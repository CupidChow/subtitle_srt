00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:47,710
Over there.

190
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:56,000
Why is the inn floating on the water?

191
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:57,110
Isn't that perfect?

192
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,320
Drinking fish soup
should be done on the water.

193
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,880
There's a poem that says,

194
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,080
"Vast oceans of water,

195
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,710
the sunlight is endlessly good;

196
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,230
The sea is full of fish,

197
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,640
the fish are truly delicious."

198
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,030
What kind of poem is that?

199
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,710
I think the person who wrote this poem

200
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,320
must be named Zhu Chengbi.

201
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,440
You always say you're well-read.

202
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,640
Recite a poem for me.

203
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,960
The hazy mist reveals
the faint shape of a raised bridge,

204
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,150
I enquire the fishermen standing west
at the crag of an edge.

205
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,470
As the peach blossoms drift daily
with the running water,

206
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,840
where can I find the source
of the creek, I wonder?

207
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,200
In autumn, by the sea,
fishing boats and rustic mist.

208
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,000
Such wonderful scenery and poem!

209
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,230
I am Chang Qing.

210
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,080
This is Miss Zhu.

211
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:43,790
May I know your names?

212
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,880
I am Liu Zhongxian,

213
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,520
and this is my wife,

214
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,520
Jiuniang.

215
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,080
You're the famous scholar,

216
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,350
Mr. Liu Zhongxian?

217
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:54,710
I've long admired your reputation.

218
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,520
Didn't expect to meet you here.

219
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:57,440
Sorry I didn't recognize you.

220
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,200
You flatter me.

221
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,000
May I ask what brings you two here?

222
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,520
Of course, the fish soup at Fuyu Inn.

223
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,280
Miss Zhu is straightforward indeed.

224
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,080
We'll be heading to Fuyu Inn soon.

225
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,470
It's my wife's first time
at Yaoguang Sea,

226
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,030
I want to take her around for a walk.

227
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,710
So I won't disturb you any further.

228
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,640
We've interrupted your leisure, Mr. Liu.

229
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,400
Farewell.

230
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,150
If fate allows,

231
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,640
we'll meet again at Fuyu Inn.

232
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,080
Be careful, honey.

233
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,520
Alright.

234
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,280
Talented man and beautiful woman.

235
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,280
What a perfect match.

236
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,350
Qing, I'm hungry.

237
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:39,910
Let's go.

238
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,200
Qing.

239
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,080
This is a nice boat. Let's board it.

240
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:58,790
Here,

241
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,550
hold the bag.

242
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,640
Come, sit tight.

243
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,400
Qing,

244
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:30,960
stop rowing.

245
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,470
Why?

246
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,640
Look at this beautiful scenery.

247
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,000
Why the rush?

248
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,150
Aren't you in a hurry for the fish soup?

249
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:40,400
But now I suddenly feel

250
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,640
there are one boat, two people.

251
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,230
If we had three more
jugs of wine right now...

252
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,110
Four songs, five verses,

253
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,030
and six pancakes,

254
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,400
it would be wonderful.

255
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,640
I could understand the poetry and songs.

256
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,030
What's with the six pancakes?

257
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:54,640
My stomach is empty.

258
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,760
I really miss pancakes.

259
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,000
Plus, we left early in the morning,

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,080
and didn't eat anything.

261
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,200
I'm really hungry.

262
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,080
What's your brush?

263
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,640
Just draw pancakes
to satisfy your hunger.

264
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:11,430
Actually, this is pretty nice.

265
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:12,950
Just the two of us

266
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,590
floating on this lake.

267
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,710
With no road ahead

268
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,040
and no burdens behind.

269
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,310
This is quite nice.

270
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,190
What are you looking at?

271
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,760
Nothing.

272
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,280
I must have overthought it.

273
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,110
The lake water here
is so clear and green.

274
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,680
It doesn't seem like
there are any demons.

275
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,470
What's wrong?

276
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:54,950
Don't make a sound.

277
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,640
Don't turn around.

278
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,520
What's going on?

279
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,830
I'll count to three.

280
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,560
Let's jump together.

281
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,510
Jump into the lake?

282
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,800
If you want to live,

283
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,470
just listen to me.

284
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:09,960
Give me your hand.

285
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,960
One, two, three.

286
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,200
You tricked me.

287
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,150
Why are you so foolish?

288
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,600
I tell you to jump and you do?

289
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,920
I'll believe whatever you say.

290
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,720
What's going on?

291
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,270
Water's coming in.

292
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:46,960
Qing,

293
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:48,150
grab the bag.

294
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,560
Let's go.

295
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:01,680
[Fuyu Inn]

296
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:04,600
Here we are.

297
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,840
[Fuyu Inn]

298
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,840
What a good day today must be.

299
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,200
So many esteemed guests have come.

300
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,080
May I ask

301
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:19,200
are you the innkeeper, Ms. Ji?

302
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,440
That's right.

303
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,840
You look unfamiliar.

304
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,080
Is it your first time here?

305
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:26,750
Ms. Ji,

306
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:28,840
my friend just fell into the lake.

307
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,680
Do you happen to have some clean clothes

308
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,390
she could change into?

309
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,200
Ms. Ji,

310
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,960
the boat you keep by the lake

311
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,270
should be checked.

312
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,150
It started leaking
in the middle of the lake.

313
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,390
We almost ended up feeding the fish.

314
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,110
I'm really sorry about that.

315
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:45,230
I really should do regular maintenance.

316
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,320
If you don't mind,

317
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,840
please come with me to change clothes.

318
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:49,510
Thank you.

319
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:50,630
Please.

320
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:09,920
Come.

321
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:12,840
Ms. Ji,

322
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,440
so you like having one outfit

323
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
in two different colors.

324
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,350
What you're wearing is so bright,

325
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,470
while mine is so plain.

326
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,440
In my opinion,

327
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,150
this plain one

328
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:25,440
belongs to Ms. Ji's sister.

329
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,560
Mr. Yang.

330
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,470
Finish your noodles quickly.

331
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:33,990
Or it'll get soggy

332
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,750
and won't taste good anymore.

333
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,110
I didn't expect that on Yaoguang Sea,

334
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:41,390
there would actually be

335
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,800
a beautiful woman
who can compete with Ms. Ji.

336
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,630
Have some water to warm yourself up.

337
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,630
Besides, Ms. Ji, you're still

338
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,990
keeping your sister's clothes.

339
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:51,960
It shows how deeply you miss her.

340
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,920
Why you won't let me

341
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,200
mention her now?

342
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,720
Eight years ago,

343
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:05,510
Ms. Ji's twin sister, Ji Hairong,

344
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,800
was about to get married.

345
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,600
But somehow,

346
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:12,230
she drowned in Yaoguang Sea.

347
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:13,990
Their father was so overcome with grief

348
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,920
that he passed away soon after,

349
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,560
leaving this large Fuyu Inn

350
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,990
to a fragile woman.

351
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,040
Ms. Ji,

352
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,350
are my calculations accurate?

353
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,630
Taoist,

354
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:26,960
you're truly amazing.

355
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:28,390
It's very accurate.

356
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,600
At that time, Ms. Ji

357
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,040
was only 18 years old,

358
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,150
yet she displayed the courage of a man.

359
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,560
She combed her hair by herself,

360
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,510
and swore to remain unmarried for life.

361
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,990
Then she took over this inn.

362
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,470
From that point on, Fuyu Inn

363
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:46,230
was supported by her
and an old servant from Kunlun.

364
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,750
Not only did it not close,

365
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,200
its business flourished even more.

366
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:51,990
Based on this alone,

367
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,630
this young innkeeper in front of me

368
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,750
is not to be underestimated.

369
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,040
Taoist,

370
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,600
are you referring to this?

371
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,320
I didn't expect that Mr. Yang

372
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,320
is also skilled in this.

373
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,920
Why does Mr. Yang know

374
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,110
the matters calculated by the Taoist

375
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,470
so clearly as well?

376
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,270
There's no need to calculate.

377
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:18,320
You just need to ask
the traveling merchants

378
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,350
passing by Cangwu Mountain.

379
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,390
Anyone can tell you this story.

380
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,270
Fuyu Inn and Ms. Ji

381
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,750
have long been their favorite topic

382
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,440
over tea and meals.

383
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:31,680
Taoist.

384
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,630
Could it be that

385
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,510
you also heard this from the merchants?

386
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,320
The secrets must not be divulged.

387
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,720
I was just joking with you.

388
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,630
Being able
to calculate the past is no skill.

389
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,350
My skill lies in Feng Shui analysis.

390
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,230
When we passed
through Cangwu Mountain,

391
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:55,440
we saw an official notice,

392
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,150
saying people have
gone missing in Yaoguang Sea.

393
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,390
It's all due to the demon fish.

394
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,840
In your view,

395
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,510
could it be a Feng Shui problem?

396
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,630
You've heard as well?

397
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,150
This time, we invited the Taoist

398
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,990
to help us examine

399
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,350
the Feng Shui of Fuyu Inn.

400
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,110
But he said

401
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,440
the Feng Shui here

402
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,560
couldn't be better.

403
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,320
No matter how good
the Feng Shui is here,

404
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,320
it can't resist the havoc
caused by demon fish.

405
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,680
There's a human-eating
demon fish in Yaoguang Sea.

406
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,440
Perhaps right now,

407
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,510
the demon fish is near Fuyu Inn.

408
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,150
What should we do, Taoist?

409
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,840
Catch the demon fish for us.

410
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,920
If you catch it,

411
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,440
there will naturally be a reward.

412
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,150
If you can't catch it,

413
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,080
you must help me spread the word.

414
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,680
Otherwise, my inn's business

415
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,560
won't go on.

416
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,720
Ms. Ji,

417
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,040
although the wandering sorcerer
has divine abilities,

418
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:47,920
the crisis in Yaoguang Sea

419
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,800
ultimately requires
the government to resolve.

420
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:52,390
The government exists specifically

421
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,960
to solve problems for the people.

422
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
You still have to trust us.

423
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,840
Mr. Yang,

424
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,440
you must be joking.

425
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,920
I merely hope

426
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,040
we don't have to seal off the sea

427
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,750
yet still solve the demon fish issue.

428
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,230
I only wish for the business of my inn

429
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,800
to gradually prosper.

430
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,320
We came here for the rainbow trout soup,

431
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,680
yet all we hear is you talking

432
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,230
about Feng Shui and sealing the sea.

433
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,040
It really spoils the mood.

434
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,150
Ms. Ji,

435
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,470
do you have rainbow trout soup today?

436
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,350
We came here

437
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,750
specifically for this dish.

438
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,560
Young man,

439
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,350
you're truly unlucky.

440
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,200
The fish stock in the kitchen
has long run out.

441
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,870
You've heard the rumor too

442
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
and seen the government notice.

443
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,960
The rainbow trout
is becoming harder to catch.

444
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,840
Even our few

445
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,200
incompetent fishermen

446
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,110
were scared away by the demon fish.

447
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,720
In that case,

448
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,870
the rumor is true.

449
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:49,110
Who cares if it's true or not?

450
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,990
Even if business is bad,

451
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:52,470
but it's not completely deserted.

452
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,920
People who come are still customers.

453
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,750
I'll figure something out

454
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,080
to serve you a bowl of fish soup.

455
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,270
However,

456
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,470
you'll have to wait a few days.

457
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,150
We've seen Yaoguang Sea,

458
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,630
but as for the rainbow trout soup,

459
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,960
we don't know
when we'll get to taste it.

460
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,390
I'm willing to wait.

461
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,150
For such delicacy,

462
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,600
even waiting a few days

463
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
or even years is worth it.

464
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,320
Alright, as you wish.

465
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,920
With the Taoist here,

466
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,440
let's find out what

467
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,510
that demon fish looks like.

468
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,600
Hello, sir.

469
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,470
Are you here to stay at the inn?

470
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,350
Yes.

471
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,040
I just came out of the mountain.

472
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:26,840
It's late.

473
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:28,960
Do you still have rooms?

474
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,200
Of course.

475
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:40,150
Are you a woodcutter from the mountain?

476
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,080
The Yaoguang Sea area
isn't very safe these days.

477
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,270
If you need to go into the mountain,

478
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,560
you should go with others.

479
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,230
And don't come back

480
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,470
so late like today.

481
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:49,630
Mr. Yang,

482
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,350
you're truly diligent
and love the people,

483
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,110
not only visiting Fuyu Inn alone,

484
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,630
but also caring for the people.

485
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,630
Don't overwork yourself.

486
00:26:58,630 --> 00:26:59,840
Take care of your health.

487
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,110
There's no other way.

488
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,470
Too many people
have gone missing lately.

489
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,800
I am deeply worried.

490
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,510
At the end of the year,

491
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:08,470
the local official evaluations

492
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:09,270
are approaching.

493
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,270
The people of Yaoguang Sea

494
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,800
must not face more problems.

495
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:14,960
Mr. Yang,

496
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,040
why bring this up again?

497
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,200
Let me prepare a room
for the guest first.

498
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,510
You can warm yourself
by the fire over there.

499
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,080
Alright.

500
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,350
Five more to go.

501
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:39,990
It's not ripe yet.

502
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,630
What fragrant mushrooms!

503
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:56,560
These mushrooms from Cangwu Mountain

504
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,270
are split open by the night cold

505
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,840
and heal again in the next day's sunlight.

506
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,390
Repeating this process

507
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,870
for 49 days and nights,

508
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,230
only one such mushroom

509
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,800
can be found out of ten.

510
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,800
The quality is good,

511
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,510
but it's not what I want.

512
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:16,960
Greetings, Miss Zhu.

513
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,680
You recognize me?

514
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:22,390
In this world,

515
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,720
there's only one Tianxiang Restaurant.

516
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,720
I often go to Wuxia City for business.

517
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,440
Who in the city doesn't know

518
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,040
Miss Zhu Chengbi
of Tianxiang Restaurant?

519
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,200
Miss Zhu is a rare culinary master

520
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,320
in this world.

521
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,350
Last month I was invited by a friend

522
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,510
to have the privilege

523
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,870
of tasting Hibiscus Flame.

524
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,350
It was so delicious.

525
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,510
The taste still lingers.

526
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,990
Then this must be

527
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,510
Mr. Chang Qing.

528
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,800
Why don't I recall you dining there?

529
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,560
You look unfamiliar.

530
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,270
I'm merely a traveling merchant.

531
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,150
How could you remember me?

532
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,870
But a traveling merchant

533
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,990
with a blade is rare.

534
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,440
No wonder Mr. Yang

535
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,870
mistook you for a woodcutter.

536
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:21,040
That's for self-defense.

537
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,040
You both must know

538
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,630
that Cangwu Mountain
has been unstable lately.

539
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Even a tiny mushroom like this

540
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,350
can fetch a good price in Wuxia City.

541
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,750
May I ask why you two

542
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:38,230
have come here?

543
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:41,870
For the rainbow trout soup, of course.

544
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,510
For the fish soup?

545
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,840
A renowned chef

546
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:53,440
can't even

547
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
make a rainbow trout soup?

548
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,750
That's incorrect.

549
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:57,990
The rainbow trout

550
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:59,750
is unique to Yaoguang Sea.

551
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,920
Once it leaves this lake,

552
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,040
the fish dies within two hours.

553
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,150
Only by coming to this Fuyu Inn

554
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,800
can you taste the freshest
rainbow trout soup.

555
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:08,990
Moreover,

556
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:12,040
the soup is personally
prepared by Ms. Ji.

557
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:13,960
The taste is naturally unique.

558
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,800
After all, Ms. Ji

559
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,040
is no ordinary person.

560
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,870
That's right, absolutely!

561
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,230
Ms. Ji is not only stunningly beautiful,

562
00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:25,040
but the events surrounding her

563
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,040
are truly extraordinary.

564
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,470
What's so extraordinary?

565
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,510
Eight years ago,

566
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,040
her twin sister Ji Hairong...

567
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,800
Enough.

568
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,270
Don't gossip about something

569
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,470
that's been going on for like 800 years.

570
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:36,320
Aren't you tired of nagging?

571
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:36,990
You...

572
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,470
Taoist,

573
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,470
please don't be angry.

574
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,800
Miss Zhu is straightforward

575
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,630
and speaks her mind freely.

576
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,840
It's fate that let us meet at this inn.

577
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,630
No need to take it too seriously.

578
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:51,040
For Mr. Yang's sake,

579
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,150
I'll let this little girl off today.

580
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:56,390
Thank you for honoring me.

581
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,470
I'm entrusted by Ms. Ji

582
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,040
to solve the inn's Feng Shui issues.

583
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,040
Naturally, I need to understand more.

584
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,510
How dare you

585
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:11,470
to call me a little girl.

586
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,040
You...

587
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,270
Miss Zhu.

588
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,990
May I ask

589
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,350
how should I address you?

590
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,230
I'm Tan Yilu.

591
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,270
Yilu means a row of egrets
ascend to the blue sky.

592
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,320
Mr. Tan Yilu,

593
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,320
you claim to be a traveling merchant.

594
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,800
Then why haven't you heard

595
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,990
the story of Ms. Ji Hairu?

596
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,440
What's wrong with you guys?

597
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,840
You're just chatting randomly,

598
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,390
why do you keep dragging me in?

599
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
Mr. Chang Qing,

600
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,750
it seems you don't trust me at all.

601
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,320
May I ask

602
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,920
who would call themselves
a traveling merchant,

603
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,270
and come to Fuyu Inn

604
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,990
in such weather?

605
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,390
It's precisely because of such weather

606
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,630
and such a place

607
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:06,990
that you arouse suspicion.

608
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,350
So in this case,

609
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,960
it doesn't seem like

610
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,270
a simple inn,

611
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,750
but rather a gathering place

612
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,040
for those with ulterior motives.

613
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:22,390
In this case,

614
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,390
Mr. Chang Qing and Miss Zhu,

615
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,480
what brings you here?

616
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,790
Just for a bowl of fish soup.

617
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,510
Exactly.

618
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,080
The rain is getting heavier.

619
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,310
At this moment,

620
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,080
how delightful it would be

621
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,190
if there was a bowl of hot fish soup.

622
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:02,720
Tired?

623
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,000
No.

624
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,270
It's Mr. Liu.

625
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,510
They really came after all.

626
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,790
It must be fate.

627
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,080
Mr. Liu.

628
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,550
Hairu,

629
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:16,720
long time no see.

630
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,840
Long time no see.

631
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,720
This must be Ms. Liu.

632
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,720
I didn't expect Ms. Liu to be here.

633
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,030
It's quite cold inside.

634
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,390
Go warm up by the fire.

635
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,960
Sorry, I almost forgot.

636
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,030
Mr. Yang,

637
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,670
let me introduce.

638
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,600
This is Liu Zhongxian,

639
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,840
and this is his wife.

640
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:46,120
Thank you, Ms. Ji.

641
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:49,360
I've long heard of Mr. Liu's brilliance.

642
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,600
Finally, I get to meet him.

643
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,120
And Ms. Liu

644
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,360
is also stunningly beautiful.

645
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,600
You two together

646
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,510
truly make a perfect match.

647
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
You flatter us, Mr. Yang.

648
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:00,640
Many years ago,

649
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:02,880
I once stayed briefly at Yaoguang Sea.

650
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,390
This time, revisiting this old place,

651
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:05,910
I found it much more prosperous.

652
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,880
This must be
thanks to Mr. Yang's contributions.

653
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:09,640
Not at all.

654
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,400
May I ask what brings you here today?

655
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,600
I have come without a single soldier,

656
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,200
just as an ordinary diner

657
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,920
to savor the soup here.

658
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,360
And incidentally, to inspect

659
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,400
the recent

660
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,710
disappearances at Yaoguang Sea.

661
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:26,470
Everyone, please do not worry.

662
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,440
Please, don't worry.

663
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,360
I see.

664
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:31,790
I host a poetry gathering annually,

665
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,080
inviting literati
to enjoy tea and compose poetry.

666
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,640
Coming to Yaoguang Sea this time,

667
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:36,790
I found such beautiful scenery

668
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,030
and couldn't help but be inspired.

669
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:40,710
How about we host the poetry gathering

670
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,680
right here at Ms. Ji's place?

671
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,550
Really?

672
00:34:44,790 --> 00:34:46,120
Hosting the poetry gathering here?

673
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,680
That's wonderful.

674
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,880
I'll inform Uncle Li right away

675
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,640
to make preparations.

676
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,310
It's a perfect time
during this crisp autumn

677
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,880
to gather friends
and drink to our hearts' content.

678
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,230
I wonder if everyone present

679
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,750
has time to join me

680
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,440
for drinks and poetry,

681
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,030
and writing compositions.

682
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,270
It's a rare opportunity

683
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:09,470
to consult with Mr. Liu in person.

684
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,710
I will definitely attend.

685
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,840
You flatter me.

686
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,230
Honey,

687
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,230
let's go warm ourselves by the fire.

688
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:17,990
Alright.

689
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,160
Mr. Liu.

690
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,120
I didn't expect to meet you here.

691
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,230
It must be fate.

692
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,470
Meeting Mr. Chang and Miss Zhu

693
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,920
is my honor.

694
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,710
Please, have a seat.

695
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:37,990
Come, sit.

696
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,440
I've long admired your literary talent.

697
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,230
Earlier, I visited the red maple forest.

698
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,550
Looking at all the red leaves,

699
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,920
I couldn't help but think of your work.

700
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,230
"Gazing from high altitudes,

701
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,680
maple leaves and reed flowers,
autumn feels desolate.

702
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Thinking of past joys,

703
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,550
I feels like the world is but a dream."

704
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,200
Surely, Mr. Liu

705
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,080
was recalling past joys at the time

706
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,230
and got inspired by the scenery, right?

707
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,120
Mr. Chang, you're too kind.

708
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:06,400
At that time,

709
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,680
I just composed a few lines casually.

710
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,200
Looking at it now,

711
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,270
this scene stirs distant thoughts,

712
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,470
and the fallen petals
only deepen the sorrow.

713
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:17,120
Better to cherish the ones before us.

714
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,920
That would be more fitting.

715
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:22,440
I misspoke.

716
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:23,640
It doesn't matter.

717
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,960
[Fuyu Inn]

718
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,920
It must be that demon fish causing harm.

719
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:53,880
A demon.

720
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,710
There's a demon in the water.

721
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,510
My wife is timid by nature
and frail in health.

722
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,640
Please forgive us.

723
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Hairu,

724
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,270
are there any rooms available?

725
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:03,750
Yes, yes.

726
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,790
Please, help yourself, sir.

727
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,310
Mr. Liu is truly devoted to his wife.

728
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,790
Not necessarily.

729
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,550
Ms. Ji,

730
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,310
set up an incense table for me.

731
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:37,510
I will immediately deal with this demon.

732
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:10,950
Exorcise.

733
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:50,080
Perhaps this bait isn't effective.

734
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,160
We need to find another kind of bait

735
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,990
to lure that demon fish out.

736
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:56,640
Earlier, I saw a glow in the sea.

737
00:38:56,990 --> 00:39:00,030
It must be the seaweed
that rainbow trout love most.

738
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,550
Now that it's late autumn,

739
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
the seaweed
has passed its growing season.

740
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,600
Who would have thought
the demon fish had become a spirit

741
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,230
and thus came ashore,

742
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,880
seeking more enticing prey?

743
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,750
So, the more enticing bait

744
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,270
that you're referring to

745
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,470
is humans?

746
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,200
Correct.

747
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,640
That demon fish enhances its cultivation

748
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,510
by absorbing human essence.

749
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,600
Taoist,

750
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,270
what kind of bait do we need

751
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,440
to lure the demon fish?

752
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,990
The demon fish has
always loved delicious things,

753
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,680
that's why it preys on humans.

754
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:42,920
We need to find an extremely

755
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,790
delicious ingredient

756
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,790
to lure the demon fish.

757
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,310
Surely we won't use humans as bait.

758
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,080
The traveling merchant's mushrooms

759
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,200
are extremely fresh.

760
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,990
Using them as bait

761
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:00,710
is also an option.

762
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:02,160
Don't even think about it.

763
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,120
I won't feed those mushrooms

764
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,230
to the demon fish.

765
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,310
Mr. Tan,

766
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,230
how much are your mushrooms?

767
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:12,200
I want to buy one to use as bait.

768
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,550
Mr. Chang,

769
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,230
I plan to sell these mushrooms elsewhere

770
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,680
for a high price.

771
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,360
Moreover,
I picked them with great effort.

772
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:20,510
Feeding them to the demon fish

773
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,920
would be such a waste.

774
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,160
However,

775
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,790
if you're willing to offer something

776
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,160
of equivalent value

777
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,160
to trade with me,

778
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,750
it's not impossible.

779
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,550
I happen to know you have something

780
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:39,880
of extraordinary value,

781
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,310
your marvelous brush.

782
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,230
If you're willing to give me that,

783
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:50,680
then my mushrooms

784
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,550
would be traded fairly.

785
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
This brush is very meaningful to me.

786
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,470
I find it hard to part with it.

787
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:01,750
However, if you're

788
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,160
willing to give me the mushrooms,

789
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,920
I will grant you three requests.

790
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,550
Should you need anything in the future,

791
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,080
I will do my utmost to help.

792
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,310
I'm a businessman.

793
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,680
I only trust money, not promises.

794
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,920
If you don't wish to trade,

795
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:15,640
then forget it.

796
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:39,750
Fine.

797
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,990
I probably won't have the chance
to use this brush again.

798
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,120
If in my limited time,

799
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,750
I can make Miss Zhu happy

800
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,680
and enjoy the delicacy she wants,

801
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,920
then it's worth it.

802
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:10,920
Here.

803
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:16,990
Taoist,

804
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:18,680
look at this mushroom.

805
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,470
It's a rare delicacy
from Cangwu Mountain.

806
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:21,440
I wonder if it'll work.

807
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,200
It can barely work.

808
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:24,790
But

809
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:27,030
it needs to be placed
in a fishing net in the water

810
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,030
to be effective.

811
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,360
Then I will go underwater with you.

812
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,200
No, no.

813
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:32,710
It's too dangerous underwater.

814
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,310
The demon fish appears unpredictably.

815
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,840
Sir,

816
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,790
you have no experience
in catching demons.

817
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,950
It's safer to stay on shore.

818
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,880
But Miss Zhu wants to drink the soup.

819
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,680
I must help her catch the rainbow trout.

820
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,550
Qing,

821
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,440
the Taoist has profound skills.

822
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,310
You don't know martial arts.

823
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,990
Just let him handle it alone.

824
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,080
Sir, rest assured.

825
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,200
I will definitely

826
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,360
catch the demon fish for you.

827
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:23,950
Just watch.

828
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,640
He will first plant stakes underwater

829
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:28,310
then catch any fish

830
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,200
and claim it's the demon fish.

831
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:31,360
Then what about my brush?

832
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,470
This is the demon fish.

833
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,270
At night, it transforms into human form
and absorbs human energy.

834
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,710
Recently around Yaoguang Sea,

835
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,550
villagers often go missing mysteriously.

836
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,470
This demon fish is responsible.

837
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:17,160
No, this...

838
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,950
This demon fish is so small.

839
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,550
It's indeed
much smaller than I imagined.

840
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,750
This demon fish can change its size.

841
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,920
Luckily, before it fully transformed,

842
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,200
I could eliminate it.

843
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,640
Otherwise, it would cause greater harm.

844
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,840
It seems you didn't expect

845
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,270
this trickster to come prepared.

846
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,310
She's well-informed and experienced.

847
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,750
She must have a way to deal with this.
