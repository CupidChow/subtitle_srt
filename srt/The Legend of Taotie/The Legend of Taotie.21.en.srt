Qing,

24
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,880
get me the "so-called" Hibiscus Flame.

25
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,240
Mr. Lu,

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,750
this isn't for free.

27
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,720
You have to pay.

28
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,670
Or our accountant

29
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:16,830
can hardly do his job.

30
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,440
How do you feel?

31
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,670
This bite is worth 50 liang, isn't it?

32
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,110
Why did you do this?

33
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,790
I'd like to help.

34
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,350
Who?

35
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,920
Who's talking?

36
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,550
Miss Qu!

37
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,670
Is that you?

38
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,670
Someone told me
humans and demons couldn't be together

39
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:22,880
and they would be far away.

40
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,760
I'd like to see

41
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,160
whether he'll fall to his death

42
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,070
or have wings instead.

48
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,920
I didn't know

49
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,390
I could see you before that.

50
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,160
I finally know

51
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,270
why those victims smiled when they died.

52
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,720
Because they saw someone

53
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,110
they hoped to see.

54
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,600

I'll never have another chance.

57

58
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,830
If you leave now,

59
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,350
you can live.

60
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,230
No, no!

61
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,470
I want to be with you

62
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
forever and ever.

63
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,960

Yan.

67
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,470
Yan?

68
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:57,910
Mr. Lu,

69
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,000
you sound really intimate.

70
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,590
I guess you've seen a pretty girl

71
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,230
in your dream.

72
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,790
But in my restaurant,

73
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:06,230
there isn't a Miss Yan.

74
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,440
I saw her just now.

75
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,030
She shed a tear.

76
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:21,880
Mr. Lu,

77
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,400
didn't you say

78
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,520
those who ate the Hibiscus Flame

79
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,760
would self-ignite and die?

80
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,840
But now,

81
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,320
you're still alive.

82
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,230
I'll keep investigating.

83
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,030
If the dish didn't kill them,

84
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,520
I'll vindicate you.

85
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,550
The miracle of the dish is...

86
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:44,200
When you eat it,

87
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,030
you'll think of what you want to do

88
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,400
and see the person you yearn to see.

89
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,840
That's why so many people

90
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,400
are crazy about this dish.

91
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:58,520
You must have felt it, huh?

92
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,840
This dish

93
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,550
is really extraordinary.

94
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,710
No wonder many people in Wuxia

95
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,320
are obsessed with it.

96
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,670
So, Mr. Lu,

97
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,670
what did you see just now?

98
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,520
I can't tell you.

99
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,910
I'll take my leave.

100
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:25,230
Remember to take Miss Yan back

101
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,710
and ransom your bow.

102
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:31,880
Bye.

103
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:33,280
Bye.

104
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,790
Mr. Lu, why do you stare me at like this?

105
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,150
I passed by the zither shop

106
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,880
and remembered you said

107
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,240
your strings were loose.

108
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,150
I asked the shopkeeper to pick some.

109
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,360
Take a look.

110
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,590
Are they available?

111
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,800
Thank you.

112
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,190
The rouge

113
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,630
on your lips

114
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,040
looks so good.

115
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,320
You flatter me, Mr. Lu.

116
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,750
Qu...

117
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,440
Yan.

118
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,750
These days,

119
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:49,590
I've never seen you smile.

120
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,270
I don't smile

121
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,040
or cry.

122
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:57,510
Why?

123
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Something happened to me years ago.

124
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,000
Since then, I've been disillusioned.

125
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,240
So, I don't smile

126
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,950
or cry.

127
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,950
No wonder I can sense sorrow

128
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,800
from your music.

129
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,190
You never told me about this.

130
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,920
Will you tell me

131
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,750
what makes you disillusioned?

132
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,560
It's been too long.

133
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,950
I can't remember.

134
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,320
And it's meaningless

135
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,440
to bring up the old story.

136
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,320
Fine.

137
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,750
Since you forget it,

138
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,270
I won't ask anymore.

139
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,390
I'm here to tell you something.

140
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,560
When I investigated
the self-ignition case,

141
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,510
I heard the new dish
in Tianxiang Restaurant

142
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,070
could make people see

143
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,190
who they hoped to see.

144
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,120
You know what?

145
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,360
After I ate it,

146
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,880
I saw you

147
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,240
in my illusion.

148
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,440
Yan,

149
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
I'm in my thirties.

150
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,390
It's the first time

151
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,710
I've cared so much for a lady.

152
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,190
So, I left Tianxiang Restaurant

153
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,920
and came right to you.

154
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:33,710
Yan, I...

155
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,150
Mr. Lu,

156
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:36,750
say no more.

157
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,590
Am I so rash

158
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,440
that you're scared?

159
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,270
Mr. Lu, you're an honorable archer.

160
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,800
I'm a humble musician.

161
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,150
We don't belong in the same world.

162
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,710
How can we be together?

163
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,000
You and I have

164
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,190
different jobs.

165
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,390
So what?

166
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,150
I don't care about this.

167
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,950
If you want to be with me,

168
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,880
I won't mind.

169
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,480
You will.

170
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,360
When you know everything,

171
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,680
you'll regret it.

172
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,360
I don't mind.

173
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,630
I really don't, Yan.

174
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,510
I thought about it on my way here.

175
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,560
I know what I want.

176
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,480
I don't know what happened to you.

177
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,120
But what's gone is gone.

178
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:32,510
I don't know what you suffered.

179
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,800
But I want to tell you.

180
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,320
From this day on,

181
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,510
you won't suffer anymore.

182
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:40,880
I will protect you.

183
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:45,360
As long as we have a future.

184
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,190
What do you say?

185
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:46,950
No.

186
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,710
We don't have a future.

187
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,480
We don't.

188
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:57,390
Why?

189
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,710
I told you.

190
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,110
I don't smile or cry.

191
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,630
I'm dead inside.

192
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,750
I can no longer love anyone.

193
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,750
Mr. Lu,

194
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,150
please leave.

195
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,630
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,040
Sorry to let you down.

197
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:04,750
What...

198
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:21,960
Mr. Lu.

199
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,390
Mr. Lu.

200
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:28,630
Mr. Lu.

201
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,470
I ate the Hibiscus Flame
in Tianxiang Restaurant.

202
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,320
I really felt I was burning.

203
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:45,390
But now,

204
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:46,560
nothing is wrong with me.

205
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,320
And people in that restaurant

206
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,750
have no motive for the killings.

207
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,390
Mr. Shu,

208
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,750
I asked you to investigate
the rosefinch's feather.

209
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:58,840
What have you got?

210
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,350
I took my men to Market Dong

211
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,560
and interrogated the stall keepers.

212
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,750
So far,

213
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,080
we haven't found

214
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,390
any clue about the feather.

215
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:10,750
Yundun,

216
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,390
what have you got about Ge Liang?

217
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,150
Mr. Lu,

218
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,080
I found some important clues.

219
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,470
Ge Liang is a merchant.

220
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,870
His family is clear.

221
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,960
But Li Jiuzeng has many enemies.

222
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,870
Ge Liang doesn't seem

223
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,470
to be a Wuxia native, either.

224
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,990
When he was little,

225
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,200
he moved in here.

226
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,270
I went to his hometown
and asked his villagers.

227
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,990
But they said

228
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,630
Ge Liang wasn't

229
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,150
from their village.

230
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,320
He seems as mysterious

231
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,390
as Li Jiuzeng.

232
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,960
What?

233
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,840
What a coincidence.

234
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:50,870
This way.

235
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,840
I deliberately picked this room.

236
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,230
It has the best view.

237
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,720
It's quiet and elegant.

238
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,110
Thank you, Miss Qu.

239
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,630
With you and the good wine in,

240
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,080
I'm all right with any room.

241
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:04,870
Please.

242
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,870
It's the wine I made.

243
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,040
I've kept it for years.

244
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,800
It's not sold on the market.

245
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,920
Sadly, no one drinks it with me.

246
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,960
Miss Zhu, a toast to you.

247
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:36,040
Thank you for helping me.

248
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,870
It's not a problem.

249
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,600
You know I didn't help you for nothing.

250
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,270
Don't forget our promise.

251
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:41,800
Rest assured.

252
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,840
I'll make my appointment.

253
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,750
Did Lu Ying come to you?

254
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,510
He came and confessed his love.

255
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,080
Did you accept him?

256
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,680
Why did you do that?

257
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,150
If I hadn't done that,

258
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,150
how would you know

259
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,560
your real feelings?

260
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,040
Stop match-making us.

261
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,350
Why?

262
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,720
Since you saved his life,

263
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,470
you must have feelings for him.

264
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,440
Why don't you try being with him?

265
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,200
I used to think

266
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,680
I only loved my late husband.

267
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,600
I didn't know I could love someone else.

268
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,080
I felt sorry for him.

269
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,840
That was long ago.

270
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:39,680
A dozen years have gone by.

271
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:40,800
I don't think your husband

272
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,990
would want you

273
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:42,920
to stay all alone

274
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,320
or live a lonely life.

275
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:46,470
He would want you to have a new life,

276
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:46,960
right?

277
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,150
You have a point.

278
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,680
But I'm not brave enough

279
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,560
to take that step.

280
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,750
Mr. Lu loves me now.

281
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,960
But it's because
he doesn't know the truth.

282
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,440
He hates demons.

283
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,040
When he knows, he'll regret it.

284
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,270
But if he knows what you suffered...

285
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,390
Think about it.

286
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,800
Will he still hate demons?

287
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,990
I don't know. Nor do I dare to think.

288
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,470
Human nature is unpredictable.

289
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,990
Even if he can accept my identity,

290
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,230
we have different lifespans.

291
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,350
How can we stay together?

292
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,510
You have different lifespans.

293
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,840
How can you stay together?

294
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,800
Are you thinking of someone?

295
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,920
I think you have a point.

296
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,720
I've never thought about it.

297
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,870
I imagined it a million times.

298
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,750
If only he hadn't died

299
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,080
in the battle 500 years ago!

300
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,440
If only he had stayed with me!

301
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,720
But he was a human.

302
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,350
He would grow old and die.

303
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,990
I would still be left alone

304
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:16,110
in this world,

305
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,510
looking back.

306
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:25,750
So, Miss Zhu,

307
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,720
you also have a sad memory.

308
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,350
Don't mention it.

309
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,560
We should drink happily.

310
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,110
Let's not think of anything so sad.

311
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,390
The wine

312
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,840
tastes spicy and rich.

313
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,990
Miss Qu, you make perfect wine.

314
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:49,230
Today, let's get drunk.

315
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:50,960
All right.

316
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,440
Let's get drunk.

317
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,110
I'll drink as much as you want.

318
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,510
If you're drunk,

319
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:05,270
stay here for some rest.

320
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,750
I can hold my liquor.

321
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,200
I won't be drunk.

322
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,200
Cheers.

323
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:19,200
Welcome, Your Highness.

324
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,680
Where's Miss Zhu
from Tianxiang Restaurant?

325
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:23,150
In the room upstairs.

326
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,230
Your Highness,

327
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,390
there you go.

328
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:45,150
Your Highness.

329
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,560
You may rise.

330
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,800
Heng, what are you doing here?

331
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,510
I went to Tianxiang Restaurant for you

332
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,110
but failed.

333
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,720
They told me you were here.

334
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,350
You're in a good mood, Miss Zhu.

335
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,600
Shall I drink with you?

336
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,470
All right.

337
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,990
You're a chill guy,

338
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,110
unlike Qing.

339
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:03,800
He's always hesitant.

340
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:04,600
He doesn't even drink.

341
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,600
You enjoy the wine.

342
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,200
I'll play some music for you.

343
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:09,470
Sit, please.

344
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:10,440
Sit.

345
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,080
Cheers.

346
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,080
It's so late.

347
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,040
Why isn't Miss Zhu back yet?

348
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,320
There you are.

349
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,510
At last.

350
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:12,600
Miss Zhu,

351
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,110
you say I'm stuck in past sufferings.

352
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,920
So are you.

353
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,040
Since you have feelings for him,

354
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,800
why don't you have him?

355
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,270
Your Highness,

356
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,680
I have things to do.

357
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:29,470
Please take care of Miss Zhu.

358
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:55,510
Mr. Chang.

359
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:58,470
Cuiyan.

360
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,990
The moon is so round.

361
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,350
You're just in time.

362
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,510
Go to Pingyue House.

363
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,720
See what Miss Zhu is doing.

364
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:05,440
Mr. Chang,

365
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,470
why won't you go?

366
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,680
I think His Highness

367
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,680
went there for Miss Zhu.

368
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:11,920
It's so late.

369
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:12,920
Don't you worry?

370
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,270
Come on.

371
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,230
Go check on her.

372
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,920
Miss Zhu, you're drunk.

373
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:34,870
Miss Zhu.

374
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:36,600
Come on.

375
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,040
I'll take you home.

376
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,680
- No.
- Come on.

377
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:45,390
Don't leave.

378
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,600
You promised me

379
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,750
to travel around with me.

380
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,390
But you left me all alone,

381
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,510
keeping this promise

382
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,230
for so many years.

383
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,040
All right.

384
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,750
I give you my word.

385
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,680
I won't leave.

386
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:07,510
I'll always stay by your side.

387
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,390
Never leave me.

388
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,440
I won't leave you.

389
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:15,720
500 years.

390
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,110
It's been 500 years.

391
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,270
I've been waiting for 500 years.

392
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,440
Never leave me again.

393
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:29,920
500 years?

394
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,390
Who are you thinking of?

395
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,990
Come on, Miss Zhu.

396
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:40,800
It's cold here.

397
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:41,680
I'll move you up.

398
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,230
I'm not going.

399
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,750
Come on.

400
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:43,440
I'm not going.

401
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,840
I almost forget.

402
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,680
I have no right to love you.

403
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:32,630
With this body,

404
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:36,720
I won't be loved, either.

405
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,440
Miss Zhu,

406
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,840
when I look at you silently

407
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,080
just like this,

408
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,630
I'm happy enough.

409
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,840
I won't ask for more.

410
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,870
I just hope

411
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:07,350
when you know what I am,

412
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:10,630
you won't hate me

413
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:13,510
or stay away from me

414
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,510
like anyone else.

415
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,110
I just fear

416
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:27,200
you won't stay with me anymore.

417
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:31,960
500 years.

418
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,230
It's been 500 years.

419
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:46,990
You seem

420
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,960
to think of me.

421
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,320
Yet you seem not.

422
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,200
Forget it.

423
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:21,080
Even if you think of me,

424
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,110
it won't make any difference.

425
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:38,840
Hey, gentleman.

426
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,150
Where's Miss Zhu
from Tianxiang Restaurant?

427
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,600
Oh, Miss Zhu.

428
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,440
She and His Highness...

429
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,560
Who are you?

430
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,560
The emperor.

431
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:34,080
Mr. Chang,

432
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,120
what happened?

433
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,040
Now, she's wild.

434
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
She got drunk,

435
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,360
slept in Pingyue House,

436
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,360
and didn't plan to come back.

437
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,600
Go get something to sober her up.

438
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,200
Yes.

439
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:45,880
Hurry.

440
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:57,000
[Pingyue House]

441
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,360
What the heck!

442
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,790
First, the prince...

443
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,470
And then the emperor.

444
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,160
Excuse me.

445
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,400
Who are you?

446
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,360
This is the Princess of Yunlong.

447
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:15,920
Oh, Your Grace.

448
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,080
You must be here for His Highness.

449
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,790
He is upstairs.

450
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:23,510
Here. Here are the stairs.

451
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,400
There they are.

452
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,510
Be careful.

453
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:27,920
Be very careful.

454
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,470
Slow down.

455
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:48,270
Lian.

456
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,030
Oh.

457
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,710
You always keep me worried.

458
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,790
You've been cultivating
for a thousand years.

459
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,310
But you're still groggy

460
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,160
and careless.

461
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,270
I'm not being lazy lately.

462
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,470
I just want you to get used to it

463
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:18,640
when I'm not around.

464
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,790
When I'm away,

465
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,550
how will you live?

466
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,360
Now, I finally realize

467
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,230
you stay here for Monk Lotus.

468
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,200
Last time, you asked me
to take you up the mountain

469
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:52,680
for the sunrise.

470
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,710
You were so dedicated
when you watched it.

471
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,470
I had never seen you

472
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,710
behave like that.

473
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,400
But now, how do you feel

474
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,510
about His Highness?

475
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,030
One day, you said you thought it through

476
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:26,640
and would have a new guy.

477
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,080
It must be him, huh?

478
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,640
I don't have much time left.

479
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,440
I shouldn't have a fantasy.

480
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,950
Very well.

481
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,600
He loves you.

482
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,270
Your love for each other

483
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,120
could be perfect.

484
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,640
He will take care of you.

485
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,750
But since he loves you,

486
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,600
he'll have a hard time.

487
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,360
Miss Zhu,

488
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:20,990
I don't want to leave you.

489
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:47,640
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

490
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,470
Your Highness,

491
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,310
since I came to Wuxia,

492
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,600
you've seldom stayed at home.

493
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,750
Staring at you like this

494
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,600
makes me happy.

495
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:10,080
Sometimes,

496
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,710
I'm really jealous of Miss Zhu.

497
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,510
When you stay with her,

498
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,710
you remain true.

499
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,920
Miss Zhu,

500
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:27,440
you know what?

501
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,120
I'm a semi-demon.

502
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,360
The humblest

503
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,920
and lowest semi-demon.

504
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,440
My mother died at a young age.

505
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,030
My father abandoned me, too.

506
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,990
I know.

507
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,710
Everyone despises me behind my back.

508
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,310
I don't dare to tell you.

509
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,550
I fear when you know it,

510
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,270
you'll stay away from me.

511
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,950
Now, you know it.

512
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,310
Will you discard me

513
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,160
as everybody else does?

514
00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:17,310
Don't worry.

515
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,030
Whatever you are,

516
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:22,200
I'll always be with you.

517
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,200
Ge Liang and Li Jiuzeng

518
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,550
seem to be unrelated

519
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:40,400
with nothing in common.

520
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,080
But I think they're from the same place.

521
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,200
They pretended
they didn't know each other.

522
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,030
I think they were hiding something.

523
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:58,710
Mr. Lu,

524
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,880
I found a strange village.

525
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,400
There's only

526
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,750
a fire record about it 16 years ago.

527
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,920
No more information.

528
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,360
A village that disappeared.

529
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,950
It accords with their background.

530
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:13,790
What's the village's name?

531
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,080
It's...

532
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:17,920
Panyun Village.

533
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,400
Panyun Village?

534
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:45,270
Qing.

535
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:47,680
Qing.

536
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,200
Qing.

537
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,680
Instead of sleeping in your room,

538
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,710
what are you doing here?

539
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,440
You're awake.

540
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,160
Come on.

541
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,120
Be more sensible, will you?

542
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,750
Last night, I went
to Pingyue House for you.

543
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:07,920
You and His Highness

544
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,640
lay in one room

545
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,950
all alone.

546
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,640
We did?

547
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,790
I was excited last night.

548
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,120
So, I was drunk.

549
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,310
Why did you drink that much?

550
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,440
Couldn't you restrain yourself?

551
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,160
If I hadn't taken you back,

552
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,120
who would know what he could do?

553
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:28,470
Heng?

554
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,400
He wouldn't dare to do anything.

555
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,030
How do you know?

556
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,470
Even if you like him,

557
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,030
do you know what kind of man he is?

558
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,400
Who told you I liked him?

559
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:40,710
Besides,

560
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,470
I'm the owner of Tianxiang Restaurant.

561
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:45,360
Don't interfere with so much.

562
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,990
You're like a Miss Caring Boss.

563
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:49,400
Oh, no.

564
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,470
Mr. Caring Boss.

565
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:51,790
I won't interfere with your stuff.

566
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,920
You just always do silly things.

567
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:54,470
No one

568
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:55,880
can always keep you around.

569
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:57,840
If you're drunk again,

570
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,310
I won't go get you back.

571
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:01,440
Anyone else can go.

572
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,080
But last night,

573
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,840
I didn't ask you to get me back.

574
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,080
I just didn't

575
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,680
want you to be fooled by a playboy.

576
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,230
Or you'd lose a lot

577
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,470
and even this restaurant.

578
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:17,880
Then, where can I make money?

579
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,080
Make money?

580
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,710
You always think of making money.

581
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:23,120
What do you need so much money for?

582
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,120
For the dowry of your sister?

583
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:24,470
I...

584
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:27,790
Yes.

585
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,270
I promised my sister.

586
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,080
I'll keep my word.

587
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,550
Or how can I go home with money?

588
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:32,470
Chang Qing,

589
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,680
you've been slackening

590
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,310
and taking less care of me.

591
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,790
I should have docked your pay.

592
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,950
You won't go home with money.

593
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,270
Dock it. I don't care.

594
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:42,600
Your temper

595
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,950
has been worse.

596
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:45,270
Get out.

597
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:47,310
