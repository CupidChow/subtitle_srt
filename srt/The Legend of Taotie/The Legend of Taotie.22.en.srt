Do you have to meddle
in so many things now?

191
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,270
why you're asking this today.

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,150
Just making things clear.

193
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,270
Since you genuinely like her,

194
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,270
then take good care of her
in the future.

195
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,510
Miss Zhu loves food and fun.

196
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,710
Her body has old ailments
that often flare up.

197
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,710
She needs careful care.

198
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,590
If I find out you've done

199
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:48,070
anything improper to her,

200
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,270
I won't spare you.

201
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,630
So you're here to play matchmaker today.

202
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,630
No need for you to say,

203
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,040
I will naturally treat Miss Zhu sincerely

204
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,360
and will continue to pursue her.

205
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,150
But I understand your thoughts.

206
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,390
How could you willingly

207
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,630
give her up?

208
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,630
It's surely not that simple.

209
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,590
It's not complicated.

210
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm just going on a long trip.

211
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,070
In the future,

212
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:38,190
I'll entrust her to you.

213
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,480
I hope you treat her well.

214
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,270
You're leaving?

215
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:49,240
Yes.

216
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,120
I've been at Tianxiang Restaurant
for two years.

217
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,390
I know her better than you do.

218
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,750
Let me tell you,

219
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:00,680
her favorite snack

220
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,190
is the green dumplings made by Stone.

221
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,710
Her favorite drink

222
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,270
is "Rainfall" from Fenghe Restaurant.

223
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,510
She loves to sleep in.

224
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:14,440
In the morning,
she usually sleeps until the Si hour.

225
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,240
Don't disturb her before then.

226
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,710
She's capricious and gets angry easily.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,680
But her biggest weakness
is her love of food.

228
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,120
When she's angry,

229
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,480
food works best to appease her.

230
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:28,920
She's picky with food.

231
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,320
But when she's hungry,

232
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,590
a bun can suffice.

233
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,560
She seems shrewd,

234
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,830
but is absolutely clueless

235
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:38,710
about the accounts.

236
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,360
Without a competent accountant,

237
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,950
she might end up
losing Tianxiang Restaurant.

238
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,120
Also,

239
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,070
Lotus Tower needs regular cleaning.

240
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,480
Each item there

241
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:57,920
is her treasure.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,270
So be extra careful.

243
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:00,830
Don't damage anything.

244
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:05,920
That's pretty much it.

245
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,750
I don't believe you'll treat her

246
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:18,710
better than I do.

247
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,000
Then why are you saying all this today?

248
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,360
Better than saying nothing.

249
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,750
Miss Zhu,

250
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,710
it's lunchtime.

251
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,480
Are you hungry?

252
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,510
Let's go out to eat.

253
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,880
Where's Qing?

254
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
He left early this morning

255
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,830
and didn't look good.

256
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,270
I don't know what's wrong.

257
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,000
Seems strange.

258
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,270
He went out?

259
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,950
Then don't ever come back.

260
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,190
Did you two argue again?

261
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,150
I don't have time to argue with him.

262
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,830
Yingtao and I both heard it.

263
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,880
Cuiyan,

264
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,710
listen.

265
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,390
Just because I got drunk,

266
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,480
he scolded me.

267
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm the manager

268
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,040
and he's the accountant.

269
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,920
It's fine if he meddles
in everything else.

270
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,070
But shouting at me is too much.

271
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,000
Who's in charge
of Tianxiang Restaurant now?

272
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,590
Mr. Chang Qing just talks tough.

273
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,710
And he's so naggy.

274
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,560
But he still cares about you.

275
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,070
He is just worried

276
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,000
that you can't take care of yourself.

277
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,000
I think he's making things
difficult for me.

278
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,240
This Qing

279
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,880
has really changed recently.

280
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,800
He's becoming less and less
like an accountant.

281
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,920
Yes.

282
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,240
He wasn't like this before.

283
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,830
He wouldn't suddenly lose his temper.

284
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,680
We also find it strange.

285
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,270
What's stranger is,

286
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,950
he's leaving
Tianxiang Restaurant's affairs

287
00:15:58,950 --> 00:16:00,360
to us one by one,

288
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,480
telling us to manage them well.

289
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
He said he's going back home.

290
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,510
Last time before looking for medicine,

291
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,390
he had already told us that.

292
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,560
Mr. Chang Qing, you're back.

293
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,120
Mr. Chang Qing,

294
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,240
you're finally back.

295
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,680
Miss Zhu's been asking about you.

296
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,830
I didn't.

297
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,360
Miss Zhu,

298
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,040
someone who says one thing
but means another

299
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,320
will fall ill.

300
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,270
Exactly.

301
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,190
Heng,

302
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,320
you're here.

303
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,150
Miss Zhu.

304
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,880
The lotus flowers
by Luoxia Lake have bloomed,

305
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,480
I'd like to invite you to go with me.

306
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,270
Also, lunch is just ready.

307
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,830
How about enjoying the scenery
while having a feast?

308
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,320
Sure!

309
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,560
I've been bored all morning.

310
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,190
I was just thinking about where to go.

311
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,470
The carriage is ready.

312
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,440
Let's go.

313
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:22,560
Go.

314
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:23,960
You two stay and guard the restaurant.

315
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,040
Perhaps being alone

316
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,840
is my destiny.

317
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,720
It's all served.

318
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,040
Rainfall from Fenghe Restaurant.

319
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,230
Your favorite.

320
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,870
These dishes are made

321
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:03,440
by the best chefs in my residence.

322
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,320
They're the newest seasonal creations.

323
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:06,870
Of course,

324
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,390
their cooking skills
are not as good as yours.

325
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,270
I don't know if you'll like them.

326
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,200
I like them.

327
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm not a picky eater when I'm hungry.

328
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,630
That's good.

329
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,720
Please.

330
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:37,920
That day,

331
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,110
did I say anything nonsensical?

332
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,870
You said quite a bit.

333
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,390
I'm prone to losing composure

334
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,440
when I drink too much.

335
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,560
Heng,

336
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:52,840
you must have laughed at me.

337
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,470
How could I?

338
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,230
What I saw

339
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,840
was your most adorable side.

340
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,510
I'm just wondering

341
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,920
how did you leave that night.

342
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,840
I don't care about your affairs.

343
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,960
You always do foolish things.

344
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,630
Do you think others

345
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,990
will always stay by your side?

346
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,800
He's leaving
Tianxiang Restaurant's affairs

347
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,150
to us one by one,

348
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,440
telling us to manage them well.

349
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,560
He said he's going back home.

350
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:29,110
Last time before looking for medicine,

351
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,200
he had already told us that.

352
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,150
If he wants to go back home, just go.

353
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,800
He could've just told me directly.

354
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,470
Why go about it this way?

355
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,470
I will surely allow it.

356
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,960
Why does he act so strangely?

357
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
It's not that simple, is it?

358
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,990
What are you thinking about?

359
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,230
Nothing.

360
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,840
Do you remember what you said that day?

361
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,390
Not a single thing.

362
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:01,440
You said you'd been waiting
for someone for 500 years,

363
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:03,680
and that person would return.

364
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,560
Is he the person
who called you Miss Fifth?

365
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:12,630
Yes.

366
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,630
He once promised me

367
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,110
to take me on scenic travels

368
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,870
and to taste all the delicacies
in the world.

369
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,040
But later, he broke his promise.

370
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,600
So before,

371
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,270
when you called me Miss Fifth,

372
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,870
I thought you were him

373
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
and that he had finally returned.

374
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm not sure if I'm truly him.

375
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,080
But since you

376
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,510
think I'm him,

377
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,510
then let me protect you in his place.

378
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,680
I'm willing to take care of you
for a lifetime.

379
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,440
Miss Zhu, I know

380
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,040
I said this too abruptly.

381
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,470
I haven't agreed to the marriage

382
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:34,920
arranged by my father.

383
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:36,600
I just hope for a chance

384
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,470
to pursue my own happiness.

385
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,150
Heng,

386
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,110
you've done so much today

387
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,990
and said so much.

388
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:47,800
In fact, you just want me to

389
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,350
hold the birthday feast
for Wan'er tomorrow, right?

390
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,840
No problem, I agree.

391
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,390
It's late today.

392
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,800
There's still a lot to do
at Tianxiang Restaurant.

393
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,600
I'll leave first.

394
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,510
I've imagined this scene
countless times,

395
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,470
hoping he would return to my side,

396
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,080
reappear before me,

397
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,960
and that he and I

398
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,870
could become

399
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,440
the most ordinary couple in the world.

400
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:43,230
But

401
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:47,720
why I find no expected joy

402
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,510
hearing this confession?

403
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,150
Qing.

404
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,040
Looking at the moon?

405
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,230
You've returned.

406
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:53,800
I've been back for a while.

407
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,560
Seeing you watch so intently here,

408
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,600
I didn't disturb you.

409
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,150
The moon tonight is beautiful.

410
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,270
So

411
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,840
I'm admiring it.

412
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,870
It's rare to see you this quiet.

413
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,110
What's been going on with you lately?

414
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:14,870
What?

415
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,150
You're very different from before.

416
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,920
Cuiyan told me everything.

417
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,150
She said you'd handed over
the usual work

418
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,150
of Tianxiang Restaurant to them

419
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,040
because you're going back
to your hometown, right?

420
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,390
Cuiyan told you?

421
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,150
I was just thinking

422
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,320
of finding the right time to tell you.

423
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,600
You're just going back home?

424
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,040
Yes.

425
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,630
Why are you going back?

426
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,630
Or is something wrong?

427
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,150
If something happened to you,

428
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:52,840
don't hide it from me.

429
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:53,960
You must tell me the truth.

430
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
Nothing happened.

431
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,080
You're overthinking.

432
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,600
I'm not going back home.

433
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,270
I'm just going on a journey

434
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,270
and leaving Tianxiang Restaurant.

435
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,390
A journey?

436
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,150
When will you be back?

437
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,080
I don't know.

438
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,870
I've stayed at Tianxiang Restaurant
for so long.

439
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,270
Thank you for taking care of me
during this time.

440
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,470
All good things must come to an end.

441
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:33,510
Wuxia City

442
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,390
and Tianxiang Restaurant

443
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:37,840
are just places I stopped along the way.

444
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,080
I'm just a passerby.

445
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:42,870
I never planned to stay here forever.

446
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,150
I'm destined
to continue my wandering journey.

447
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,510
So

448
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,800
you've already
decided to leave long ago.

449
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,080
When I came here,

450
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,990
I didn't intend to stay here permanently.

451
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,990
It's just I owed you money.

452
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,600
I will return the silver...

453
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,150
Don't go.

454
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:14,510
Don't go, Qing.

455
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,150
I'll feel so out of place if you go.

456
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,990
I've long regarded you and them

457
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,080
as my family.

458
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:29,270
I can't imagine the days
after you leave.

459
00:27:35,470 --> 00:27:36,560
Don't worry, Miss Zhu.

460
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:38,870
Cuiyan and Yingtao will stay with you.

461
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,230
You should stay with me too.

462
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:41,990
Is that not possible?

463
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,270
Miss Zhu,

464
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,990
I have no other way.

465
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,720
I've already decided.

466
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,320
But I'm not leaving that soon.

467
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,470
I'm still making travel plans.

468
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,390
Alright.

469
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,600
Since you've decided,

470
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,350
I won't stop you.

471
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:18,920
But if you're leaving,

472
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,230
take me with you.

473
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:23,230
I'm already tired of staying here.

474
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,920
I was just thinking of
going out to explore.

475
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,110
Let's go travel together.

476
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:27,750
Wouldn't that be great?

477
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,150
It's decided then.

478
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:40,990
I also wish to.

479
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,240
[Residence of the Prince of Langya]

480
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,110
Your Highness.

481
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,440
Is something the matter?

482
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,720
The peddler
delivered a letter to Her Grace,

483
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,600
but the content is still unknown.

484
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,510
Miss Zhu, this way please.

485
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,040
Miss Zhu,

486
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,320
His Highness has been
waiting for you in the study.

487
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,040
Greetings, Miss Zhu and Mr. Chang.

488
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,990
Her Grace has some matters
to consult you on.

489
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,920
I wonder if you could go meet her?

490
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,680
Alright.

491
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:49,870
Qing,

492
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,510
you head back
to Tianxiang Restaurant first.

493
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,560
Alright.

494
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,350
Don't worry.

495
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:56,680
Let's go.

496
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:07,720
Your Grace,

497
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,800
Miss Zhu has arrived.

498
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,390
You may leave.

499
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,320
Today is your birthday.

500
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:36,200
Why you're still not dressed up

501
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,600
and called me over?

502
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:40,600
I just want to have

503
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,390
a private chat with you.

504
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
I wonder

505
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:49,270
how well do you know His Highness.

506
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,440
Did you summon me today

507
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,510
just to talk about Heng?

508
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,270
Once, I too was like you,

509
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,110
free to do as I wished

510
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,630
and live leisurely and carefree.

511
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,600
But now, sadly,

512
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,960
my status feels like my shackle.

513
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,470
Your Grace,

514
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,720
if you're just feeling emotional,

515
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,870
perhaps another time would be better.

516
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,150
I'm here today
to cook for the birthday feast.

517
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,840
Miss Zhu, please wait a moment.

518
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,510
I have something to show you.

519
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,560
Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures.

520
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:42,270
How did it end up in your hands?

521
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,040
So, you do know of this painting.

522
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,110
I wonder if you know

523
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,750
the mystery

524
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,960
within this painting.

525
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,040
What exactly are you trying to say?

526
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,680
I want to say that His Highness

527
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,840
truly treats you

528
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,040
differently from others.

529
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,720
But unfortunately, many things

530
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,230
are not what they seem.

531
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,320
What does it have to do

532
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,200
with this painting?

533
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:48,510
This painting can tremble

534
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,800
and even transform.

535
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,350
So,

536
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,040
you must have seen it change

537
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,510
and want to know why.

538
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:09,560
Do you know?

539
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,440
I don't.

540
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,720
But our Qing

541
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,080
is skilled in studying such paintings.

542
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,510
How about this.

543
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,750
Let me take this painting back

544
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,720
and have him study it.

545
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:20,080
After all, in this residence,

546
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,600
any things are inconvenient.

547
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Perhaps you could pick another time

548
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,920
to discuss this
at Tianxiang Restaurant instead.

549
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:50,680
Your Grace.

550
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,390
Did His Highness
send you here to find me?

551
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,390
You're overthinking.

552
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,390
He doesn't know
about you and the peddler.

553
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,270
But I can help you.

554
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,440
You can help me?

555
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:12,710
Wan'er.

556
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:15,990
Wan'er.

557
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:18,800
Wan'er.

558
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,360
What happened to your face?

559
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:27,840
I...

560
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,600
My nose was accidentally hurt.

561
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,750
Wan'er,

562
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,230
I've brought you something good.

563
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:33,120
You must try it well.

564
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:02,950
Qing.

565
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:05,800
What are you doing

566
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,400
not sleeping so late at night?

567
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,190
Miss Zhu.

568
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,040
When did you come back?

569
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,880
I've been waiting at the door
all this time.

570
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,670
I don't necessarily always
return through the door.

571
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,320
Why keep waiting there?

572
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:22,910
It's Her Grace's birthday feast.

573
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,190
Why are you back so early?

574
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,510
Her Grace is missing.

575
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,710
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

576
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,510
I'm tired today.

577
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,990
Her Grace is missing?

578
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,560
This smells so fragrant.

579
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,600
So familiar.

580
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,400
Yes, yes, yes.

581
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,750
It's made from rosefinch egg.

582
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,310
You ate it when you were a child.

583
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,790
Rosefinch egg?

584
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:55,200
Wan'er.

585
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,880
All these years,

586
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,400
I know you like it.

587
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,160
I've always kept it in mind.

588
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,840
Finally, I managed to get it

589
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:05,680
from Tianxiang Restaurant.

590
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,600
I was afraid I

591
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,440
might not resist eating it myself,

592
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,470
so

593
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,600
I hurt my nose.

594
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:18,360
By the way,

595
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,080
today is your birthday.

596
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,120
I've also prepared

597
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,120
another gift for you.

598
00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:24,200
Wan'er.

599
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,840
I've traveled across the land

600
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,440
and finally found
the legendary rhino horn

601
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,600
and made into your favorite hairpin.

602
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:36,310
Do you still remember?

603
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,680
When you were young,

604
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,440
you didn't know how to comb your hair

605
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,080
and often asked me to do it for you.

606
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,750
I said at the time,

607
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,880
"Such a clumsy girl.

608
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,160
Might as well marry me.

609
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,030
I'll comb your hair every day.

610
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:50,550
How does that sound?"

611
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,790
What a delicate hairpin.

612
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,680
Ze,

613
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,750
how should I thank you?

614
00:36:59,360 --> 00:36:59,840
Wan'er,

615
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,080
don't thank me.

616
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:04,710
Wan'er,

617
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:06,680
leave here with me, will you?

618
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,160
Wan'er, I've seen you

619
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:11,950
at your happiest.

620
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:14,600
I can tell

621
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,360
you are not happy at all

622
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,400
when you're with the Prince of Langya.

623
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,360
I've wandered all these years,

624
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,680
making a home everywhere.

625
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,030
But you're always on my mind.

626
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,440
How I wish you

627
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,510
could roam the world with me.

628
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:32,990
Wan'er,

629
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,360
go with me.

630
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:36,030
Yes.

631
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,030
I've always been unhappy.

632
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,920
And you saw right through me.

633
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,160
Ze,

634
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:56,880
see what it is.

635
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:04,270
I don't recognize it.

636
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,030
Looks a bit like silkworm silk.

637
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,440
Is it silkworm silk?

638
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,550
It...

639
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:14,440
It's a puppet string

640
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:16,640
given to me by Mr. Tan.

641
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,680
As long as I loop it around your neck,

642
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,990
I can kill you instantly.

643
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,360
Wan'er.

644
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,230
Are you going to kill me?

645
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:33,270
Wan'er,

646
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,230
did you come to kill me?

647
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,920
Yes.

648
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,920
Originally, I came this time

649
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,790
to settle things with you.

650
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,640
You're afraid I'll tell your secret

651
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,750
to the Prince of Langya?

652
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,710
About your impersonation?

653
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:00,230
Yes, I'm scared.

654
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,030
I'm terrified.

655
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,360
But now that I think about it,

656
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,510
what's the point?

657
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,080
Ze, do you know?

658
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,790
Every time I see you,

659
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:15,880
it's like seeing myself.

660
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,950
I didn't tell you before

661
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,920
how unhappy I'd been with His Highness.

662
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,400
He has always ignored me.

663
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,310
I offered him my whole heart,

664
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,360
but he threw it to the ground.

665
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,160
He gave all his heart

666
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:41,710
to Miss Zhu of Tianxiang Restaurant

667
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,080
and invited her
to see the lotus flowers.

668
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,310
I wanted to kill you

669
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,080
and be with His Highness forever.

670
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,400
But then I thought,

671
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,120
even if I end up being with him,

672
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,990
I won't see any hope or future.

673
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,470
Wan'er, Wan'er.

674
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:06,710
Don't cry.

675
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,880
Don't cry.

676
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,160
Don't cry.

677
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,710
I'll be heartbroken if you cry, Wan'er.

678
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,360
I came here today

679
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,750
to keep my secret safe.

680
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,950
I intended to kill you.

681
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,550
But you treat me so kindly.

682
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,790
You give me your all.

683
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:29,230
Am I not incredibly foolish

684
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,750
trying to kill someone who loves me

685
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,790
to please someone
who doesn't love me at all?

686
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:40,710
Wan'er.

687
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:43,440
So what if I'm Li Wan'er

688
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,270
or not?

689
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,950
He doesn't love me.

690
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,510
Ze, tell me.

691
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,360
How alike we are.

692
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,400
The person I love don't love me back.

693
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,030
Wan'er.

694
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,750
Wan'er.

695
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,080
His Highness is here.

696
00:41:15,990 --> 00:41:16,990
Get on your knees.

697
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,030
Li Wan'er.

698
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:30,030
I prepared
a grand birthday feast for you,

699
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,160
but you disappeared,

700
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,270
only to be found here,

701
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,510
engaging in such disgraceful behavior.

702
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,440
Your Highness.

703
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,710
All these years,

704
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,680
I've been walking the wrong path.

705
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,920
I shouldn't have loved you.

706
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,680
All these years,

707
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:50,400
I've lived entirely

708
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,160
in pursuit of my love for you

709
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:54,200
and lost myself.

710
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,750
I was too persistent.

711
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:57,360
Now,

712
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,230
I no longer want to continue.

713
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,840
Wealth is easy to gain,

714
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,640
but true love is hard to find.

715
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,030
I choose true love.

716
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:11,950
It's a pity

717
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,400
that I only understand this now.

718
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,270
Come here.

719
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:02,710
I didn't expect

720
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,400
my happiest moments

721
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:05,680
are still from our childhood.

722
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:08,230
When we were childhood sweethearts,

723
00:43:09,470 --> 00:43:10,400
we played

724
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:12,680
in the fields.

725
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:14,680
How happy we were.

726
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,030
I don't have to be like now,

727
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:18,750
worrying day and night

728
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,840
that my secret would be exposed.

729
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,920
And you don't have
to wander for a living.

730
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:29,640
Your Highness.

731
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:31,200
All these years,

732
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:33,120
I've been struggling,

733
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,440
longing but unable to obtain.

734
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:37,200
You should know

735
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,750
the rosefinch egg
cannot be consumed twice.

736
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:43,950
I'm taking

737
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:47,550
your secret with me.

738
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:55,470
Wan'er. Wan...

739
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:00,470
Wan'er.

740
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,310
Wan'er! Wan'er!

741
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,030
Years apart,

742
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:23,640
not a day without longing.

743
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:26,990
Today, I acquired
a treasure to present to you.

744
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,640
On a crescent moon night,

745
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,470
I'll see an old friend again.

746
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:36,310
Mr. Chen.

747
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,750
Do you recognize

748
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,510
the words on it?

749
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:16,600
♪Here's a flower for you♪

750
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,740
♪I don't know what to say
when we look at each other♪

751
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:29,380
♪Time goes by so quickly♪

752
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:35,050
