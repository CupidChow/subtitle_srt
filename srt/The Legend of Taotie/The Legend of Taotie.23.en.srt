Wan'er! Wan'er!

We haven't seen for years.

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,600
I miss you every day.

26
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,960

Mr. Chen,

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,720
can you recognize

31
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,320
this handwriting?

32
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,320
Yes, of course.

33
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,670
I wrote this note.

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,630
Her Grace once helped me.

35
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,320
Under no circumstances would I kill her.

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,830

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,390

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,600
Comb.

42
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,960
Mr. Chen,

43
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,750
what do you call this?

44
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,160
Fine-toothed comb.

45
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,720
If I ask anyone out there,

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,360
they'll call this "comb".

Throughout Wuxia...

48
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,750
No.

Throughout the South,

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,880
people call it "comb".

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,240
Official Cai figured it out.

52
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,600
People in the former dynasty
call it "fine-toothed comb".

00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,720
call it "fine-toothed comb".

57
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:00,830
Mr. Chen,

58
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:04,000
let me guess,

59
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,440
you're from Panyun Village
of Weiyi Mountain, right?

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What if I am?

61
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,000
What if I'm not?

62
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,270
What a coincidence.

63
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,760
I know another two men
from Panyun Village.

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,670
Ge Liang.

65
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,270
A draper in the north of the city.

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:29,110
Ten years ago, he moved in here.

67
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,320
Half a month ago, he argued with me

68
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,880
in Pingyue House.

69
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,350
Later, he was strangled in an alley.

70
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,550
Li Jiuzeng.

71
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,880
He was a ruffian on Xingshan Street.

72
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,230
He bullied people and did evil.

73
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,390
Seven days ago,
he ate the Hibiscus Flame

74
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,640
and self-ignited on the street.

75
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,830
It's back.

76
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,950
I know it's back.

77
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,480
I sent my men

78
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,950
to ask his neighbors.

79
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:56,110
They were told

80
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,230
he usually called this comb

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,830
"fine-toothed comb".

82
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,920
We also figured out something.

83
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
Her Grace

84
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,920
is also from Panyun Village.

85
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,070
What a coincidence.

86
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:17,040
They're from the same village.

87
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,270

88
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:21,480

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,760
in their death?

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,480
It's just a coincidence.

91
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,440
Perfect excuse.

92
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,160
I wonder

93
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,350
if you've heard about a story.

94
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,480
An orphan

95
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,070
was always bullied in his village.

96
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,790
One day,

97
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,830
he brought in rosefinches.

98
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,070
A couple of rosefinches.

99
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,350
The entire Panyun Village

100
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,760
was almost destroyed in a fire!

101
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,480
The village head asked Wuxia for help.

102
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,110
Archers were sent
to kill the male rosefinch.

103
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:02,920
The female rosefinch

104
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:06,830
then disappeared.

105
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,350
Mr. Chen,

106
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
does this story

107
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,950
sound very familiar?

108
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,920
I sent archers

109
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:25,040
to check the destroyed village,

110
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,000
only to find Ge Liang
was the son of the village head.

111
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,760
Li Jiuzeng was his follower.

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,640
When they were in the village,

113
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:38,320
they always bullied the weak.

114
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,230
I heard

115
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:42,760
the orphan they bullied most

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,070
was also a Chen.

117
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,000
No.

118
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,510
It's not me.

119
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,480
It's not.

120
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,110
I wouldn't kill anyone.

121
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,160
I...

122
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,600
I wouldn't kill Her Grace.

123
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,480
Oh, I see.

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:57,670
It's them.

125
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,670
The rosefinches.

126
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,160
They killed these people.

127
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,600
You snatched money from Ge Liang's bag.

128
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,880
You killed him!

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,230
He didn't give me the money.

130
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,600
I had to do that.

131
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,720
You just admitted that.

132
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:22,600
And Li Jiuzeng...

133
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:26,160
What witchcraft did you use

134
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,950
to make him self-ignite?

135
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,200
How did Her Grace offend you?

136
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,760
Why did you kill her?

137
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,070
It's not me.

138
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,480
It's just not.

139
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,550
I wouldn't kill Wan'er.

140
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,110
She's the woman

141
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,070
I've been loving.

142
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:45,110
I wouldn't kill her.

143
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,110
I wouldn't kill my beloved woman.

144
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,880
I just wouldn't.

145
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,600
How dare you?

146
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,600
You can't call Her Grace by name.

147
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,040
What's so funny?

148
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,040
What's so funny?

149
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,390
Your mistake is funny!

150
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,510
Wan'er and I were very close

151
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,880
and we grew up together.

152
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,830
I would rather die for her

153
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,550
than hurt her.

154
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,350
It's hard to tell.

155
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:31,390
His Highness is charming.

156
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,280
Her Grace would marry him.

157
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,910
So, she wouldn't like you anymore.

158
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,910
When she rejected you,

159
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,960
anger flooded through you

160
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,640
and you may also burn her

161
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,840
with the rosefinch's flame.

162
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,790
Nonsense!

163
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,230
Total nonsense!

164
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,080
How could you slander me?

165
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,710
If I had the flame,

166
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,520
I would burn you first!

167
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,520
Sadly...

168
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,550
Sadly, I'm not powerful enough.

169
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,520
But anyway,

170
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,710
you can never get the truth

171
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:13,710
from me.

172
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,960
Keep investigating it.

173
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,150
If I had the flame,

174
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,200
I'd burn you

175
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,080
and eat you up!

176
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,670
You'll never know

177
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,030
how tasty it can be!

178
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,640
I'll even chew your bones

179
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,710
and then...

180
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,230
Who's that?

181
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,280
You're agile, Mr. Lu.

182
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,150
Your Highness.

183
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,760
I've never been here.

184
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,590
You've never seen me.

185
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,150
Don't bother to greet me.

186
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,230
I understand.

187
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,440
Are you done interrogating Chen Ze?

188
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,840
Did he confess

189
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,760
he murdered Wan'er?

190
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:28,400
Chen Ze is insane.

191
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,320
His speech is quite suspicious.

192
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,670
He may not be the killer.

193
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,590
I need to investigate more.

194
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,440
Li Wan'er is the princess.

195
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,910
She was killed
in the wild for no reason.

196
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:44,790
But you fail to solve this case quickly.

197
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:47,760
Your Highness,

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,790
my job is to arrest the real killer.

199
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,350
Before Chen Ze is convicted,

200
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,440
he's a common man.

201
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,550
Killing a commoner

202
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,320
won't help with this case.

203
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,910
How dare you disobey me

204
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,670
for a shameless guy?

205
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:14,520
Fine.

206
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,790
You have two days.

207
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,880
Within two days,

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,670
you must find the real killer.

209
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,400
Yes.

210
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:33,920
[Sealed by the Inspection Department]

211
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,350
Why is Tianxiang Restaurant closed down?

212
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,550
Look. It's closed down.

213
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,080
I heard

214
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,200
another person died after eating

215
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,280
the Hibiscus Flame.

216
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:47,710
Really?

217
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,440
What's worse,

218
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,280
it was the princess

219
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,880
who would marry His Highness.

220
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,760
Really?

221
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,110
It's big trouble, then.

222
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,030
Miss Zhu,

223
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,080
what's going on?

224
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:01,710
Yeah.

225
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,590
Her Grace disappeared before the feast.

226
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:07,350
Why is our dish involved?

227
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
Anyway, our restaurant and Miss Zhu

228
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,230
are blamed for this.

229
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,280
His Highness turned
against us so quickly.

230
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,590
He isn't to blame.

231
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,320
Even I think it's unbelievable.

232
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,080
Did Her Grace...

233
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,910
Did she also eat
the rosefinch's egg before?

234
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,760
Yes.

235
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,590
Such a strange coincidence.

236
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,400
I told you.

237
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,110
Don't cook anything

238
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,440
so dangerous.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,350
There aren't so many coincidences.

240
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,880
Actually,

241
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,470
everyone makes his own choice.

242
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,470
But...

243
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,960
Why did he send Mingyan

244
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,230
instead of coming personally?

245
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:47,470
Someone died.

246
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,760
Why do you still think of him?

247
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,960
His fiancée just died.

248
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,790
Qing, you sound

249
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,080
really unsympathetic.

250
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,670
I pitied him,

251
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,320
so I blamed you.

252
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,910
His Highness just lost his fiancée.

253
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,440
He must be grieved.

254
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,670
How can he see you now?

255
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,320
Does he have to come here

256
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,440
and confront you?

257
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:05,910
He can do that.

258
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:07,520
It may not be my fault.

259
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,670
Too sad for Wan'er.

260
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,150
Forget it.

261
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,110
It's not too bad.

262
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,080
Qing,

263
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,080
let me show you something.

264
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,350
Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures?

265
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:28,880
Miss Zhu,

266
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,200
how did you get it back?

267
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,960
Yesterday, at Heng's mansion,

268
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,200
Wan'er gave it to me.

269
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,550
Her Grace?

270
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,790
The one who defeated me

271
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,640
and stole it was really agile.

272
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,960
It can't be Her Grace.

273
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,110
Among the guards

274
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,520
who serve His Highness,
many of them are very agile.

275
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,000
So, His Highness

276
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,400
must be involved.

277
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,550
Miss Zhu,

278
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,960
what else did Her Grace tell you?

279
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:25,880
Miss Zhu,

280
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,910
it's...

281
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,150
When Official Xu

282
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,550
gave it to me,

283
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,080
I thought

284
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,790
it could echo the Dragon's blood.

285
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,150
But only Jiao was there.

286
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,640
It appears so now.

287
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,960
Everything in this world is complicated.

288
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:52,640
No one knows what will happen

289
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,960
at a certain time.

290
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,400
It's the Hibiscus Flame
I made for Wan'er yesterday.

291
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,200
Now, no one will eat it.

292
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:03,790
Qing,

293
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,760
do you dare to eat it?

294
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,280
I certainly do.

295
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,240
Did I ignore it deliberately

296
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,830
or was I just stupid?

297
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,240
I didn't realize

298
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,920
the rosefinch's feather you gave me

299
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,680
could be the key

300
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,480
to the recent murder cases.

301
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,920
What have you got?

302
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,000
Just ask me.

303
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,240
I've never meant to hide anything.

304
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,880
We arrested a man.

305
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,880
His name is Chen Ze.

306
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,270
He used to live in Panyun Village

307
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,360
and he was often bullied.

308
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,190
I heard he brought in rosefinches

309
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,150
and burned his village.

310
00:16:15,390 --> 00:16:16,680
Where is he now?

311
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,240
In jail.

312
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:27,390
Wait a minute.

313
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,240
Come to think of it,

314
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,150
I haven't bought you a drink

315
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,390
since we met.

316
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,630
It's strong.

317
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,990
With some green plum.

318
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,040
No wonder I think

319
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,720
it smells a little bit sour.

320
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,350
You know it's poisonous.

321
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,080
Why did you drink it?

322
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,080
I've never rejected

323
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,440
anything you gave me.

324
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,230
Since I gave the rosefinch's feather,

325
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,390
you've been suspecting me, huh?

326
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,560
Why did you give me the signal

327
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,960
to make me know you're a rosefinch?

328
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,150
Whatever you want to know,

329
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,680
I've never kept it from you.

330
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,470
Yan,

331
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,230
where are you going?

332
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,630
To kill Chen Ze.

333
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:35,440
Don't go.

334
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,600
He's the last one.

335
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,990
I must kill him.

336
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,470
For the sake Chen Ze was an orphan

337
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,870
and he was terribly bullied,

338
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,320
my husband and I
took him in for one night.

339
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,870
Unexpectedly,

340
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,800
he found out what we were

341
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,560
and stole

342
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,200
my five babies who were hatching.

343
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,680
My husband hunted him

344
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,080
until he reached Panyun Village.

345
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,200
But archers killed him.

346
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,470
Mr. Lu,

347
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,750
the man you're trying to save

348
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,470
is a disloyal traitor.

349
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,600
My poor babies
who didn't even open their eyes

350
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,960
were all dead.

351
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:42,750
He broke their shells,

352
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:44,560
dragged them out,

353
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,840
and ate them up.

354
00:19:58,510 --> 00:19:59,800
I'm a demon.

355
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,840
So, I deserve the tragedy?

356
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,560
He's a human.

357
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,750
So, he deserves your protection?

358
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,870
Don't go!

359
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,870
His Highness will kill you!

360
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,320
No.

361
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,200
Making the Hibiscus Flame for you

362
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,680
has got me in a lot of trouble.

363
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,600
Now, my restaurant

364
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,560
is closed up.

365
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,750
I'll have my fifty-year nirvana.

366
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,110
Please make it for me again.

367
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,470
After I take revenge,

368
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,350
you can eat me

369
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,750
as compensation.

370
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,470
You really taste good.

371
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,230
A hundred times better than your egg.

372
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,390
I won't live too long.

373
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,510
Please help me.

374
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,840
You can take revenge.

375
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,630
But...

376
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,270
If you damage the Lotus Tower,

377
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,680
I won't spare you.

378
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,350
I won't.

379
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,270
No!

380
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,470
No! No!

381
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:18,630
No!

382
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,350
No.

383
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,390
Don't.

384
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,920
I work for Miss Zhu
of Tianxiang Restaurant.

385
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,750
I'm Yingtao.

386
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,630
Miss Zhu asked me to bring you a dish.

387
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,510
She said

388
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,960
you should eat it when it's hot.

389
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,510
Or it'll taste bad.

390
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,110
Go away.

391
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:44,990
Get lost.

392
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,390
Go away.

393
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,840
Get away.

394
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,750
Go away.

395
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
[Inspection Department]

396
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,200
Leave.

397
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,680
Before the worst thing happens,

398
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,230
you can leave.

399
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,270
I won't blame you.

400
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,040
Mr. Lu,

401
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,390
it's easy for you

402
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,720
to kill me.

403
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:28,200
Why do you release a demon
who kills people?

404
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,110
The last three sections

405
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,230
of the Purification weren't played.

406
00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:37,510
If you had finished them,
I would have died.

407
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,630
Why didn't you finish them?

408
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:30,750
This is it.

409
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,470
This is the taste.

410
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,990
It's so good.

411
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:08,990
Yutong,

412
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,510
is that you?

413
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,630
Yes.

414
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,350
I'll go with you.

415
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,630
Let's get out of here

416
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,230
and live a happy life.

417
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:22,870
Really?

418
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,080
Yutong,

419
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:36,720
we can finally be together!

420
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,750
Yan,

421
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,350
the killing will never end.

422
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:07,750
Let it go.

423
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:08,800
Yutong.

424
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,150
Yutong.

425
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:26,200
Mr. Lu,

426
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,320
I've taken revenge.

427
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:31,720
Punish me as you wish.

428
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,560
Yan,

429
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,350
why did you have to do this?

430
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,600
You know I'm an archer.

431
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,110
Can't you stop this for me?

432
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,920
Years ago, I lost my husband and babies

433
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,080
because of this man.

434
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,040
My whole clan

435
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,560
was also destroyed

436
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,800
because of him.

437
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,750
How could I stop?

438
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,720
But you met me.

439
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,350
Can't you let go of your hatred?

440
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,750
Don't push me.

441
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,320
Under such circumstances,

442
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,390
punish me as you wish.

443
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,110
Forget it, Yan.

444
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:40,750
It's my fault.

445
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,870
I should have known what you wanted.

446
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
Sorry I didn't help you.

447
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,870
I won't bother about what happened

449
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,200
before you met me.

450
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,150
But since we've met,

451
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,350
in the future...

452
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,840
The past is miserable.

453
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,110
In the future,

454
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,720
what can we do?

455
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,630
What's gone is gone.

456
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,270
But in the future,

457
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,390
you'll have me.

458
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,800
Whatever happens,

459
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,080
I'll take the blame with you.

460
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,080
Trust me.

461
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,150
I'm here.

462
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:46,990
I'll always be with you.

463
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,200
You and I

464
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:53,960
will be together?

465
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,150
Yan,

466
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,350
trust me.

467
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:30,040
Stop.

468
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,440
Take her alive.

469
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,150
Yan.

470
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,560
I trust you.

471
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,350
No, Yan!

472
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:07,960
After her.

473
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:09,990
Hurry.

474
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,840
Your Highness.

475
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:19,230
You had hard work, Mr. Lu.

476
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,110
Your Highness.

477
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,390
Your Highness.

478
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:29,750
Somebody.

479
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,470
Here.

480
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,630
Take Mr. Lu back for some treatment.

481
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,200
Yes.

482
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,110
Mr. Lu.

483
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,320
Mr. Lu.

484
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:17,270
Tell Mingyan

485
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,680
to gather all our men

486
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,680
to put out the fires in the city.

487
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:20,320
Yes.

488
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:26,720
Oh, no.

489
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:27,720
She's out of control.

490
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,470
No.

491
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,150
You were injured
in the battle 500 years ago.

492
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,560
You've been recovering in human form.

493
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,440
Lately, frequent transformations

494
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,990
have weakened you.

495
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,200
It's too dangerous.

496
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,390
You must not move rashly.

497
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,870
He asked me to protect Wuxia.

498
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,510
Miss Zhu.

499
00:32:58,510 --> 00:32:59,470
Put out the fire!

500
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,350
- Run!
- Put out the fire!

501
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,110
Fight the fire!

502
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Report!

503
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,680
Report.

504
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,720
Your Highness,

505
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,750
waster or soil can't extinguish

506
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,510
the rosefinch's flame.

507
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,840
Over 50 houses
on the east of Fuqing Street

508
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,870
have been burned down.

509
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:17,920
Report!

510
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,990
Report, Your Highness.

511
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:19,960
The fires develop fast.

512
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,110
Two big clans in the south of the city

513
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:22,990
have suffered great losses.

514
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,150
Mingyan.

515
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:27,560
Here.

516
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,350
Send all my guards to fight the fires.

517
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,750
Yes.

518
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:30,680
Also,

519
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:32,230
you lead the archers

520
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,960
to arrest the rosefinch.

521
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:35,720
Yes.

522
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,630
The rest of you,

523
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,680
go fight the fire with me.

524
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,230
Your Highness,

525
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,510
you can't go.

526
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,750
You're a prince.

527
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:41,840
Don't put yourself in danger.

528
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,990
If my people are dead,

529
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,560
what do we need a prince for?

530
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:46,720
On my command, guards!

531
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,750
Let's go fight the fires!

532
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,230
Yes.

533
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:50,920
Your Highness, look.

534
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,320
What... What's that?

535
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,160
Demon. That's a demon.

536
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:57,710
Taotie.

537
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,040
That's the Divine Beast Taotie.

538
00:34:59,040 --> 00:34:59,470
It is?

539
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:00,910
It's here to save us.

540
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,470
Really?

541
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:03,910
The Divine Beast.

542
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,080
Thank you.

543
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,400
Taotie?

544
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:26,800
Taotie is chasing the rosefinch

545
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,160
towards the Lotus Tower.

546
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:28,640
Mingyan.

547
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:29,120
Here.

548
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,750
Go.

549
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,310
Yes.

550
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:30,950
Let's go.

551
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,710
Stop!

552
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,790
[Lotus Tower]
Mr. Lu.

553
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,510
I'll take care of this.

554
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,920
But Mr. Lu,

555
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:32,120
His Highness...

556
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,990
What...

557
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,360
Hurry.

558
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,990
Put out the fire.

559
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,710
Go get more water.

560
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,310
Help!

561
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:27,950
Help!

562
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,510
Somebody help!

563
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,120
Save my granddaughter!

564
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,680
Mr. Yun.

565
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:33,750
Mr. Yun.

566
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,400
Ms. Li.

567
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,200
Hurry. My granddaughter is in there!

568
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,120
Get her out, please!

569
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:37,750
Ms. Li,

570
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,680
calm down.

571
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,080
Mr. Yun.

572
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:39,600
Don't worry.

573
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,030
She's in there.

574
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,400
My granddaughter.

575
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,990
Help her!

576
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:48,510
Ms. Li,

577
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,510
I'll go.

578
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,030
Mr. Yun.

579
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,920
I beg you, Mr. Yun.

580
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,080
Yan.

581
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:05,270
Mr. Lu.

582
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,640
You knew His Highness
wouldn't let me go.

583
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,310
Why did you come here?

584
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,310
Because I said,

585
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,640
"Whatever happens

586
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,750
I'll take the blame with you."

587
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,470
For a demon like me

588
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,080
who kills people,

589
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,550
is it worth it?

590
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,840
I decide if it's worth it.

591
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,470
Mr. Ming.

592
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,120
Mr. Ming.

593
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,400
At the command of His Majesty,

594
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,470
we must kill the rosefinch.

595
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:03,680
But...

596
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,440
But...

597
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:05,510
Umm...

598
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,270
What are you waiting for?
Encircle this tower!

599
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,360
- Yes.
- Yes.

600
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,680
Yan,

601
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,510
you took revenge.

602
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,950
Why must you hurt common people?

603
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,840
I beg you for one tear.

604
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,680
Official Cai told me

605
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,470
the rosefinch flame isn't ordinary

606
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,550
and can't be extinguished.

607
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,880
Only a cold rosefinch's tear

608
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:50,470
can save this city.

609
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,680
I told you.

610
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,920
I don't smile or cry.

611
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:00,920
Besides,

612
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,510
they deserve to die.

613
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,160
Yan,

614
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:11,310
don't you remember what I just said?

615
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,120
When you saw I was dying,

616
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,510
you shed a tear.

617
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,550
Yan.

618
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,680
We have a future.

619
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,080
Mr. Lu,

620
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,790
I've taken revenge.

621
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:40,080
All I want is to die now.

622
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,840
I just hope.

623
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,440
In the next life,

624
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,160
I could still meet you.

625
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,680
Why can't we be together in this life?

626
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,920
Why can't we?

627
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,080
Yan,

628
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,790
I will pay

629
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,920
for what humans owed you.

630
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,990
What do you say?

631
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,840
You damaged the Tower.

632
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,360
Do you plead guilty?

633
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,230
How could there be

634
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,470
such a powerful demon?

635
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:12,710
I plead guilty.

636
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:14,550
Thank you, Miss.

637
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,440
For what?

638
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:26,200
Mr. Lu,

639
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:31,480
I thought no one else

640
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:34,350
would really love me.

641
00:42:36,510 --> 00:42:39,720
I didn't expect to meet you, either.

642
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,350
Yan, I told you.

643
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,680
I'll always be with you.

644
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,750
Don't.

645
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:51,510
Don't do anything silly, will you?

646
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,030
I've covered all the sins.

647
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,720
There can be no forgiveness.

648
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,240
I totally understand.

649
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,550
I don't care.

650
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:03,510
The two of us

651
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,590
are destined to go different ways.

652
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,350
Even so,

653
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,920
we can end up together.

654
00:43:26,310 --> 00:43:26,960
Mr. Lu,

655
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,350
I'll see you in the next life.

656
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,680
Look.

657
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:42,990
What?

658
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:43,510
Look. Look.

659
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:44,720
