Hello, Official Xu.

He lives in this cottage.

Miss Zhu,

58
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,200
this painting is “Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures”

59
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,000
painted by Bai Ze that year.

60
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,510
500 years ago,

61
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,480
this painting was given by Monk Lotus

62
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,760
to my ancestor

63
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,200
and passed on from generation to generation.

64
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:44,390
Do you mean

65
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,720
this is from Monk Lotus?

66
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:48,110
Yeah.

67
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:51,670
My ancestor and Monk Lotus were confidants.

68
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,110
This painting has been placed in my mansion.

69
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,670
But a change has taken place

70
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,160
after the crack in the Lotus Tower.

71
00:07:59,160 --> 00:07:59,950
What change?

72
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,040
If beasts touch it,

73
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,320
it will emit fluorescence.

00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,440
You should know

00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:12,000

00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
Unintentionally,.

78
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,440

I didn't expect it to be so mysterious.

81
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,790
Now that Monk Lotus has given it to your ancestor,

82
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,390
why do you give it to me today?

83
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,910
I know you and Monk Lotus

Besides,

139
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,760
because of it,

140
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,840
I fell out with my father

141
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,550
and ran out.

142
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,280
What are you doing?

143
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,230
It's not delicious.

144
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,400
Of course not.

150
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,230

151
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,230
Return to the hive to recuperate

152
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,880
and replace the body

153
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,080
and then I can have

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,550
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Mr. Lu,

167
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,000
I have made clear who is the killer.

168
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,200
It was a Bei Di boy.

169
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:46,880
A Bei Di boy?

170
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,840
How could a Bei Di boy have wings

171
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,080
and fly away in full view?

172
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,200
You are right.

173
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,880
The killer was a beast

174
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,550
who disguised as a Bei Di boy.

175
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,470
Were you with Official Xu all the time

176
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,670
before going back to the Inspection Department?

177
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,550
Yes, I was.

178
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,150
I have been checking with Official Xu

179
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,400
outside the cottage.

180
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,350
What did you see?

181
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,840
On that day, Official Xu entered the house alone.

182
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:14,400
He was pale when he came out

183
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,230
and kept saying

184
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,790
it's terrible.

185
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:19,790
Hurry up.

186
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,320
We're still a step late.

187
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,280
I think they are the things

188
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,000
that Official Xu saw in the cottage that day.

189
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,840
They used beasts to kill people

190
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,000
and burned them down.

191
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,640
None survived.

192
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,710
None survived.

193
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,230
Who's there?

194
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:25,550
Who are you?

195
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,790
Drop your hand.

196
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,030
Or I will shoot arrows.

197
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:33,550
Ling.

198
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:36,030
Who is that?

199
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,520
Run!

200
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,110
Don't hurt him.

201
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:05,760
Who is he?

202
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,200
He is Xu Ruoxu,

203
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:08,710
the son of Official Xu.

204
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,590
Let's chase them.

205
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,320
The beast can fly.

206
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,230
We can't catch them up.

207
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
This is the beast

208
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,550
that killed Official Xu.

209
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:20,880
How could Official Xu have thought

210
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,960
that his son

211
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,320
saved the bee that killed him?

212
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,640
[Langya Prefecture]

213
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,960
It's a flying beast.

214
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,670
We can confirm

215
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,280
that Official Xu was killed by him.

216
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,710
Is the beast

217
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,670
a black bee?

218
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,150
Exactly.

219
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,280
In the “Records of Beasts in the Continent”

220
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,350
written by Official Xu,

221
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,320
there is a description of it.

222
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,910
While the bee is killing people,

223
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,590
it will also get the victim's memories.

224
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,960
But it's not very detailed.

225
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,670
Because few people have ever seen it.

226
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,710
Prince Nan also mentioned it to me.

227
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:06,070
Looks like Bei Di people

228
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,560
have domesticated black bees

229
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,310
into killers.

230
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,950
At all costs,

231
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,310
we must find the beekeeper.

232
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,070
Got it.

233
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:14,590
Got it.

234
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,160
I have one more thing

235
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,040
to report to you, Your Highness.

236
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,950
The one who saved the black bee

237
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:28,350
was Xu Ruoxu, Official Xu's son.

238
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,350
Why him?

239
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,680
I don't know why either.

240
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,190
And

241
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,710
the coroner has examined Official Xu's body

242
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:43,950
and found out

243
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,680
there are three moles in his palm.

244
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,680
He said

245
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,190
the moles look like a tattoo.

246
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,950
It seems that Official Xu

247
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,160
is deliberately protecting

248
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,880
the man with three moles in his palm.

249
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,430
This person is the one who can destroy Bei Di

250
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,710
after 10 years in the prophecy.

251
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,830
I know you're hungry.

252
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,880
But I don't have any money now.

253
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:34,710
When I go home and get money tomorrow,

254
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,190
I'll buy you the best.

255
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,110
What does that mean by none survived?

256
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,830
That means

257
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,830
there is no one left.

258
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,680
It's all gone.

259
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:58,160
What happened to you?

260
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,160
Why?

261
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:01,560
What?

262
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,710
Why did I save you?

263
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,110
Because you saved me first.

264
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,520
Said the saint,

265
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,280
within the four seas, all men are brothers.

266
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,160
Then we'll be brothers.

267
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,160
Brothers.

268
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:20,710
Go.

269
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,640
[Zhu]

270
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,400
I've been busy entertaining Prince Nan these days.

271
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,590
I had no time to visit you.

272
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,310
Sorry for that.

273
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,190
After all, Tianxiang Restaurant is not a hotel

274
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,430
where people are free to come and go.

275
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,950
Miss Zhu loves to be quiet.

276
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:40,950
As soon as the curtains hang,

277
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,520
we have had no guests for about ten days.

278
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,160
Your Highness, you don't have to stand on ceremony.

279
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,190
That being said,

280
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,400
in my heart,

281
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,800
I really miss you.

282
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:52,710
So,

283
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,280
I especially got a rare ingredient

284
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,400
for you.

285
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:57,830
Mingyan, here.

286
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:58,880
There seems to be something good.

287
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,350
Really?

288
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,160
Let me see.

289
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,560
It has a sweet taste.

290
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,640
But the sweetness

291
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,760
is mixed with a smoky taste.

292
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,000
It's a fly in the ointment.

293
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,800
You don't even need to see it

294
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:23,950
but know it when you smell it.

295
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,920
What is this?

296
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,560
Roasted bees?

297
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:37,040
They are

298
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,190
black bees.

299
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,760
I've eaten its honey before.

300
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,160
The taste lingers.

301
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,710
The honey wine made with it

302
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,470
is much better

303
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,760
than that made with ordinary honey.

304
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,760
But, Heng,

305
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,230
they are already burnt.

306
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:49,950
How do we eat them?

307
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:50,920
Miss Zhu,

308
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,800
can they still be used to make wine?

309
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:53,190
Make honey wine.

310
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,640
You girls

311
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,830
always want to eat.

312
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:57,710
Miss Zhu,

313
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,430
can I have a word with you?

314
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:02,760
So mysterious.

315
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,110
Please.

316
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,000
Let's go.

317
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,350
What is the reason?

318
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm the one from Tianxiang Restaurant.

319
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,680
His Highness and Miss Zhu
have important matters to discuss.

320
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,710
Official Xu

321
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,640
is dead.

322
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,520
Official Xu…

323
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,190
You come here because of black bees,

324
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,230
don't you?

325
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,520
Sure enough, nothing can hide from you.

326
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,280
The bodies of these bees

327
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,280
were found at the residence of a Bei Di person.

328
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,640
They used black bees as a killing weapon

329
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,710
to assassinate Official Xu

330
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,950
and then burned the hive completely.

331
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,230
Official Xu was dead?

332
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,560
Black bees only listen to the queen bee's orders.

333
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,040
Have they really been tamed by humans?

334
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,400
Xu Ruoxu, Official Xu's son is just the one

335
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:03,800
who can destroy Bei Di in ten years

336
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,520
in the prophecy.

337
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,000
Official Xu used his body as bait,

338
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,470
making Bei Di people believe

339
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:10,800
the assassination was successful.

340
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,800
This protects not only Xu Ruoxu

341
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:15,800
but also the talent
who can defend Da Liang.

342
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,830
Xu Ruoxu?

343
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,680
That brat?

344
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,830
How could he defend Da Liang?

345
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,230
The god of destiny makes a fool of people.

346
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,190
Xu Ruoxu accidentally lost his father

347
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,640
and saved the black bee that killed his father.

348
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,000
Saving the black bee that killed his father

349
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,560
is what he can do.

350
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:38,680
But

351
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,560
this can be the key to breaking the secrets
of black bees.

352
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,800
You mean…

353
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,430
Xu Ruoxu always gets close to beasts

354
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,800
and now he has saved the guy
who killed his father.

355
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
This is a good chance

356
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,070
to learn about black bees.

357
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:56,640
The so-called all things feed on each other.

358
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,560
What goes around comes around.

359
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,560
Official Xu sacrificed himself

360
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,950
but protected

361
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,880
the one who can destroy Bei Di 10 years later.

362
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,230
It makes sense.

363
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,400
Actually, it's all my fault.

364
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,590
I could tell something was wrong with Official Xu.

365
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,190
I was too lazy to help him.

366
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,230
If I had done it earlier,

367
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,470
he wouldn't die.

368
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,560
Xu Ruoxu would not lose his father.

369
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:22,800
Just like you said,

370
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,830
everything happens by coincidence.

371
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:26,920
In the unseen world, everything has been arranged.

372
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:29,280
Heng,

373
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,680
I appreciate you more and more.

374
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,560
Then join me in the fight against Bei Di.

375
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,100
Are you okay, Ling?

376
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,110
Let me try it again.

377
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:21,710
Oh my.

378
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,070
You're a beast.

379
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:25,680
Oh, no.

380
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,350
My father was a beast hunter.

381
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,280
If he finds you.

382
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:28,950
you'll be in danger.

383
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,560
Go!

384
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,340
Let's go.

385
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:44,110
Come on.

386
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,680
That is the killer.

387
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,520
Why don't we get him?

388
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,590
His Highness has his own plan.

389
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,560
This is not the time.

390
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,520
Follow them.

391
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:07,920
Got it.

392
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,640
Miss Zhu.

393
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,470
What are you doing?

394
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,640
This is my new dish,

395
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,470
Bee Soup.

396
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,280
They are little wontons, aren't they?

397
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,710
How is it possible?

398
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,160
They are much smaller than wontons.

399
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,950
Don't you think they look like black bees?

400
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,710
This kind of small pasta

401
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,070
is particular about heat control,

402
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,190
so the taste can be mellow.

403
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:05,830
But now these are only semi-finished products.

404
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,040
It just needs the bee venom.

405
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,110
What a pity.

406
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,190
Black bees were all dead at the scene.

407
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:15,000
Official Xu died because of this.

408
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,190
But you are so excited

409
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,310
to make Bee Soup here.

410
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,950
You even don't have any expression.

411
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,070
Qing,

412
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:25,880
I've seen too much life and death.

413
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,000
People come and go.

414
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,040
I got used to it a long time ago.

415
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,000
If I express my sadness

416
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,180
for each death,

417
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,110
then I have to sign with emotion every day.

418
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,520
Each person has his own destiny.

419
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,280
What's the use of sadness?

420
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,040
But what should Xu Ruoxu do?

421
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,800
I have run out of my money.

422
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,280
What can I do?

423
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,680
Go home?

424
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,680
No, I can't go home.

425
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,040
Ling is with me.

426
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
If I go home and get caught by my father,

427
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,350
then who will take care of him?

428
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,040
Mr. Lu,

429
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:17,400
Tianxiang Restaurant is just ahead.

430
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,830
Is it time to take action?

431
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,190
Let's go separately and surround them.

432
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:20,680
Got it.

433
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,760
But I'm hungry.

434
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,520
Ling must be hungry too.

435
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,160
How can I buy food without money?

436
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:30,760
Stop!

437
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,760
Just surrender.

438
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,350
Run.

439
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,070
Mr. Lu,

440
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,470
let's move forward to look for them.

441
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,520
Go and see.

442
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,760
It smells good.

443
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,950
I know where we can find food.

444
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:15,710
And we don't have to pay, either.

445
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:16,400
Let's go.

446
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:19,950
Be careful.

447
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:43,040
Come on! Come on!

448
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,190
It's yummy.

449
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:00,920
You take a bite, too.

450
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,230
Xu Ruoxu!

451
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,000
All right, you brat.

452
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:14,560
How dare you come to my place to steal food?

453
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,400
Are you…

454
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,880
It's so good.

455
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,800
Put it down.

456
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,640
Don't hurt her.

457
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,880
Xu Ruoxu,

458
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,880
you're an intellectual, anyway.

459
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:39,640
What will you do

460
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,830
about the theft?

461
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,280
We're really hungry.

462
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,190
We have no choice.

463
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,830
Sorry, Miss Zhu.

464
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,160
I'll pay you.

465
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:48,830
Pay me?

466
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,190
With what?

467
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,070
Do you have money?

468
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:57,070
How about this?

469
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,590
You two

470
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
stay at my restaurant to work for me.

471
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,230
Do we get paid?

472
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:04,560
What do you think?

473
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,310
To take without telling others is theft.

474
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,430
No matter what you ask us to do,

475
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:14,920
we should do that.

476
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,520
You are worth teaching.

477
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:32,800
Ling.

478
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:34,110
Miss Zhu said

479
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,160
she needs your bee venom.

480
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,950
Could you squeeze her a little?

481
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,280
Ling,

482
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,680
Miss Zhu said

483
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,230
the more, the better.

484
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,230
The more, the better.

485
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:05,140
[Zhu]

486
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,710
Why not?

487
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:16,110
You know what?

488
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:17,590
If I add one drop of bee venom to it,

489
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:18,760
the soup is tasteless.

490
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,110
Two drops

491
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,560
will make it more delicious.

492
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:22,920
Three drops

493
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,920
will make diners get their tongues numb

494
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,800
and stop breathing.

495
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,950
Between the dish and death

496
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:30,470
is only a drop of bee venom away.

497
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,710
Isn't that funny?

498
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,880
But once it gets out,

499
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,950
it'll scare away all the guests.

500
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,350
Wrong.

501
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,040
It's the opposite.

502
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,760
Qing, let me ask you something.

503
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,040
Do you know

504
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,430
how many people die of this puffer fish venom
every year?

505
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,430
I don't know.

506
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,040
Then do you know

507
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,310
why more people

508
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,230
are willing to bet on their lives to try?

509
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,110
I don't know, either.

510
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:52,950
In this world,

511
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,590
only things

512
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,000
that people take higher risks to get

513
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,280
are fascinating.

514
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,880
Like these wontons.

515
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,110
They look like eggs,

516
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,590
representing the chaos of heaven and earth.

517
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,350
It has endured ever since it appeared.

518
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,710
But people often get them wrong

519
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,470
and think it is just

520
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,830
an ordinary dish.

521
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,280
In fact…

522
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:12,280
Brat,

523
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,350
tell Qing

524
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,520
about the fillings

525
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
of my Bee Soup.

526
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,590
Shrimps, egg yolks, and fish.

527
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:21,400
Let me tell you.

528
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Do you remember

529
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,110
the mountain-sized red ray

530
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,470
that we used to catch at sea?

531
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,800
It slept for too long.

532
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,040
Mountains and trees have already grown
on its back.

533
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:31,920
I spent three days and three nights

534
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,110
to capture it

535
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:35,110
but only took a piece of flesh from its belly.

536
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,710
It's only about ten catties in total.

537
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,350
So I made this filling with it.

538
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:40,040
I worked so hard.

539
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,590
How can they enjoy it for nothing?

540
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,280
I just let them know

541
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,760
every bite they eat

542
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,880
are living things

543
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,760
that grow up through days and nights

544
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,830
and countless years.

545
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,310
It's a taste of the world.

546
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,590
How can they not

547
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,710
take a little risk?

548
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,110
This is absurd.

549
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,280
Qing, trust me.

550
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,470
No one will ever die because of this.

551
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,070
This bee venom is strong.

552
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,110
I have tried it myself.

553
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:08,100
If people don't eat too much,

554
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,040
they may faint,

555
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,230
but not die.

556
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:10,470
But…

557
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,110
You make it well.

558
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:18,560
Fine.

559
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,070
Now it seems

560
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,070
no matter what she taught you,

561
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,400
at least you won't starve in the future.

562
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:28,430
Ling.

563
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,400
Do you like the smell of Bee Soup?

564
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,830
You like it.

565
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,400
Say, I.

566
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,560
I like it.

567
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:39,470
I…

568
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,110
like it.

569
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,110
No, no, no.

570
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,110
You follow me.

571
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,110
I.

572
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,520
I like it.

573
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,680
I…

574
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,040
I…

575
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,160
Like it.

576
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,760
He finally can speak I.

577
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,040
Ling, you're so great.

578
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,640
Ling, come back.

579
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,600
Ling, come back.

580
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,360
Ling.

581
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,560
Ling, come back.

582
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,520
Ling.

583
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:17,080
Come back.

584
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,190
Ling, come back.

585
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,000
Ling, come back.

586
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,390
Ling.

587
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,390
Come back.

588
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,390
Ling.

589
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,710
Come back.

590
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,520
What happened to you?

591
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,120
Ling!

592
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:49,000
Be careful.

593
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,080
Ling, don't hurt anybody.

594
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:56,430
Ling!

595
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,390
Don't hurt anybody.

596
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,390
Ling!

597
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,470
Don't hurt anybody.

598
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,120
Come back, Ling.

599
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:04,760
Ling!

600
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:05,870
Ling!

601
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,120
Come back.

602
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,600
Ling!

603
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,080
Ling!

604
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,560
Don't hurt anybody.

605
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,040
Come back.

606
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,600
My boy…

607
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,760
Xu…

608
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:24,800
Ruoxu…

609
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,840
Ling is out of control.

610
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,280
You always nag

611
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,560
drinking is harmful to health.

612
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,150
Why would you drink today?

613
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,600
A non-drinker buys wine.

614
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,040
You must be deceived.

615
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,710
This wine is spicy and strong.

616
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:57,040
Are you okay?

617
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:01,000
I just feel bad when I see Xu Ruoxu.

618
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:02,710
He doesn't know yet

619
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,840
his father's death.

620
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:05,840
I don't know how to tell him.

621
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,870
What if I told you

622
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,390
the man who killed his father

623
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,630
is the one

624
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,470
whom he treated as his buddy?

625
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
How do you know?

626
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,230
Who am I?

627
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,230
That Bei Di boy

628
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,760
is a black bee.

629
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,150
Official Xu

630
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,360
died of his bee venom.

631
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:27,950
Now that you know it,

632
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,190
why didn't you ask the Inspection Department

633
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,950
to arrest him?

634
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:32,950
Making that black bee stay here

635
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,760
is also the meaning of Prince of Langya.

636
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,190
What?

637
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,870
Between you and that Prince of Langya,

638
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:42,120
how many things are you hiding from me?

639
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:44,000
Why are you so excited?

640
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,870
As the accountant of Tianxiang Restaurant,

641
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,630
there is something that I don't know.

642
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,520
There are many things you don't know
about this restaurant.

643
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,080
You…

644
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,080
Okay.

645
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,000
Then I'll go to bed.

646
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:55,470
Come back.

647
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,840
Didn't you say you wanted to drink with me?

648
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,710
I feel your distrust.

649
00:36:58,710 --> 00:36:59,670
I can't go on.

650
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,360
Come back.

651
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,390
I'll tell you a secret.

652
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:04,470
Really?

653
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,470
Sit down.

654
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,040
What secret?

655
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,760
About the black bees.

656
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,950
Black bees roar out to hunt in the daytime

657
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:18,080
and return home at night.

658
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,360
They are large in number,

659
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,280
but act like one.

660
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,080
They concentrate on repairing the hive

661
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,000
and hatch young bees.

662
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,470
Finally, the strongest bee

663
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,800
has self-awareness.

664
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:30,600
It

665
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,080
has wisdom.

666
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,230
What I have to do

667
00:37:40,950 --> 00:37:42,870
is to trigger Ling's self-awareness

668
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,150
and ask him to lead the swarm

669
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,360
to fight against the people who tamed them.

670
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,630
What will happen to them at last?

671
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,670
Death.

672
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,080
Is there no other way?

673
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,630
The strong are the king
and the weak are abandoned.

674
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,230
This is how the black bees live.

675
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:01,120
Even if they are driven by humans

676
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,800
to kill people,

677
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,230
they will still be abandoned.

678
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,760
Displaced beasts.

679
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,390
Miserable beasts.

680
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,710
What can we do

681
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,630
to send them back?

682
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,630
Go back to where?

683
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,320
Where they came from.

684
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,670
They can't.

685
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:24,950
The Portal

686
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:26,710
is a gateway between two worlds.

687
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,190
But it's been cut off.

688
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,390
Is there any way to open it?

689
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:12,710
What happened to you?

690
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,560
It's all my fault.

691
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,190
I bought bad wine

692
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,000
that made you like this.

693
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,080
Forget it. Forget it.

694
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,080
No more drinking. No more drinking.

695
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:31,800
Dragon's blood.

696
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,230
Only the Dragon's blood

697
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,630
can open the Portal.

698
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,470
But no one can get it.

699
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,360
So, Qing,

700
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,760
give up on it.

701
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,230
You are really moody.

702
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:47,710
You freaked me out.

703
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,470
But

704
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,910
how should we tell Xu Ruoxu

705
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
about his father's death?

706
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,120
Someday he'll know.

707
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,600
Ans he will slowly accept it.

708
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,120
People will grow up

709
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,470
after experiencing birth, old age, sickness, and death.

710
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,150
Qing,

711
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,150
who the hell are you?

712
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,760
Where are you from?

713
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,390
We have been together for so long.

714
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,390
But I still don't know you.

715
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,630
And you don't understand me, either.

716
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,280
I kept you here

717
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,360
probably because I'm so lonely.

718
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:10,390
Lotus,

719
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,520
you sealed the Dragon's blood

720
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,840
on my chest,

721
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,950
but gave the Xu family this picture

722
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,190
that can identify beasts.

723
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,870
