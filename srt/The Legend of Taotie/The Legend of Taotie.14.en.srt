[The Legend of TAOTIE]

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,080
[Episode 14]

23
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,360
Legends of the dragon

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
are recorded in a book

25
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,960
called Mei Sheng's Encounter
with an Immortal.

26
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,160
Since it's documented in a book,

27
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,190
it's definitely not a baseless tale

28
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,960
but a true story.

29
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,360
That being the case,

30
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,470
Qing,

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,880
didn't you say

32
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,390
you'd make me happy every day?

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,830
I want to read

34
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,800
Mei Sheng's Encounter with an Immortal.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,080
Find it for me.

36
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,110
Find the book?

37
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,160
No problem.

38
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,160
Easier than finding a beast for you.

39
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,750
Leave it to me.

40
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,830
Listen to this one.

41
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,390
The book says

42
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:05,000
Mei Sheng met a divine dragon
at Duiying Bridge.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,630
The two of them
hit it off at first sight

44
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,470
and talked about poetry
and wine culture,

45
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,630
paintings,

46
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,880
and then the various snacks

47
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,600
they had eaten.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,270
They felt as if they were old friends.

49
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:16,910
Let me see, let me see.

50
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,030
The book is upside down.

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,080
Not only are you illiterate,

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,630
you even took the wrong book.

53
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,800
It's in Miss Zhu's hands.

54
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:26,800
Chunjiu,

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,190
you don't read at all.

56
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,720
Why pretend that you can read?

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,670
It's Mr. Chang Qing's fault.

58
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,000
When he drew us out,

59
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,320
he forgot to draw us as literate people.

60
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,960
Right.

61
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,630
Now you blame me?

62
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,110
Who is born knowing

63
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,030
how to read and write?

64
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,600
Exactly.

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,270
So

66
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,800
you all need to read more.

67
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,670
You just didn't read enough.

68
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,670
All you know is eat.

69
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,030
Exactly.

70
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,550
Miss Zhu eats too.

71
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,880
That's not the same.

72
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,080
Miss Zhu.

73
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,240
Did Mei Sheng

74
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:53,320
really meet a dragon?

75
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,830
When Mei Sheng met the divine dragon,

76
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,670
I was there too.

77
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,880
The moon is so round.

78
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,720
It looks like a coconut rice cake.

79
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,510
Right.

80
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,550
Probably one filled with red bean paste.

81
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,320
Who?

82
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,040
Who's talking?

83
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,200
Come out quickly.

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,550
I've been craving this

85
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,110
coconut rice cake
with red bean paste filling.

86
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,350
I didn't expect to meet a soulmate

87
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,600
in the wilderness.

88
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:33,160
Where are you? Come out quickly.

89
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:34,830
Hello?

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,200
Fate brought us together.

91
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,600
So let's have a drink then.

92
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,550
It smells so good.

93
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,160
Such a nice rice wine.

94
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,550
Does it have a name?

95
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,880
This is my homemade peach blossom wine.

96
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:50,830
If you like it,

97
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,600
I'll give you all of it.

98
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,270
Good wine, good wine.

99
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:20,440
It's you.

100
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,790
It's you.

101
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,830
Such fine wine, with such a moon.

102
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,440
Though it chills to the bone,

103
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
it makes me long for

104
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,670
the pastry I ate at the banquet

105
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,350
of Queen Mother of the West.

106
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:35,440
The taste of it

107
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,160
truly is unforgettable.

108
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,480
What kind of pastry is it?

109
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,720
What's its name? How is it made?

110
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,070
Why the hurry?

111
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,480
You've given me such fine wine.

112
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:47,040
What harm is there
in telling you the recipe?

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,760
This pastry is called

114
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,510
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

115
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,070
Heaven and Earth in Spring?

116
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,830
But the recipe from the immortals
uses special ingredients.

117
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,160
It's hard to find them
in the mortal world.

118
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,950
So what if I can't find them?

119
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:04,230
You can always go with me

120
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,760
to search them.

121
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,510
I won't leave here.

122
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,110
Why not?

123
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,230
Don't ask.

124
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,390
I just can't leave.

125
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,670
What a pity.

126
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,790
For the world's good food

127
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,550
and for Heaven and Earth in Spring.

128
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,110
You...

129
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:24,720
Where did you go?

130
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,160
Someone is here.

131
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,600
I've lived my whole life

132
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,880
for what?

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,270
Like this river

134
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,000
in the darkness,

135
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,830
so dark, so cold,

136
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,670
without any trace of life.

137
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,200
If I were to merge with you,

138
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,230
let the cold river swallow me

139
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:48,920
so I could forever sleep in the abyss.

140
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,510
Perhaps this is the best ending.

141
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:57,160
Who can hear my voice?

142
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,550
Who would want to hear my voice?

143
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,040
Wait a moment.

144
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,390
I've heard it.

145
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,830
Wait a moment, Miss Zhu.

146
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,480
What is it?

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,880
Let her continue.

148
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,320
I think

149
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,510
this doesn't sound very logical.

150
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,480
Exactly.

151
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:24,070
With Miss Zhu's character,

152
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,760
she must have made
Heaven and Earth in Spring

153
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,640
right after she heard about it.

154
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,390
Why wait for Mei Sheng to appear?

155
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:30,920
Exactly.

156
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,950
She can't possibly make pastries.

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,320
If she could,

158
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,510
she wouldn't have made me stand in line

159
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:36,440
at Xunfang Resto

160
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,070
to buy those expensive rose cakes.

161
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,510
Who said I can't make them?

162
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,200
Are you questioning my cooking skills?

163
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,350
Qing.

164
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,200
Really?

165
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,600
If you could,

166
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,790
why I've never seen you make any?

167
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,600
You have not yet made

168
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,920
the simplest sticky rice balls.

169
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:53,000
I haven't made sticky rice balls

170
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,790
because

171
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,760
I'm not good at shaping them.

172
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,110
Why are you laughing?

173
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:00,950
Hurry up and leave.

174
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,600
I'm going to sleep now.

175
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,350
Move quickly, hurry up.

176
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,640
After reading books all night,

177
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,440
I'm tired now.

178
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:09,510
Rest early.

179
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,600
You all go ahead.

180
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,400
Rest early.

181
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,670
Lotus.

182
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,440
Actually, the green dumplings you made

183
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,550
aren't that good.

184
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,790
That's why I never make pastries.

185
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,230
As soon as I shape a dumpling,

186
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,320
I think of how clumsy you are.

187
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:06,760
Lotus.

188
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,790
Lotus.

189
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,710
Lotus.

190
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,760
Lotus!

191
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,880
It's been 500 years.

192
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,790
It's been 500 years.

193
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,230
Miss Zhu.

194
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,670
Miss Zhu.

195
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:48,760
Look.

196
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,110
I've found two more versions

197
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:51,590
of Mei Sheng's story.

198
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,640
What's so unusual about his story?

199
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,350
Back when we went
to his stall to buy pastries,

200
00:11:57,710 --> 00:11:58,640
we were quite happy.

201
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,150
We?

202
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,640
Who else was there?

203
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Did I say "we"?

204
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:07,680
You did.

205
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,880
A friend, I suppose.

206
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,190
I can't remember.

207
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,480
Then listen to these two versions.

208
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,240
See which ending feels more real.

209
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:16,950
Go ahead.

210
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,920
This version says

211
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,390
Mei Sheng spent his whole life

212
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,320
trying to gather the materials
for Heaven and Earth in Spring

213
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,070
and wasted decades of time.

214
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,390
What about the other version?

215
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,920
Is it Records of Beasts in the Continent

216
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,920
written by Official Xu?

217
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,120
That's right.

218
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,590
He wrote,

219
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,800
"Mei Sheng built a stone house
by the bridge

220
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,560
and settled there.

221
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,920
He tried using local materials

222
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,240
to replace the immortal materials,

223
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,390
but what he made

224
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,950
always lacked that certain flavor."

225
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,630
One day, he asked me

226
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,590
about the third layer of filling.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,390
He wondered whether
to replace it with mint

228
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,190
or with calamus.

229
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,480
How do you know this?

230
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,680
I told you already.

231
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,880
I know Mei Sheng.

232
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:08,710
The next day,
Mei Sheng packed up his bag

233
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,070
and said to the voice under the bridge,

234
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,800
"I'll go back to my hometown
to ask my parents.

235
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
If they don't know,

236
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:16,150
I'll ask all pastry chefs in the capital

237
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,270
in order to find

238
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,590
a perfect ingredient

239
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,040
to make Heaven and Earth in Spring."

240
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,240
Unexpectedly,

241
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,150
this journey lasted 500 years.

242
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:31,920
That person

243
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:34,360
never returned.

244
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:36,830
Maybe

245
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,440
Mei Sheng has
already forgotten this promise

246
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,000
and became a heartless person.

247
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,830
He won't.

248
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,510
Mei Sheng won't do that.

249
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,920
The promise he made with the dragon

250
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,590
will definitely be fulfilled.

251
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,440
I

252
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,750
am just a useless scholar,

253
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,120
taking exams

254
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,710
but failing every year.

255
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,120
Since you're not cut out for studying,

256
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,750
stop it.

257
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,190
Do what you want to do.

258
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,480
The world is vast,

259
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,710
there are many things to enjoy.

260
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,560
You're right.

261
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,750
For example, do you love food?

262
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,510
I love food.

263
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:20,590
By the way,

264
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,560
my ancestors

265
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,360
were pastry makers.

266
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,000
Pastry makers?

267
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:27,950
Don't die just yet.

268
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,750
Make some for me to eat.

269
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,360
Calm down, calm down.

270
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:31,830
Miss,

271
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:34,150
I've made up my mind.

272
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,440
In this world,

273
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,800
there is no one I care about anymore.

274
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,440
I'm no different from being dead.

275
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:41,630
I might as well die.

276
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,150
That's true.

277
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:46,920
Your words

278
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,950
remind me of a story.

279
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
How about I tell you?

280
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,150
Once upon a time,
there was a greedy creature in heaven

281
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,070
who was born with a passion for food

282
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,360
and loved to travel far and wide.

283
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,270
The greatest meaning of life for him

284
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,710
was to travel the world

285
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,240
and eat all the food.

286
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,070
But because of his greed,
he was cast down to the mortal world

287
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,120
and imprisoned here.

288
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,880
He was once a dragon
who could roam the heavens,

289
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:14,320
but was deprived of his freedom,

290
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,390
confined to a small pool.

291
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,150
No wonder you can't leave here.

292
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,040
I'm trapped here now,

293
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,510
worse than being a shrimp or crab.

294
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,950
I'm unable to taste any delicious food.

295
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,040
How can you leave here?

296
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,000
How can you regain your freedom?

297
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,560
I am sealed here.

298
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:38,440
To leave this place,

299
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:40,390
I must obtain a human soul

300
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,560
and the person
must willingly offer it to me.

301
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,120
If you truly want a human soul,

302
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,000
take mine.

303
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,560
You are willing?

304
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,830
We are both suffering souls.

305
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,390
If I help you,

306
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
it will not be in vain for me
to have come to this world.

307
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,270
Come, take it.

308
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,390
Don't regret it.

309
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,040
I never break my word.

310
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,560
Wait, wait, wait!

311
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,680
Are you guys

312
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,070
serious?

313
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,720
Am I still alive?

314
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,390
I have returned the soul to you.

315
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,390
After getting your soul, I realized

316
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,560
the true meaning of this seal was not

317
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,040
to take human souls

318
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,390
but to get someone's dedication.

319
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,800
Since you are willing to help others,

320
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,920
how about helping me with something?

321
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,110
Please tell me.

322
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:37,230
There is a pastry

323
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,840
called Heaven and Earth in Spring.

324
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,390
Could you make it for me to eat?

325
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,110
Alright.

326
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,150
I will definitely make it for you.

327
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,320
I will

328
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,350
bring you
the Heaven and Earth in Spring.

329
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,720
Wait here for me.

330
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:18,510
Since Mei Sheng has
made up his mind to die

331
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,390
and leave the mortal world,

332
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:22,680
why did he agree to help the dragon

333
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,720
to find the recipe
for Heaven and Earth in Spring?

334
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,390
Because after that,

335
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,800
Mei Sheng had someone to care about.

336
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
Wherever he went,

337
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,870
he would always remember

338
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,230
the person waiting for him

339
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,230
under Duiying Bridge.

340
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,510
He found the courage
and motivation to live.

341
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,920
But he broke his promise

342
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,630
and never returned.

343
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,270
The dragon kept waiting

344
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:00,200
for 500 years.

345
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,320
The second year after Mei Sheng left,

346
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Black Qilin King led his army rampaging,

347
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,040
causing havoc among the people.

348
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:11,080
The world was in chaos.

349
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,560
I don't know what happened

350
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,110
to Mei Sheng.

351
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,200
I only know

352
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,800
that foolish dragon

353
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,870
has been trapped under the bridge.

354
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
He knows nothing
about what happened to the world.

355
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,720
He just keeps waiting

356
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,080
for someone who will never return

357
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,720
for 500 years.

358
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,350
Miss Zhu.

359
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,470
Miss Zhu.

360
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,560
What?

361
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:58,990
Did you tell the dragon

362
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,350
that Mei Sheng will never return

363
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,320
and that he should stop waiting?

364
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,270
It's been 500 years.

365
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,720
The dragon's eyes can no longer see.

366
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,560
Yesterday, we went to find him.

367
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,870
I spoke to him,

368
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,510
but he didn't show up

369
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,110
I poured the peach blossom wine
into the pool

370
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,270
and he didn't drink it.

371
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
This foolish dragon

372
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
must be both blind and deaf now,

373
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,920
not being able to smell the wine.

374
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,870
Probably his nose is also useless.

375
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,270
Even so,

376
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:31,720
he still foolishly waits
for Heaven and Earth in Spring.

377
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:33,840
Miss Zhu,

378
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,150
come up with a solution.

379
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,350
You're so capable.

380
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,720
You must be able to make
Heaven and Earth in Spring

381
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,720
to fulfill the dragon's wish.

382
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,630
You don't understand.

383
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,800
He has this promise,

384
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,230
and is waiting only for Mei Sheng.

385
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,200
If Mei Sheng hadn't broken his promise,

386
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,560
he would have passed this down
through generations.

387
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:53,960
Someone will fulfill the promise.

388
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:57,560
Qing.

389
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,320
Now, Mei Sheng's successor has arrived,

390
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,720
but it's just a little child.

391
00:21:04,990 --> 00:21:05,600
Who knows

392
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,680
if he can make
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

393
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,840
Mei Sheng has a successor?

394
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,990
I think

395
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,560
no one remembers this legend anymore.

396
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,440
So

397
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:15,870
everyone thinks

398
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,040
Mei Sheng's Encounter with an Immortal
is just a story.

399
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,110
Even the disciples of Mei's Pastry

400
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,390
don't try to make it.

401
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,230
Only that silly little child

402
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,720
believes that dragons
exist in this world.

403
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,200
Only he

404
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,470
foolishly throws the green dumplings

405
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,110
into the bottom of the bridge.

406
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,560
It seems the rumor
about the dragon causing a drought

407
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,270
is true.

408
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,110
I must report to Father immediately.

409
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,750
Your Highness.

410
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,080
His Majesty dislikes discussing beasts.

411
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,440
And it's his birthday banquet.

412
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:04,320
Let's not anger him now.

413
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,870
True.

414
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,320
It seems that now

415
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,960
only discussing with Miss Zhu

416
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,920
is the most appropriate.

417
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,510
It's a pity that Tianxiang Restaurant

418
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:15,110
has been closed for a long time.

419

421
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,920
My elder brother
specially returned to Yunlong

422
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,800
to celebrate your birthday.

423
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:03,750
By the way,

424
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,800
you said after the banquet,

425
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,750
you have something important
to report to me.

426
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,230
Tell me now.

427
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,800
Father.

428
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,230
I have specially prepared
a birthday gift for you.

429
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,750
It was inconvenient to present it
during the banquet.

430
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,630
Now I present it to you.

431
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,200
Father.

432
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,630
I searched for rare materials

433
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,630
and invited a famous chef
to make this dish.

434
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,630
I hope you like it, Father.

435
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,470
Your Majesty.

436
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:10,680
Father.

437
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,510
My elder brother traveled a long way

438
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,110
to bring you the gift from Wuxia.

439
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,440
It must be very precious.

440
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,110
Why not try it?

441
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,750
What is this?

442
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:29,920
Father,

443
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,750
this dish is called Paw Bead.

444
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:34,470
Eating it can prolong life.

445
00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:35,840
It is very beneficial to you.

446
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,150
I hope you can take it soon, Father.

447
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:47,560
I don't need

448
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,680
this foul thing.

449
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,870
Take it away.

450
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:53,080
Father.

451
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:55,040
This dish is truly rare.

452
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,750
You must take it.

453
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:58,870
Your Majesty.

454
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,230
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

455
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,600
Alright.

456
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,510
Since it's a rare dish,

457
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,440
I will grant you to eat it.

458
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,470
Eat it yourself.

459
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,390

461
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,040
What?

462
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,320
Are you defying my order?

463
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:32,600
I will take it.

464
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,630
Miss Zhu, what does this mean?

465
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,840
The effects of Paw Bead
need no further explanation.

466
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,200
I know there's an important person
in your heart.

467
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,720
You should give it to him.

468
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,470
It can make the person
who delivers the medicine

469
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,150
become the pearl in the palm
of the one who takes it.

475

don't want to see you.

476

Father.

477
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,600
I have one more thing to report.

478
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,080
There has been a severe drought
around Wuxia recently.

479
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,470
The crops have failed

480
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,600
and there are many victims.

481
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,990
I hope you will issue an order

482
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,350
to open the granaries
and distribute food

483
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,750
to aid the disaster victims.

484
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,800
You ungrateful child!

485
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,600
I ordered you to govern Wuxia

486
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,630
and now you say the disaster is severe?

487
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,800
How are you fit
to be the Prince of Langya?

488

to prison to reflect on his actions.

What are you waiting for?

492
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,390

493
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:38,080
Yes.

494
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,200

of the Paw Bead?

It's nothing special.

509
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,440

569
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,350
Why is it that

570
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:32,600
no one is buying snacks here?

571
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,680
How are you managing it?

572
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,110
Miss Ji,

573
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,870
this isn't my fault.

574
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,270
Recently, everyone

575
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,750
is going to a stall on East Street
to buy green dumplings.

576
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,470
I heard there's a long line there.

577
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,600
Look,

578
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,150
they've taken away

579
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:48,270
our business.

580
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,870
I've got to see

581
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,230
who exactly is behind this.

582
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,320
[Pastry]

583
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,840
Thank you.

584
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:57,350
Take care.

585
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:58,680
Give me one.

586
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,080
Okay.

587
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,200
Thank you.

588
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,200
Take care.

589
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:11,680
How many would you like?

590
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:12,720
One will be fine.

591
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,270
Alright.

592
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:16,200
Take care.

593
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,150
Give me four.

594
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,040
Okay.

595
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:22,750
This person,

596
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,720
how dare you cut in line?

597
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:25,870
I thought it was someone else
making green dumplings here.

598
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,320
Turns out it's my little junior.

599
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,350
Senior.

600
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,440
Since we've met today,

601
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,750
I want to ask you.

602
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,320
Red Plum Umbrella and Xunfang Manual

603
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:39,350
record hundreds of ways
to make pastries.

604
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,200
But you

605
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,470
only make this green dumpling.

606
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,200
In this case,

607
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,750
why don't you just give me
Xunfang Manual?

608
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,750
Everyone.

609
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,600
I have family matters to take care of.

610
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,800
My shop will be closed for the day.

611
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,600
Please come back tomorrow.

612
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,510
Sorry.

613
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,320
Sorry.

614
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,080
Senior.

615
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:11,360
Please.

616
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:19,440
[Tablet of Master Min]

617
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:22,080
It's been many years, Senior.

618
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,640
You didn't ask where Master is,

619
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,270
but only care about the Red Plum Umbrella
and the Xunfang Manual.

620
00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:31,510
When you left the mountain,
you took the Dragon Scale Arrow.

621
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,510
Isn't that enough?

622
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:37,510
My foolish junior.

623
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:39,840
Do you really believe what Master said

624
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:41,600
and want to make
Heaven and Earth in Spring

625
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,560
to feed a dragon?

626
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,600
There's nothing

627
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,670
under that bridge.

628
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,160
There's a dragon under the bridge.

629
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,270
Have you ever seen it?

630
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:52,750
I heard the roar of a dragon
when I was six.

631
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,560
Mei Sheng's Encounter with an Immortal

632
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,670
and Heaven and Earth in Spring

633
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,230
are just myths
from hundreds of years ago.

634
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,360
Our master

635
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,670
was just using it

636
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,160
as a guise to recruit disciples.

637
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,080
In my opinion,

638
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,430
Junior,

639
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,560
why don't you just lend me
the Xunfang Manual

640
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,190
and let me see if it contains

641
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,800
Heaven and Earth in Spring?

642
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,270
Senior.

643
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,560
Senior.

644
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,800
It's not possible.

645
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,910
Master instructed before his death

646
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,270
that you're no longer his disciple.

647
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,080
I cannot let you see it.

648
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:28,190
I think

649
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,560
you just don't have it.

650
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,230
There's no Xunfang Manual,

651
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,600
no divine dragon,

652
00:35:32,950 --> 00:35:34,230
and no Heaven and Earth in Spring.

653
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,840
There is.

654
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:37,080
I've actually eaten it.

655
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,510
Stone.

656
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,990
You forgot to put your green dumplings

657
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,120
in the steamer.

658
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,120
Hello, Miss Zhu.

659
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:49,160
Isn't this the owner of Xunfang Resto?

660
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,230
I didn't know you were
Stone's old friend.

661
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,750
You didn't buy any green dumplings.

662
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,880
Could it be because

663
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,400
Stone took your business?

664
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,990
You must be joking.

665
00:35:58,470 --> 00:35:59,840
We're just catching up.

666
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Right, Junior?

667
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,230
I think I just heard Xunfang Manual.

668
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:06,080
What does that mean?

669
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:09,990
None of your business.

670
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,120
Miss.

671
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,710
Are you Miss Zhu
from Tianxiang Restaurant?

672
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,510
Don't mind who I am.

673
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,600
Go make green dumplings.

674
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
I'm starving.

675
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,080
No, Miss.

676
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,750
Have you really eaten
Heaven and Earth in Spring?

677
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:26,990
Of course.

678
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:27,880
That's great.

679
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:28,510
Miss.

680
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,910
Can you teach me how to make it?

681
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,470
Heaven and Earth in Spring

682
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:33,950
is for...

683
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,190
Stone.

684
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,510
Do you see that man from the other day?

685
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,160
Don't let him know I'm here.

686
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:42,510
Or he'll be blabbering.

687
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,230
Stone.

688
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:50,670
Did you see Miss Zhu?

689
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,470
She should have gone that way.

690
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,400
That way?

691
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:55,840
Yes.

692
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,160
Go get busy.

693
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,080
Okay, okay.

694
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:05,510
Hurry up.

695
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:19,600
[Tai Chi Hall]

696
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,080
Greetings, Your Majesty.

697
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,320
Wan'er.

698
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,510
Why are you here

699
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,230
instead of resting?

700
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,670
Come, come.

701
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,320
Thank you, Your Majesty.

702
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,510
This time, you saved me.

703
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,510
Thank you.

704
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:50,400
Your Majesty.

705
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:53,640
Have you figured out who did this?

706
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:54,910
Yes.

707
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,190
It was a spy from Bei Di.

708
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,230
By the way,

709
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:02,430
Wan'er,

710
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,990
just focus on recovering.

711
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,320
Don't worry about this anymore.

712
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,230
Your Majesty.

713
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,510
I have come this time

714
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:12,080
to tell you the truth of this matter.

715
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,880
Speak quickly.

716
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,430
Actually, this time

717
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:18,990
I didn't save you.

718
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,600
His Highness told me

719
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,510
you would face a calamity.

720
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,670
The Paw Bead he offered before

721
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,160
has the power to dispel illness
and ward off evil.

722
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,750
That's why he insisted
on having you take it.

723
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,990
After the bead was knocked over,

724
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,880
he wanted to stop the calamity for you.

725
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,510
Unfortunately, he is imprisoned.

726
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,360
So that day,

727
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,470
I appeared there.

728
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,360
Your Majesty.

729
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,160
His Highness
is sincerely devoted to you.

730
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:54,230
Please note that.

731
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,430
Wan'er.

732
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,510
No need to say more about this.

733
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,710
Let me think about it.

734
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:11,600
Your Majesty.

735
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:14,750
Please release the Prince of Langya.

736
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,120
Alright, alright.

737
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,560
I'll give the order now.

738
00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:21,990
Get up, quickly.

739
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,230
Get up.

740
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,080
Thank you, Your Majesty.

741
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,230
Your Highness.

742
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,230
Your Highness.

743
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:36,990
You have suffered.

744
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,400
I'm fine.

745
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,230
Did Father order my release?

746
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,470
Is Father well?

747
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,230
His Majesty is fine.

748
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,470
Don't worry.

749
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:50,950
That's great.

750
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:52,670
Your Grace,

751
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:53,990
luckily, you were there.

752
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,320
You look pale.

753
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:58,990
Your injury...

754
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,840
I'm fine.

755
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,430
Heng.

756
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,120
Your Grace.

757
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,990
I'm glad you're fine.

758
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:28,880
Your Highness.

759
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,400
Just received a pigeon post.

760
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,360
After Miss Zhu ate

761
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,750
the Heaven and Earth in Spring

762
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,080
made by a new pastry chef,

763
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,880
her health has improved.

764
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,030
You can rest assured, Your Highness.

765
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,750
What is Heaven and Earth in Spring?

766
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,790
I'm not sure either.

767
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:47,440
Stop the carriage.

768
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
Let's rest here.

769
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:50,880
Let Mr. Tan come to see me.

770
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:51,600
Yes.

771
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:54,920
Stop.

772
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,990
Mr. Tan.

773
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:56,880
His Highness requests your presence.

774
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:03,750
Your Highness.

775
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,030
Do you know what
Heaven and Earth in Spring is?

776
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,950
In Mei Sheng's Encounter
with an Immortal,

777
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,400
it is recorded.

778
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,510
After Mei Sheng met the dragon,

779
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,600
he promised to make him

780
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,640
a green dumpling called
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

781
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,270
The dragon lingered

782
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,550
just to wait for this green dumpling.

783
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,840
But what power

784
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,510
does the green dumpling have?

785
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:29,080
It is said that the Mei family
has two heirlooms,

786
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:31,030
one is Red Plum Umbrella,

787
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,310
which contains the recipes
for all pastries of the Mei family

788
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,680
and is also a magical artifact
that can capture souls.

789
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:39,400
The second

790
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,470
is the Dragon Scale Arrow
that can kill divine dragons.

791
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:48,790
So, it seems

792
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,160
with this item,
one can subdue the divine dragon

793
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:53,880
and alleviate the drought?

794
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,080
Exactly.

795
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,000
[Pastry]

796
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:09,680
Why isn't Stone here today?

797
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:12,600
Stone.

798
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,510
Stone.

799
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:22,950
How is Stone?

800
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:23,640
Not serious.

801
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,160
It's just that there are no
green dumplings to eat these days.

802
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:37,030
Does it still hurt?

803
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:40,470
Stone.

804
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:41,920
If the Red Plum Umbrella is lost,

805
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,360
we'll just find it.

806
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,790
Crying doesn't help.

807
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,400
I'm almost dying

808
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,200
and I didn't cry.
