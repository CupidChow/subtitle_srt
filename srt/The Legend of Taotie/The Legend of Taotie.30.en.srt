There have always been beasts
in Cangwu Mountain,

for a few people to be eaten.

all end up like this within days.

149
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,790
This is why the caravans
prefer to take a detour

150
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,470
rather than come to Fuyu.

of my coming here.

the demon you're hunting

154
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,350
is the same as the one

00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,470
A weak woman like me

191
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,670
didn't know what to do.

192
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,470
I exhausted all the solutions
I could think of,

193
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,910
whether it was seeking the Taoist
to catch the demon

194
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,110
or using Mr. Liu's influence

195
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:48,150
to host the poetry gathering.

196
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,440
I am an old acquaintance of Mr. Liu.

197
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,000
Mr. Liu is exceptionally talented.

198
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,080
Every year, he hosts
poetry gatherings in various places.

199
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,350
I truly had no choice,

200
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,590
so I boldly invited Mr. Liu

201
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,150
to hold a poetry gathering
in my unlucky place.

202
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,470
It's all my fault.

203
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,000
I clearly knew

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,840
that people keep disappearing
near Yaoguang Sea,

205
00:11:08,230 --> 00:11:09,710
and still delayed closing the inn.

206
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,400
Now everyone is trapped here
because of me.

207
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,080
Hairu,

208
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,000
although it was you
who proposed the poetry gathering,

209
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:17,320
I came voluntarily.

210
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,150
You're not to blame.

211
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:18,880
That's right.

212
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,350
I came here to investigate the case.

213
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,440
Since the origin of these two letters

214
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:25,840
seems unproblematic,

215
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,110
why does this demon fish

216
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,960
kill people?

217
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,000
Mr. Yang.

218
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,000
Taoist.

219
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,910
Why didn't the demon fish choose us

220
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,280
but specifically choose those two?

221
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,840
This Taoist was a fraud.

222
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,710
Carrying so many silver notes,

223
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,640
he must have swindled quite a lot.

224
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,470
And Mr. Yang

225
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,520
kept shouting about
his regrets before his death.

226
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:51,960
He must have done

227
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,640
plenty of wrongs before.

228
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,590
Could it be that
what attracted the demon fish was...

229
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,280
Guilt.

230
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,880
From Archer Tan's description,

231
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,280
this demon is indeed

232
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,670
a Heng Gong fish from Yaoguang Sea.

233
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,080
This fish is sensitive
to human emotions,

234
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,640
and transforms into human form at night.

235
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,110
But it doesn't usually
like to harm people.

236
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,960
But now, somehow

237
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,150
it has tasted

238
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,030
the unique flavor of human guilt.

239
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,550
This is truly irresistible for it.

240
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,230
As long as it transforms

241
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:23,200
into the appearance of someone
its prey feels guilty towards,

242
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,000
it will evoke a blazing

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,470
and radiant guilt to feed on.

244
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:27,960
Everyone,

245
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,790
from now on,

246
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:30,960
be extremely careful.

247
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,400
Don't show even a hint of guilt.

248
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,320
Did Miss Zhu also receive a letter?

249
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,030
Are you suspecting me?

250
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,470
I dare not.

251
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:48,840
It's just that everything

252
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,640
has happened too coincidentally.

253
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,320
Mr. Chang's brush

254
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,520
also broke at just the right time,

255
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:55,150
leaving all of us

256
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,230
trapped desperately in this inn.

257
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,910
Could it be that you

258
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,470
came here just to investigate a case?

259
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:05,400
Can't you explain your insistence

260
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,910
on catching the demon fish?

261
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,470
And the Taoist and Mr. Yang

262
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,320
were harmed by the demon fish

263
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,520
after interacting with you.

264
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,470
Could it be something you said

265
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,400
that triggered their guilt?

266
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,230
Years ago,

267
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,440
I met a wandering charlatan.

268
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,880
I wanted to learn some spells from him,

269
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:26,670
but who would have thought

270
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,910
he cheated me out of all my money.

271
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,440
In the end, I lost my family.

272
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,030
After that,

273
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,840
I became a wandering merchant.

274
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,230
Yes.

275
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:43,080
Although I spoke with the Taoist,

276
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,320
I never interacted with Mr. Yang.

277
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:46,470
Don't forget

278
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:47,840
it was you who first mentioned

279
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,840
Mr. Yang's disloyal and unfilial actions.

280
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,710
Mr. Yang was disloyal and unfilial,

281
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:52,550
forcing his own mother to death

282
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,000
for a promotion.

283
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,320
I've never thought Mr. Yang

284
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,350
had such a past.

285
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:57,470
But Mr. Tan,

286
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,520
how did you learn about this?

287
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,030
I'm a wandering merchant

288
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,320
and have met many people.

289
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,150
Naturally, I heard some rumors.

290
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,400
Earlier, you said

291
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,760
you were a wandering merchant.

292
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,960
But clearly, you are an archer.

293
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,960
I came here to investigate the case.

294
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,710
It's not strange to know more details.

295
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,080
Besides,

296
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,670
I am an archer.

297
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,320
If I truly wanted to kill those two,

298
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,960
would I need the demon fish to do it?

299
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,710
Now I'm trapped in this inn as well.

300
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:28,280
Is it worth it

301
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,200
taking such a big risk?

302
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,440
Perhaps you have another purpose.

303
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:41,150
Listen.

304
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,520
Someone outside
is calling for his mother.

305
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:44,670
Honey,

306
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,840
the demon fish is coming up!

307
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,150
The demon fish is coming to eat me!

308
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,440
It's coming for me!

309
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,350
It's coming for me!

310
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,320
Calm down!

311
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,760
Today is the 15th day of this month.

312
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,030
It's time to hold the poetry gathering.

313
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,400
What poetry gathering?

314
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,520
It'll be good enough
if we can leave here alive.

315
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,880
Though my husband
has lost his poetic inspiration,

316
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,280
I remembered

317
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,110
the scenes of Pingyue House in the past.

318
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,640
How about I take this chance

319
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,150
to perform a dance for everyone?

320
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:15,790
In such a dire situation,

321
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
it's not a bad idea to witness

322
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:20,080
the dance of a famous singer.

323
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:39,400
Wonder if my grief will ever end.

324
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,400
No girl need cry when she's married.

325
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,200
If her husband is a single-hearted man,

326
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,030
who'll not leave her
till her hair is white?

327
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,670
This woman only

328
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,760
exists in the heavens.

329
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,000
Ms. Liu has such a graceful figure.

330
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,470
Though there was no
musical accompaniment,

331
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:50,760
your every move and smile

332
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,080
still captivated souls.

333
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,960
With this dance complete,

334
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,760
did you think of something?

335
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,670
All these years,

336
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,520
you've always been distant with me.

337
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,950
You appear respectful,

338
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,680
but I always feel lacking something.

339
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:15,430
Not until this trip to Yaoguang Sea

340
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,040
did I finally understand,

341
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,040
I am nothing
but the shadow of another woman.

342
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,000
People say I am lucky

343
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,920
to have met Mr. Liu,

344
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:32,230
who didn't care about my background

345
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,310
and treated me with deep affection.

346
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,560
But who knows that, to marry him,

347
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,830
I was cruel enough

348
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,190
to abandon my three-year-old daughter

349
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,390
who was seriously ill?

350
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,720
Here, take this money.

351
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,600
I'm not here for money.

352
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,750
The doctor said
Zhi won't make it through today.

353
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,150
She just wants to see her mother.

354
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:56,750
I'm sorry.

355
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,990
Someone like me

356
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,510
isn't worthy of being Zhi's mother.

357
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
Mr. Liu is my only lifeline.

358
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,680
He must never know I had a child.

359
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,040
I must marry him.

360
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:05,920
I'm sorry.

361
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,080
I'm sorry.

362
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:13,470
Thank you.

363
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:17,920
Mr. Liu.

364
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,200
Liu!

365
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,470
Save me!

366
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,990
Liu, save me!

367
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,600
Liu, save me!

368
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,080
Please save me!

369
00:18:59,150 --> 00:18:59,680
Liu!

370
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,110
Jiuniang!

371
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:05,840
Go! To the second floor!

372
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:11,510
Hurry!

373
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,110
Get inside!

374
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:14,600
Hurry!

375
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,390
Ms. Ji,

376
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,040
is this place safe?

377
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,870
Will the demon fish
bite through the door

378
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,470
and break in?

379
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,150
This is where I store
my account books and silver.

380
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:48,440
The walls and floor

381
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,040
are made of ginkgo wood.

382
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:51,720
I even had it reinforced.

383
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,720
Even if the demon fish has strong teeth,

384
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,960
it definitely can't get in.

385
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,840
Darn it.

386
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,390
In a few hours, it will be dark.

387
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:03,840
And now my brush is broken.

388
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,390
I must catch

389
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,680
this demon fish.

390
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:15,630
If that's the case,

391
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:17,870
let's find a way

392
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,230
to lure the demon fish into a trap.

393
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,840
Mr. Chang, do you have a plan?

394
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,990
This demon fish can transform
into human form at night.

395
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,600
When it gets dark,

396
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,800
one person will stay in the room,

397
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,510
leaving one window open
for the Heng Gong fish.

398
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,270
When it enters through the window,

399
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:54,990
it will definitely transform

400
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,560
into the appearance of someone
that person feels guilty about.

401
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,960
Before that, we can

402
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,630
set a rope loop
on the ground by the window.

403
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:01,680
By then,

404
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,600
Archer Tan will drop
the prepared heavy object

405
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,150
into Yaoguang Sea.

406
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,080
When the heavy object hits the water,

407
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,200
the sea surface will glow
with phosphorescence.

408
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,560
At that time, Ms. Ji,

409
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,110
please use your dressing mirror

410
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,230
to reflect the light onto the fish.

411
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,870
The demon fish, dazzled by the light,

412
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,470
will momentarily be unable
to distinguish day from night

413
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,230
and will instinctively
try to revert to its fish form.

414
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,720
In Records of Beasts in the Continent,

415
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,510
there is a record

416
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,200
that the Henggong fish
is impervious to blades.

417
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,040
Only in the moment
when it is transforming

418
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,960
can it be killed.

419
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,230
I think we can give it a try.

420
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:34,230
If there's a sliver of chance,

421
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,510
we must not miss it.

422
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:36,870
Alright.

423
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,350
Let's split up and take action.

424
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,510
Each of us will prepare the ropes

425
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:40,720
and the copper mirror.

426
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:43,470
Alright.

427
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:56,720
Let's go.

428
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:08,200
I have a clear conscience.

429
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:09,630
It has nothing to do with me.

430
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:11,110
It has nothing to do with me.

431
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:12,840
It has nothing to do with me.

432
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:37,870
Mr. Chang, lend a hand.

433
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,110
How is it?

434
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,920
Is everything ready?

435
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,470
Yes.

436
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:11,440
She should've known

437
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,510
what was coming.

438
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,470
Stop thinking about it.

439
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Go back and prepare quickly.

440
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,230
Let's go.

441
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,080
Go.

442
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,600
Everything is ready.

443
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,920
By then,

444
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:50,840
we'll rely on your Black Vulture Blade.

445
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:51,990
No problem.

446
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,990
I'll take care of the demon fish
as quickly as possible.

447
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,230
But I have one question.

448
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,230
Though your plan is good,

449
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,960
someone has to lure the demon fish.

450
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,230
Who will be the bait?

451
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,720
It has nothing to do with me.

452
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:14,990
It's not related to me.

453
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:16,510
It's not related to me.

454
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,080
It has nothing to do with me.

455
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,110
I've made up my mind.

456
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,960
I will be the bait.

457
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,230
Speaking of guilt,

458
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,150
no one is more suitable than me.

459
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:32,630
No.

460
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:34,440
Qing,

461
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,680
you are seriously injured now.

462
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,960
If you go to lure the demon fish,

463
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,200
even I can't guarantee

464
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,560
your safe escape from danger.

465
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:42,990
I disagree.

466
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,230
Miss Zhu,

467
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,200
only guilt can lure it,

468
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,110
and humans all have guilt.

469
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,040
Actually, toward you,

470
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:55,110
I also feel guilty.

471
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,270
But it will soon be resolved.

472
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,630
Now we are all trapped in this inn

473
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,440
and can't escape.

474
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,230
The demon fish
will come for us sooner or later.

475
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,110
If one day,

476
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,840
we are separated,

477
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,230
you must take care of yourself.

478
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,040
Qing,

479
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:25,150
you still owe me 300 liang of silver.

480
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,470
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

481
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:27,960
It's getting dark.

482
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,350
I'll go cook for everyone.

483
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:30,680
Miss Zhu,

484
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,200
the demon fish is waiting outside.

485
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,390
You absolutely must not go out.

486
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,150
I don't feel guilty about anyone.

487
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:39,390
I'm not afraid of the demon fish.

488
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,630
I promised the beasts

489
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,110
to open the Portal

490
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,440
and send them home.

491
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,350
But I can't bear to harm Miss Zhu.

492
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,920
This is such a betrayal.

493
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,200
Being the demon fish's meal

494
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,560
would at least save everyone else.

495
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,630
But this way,

496
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,320
the time I can stay with Miss Zhu

497
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,270
will be even shorter.

498
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,960
Miss Zhu,

499
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,150
you must take care of yourself.

500
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:13,840
We are about to confront

501
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,680
the Heng Gong fish.

502
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:17,630
Everyone, suppress
your fear and guilt for now.

503
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,080
Let's eat first.

504
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,680
Much appreciated, Miss Zhu.

505
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,270
However,

506
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,040
I really have no appetite to eat.

507
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,990
You haven't seen the world enough.

508
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,800
If you starve to death like this,

509
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,080
won't that be a pity?

510
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,470
That's right, Hairu.

511
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,080
You should eat something.

512
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,080
Unlike me,

513
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,110
I've seen much of the world.

514
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,750
Although Mr. Liu has already

515
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,150
seen the world,

516
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,230
you still don't know the final outcome.

517
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,510
Is that right, Archer Tan?

518
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,150
What exactly do you mean by that?

519
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,800
I feel a bit suffocated.

520
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,230
I'll go get some fresh air.

521
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,510
You all take your time eating.

522
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,390
Kill!

523
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,630
Thank you, Your Highness,for saving me.

524
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,200
I admire your talent.

525
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,990
Are you willing to stand with me,
through thick and thin?

526
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,630
From now on,

527
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,600
there will no longer
be Tan Yilu in this world,

528
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,750
only my shadow archer,

529
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,870
Mr. Tan.

530
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,510
You're the one

531
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,080
who drugged my soup, right?

532
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,390
Why...

533
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,990
Why did you do this?

534
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,920
Was it just to make me the bait?

535
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,080
Mr. Tan,

536
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,200
didn't you come here

537
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,960
to help your prince

538
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,200
find the precious ingredient?

539
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,750
So what if you
have to sacrifice yourself?

540
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,150
Do you think

541
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,990
I would let Qing

542
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,720
become fish food?

543
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,150
You think you can make up

544
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:37,270
a name like Mr. Tan

545
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,990
and I'll obediently fall into your trap?

546
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,630
Ridiculous.

547
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,600
When the Heng Gong fish appears,

548
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,560
the Prince of Langya you saw

549
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
was also my fabrication?

550
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:50,960
Mr. Tan.

551
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,080
Have you forgotten
the purpose of coming here?

552
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,230
There is a type of demon beast

553
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,200
that can gather
the essence of heaven and earth.

554
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,150
Anyone who consumes it can be reborn.

555
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,990
Have you also forgotten

556
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,390
how you survived death?

557
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:05,470
Stop!

558
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,110
It was the Prince of Langya
who granted you rebirth.

559
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,600
Now you've even forgotten him.

560
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,870
Do you know

561
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:16,600
that the Prince of Langya is bedridden,

562
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,560
barely clinging to life?

563
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,750
Does this not evoke

564
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,110
even a shred of guilt in your heart?

565
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:30,790
No rush.

566
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,030
Take your time to recall.

567
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,240
This person merely
frightened a few women.

568
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,120
Moreover, these women are unharmed.

569
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,390
Yet you want to capture him

570
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,240
and sentence him to death.

571
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,270
That's absurd!

572
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:50,390
I will not fail Your Highness's trust.

573
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:52,000
Rise.

574
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,760
Impossible.

575
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:53,840
I...

576
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,480
How could I be Mr. Tan?

577
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,190
Such a treasure exists!

578
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,360
I've been counting the days.

579
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,550
Once it ripens,

580
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,640
I will surely pick it for Your Highness

581
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,760
to consume.

582
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,600
Impossible.

583
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,550
Miss Zhu.

584
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:14,960
What's happening outside?

585
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:17,640
Zhu Chengbi.

586
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,550
Zhu Chengbi!

587
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,640
Explain yourself clearly.

588
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,150
How could I be Mr. Tan?

589
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,510
How could I be Mr. Tan?

590
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:27,910
Fish!

591
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,840
Tan Yilu, watch out!

592
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,390
Qing!

593
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,480
Watch out!

594
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:43,840
Who are you?

595
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,760
Master.

596
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,030
Only two more people are needed now

597
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,640
for the Twin Mushroom to mature.

598
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,550
What does this mean?

599
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,390
Qing.

600
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,270
Master once said

601
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,550
this mission is extraordinary.

602
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,640
You must forget your true identity.

603
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:35,960
My true identity?

604
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,030
Your Highness,

605
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:41,360
don't be deceived by her anymore.

606
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:43,390
My true identity...

607
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:44,670
Your Highness,

608
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,600
your wish will surely be fulfilled.

609
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,960
Everything in this world
can be destroyed by betrayal.

610
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,080
Only the Prince of Langya

611
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,510
must never be abandoned.

612
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,360
I wish to ask you for something.

613
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,670
You've risked your life for me,

614
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,190
I cannot bear it in my heart.

615
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,190
Not to mention just one thing,

616
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,150
even it's a thousand things,

617
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,600
I'll give them all to you.

618
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,920
Your Highness is most generous.

619
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,080
Please, tell me,

620
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,510
what exactly do you need?

621
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,950
An archer badge.

622
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,640
So it seems

623
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,030
you won't even tell me your name.

624
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,640
It's truly strange.

625
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,230
Yesterday, a fierce

626
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,840
little girl with twin buns

627
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,310
broke all my windows.

628
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,510
At her side,

629
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,080
was there a young man?

630
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:38,200
That's right.

631
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,750
That young man looked like a scholar

632
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,640
and was very polite.

633
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,840
My past name doesn't matter.

634
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:48,920
From now on,

635
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,470
my name is Tan Yilu.

636
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:07,750
Why does

637
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,200
a handsome young man like you

638
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,160
wear a mask?

639
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,400
My name is Tan Yilu.

640
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,680
I am an archer from Wuxia City.

641
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,550
From now on,

642
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:21,470
I am your master.

643
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,230
In three days,

644
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,840
go to Fuyu Inn at Yaoguang Sea

645
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,710
and bring this mask to me.

646
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:27,710
Yaoguang Sea?

647
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,950
I don't dare to go.

648
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,470
I won't go.

649
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:40,950
You don't dare to go?

650
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
[50 liang]

651
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,230
The demon fish is causing trouble.

652
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,200
Going there is truly dangerous.

653
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,950
Besides, this little money

654
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,750
is not enough.

655
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:02,880
You...

656
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,470
Since I'm here,

657
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,710
I must have prepared thoroughly.

658
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,750
If I don't know your true identity,

659
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,550
why would I seek you out?

660
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:14,640
You...

661
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,360
What are you saying?

662
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,400
I don't understand.

663
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,310
This mission is extraordinary.

664
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,840
I must take the medicine

665
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,440
to forget my true identity,

666
00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:52,880
and only remember
I'm an ordinary archer.

667
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,030
In three days, bring the mask to me.

668
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:57,840
Upon seeing it,

669
00:36:57,990 --> 00:36:59,360
I will remember everything.

670
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,080
If not for this,

671
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:08,510
how could His Highness
obtain what he desires?

672
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,950
Yes, Master.

673
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,840
Listen to everything I'm saying now

674
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,790
and repeat it to me
when the time comes.

675
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,790
Yes.

676
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,310
The Twin Mushroom
can only parasitize monsters.

677
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,920
It must absorb
the essence of heaven and earth

678
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,840
and take 60 years

679
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,880
to slowly mature.

680
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,550
Now, the Heng Gong fish

681
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,310
only needs to eat two more people

682
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,750
to ripen the mushroom.

683
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,230
Zhu Chengbi.

684
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,510
This time,

685
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,790
you can't stop me.

686
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,440
Master.

687
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,360
Is there anything you need me to do?

688
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,160
Your mission is complete.

689
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:10,440
Thank you.

690
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:15,230
Miss Zhu.

691
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,230
Qing.

692
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:20,920
Qing.

693
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,400
Qing, I'm here.

694
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:22,840
Qing!

695
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:23,880
That's not real.

696
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,600
I treated you so well,

697
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,600
yet how did you treat me?

698
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,200
I'm sorry.

699
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:37,710
Qing.

700
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,550
It's me who let you down.

701
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:47,440
Actually,

702
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:52,600
from the very beginning when I
collapsed hungry in front of you,

703
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,470
I came with an ulterior motive.

704
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,840
So it seems

705
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,990
I'm the one who betrayed you.

706
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,310
I approached you

707
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,600
only to open the Lotus Tower,

708
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:26,440
so that the beasts stranded
in the human world could return home.

709
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,160
But later I realized

710
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,440
if one day I truly destroyed that tower,

711
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,840
you would never forgive me.

712
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,470
So I'm afraid

713
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,600
you'd hate me.

714
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,680
Miss Zhu.

715
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:05,510
Qing.

716
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,680
Qing.

717
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,030
Miss Zhu.

718
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:14,510
Qing!

719
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,360
Qing!

720
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,790
Qing.

721
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:33,750
I forgave you long ago.

722
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,600
Why would you feel guilty toward me?

723
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:42,680
Miss Zhu,

724
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:45,790
I'm sorry.

725
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,360
You fool.

726
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,200
From the moment I knew

727
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:57,790
that you used your lifespan as the price

728
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,950
to remove the Soul Hook for me,

729
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,840
I had already forgiven you.

730
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,920
I'm sorry, Miss Zhu.

731
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:10,400
Alright.

732
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,400
At this point,

733
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,840
haven't you recalled anything?

734
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,270
Is she Hairong?

735
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,640
You've finally remembered.

736
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,360
Hairong,

737
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,470
it's me.

738
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:46,790
It has nothing to do with me.

739
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,710
I didn't kill you.

740
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,750
I didn't kill you.

741
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:49,790
I didn't kill you.

742
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,710
I didn't kill you.

743
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,030
I didn't kill you.

744
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,310
The talented Mr. Liu

745
00:41:56,510 --> 00:41:57,550
naturally didn't kill anyone.

746
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,470
But the thing you did

747
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,880
was 100 times crueler than murder.

748
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,750
You always said you loved me,

749
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,990
but why were you with Hairong?

750
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:09,030
She's been behaved since childhood,

751
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,200
following behind me

752
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,270
like a shadow.

753
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:13,470
But why did she betray me?

754
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,950
Why did she end up with you?

755
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:17,470
Look.

756
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,270
You are as clear as water.

757
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:21,840
Promise me, will you?

758
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,230
Okay.

759
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:23,880
Then let's go another day.

760
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,470
So many years have passed.

761
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:33,710
I finally realized

762
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,400
that your verses

763
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,950
were mostly my sister's drafts.

764
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,400
You beast!

765
00:42:39,550 --> 00:42:40,990
You approached her

766
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,270
just to steal her verses,

767
00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:43,160
isn't that right?

768
00:42:45,030 --> 00:42:45,550
Hairu,

769
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,230
I know that whatever I say now

770
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,270
can't make up for it.

771
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,360
But I didn't mean to deceive you.

772
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,600
I loved you,

773
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:54,470
and I loved Hairong.

774
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:56,880
When I first saw Hairong

775
00:42:57,790 --> 00:42:59,600
reciting poetry by the shores,

776
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,310
I knew

777
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:01,990
that in this world,

778
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:02,750
as long as a prodigious talent

779
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,400
like your sister existed,

780
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,120
I'd always be a second-rate poet.

781
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:14,640
I wanted to possess her talent.

782
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,120
To do that,
I had to exploit your jealousy.

783
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,750
So I told Hairong

784
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,200
that I would take her far away

785
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:25,230
and I made sure you found out.

786
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,990
How could you do this?

787
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:33,080
Do you know

788
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,400
how heartbroken I was

789
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,120
when I found out?

790
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,710
Because I am her sister,

791
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:42,950
I've carried everything since childhood.

792
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,360
I could do anything for her.

793
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,030
I stayed in the greasy kitchen for her.

794
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,030
I could also deal with

795
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:52,750
the difficult customers for her.

796
00:43:52,950 --> 00:43:54,200
I could give her everything.

797
00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:56,200
Except for you,

798
00:43:57,400 --> 00:43:59,750
I can't share you with anyone.

799
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,120
When I found out

800
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,880
that you were planning
to run away together,

801
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:07,640
I was devastated.

802
00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:09,750
I didn't know what to do.

803
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:11,360
I thought about...

804
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,550
I thought about killing you.

805
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:16,080
But...

806
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,200
But I couldn't do it.

807
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:23,470
I could only...

808
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:27,550
I could only...

809
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:36,840
Hairu,

810
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:37,920
help me.

811
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:42,600
Hairu!
