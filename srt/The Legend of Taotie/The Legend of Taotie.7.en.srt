00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,110
Your trash!

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,720
Ling!

28
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,830
How are you?

29
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,240
Mr. Xu.

30
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,080
Look.

31
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,030
It turns out Prince Nan of Bei Di is a beast.

32
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,030
Beast! Beast!

33
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,190
Monster! Monster!

34
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,720
Go.

00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,550
Run.

36
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,830
It hurts.

37
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,880
My head hurts, too.

38
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,440
My waist also hurts.

39
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,720
My legs also hurt.

40
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720

I got beaten.

45
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,470
What happened?

46
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,320
Miss Zhu.

47
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,520
You finally came back.

48
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,520
The house was stolen.

49
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,960
There was a man in black.

50
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,110
I don't know what he stole.

51
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:28,880
How dare you!

52
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,510
Miss Zhao,

53
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,390
what happened?

54
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,720
Do you want me to ask someone to check it out?

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,640
No need.

56
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,600
You guys go back first.

57
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,320
Just tell me if you need help.

58
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,600
Let's go back.

59
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:08,480
What the hell happened?

60
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,320
I have no idea.

61
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,720
Did you guys see anything?

62
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,000
I don't know.

63
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:15,350
My head was hit

64
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,600
and then I fainted.

65
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,510
So was I.

66
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,720
You stole “Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures”,

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,440
didn't you?

68
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,480
How could it be me?

69
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,670
It took me a lot of effort

70
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,000
to drive the thief.

71
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,510
You still get me wrong.

72
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,950
If it were me,

73
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,670
why did I stay here?

74
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,480
Then what the hell is your relationship
with Bai Ze?

75
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,600
I don't even know

76
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,390
why I look like Bai Ze?

77
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,270
How am I supposed to answer that?

78
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,230
If you can't explain it to me

79
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,320
your relationship with Bai Ze,

80
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,600
you just don't stay here.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,720
Now get out of here.

82
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,760
You saved me back then.

83
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,200
If I don't pay you off 300 taels of silver,

84
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,110
I won't leave.

85
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
300 taels of silver.

86
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,510
Okay.

87
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,510
Yingtao, come here.

88
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,270
Coming.

89
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,110
Miss Zhu.

90
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,640
Miss Zhu.

91
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,160
What?

92
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,040
300 taels of silver.

93
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,230
I offset it right now.

94
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,230
From now on,

95
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,760
the two of us don't owe each other.

96
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:39,760
Yingtao…

97
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,160
Yingtao…

98
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,790
Yingtao…

99
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,160
Yingtao…

100
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,510
Yingtao…

101
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,320
Zhu Chengbi.

102
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,200
How heartless you are.

103
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:21,760
Cuiyan, see him out.

104
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,550
Miss Zhu…

105
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,000
Miss Zhu…

106
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:12,950
Lotus,

107
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,760
there seems to be a lot of mystery

108
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,270
in “Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures”.

109
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,200
But I lost it.

110
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,270
I'm really useless.

111
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,950
I even can't protect a painting.

112
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,470
I am so scared

113
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,590
that he is the one stealing the painting.

114
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,710
Your Majesty.

115
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,200
How dare

116
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:17,840
you bring this ominous thing

117
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,280
to the palace?

118
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,440
Your Majesty, please forgive my sin.

119
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:22,520
It's indeed not right to bring this thing

120
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,760
to the palace.

121
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,280
But I have no choice.

122
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,760
In this coffin,

123
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,880
it is the body of Prince Nan of Bei Di.

124
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:33,230
You failed to protect my brother

125
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,470
so that he died in a foreign land.

126
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,590
And now you bring this coffin to humiliate Bei Di.

127
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:42,550
Do you think we have no soldiers?

128
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,550
Your Majesty, please calm down.

129
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,710
Prince Nan was assassinated.

130
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,320
I admit Wuxia had poor protection.

131
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,840
Please make a decision again

132
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,790
after you see the body of Prince Nan.

133
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:55,590
Open the coffin.

134
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,080
In the coffin,

135
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,520
it is not the body of Prince Nan.

136
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,760
Prince Nan and I are brothers by the same mother.

137
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,200
How could he be a beast?

138
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,150
How dare you slander our country?

139
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,230
You should be cut into halves.

140
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,030
Somebody.

141
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,550
Drag this person out

142
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,200
and hang him above the gate for three months,

143
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,880
making him suffer from the sun.

144
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,000
Got it.

145
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,520
Hold on.

146
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
My life is insignificant.

147
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,320
Your Majesty, please think it twice.

148
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,350
In the battle of two countries,
the envoy shouldn't be killed.

149
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,960
Please don't break the rule

150
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,080
because of anger at this moment.

151
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,710
That would make Bei Di unrighteous.

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,520
When Prince Nan was assassinated that day

153
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,440
in a hunting ground,

154
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,080
envoys of other countries were also present.

155
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,670
After the death of Prince Nan,
his body turned into a beast.

156
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,080
Wuxia

157
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,910
is just a barbaric place in Da Liang.

158
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,520
How dare we falsify it

159
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,440
to deceive the envoys of other countries?

160
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,320
Now Prince of Langya sent us

161
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,670
to transport Prince Nan's body back.

162
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,280
He hoped that you can investigate
this matter thoroughly.

163
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,760
Shut up.

164
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,080
My brother

165
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,520
could never be a beast.

166
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,400
Your Majesty, if you want to prove

167
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,710
that this is not Prince Nan,

168
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,590
please show us the real evidence.

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,960
I have accomplished my mission.

170
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,640
I have to go back to Wuxia to report it.

171
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,880
Please excuse my leave.

172
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,640
Now you've seen it with your own eyes.

173
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,760
You should believe it.

174
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,110
We are the best brothers.

175
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,590
Why did he do that?

176
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,790
All people have desires.

177
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:08,840
Not to mention

178
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,110
he's still an emperor.

179
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,400
What about you?

180
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:17,840
Do you also want to be an emperor?

181
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,430
I just want to be simple and happy.

182
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,440
You failed. How dare you come back?

183
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,550
You even didn't know you killed a fake Prince Nan

184
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,760
and left the latest weapon of Bei Di

185
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,840
behind in Wuxia.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,230
If Da Liang has mastered the way

187
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:04,640
to control black bees,

188
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,200
do you think

189
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,550
you can afford it?

190
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,020
Your Majesty,

191
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,760
I failed to assassinate Prince Nan.

192
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,000
My death is not a pity.

193
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:12,960
I am old enough.

194
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,910
I can't live for a few years.

195
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,000
But I beg you

196
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,470
to give me another chance.

197
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:21,710
After I kill Ling,

198
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,790
I will come back and admit my guilt.

199
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,960
Prince of Langya is just a hostage.

200
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,640
How dare he embarrassed me in the palace?

201
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,710
This time,

202
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:34,150
you must kill him in one stroke.

203
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,960
I take your order.

204
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,350
How about

205
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,670
the new black bee warrior?

206
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:41,910
I have succeeded.

207
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,670
He's quicker than Ling.

208
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,550
He has more sensitive five senses.

209
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,910
And he will never get out of my control.

210
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,280
You can go.

211
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,030
Excuse me for my leave.

212
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:14,550
What's up?

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:15,590
Miss Zhu,

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,030
in this huge restaurant,

215
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,440
I'm the only one who's busy inside and out.

216
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,710
I painted two maids.

217
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,280
Girls,

218
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,590
what are your names?

219
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,670
My name is Cuiyan.

220
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:34,760
My name is Yingtao.

221
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,080
What the hell?

222
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,550
Look at you.

223
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,790
Why don't I call you Chunjiu and Xiefen?

224
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,110
Miss Zhu,

225
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,080
Mister and Yingtao are not here.

226
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,590
The restaurant is so deserted.

227
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:10,550
It's not that.

228
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,110
This is lively, isn't it?

229
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,320
Don't be mad at Mister.

230
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,640
Cuiyan, clean up.

231
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,710
Or I'll tear you up, too.

232
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:56,790
Let's go.

233
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:59,200
I heard the rose cakes changed the new recipe.

234
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,030
Go and taste it.

235
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,910
Ling.

236
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,470
What are you doing here?

237
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,150
We are so lucky today.

238
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,910
We get a treasure.

239
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
Where's Xu Ruoxu?

240
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,320
He

241
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,030
asked me to wait for him here.

242
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,280
Maybe this idiot

243
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,030
was thrown away by Xu Ruoxu again.

244
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:32,910
Why don't you come in and wait?

245
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:33,550
Come on.

246
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,910
I get you some honey.

247
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
Come on, let's go.

248
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,030
Go.

249
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,280
Why does it not work?

250
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,710
This one is a lot like the one

251
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,800
of the geezer's.

252
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,230
Is the rhythm different?

253
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,880
All you know is to eat.

254
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,110
You have almost eaten it up.

255
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,430
Why don't give me the bee venom?

256
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,590
Just give me it.

257
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:18,110
Okay?

258
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,520
Cuiyan,

259
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,190
don't stop.

260
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,190
Keep shaking. Don't stop.

261
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:41,710
Cuiyan,

262
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,190
keep shaking.

263
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:42,760
Don't stop.

264
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:23,000
What a pity.

265
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,800
This black bee is going to die.

266
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,680
He has only a little bit of venom.

267
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,350
Cuiyan,

268
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:29,830
stop.

269
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:31,760
Eat it.

270
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,160
Eat more.

271
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,640
If you don't eat it, you can't have it any longer.

272
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,000
Keep your voice down.

273
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,230
Yummy.

274
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,530
[Zhu]

275
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,950
How about we give Mr. Chang a bowl of this?

276
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,640
No way.

277
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,760
If he didn't explain to me

278
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,710
his relationship with Bai Ze,

279
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,280
he couldn't eat anything I made.

280
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,110
Miss Zhu!

281
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,040
It's Heng.

282
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,830
Wait a minute.

283
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,160
Go, go, go. Come on.

284
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,520
Keep your voice down.

285
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,430
Go! Go! Go!

286
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,590
Keep your voice down.

287
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,710
Go. Go. Go.

288
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,430
Quick, quick, quick.

289
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,350
Please come in.

290
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,710
What are you doing?

291
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:54,560
You're mysterious.

292
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,830
I seem to have heard

293
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,110
the sound of bells.

294
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,190
Bells?

295
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:00,950
Do you?

296
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,310
I'm afraid lanterns in my restaurant

297
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:04,710
made sounds.

298
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,430
Your restaurant

299
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,560
is really interesting.

300
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,040
Here.

301
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,830
Try my new dish.

302
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,470
I'm going to have a big party for three days.

303
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:28,310
These

304
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,920
look like little wontons.

305
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,230
You may feel tingling and numbing
when you just put it in your mouth.

306
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,310
After you savor it slowly,

307
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,400
it's extremely delicious.

308
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:36,590
Miss Zhu,

309
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,950
you put some venom flavoring in it, right?

310
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:41,400
That's right.

311
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,310
You know me best.

312
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,110
But

313
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:47,160
I have too little bee venom.

314
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,800
I don't know if they are enough

315
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,000
for three days.

316
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,310
What a shame.

317
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,950
He escaped in the last hunt.

318
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,430
Otherwise,

319
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:56,950
I will catch the geezer alive

320
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,590
and check it out

321
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,760
how the hell he made

322
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,000
black bee warriors.

323
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,230
Xu Ruoxu.

324
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,040
Xu Ruoxu…

325
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,680
Is that you?

326
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:42,640
Ling!

327
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:44,830
Ling!

328
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:45,560
Ling.

329
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,230
Are you okay?

330
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,000
I know

331
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,590
you will definitely come and pick me up.

332
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,230
Since you're okay,

333
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,640
I will leave.

334
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,560
I don't care about you.

335
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:00,880
Because you have my father's memories.

336
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,590
Xu Ruoxu,.

337
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,710
Sorry.

338
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:09,830
I may be going very soon.

339
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,280
So I must tell you

340
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,560
a few words now.

341
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,070
What do you mean by you may be going?

342
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:18,470
Where are you going?

343
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,590
Ruoxu,

344
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,350
I always thought

345
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,800
it's good for you to keep away from the beasts.

346
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,280
I admit

347
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,520
I've been ignoring how you feel.

348
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,590
I don't know

349
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,230
you've been grumbling at me all these years.

350
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,310
Ruoxu,

351
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,680
I can't take care of you anymore.

352
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,590
Whether the beasts are good or bad

353
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,920
depends on you to distinguish

354
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,400
in the future.

355
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,950
I'm not a good father.

356
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,710
Afterward,

357
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,800
you have to learn to take care of yourself.

358
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,190
I didn't expect the last time we met each other

359
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,470
I quarreled with him.

360
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:33,070
I'm an unfilial son.

361
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,400
Ever since my mother died,

362
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,680
I haven't talked to him properly.

363
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,350
I know he did it for my own good.

364
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,880
But I just couldn't help talking back to him.

365
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:50,230
I regret it now.

366
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,110
Father,

367
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,000
I hope you'll be fine there.

368
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,000
I'll take good care of myself.

369
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,590
It seems Official Xu

370
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,230
was so harsh on Xu Ruoxu.

371
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,430
In fact, in his heart,

372
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:12,190
he loved his son very much.

373
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,040
Just in the wrong way.

374
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,800
Why?

375
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,110
Look.

376
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,920
Ling has been with Xu Ruoxu

377
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,560
and been protecting him.

378
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,400
That's because after the black bee killed the victim,

379
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,830
he had memories of the victim.

380
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,640
So, Ling

381
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,520
has memories of Official Xu right now.

382
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,880
Ling killed several people, didn't he?

383
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,400
How come he has only the memories of Official Xu?

384
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,680
At the scene,

385
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,520
I found the bodies of a few black bees.

386
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,710
That was the flesh

387
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:43,400
that Official Xu ripped off from Ling before his death.

388
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,920
It shows how strong

389
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,400
his concern and emotions for his son are.

390
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,680
Far more than others.

391
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,070
So he didn't want to let it go until he died.

392
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,920
But now

393
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,640
Ling has his own consciousness.

394
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,800
Xu Ruoxu…

395
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:13,710
Ling!

396
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,800
Ling!

397
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,000
What happened to you?

398
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,350
Ling, wake up. Ling.

399
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:19,110
You wake up!

400
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,230
Miss Zhu.

401
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,310
Miss Zhu.

402
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,680
Save Ling. Save Ling.

403
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,880
I can't help him.

404
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,040
But

405
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,590
I don't know

406
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,590
if the geezer who can control Ling

407
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,920
has a way.

408
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,000
Then let's go find the geezer

409
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:39,760
and forced him to say us the way
to prolong Ling's life.

410
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,310
Let's go.

411
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,830
Wait a minute.

412
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,350
If you want to catch the geezer,

413
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,920
we need another helper.

414
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:48,280
Who is it?

415
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:48,950
Who?

416
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:00,680
Here.

417
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,350
Is it hot?

418
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,520
Is it good?

419
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:10,680
Good.

420
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,760
It tastes

421
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:15,640
very special.

422
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,350
It tastes very special.

423
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,680
Ling, don't worry.

424
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,520
I won't let anything happen to you.

425
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,710
Here comes the helper.

426
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:51,430
Mr. Xu,

427
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,590
His Highness asked me to assist Miss Zhu.

428
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,800
Mr. Chang!

429
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:18,880
Mr. Chang!

430
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:21,830
Come in.

431
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,640
Mr. Chang,

432
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,310
I came to see you.

433
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:29,800
Cuiyan,

434
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,190
why come here so late?

435
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,000
Mr. Chang,

436
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
are you painting Yingtao again?

437
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:42,950
Mr. Chang,

438
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,310
come and have a bite.

439
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,830
Miss Zhu

440
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,920
made it personally.

441
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:50,070
Although Miss Zhu always said
that she didn't care about you,

442
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,280
she still missed you in her heart.

443
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,350
Come and have a taste.

444
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,680
This is the Bee Soup

445
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,470
that Miss Zhu especially left in the kitchen.

446
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:02,880
What?

447
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:09,000
Miss Zhu caught Ling?

448
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:09,920
How is Ling now?

449
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,000
Did Miss Zhu hurt Ling?

450
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,160
You misunderstood.

451
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
Xu Ruoxu left Ling

452
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:14,880
at the door of Tianxiang Restaurant.

453
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:16,590
Miss Zhu took him in.

454
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
She didn't hurt him

455
00:29:18,230 --> 00:29:19,560
and gave him honey.

456
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,640
Miss Zhu also asked Mr. Lu

457
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,680
to deal with the geezer.

458
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,190
Eat it.

459
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:51,640
Her craftsmanship

460
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,710
is still so amazing.

461
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,830
By the way, Cuiyan,

462
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,110
Remind Miss Zhu to be careful of that guy

463
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,040
who stole “Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures”.

464
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,830
He has strong skills.

465
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,800
He is not an ordinary person.

466
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,310
I don't know what his purpose is now.

467
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:06,830
If his purpose was “Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures”,

468
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:08,230
he has already succeeded.

469
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,680
But if he aimed at Miss Zhu,

470
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,520
that would be bad.

471
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,280
Relax.

472
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
I'll watch Tianxiang Restaurant for you.

473
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,110
If there are any changes,

474
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,350
I'll keep you informed.

475
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:23,800
But,

476
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,070
Mr. Chang,

477
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,760
you still care about Miss Zhu.

478
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,310
I'm just worried about you and Yingtao.

479
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,710
You are duplicity.

480
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,230
Coming. Coming. Coming.

481
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,040
Coming.

482
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,280
Ling,

483
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,040
come back with me.

484
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,280
I'm not leaving.

485
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,190
I want to be here with Xu Ruoxu.

486
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,000
Ling.

487
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,000
Who is that?

488
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,160
Why does he look exactly like you?

489
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:47,400
Yuan,

490
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,230
kill her.

491
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,390
Miss Zhu,

492
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:11,560
are you okay?

493
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,560
Qing,

494
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,230
you finally came.

495
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:14,710
I almost was killed by him just now.

496
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,840
It's fine as long as you believe in me.

497
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:28,630
Ling, are you okay?

498
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,360
Xu Ruoxu,

499
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,390
he's too dangerous.

500
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,040
Let's go.

501
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,190
You killed Official Xu

502
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,360
and murdered innocent people.

503
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:12,600
Today,

504
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:14,800
can you escape?

505
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:19,040
Without the wings of that black bee,

506
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,870
how will you fly?

507
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,120
Yuan,

508
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,710
break the gold wire net.

509
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:41,800
Yuan,

510
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,840
kill Ling

511
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,080
and go back to report.

512
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:46,870
Our weapons of Bei Di

513
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,320
must not fall into the hands of Da Liang.

514
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:00,800
Qing,

515
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,520
that black bee is fleeing.

516
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:07,630
It's time to use you.

517
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,320
Xu Ruoxu,

518
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,600
you go first.

519
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:42,190
No.

520
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,320
I'm not leaving.

521
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,230
I don't allow you to hurt Ling again.

522
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,000
This is my last bit of venom.

523
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,560
It couldn't hurt you.

524
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,230
Xu Ruoxu,

525
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,120
goodbye.

526
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,560
Ling…

527
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,150
Ling…

528
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:11,280
Ling!

529
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:15,710
Ling…

530
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:28,910
Ling…

531
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:40,520
Ling…

532
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:41,670
Ling…

533
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,600
What are you doing?

534
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,470
Just let me go.

535
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:20,670
What the hell?

536
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,360
You

537
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,910
feel it yourself…

538
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,120
I know you're hungry.

539
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:34,800
But I don't have any money now.

540
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,630
When I go home tomorrow and get money,

541
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,840
I'll buy you the best.

542
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,470
Plate.

543
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,150
Plate.

544
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:49,670
Bowl.

545
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:55,320
Is it good?

546
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,430
You can't show your wings at random anymore.

547
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:05,430
This is dangerous.

548
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,670
You look really good.

549
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,190
Open your mouth.

550
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,870
Let's fly a kite tomorrow.

551
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,120
We can also row a boat

552
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:17,360
and buy some more clothes.

553
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,600
By the way.

554
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,430
Have you ever flown a kite?

555
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:20,800
Then we'll be brothers.

556
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Brothers.

557
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:28,840
This is something you've never felt before, right?

558
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,000
You're just like the old me.

559
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,280
You were born in the hive.

560
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,040
You don't know the sweetness of wine.

561
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,560
You don't know the sourness of vinegar.

562
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:41,000
You are never alive nor smile,

563
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,710
nor protected by others.

564
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:45,840
You don't know what it means to never give up.

565
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,430
You can never resist it.

566
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,120
When I pour it all into your senses,

567
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,230
when my body is destroyed,

568
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,280
my memories

569
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,120
and my wish of protecting him will be preserved.

570
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,430
It's something important

571
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,670
worth protecting.

572
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,760
From now on,

573
