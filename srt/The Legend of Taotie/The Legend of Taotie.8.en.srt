[The Legend of TAOTIE]

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,100
[Episode 8]

26
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,030
Are you Xu Ruoxu?

27
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,390
Xu…

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,720
Ruoxu…

29
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,600
You used Ling as a bait

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,270
to get the bell?

31
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,880
I didn't, Qing.

32
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:21,720
Get it back to me.

33
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,670
Qing.

34
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:14,720
Qing.

35
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,440
Qing.

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,880
Listen to me.

37
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,110
What are you going to tell me?

38
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,640
I thought

39
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
you had to eat beasts

40
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,600
to survive.

41
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,350
But I didn't expect that

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,000
you did anything

43
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,110
to get beasts.

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,350
Don't you regret at all

45
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,320
for killing Ling?

46
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,760
Ling didn't die.

47
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,830
Ling's body vanished,

48
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,880
but the memory lives in Yuan.

49
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,830
And I have eaten Ling's bee venom.

50
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,510
It's good for him.

51
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,270
Ling has put his and Xu Ruoxu's memories

52
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,880
into Yuan's body.

53
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,270
Exactly, it's risky.

54
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,880
And I'm not sure about it.

55
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,760
But if we tell Xu Ruoxu in advance,

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,440
he wouldn't permit

57
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,950
Ling to do it.

58
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,600
Get it?

59
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,480
Really?

60
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,160
Yes.

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,160
Thank you, Miss Zhu

62
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,270
and Mr. Chang Qing.

63
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,230
You're welcome.

64
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,070
See you.

65
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,350
See you.

66
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,720
See you.

67
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,160
Let's go.

68
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,230
Xu Ruoxu.

69
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:35,440
Where are we going?

70
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,880
The world is vast.

71
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,950
I have no idea.

72
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,000
Just go.

73
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,110
OK.

74
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:42,070
Anyway, where you are,

75
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,160
where my home lies.

76
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:43,920
OK.

77
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,320
Let's go to the North first.

78
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's go.

79
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,160
The world is so big.

80
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,200
It must be interesting.

81
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:54,920
Yes.

82
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,510
They wander around the world

83
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,920
and live together all their lives.

84
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,600
It's amazing.

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,670
Get me the brush.

86
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:15,510
Why?

87
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,350
Apologize.

88
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,720
You are the one to apologize.

89
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,760
Why did you let the horse go?

90
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
Because I can fly.

91
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,160
It's over ten miles to go!

92
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:00,920
Di Feng.

93
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,600
Brother.

94
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,350
You have to be careful

95
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,200
in this trip to Xia.

96
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,760
I'm so grateful

97
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,200
for you to be the hostage.

98
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,670
I have no idea

99
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,950
when we may meet again.

100
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,320
Take my sword, and may it protect you.

101
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,040
Thank you, brother.

102
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,550
I will be careful.

103
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,510
Take care, brother.

104
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,640
This

105
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,350
is my flute.

106
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:38,160
Take it as a souvenir.

107
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,040
I'll take off.

108
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,590
Di Feng.

109
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,230
Come on.

110
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:02,910
Your Highness.

111
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,640
Where is Prince Nan of Bei Di?

112
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,910
Prince Nan of Bei Di

113
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:06,030
left this morning.

114
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,520
He said he took a walk in the countryside.

115
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,520
Your Highness.

116
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,590
This road is to the valley.

117
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,960
And that one is to the countryside.

118
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,030
Any news?

119
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:39,960
Your Highness,

120
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,760
we found a flagon made in the prefecture

121
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,320
in the grass ahead.

122
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:44,960
Prince Nan may have gone out of the town.

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,760
Guide me to it.

124
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:25,910
Kill him.

125
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:43,910
Di Feng.

126
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,030
I'm late.

127
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,110
How are you?

128
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:48,550
Brother,

129
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,440
I came to Da Liang this time,

130
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,000
and found that

131
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,400
brother has changed

132
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
after enthroned.

133
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:03,910
But you?

134
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,200
Why are you changed?

135
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,110
All right.

136
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,150
All right.

137
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,640
Subjects must obey their emperor absolutely

138
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,670
even if he orders them to die.

139
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,440
I have gotten out of Da Liang anyway.

140
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,030
I didn't let you down.

141
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:39,440
Di Feng.

142
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,280
What are you going to do?

143
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,320
I miss the past time.

144
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,760
Di Feng.

145
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:13,550
Di Feng.

146
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,280
You're a man.

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,280
An upright man.

148
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,030
But why are you so foolish?

149
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,440
Why didn't you cherish your life?

150
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,030
Why?

151
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,670
Why?

152
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,670
Why?

153
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,760
General.

154
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,000
General.

155
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:51,960
General.

156
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,790
Taotie.

157
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:10,440
You're a beast.

158
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,150
How dare you betray us for humans?

159
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,350
The courier of Yangcheng Prefecture.

160
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,790
Take a look for me.

161
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,520
Is there a town in Songyang Pass?

162
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,910
Monk Lotus

163
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,230
transformed himself into a pavilion!

164
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,350
Taotie.

165
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,080
We're comrade-in-arms now.

166
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,640
You're the fifth son of dragon.

167
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,230
How about calling you

168
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,590
Mr. Five?

169
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,110
18.

170
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,110
19.

171
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,440
20.

172
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,550
21.

173
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,760
So much honey wine.

174
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,110
They were all eaten up by Miss Zhu.

175
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,550
Yes.

176
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,080
She didn't leave any to us.

177
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,110
I want to have a sip.

178
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,670
How about

179
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:51,030
buying some honey?

180
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,640
Good idea!

181
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:56,000
Then we can make honey wine by ourselves.

182
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,880
It's enough for having a tippler in Tianxiang Restaurant.

183
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,110
Don't join in.

184
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,000
What about the business

185
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
if you are all drunk?

186
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,160
Do we have business?

187
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,950
Little drinking is good for us.

188
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:14,640
Where did you learn it from?

189
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,110
From me.

190
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,920
Alcohol doesn't hurt at all.

191
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm still so clear.

192
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,400
Qing.

193
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,590
Is there anything in the world

194
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
that can remove people's memory?

195
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,040
Maybe only the Meng Po Soup.

196
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,590
Yes, you reminded me.

197
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,760
Meng Po Soup

198
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,560
needs souls and tears

199
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,230
and various medicines in the world.

200
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,400
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

201
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,000
Leave them off.

202
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,640
Check the kitchen

203
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
for me.

204
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,070
Okay.

205
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:56,800
And what?

206
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,110
And...

207
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,710
Think about it.

208
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,680
You'll forget everything

209
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
even me,

210
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,680
well, even Cuiyan and Yingtao.

211
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,190
It's OK.

212
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,470
Anyway,

213
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,280
I can know you again.

214
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,710
I just want to remind you,

215
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,560
if you drink Meng Po Soup,

216
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:23,710
you'll forget anything

217
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,110
and have no way to regret.

218
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,190
Qing, tell me.

219
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,430
Is there anyone or anything

220
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,880
you don't want to forget?

221
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,880
No.

222
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,590
But you lost your mind.

223
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,470
You must be hiding something.

224
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,560
You asked me.

225
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,400
So I thought about it

226
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,190
and found

227
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:11,880
nothing.

228
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,400
Nothing.

229
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,760
So, you don't get it.

230
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,160
It's of no use to tell you.

231
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:17,830
You're not as good as Heng.

232
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,950
You just have known him for days,

233
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,190
and know more than me?

234
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,470
You don't understand it.

235
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,110
To know someone

236
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,230
doesn't depend on the length of time,

237
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,040
but the tacit understanding.

238
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:33,800
Take you.

239
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,800
You're not with me when I want to drink.

240
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,040
What's more,

241
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,710
you kept chattering,

242
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,280
drink less,

243
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,230
be careful,

244
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,230
alcohol is harmful...

245
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,520
So boring, right?

246
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:43,430
I...

247
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,110
I just want to remind you,

248
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:48,590
you shouldn't try to solve the problem

249
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,520
by escapism.

250
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,680
You won't forget anything you should remember,

251
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,920
and don't have to stick to something you should forget.

252
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,190
You can live happily in this way.

253
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,640
I see.

254
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,950
No wonder you said I'm worse than Jiao

255
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
when I laughed about her unreasoning passion.

256
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,310
Well,

257
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,350
tell me,

258
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:31,190
what do you want to forget?

259
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:36,800
Nothing.

260
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,590
I was joking.

261
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,680
I just wanted to drink.

262
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,280
Lying.

263
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,880
I know it.

264
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,800
All right.

265
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,920
It's okay you're not with me.

266
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,000
I have Heng anyway.

267
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:49,800
Why didn't Prince of Langya

268
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,000
come these days?

269
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,040
The royal prince

270
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,230
is just having fun.

271
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,880
How could he be here everyday?

272
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:56,070
In my view,

273
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:58,310
he must have forgotten you.

274
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,310
I've never expected

275
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,710
that you can be so clumsy.

276
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,760
It's because of the chopsticks.

277
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,590
I'd like it if the chicken claw is boneless.

278
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,070
Yes.

279
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:39,070
The boneless chicken claw

280
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,310
in Zuixianju last time

281
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,430
was so tasty.

282
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,680
But we never went there later.

283
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,800
You really need the magic power

284
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,640
to enjoy the food.

285
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,590
I see.

286
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,640
Miss Zhu is amazing!

287
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:31,560
You're just a cook.

288
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,430
No need to make a fuss.

289
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,190
You don't get it.

290
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,560
It's the sense of ceremony.

291
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,040
But you really reminded me.

292
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,070
I should have made the spicy zhangzhongbao

293
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:46,160
for us.

294
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:47,760
Miss Zhu.

295
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,040
What's zhangzhongbao?

296
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,800
As its name suggests,

297
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:53,160
it's the part

298
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,920
in the center of the palm.

299
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,040
Idiot.

300
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,070
Zhangzhongbao

301
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,590
is the gristle in chicken's knees.

302
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,830
It's really tasty.

303
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,400
No way.

304
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,230
Zhangzhongbao.

305
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:05,950
As its name suggests,

306
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,110
it's the center of the palm,

307
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:08,760
just like the pearl in the palm.

308
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,310
How can it be the chicken's knee?

309
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,710
Mr. Chang Qing.

310
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,520
Mr. Zhou.

311
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,190
Mr. Zhou.

312
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,350
He looks handsome.

313
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,230
See,

314
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,470
he's whiter than you.

315
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,280
Hi, Miss Zhu.

316
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,800
We were just talking about the pearl in the palm,

317
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,350
and you came.

318
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,470
Mr. Zhou rarely goes out.

319
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,040
What brings you here?

320
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,280
I was planning to ask you for suggestions

321
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,640
about my new paintings.

322
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,800
You're too modest.

323
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,680
Mr. Zhou.

324
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,230
My accountant

325
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,160
only takes you

326
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:42,160
as a teacher in painting,

327
00:24:42,590 --> 00:24:43,760
and said you're a genius.

328
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,640
Not at all.

329
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,430
Mr. Zhou is too modest.

330
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,280
Last time I saw your

331
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,680
painting of sunrise at sea,

332
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,430
I still remember it.

333
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
I once visited Sijing Garden

334
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,680
and was told that you were sick.

335
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,950
What a pity.

336
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,640
My mom is strict about my life

337
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,070
and I've been used to

338
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:05,880
rarely going out.

339
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,920
It's a pleasure

340
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:08,950
to talk about the painting with you.

341
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:14,710
So I came today.

342
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,070
You have a company.

343
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Why don't you invite her in?

344
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:24,160
It's Liyu, my maid.

345
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,520
It's okay for her to wait for me outside.

346
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:30,560
Mr. Chang.

347
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,830
Can I talk to you privately?

348
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:32,880
OK.

349
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:34,880
Well, I shouldn't have been here.

350
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,400
Cuiyan, Yingtao,

351
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,110
let's go

352
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,280
to buy zhangzhongbao.

353
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:39,830
Mr. Zhou.

354
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,430
Please.

355
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:40,880
OK.

356
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:41,560
Wait.

357
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,470
Mr. Zhou.

358
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,710
It's late now.

359
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:50,520
If you don't come home early,

360
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,350
your mom who cherishes you

361
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,160
as the pearl in the palm

362
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,070
will worry about you.

363
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,190
What do you mean?

364
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,110
Mr. Zhou.

365
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:25,710
Mr. Zhou.

366
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,350
Please.

367
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:28,950
Come on.

368
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,190
Here.

369
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,140
[Sijing Garden]

370
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,520
Anyone find him?

371
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:58,710
No.

372
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:00,950
Go away.

373
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,950
Go find the master.

374
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,070
Hurry up.

375
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,070
Calm down, madam.

376
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,710
The master will be home soon.

377
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,590
Madam. Madam.

378
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:22,110
Madam.

379
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,070
We found the master.

380
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,190
Mr. Zhou looks good.

381
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,000
But he's weird.

382
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:35,950
Yes.

383
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,880
His maid looked nervous

384
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,430
and weird.

385
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:42,430
Miss Zhu.

386
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,430
What did you mean by saying that

387
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,560
Mr. Zhou is the pearl in the palm?

388
00:27:53,190 --> 00:27:53,710
What?

389
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:58,710
[Ding Jiang Zhou]

390
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,000
Zhou Guangping is the only inheritor of

391
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,110
Ding Jiang Zhou, Jiangling's Zhou family.

392
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:11,590
It smells good.

393
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,040
Let's go.

394
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Jiangling's Zhou family

395
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,280
is the No.1 sauce merchant in Jiangnan.

396
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,680
Its goods,

397
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,880
like beef sauce, spicy sauce,

398
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,400
soybean sauce, or garlic sauce,

399
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:31,280
smells tasty with a unique flavor

400
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:36,190
which doesn't vanish for years.

401
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,160
What's more, they are efficient.

402
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,950
The customer

403
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,070
can get high-quality sauce

404
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,190
on the second they ordered.

405
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,710
So, Zhou's business is better and better.

406
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,160
At peak time,

407
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,350
they own the stores

408
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,040
of the whole street.

409
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:52,190
Miss Zhu.

410
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,680
Miss Zhu.

411
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:54,830
But it's Wuxia,

412
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,830
not Jiangling.

413
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:57,400
Do you want to know more?

414
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,470
Yes. Yes.

415
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:00,920
When Zhou Guangping was born,

416
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,400
Zhou's family had 15 generations

417
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,640
but little kids.

418
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,160
As the only inheritor,

419
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,070
his life is dramatic.

420
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,350
When he was about three or four,

421
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,430
his father took them

422
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:10,710
to visit mother-in-law in Yunlong

423
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:12,830
and died in an accident

424
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,680
in Wuxia.

425
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:14,310
Oh my.

426
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,070
His mother has to

427
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,040
raise Zhou Guangping

428
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,640
who was scared and sick by herself.

429
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,800
She bought Sijing Garden in Wuxia

430
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:21,590
and settled down.

431
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,520
Does Mr. Zhou have a wife?

432
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:26,110
What are you thinking about?

433
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,400
Marry him?

434
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:28,560
No way.

435
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,880
It's not lucky to marry him.

436
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,830
Zhou Guangping had four wives.

437
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:34,400
Four wives.

438
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,710
His second and the third wife

439
00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:37,070
died weirdly.

440
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,920
Everybody said that

441
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,470
Sijing Garden has bad fengshui,

442
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,640
especially the white stone

443
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,520
in the garden

444
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,710
which looks like a white tiger.

445
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:46,920
It has been regarded as the cause

446
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,680
of his three wives' death.

447
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:49,950
White tiger.

448
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,830
Three wives died.

449
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,310
Is there really a white tiger in Sijing Garden?

450
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,520
The third, fourth.

451
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,160
Miss Zhu,

452
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,520
you just said that

453
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,710
the second and third wives died.

454
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,710
Why is it three?

455
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,710
Yes.

456
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,400
The second and third,

457
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,400
it's two.

458
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:08,880
Yes.

459
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,430
The story may not be true.

460
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,070
Just forget it.

461
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,520
Every mother caring about her son

462
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,950
is like a tigress, right?

463
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:18,710
Tigress?

464
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,350
What does it mean?

465
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,310
Tigress.

466
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,400
In my mind,

467
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,560
Miss Zhu is the only tigress.

468
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,400
Let's go.

469
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,950
You're still there.

470
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,190
Greetings, Miss Zhu.

471
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:50,830
Is Mr. Zhou still talking with Chang Qing?

472
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,070
It's so late

473
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,590
and master hasn't come.

474
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,710
It may cause trouble.

475
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,310
He just went out,

476
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:58,160
it's not

477
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,310
a big deal.

478
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,310
Our madam,

479
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:02,640
well...

480
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,920
It's so fragrant, smell it.

481
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,000
Please stay, Mr. Chang.

482
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:13,710
Well,

483
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,590
take your time.

484
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:15,680
See you, Mr. Zhou.

485
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,520
See you, Miss Zhu.

486
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:22,400
Mr. Zhou.

487
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,160
I want to give something

488
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,040
to your mother.

489
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,160
What's this?

490
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,470
Just give it to your mother.

491
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,070
And

492
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,310
send a message to her.

493
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,590
Well.

494
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:53,520
Miss Zhu,

495
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,310
what are you planning to?

496
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,000
It's a secret.

497
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,590
None of your business.

498
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,520
Mr. Zhou.

499
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,520
Miss Zhu is rude,

500
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,710
don't mind

501
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:04,190
her words.

502
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:07,310
Accountant,

503
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,590
could you be careful

504
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,190
when talking bad about me?

505
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,920
A gentleman is open and poised.

506
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:14,640
I'll

507
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,110
take off now.

508
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:33,810
[Sijing Garden]

509
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,640
Ruifang.

510
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,110
Honey, bad news.

511
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,710
Go and look at mother.

512
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,560
Mother is hurting herself again?

513
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,800
Ping.

514
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,190
Mother.

515
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,040
Mother.

516
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:53,560
I'm back.

517
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,160
Ping.

518
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,110
You're back.

519
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,040
Don't leave me.

520
00:32:59,040 --> 00:32:59,880
You know?

521
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,190
Mother.

522
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:07,000
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

523
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,000
I can't

524
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,040
bear it.

525
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,190
Promise me.

526
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,830
Don't leave me.

527
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,400
Never leave me.

528
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,590
Okay?

529
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:20,710
Okay.

530
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,830
Where have you been?

531
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:31,350
Why are you so late?

532
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:35,070
Xunfang Restaurant opened today

533
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,190
and Mr. Ji invited me

534
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,920
to visit.

535
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,710
And then?

536
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,920
Then,

537
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,190
I met Tianxiang Restaurant's Mr. Chang Qing

538
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,400
and had cups of tea in his place

539
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:48,560
and came back with Liyu.

540
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,830
According to the rule,

541
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:52,470
you only have one incense's time to meet a friend.

542
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,430
Why did it cost half an hour more?

543
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,590
Because

544
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,070
Mr. Chang Qing is

545
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,880
also interested in painting,

546
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,560
we had fun

547
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,880
and took time.

548
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,710
It's enough.

549
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,710
I don't care what you talked about.

550
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,350
We have the rule.

551
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:08,710
And you broke it.

552
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,600
You deserve the punishment.

553
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,320
But it was

554
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:15,190
Ruifang's fault.

555
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,710
Well, start the punishment.

556
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:20,390
Mother.

557
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,190
Don't, mother.

558
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,190
I'm tired.

559
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,390
Liyu.

560
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,080
You do it for me.

561
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:30,710
Madam.

562
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:32,710
Please, madam.

563
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:33,390
Madam.

564
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:36,040
Have you heard my words?

565
00:34:36,430 --> 00:34:36,910
Mother.

566
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:37,710
Mother.

567
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:38,470
Don't, mother.

568
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,120
Come on.

569
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:43,710
Mother.

570
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,870
Beat her.

571
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,000
Sorry, lady?

572
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:11,230
Please, mother.

573
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:12,870
Mother.

574
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:22,000
Ping.

575
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,840
See.

576
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,870
Ruifang's pain

577
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,560
is because that

578
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,080
you disobeyed me.

579
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,670
Your selfishness hurt her.

580
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,710
What's this?

581
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,670
Miss Zhu from Tianxiang Restaurant

582
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,800
asked me to take it to you.

583
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,320
Zhu Chengbi.

584
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,840
What does she want?

585
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,470
She asked me to send a message to you.

586
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,950
The pearl will be hot

587
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,360
when holding all the time in the palm,

588
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,280
and will hurt yourself

589
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,840
finally.

590
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,230
Good boy.

591
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,150
We don't

592
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,520

593
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:35,710
Okay?

594
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,390

595
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:25,320
What a pity.

596
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,000
Another piece of paper wasted.

597
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,950
There's no wasted paper,

598
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,190
but painting

599
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:31,910
without spirit.

600
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,670
There was a lotus

601
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,670
which didn't bloom

602
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:49,360
when you just came to Tianxiang Restaurant.

603
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:51,360
And it bloomed after you painted.

604
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,390
That's the reason why I kept you.

605
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,760
But I didn't expect that

606
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,600
you dominated Tianxiang Restaurant

607
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,390
and ignored me.

608
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,230
You're the dominator.

609
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,950
I dare not.

610
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,120
Tell me,

611
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:05,430
why did Zhou Guangping come?

612
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,000
We just talk,

613
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,670
it's common for friends.

614
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,800
Just casual talk.

615
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,360
No way.

616
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,630
You're hiding something.

617
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,150
Even if I am

618
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:16,870
I can't tell you.

619
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,230
It's a promise to my friend.

620
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,630
Qing, I'm warning you.

621
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,000
Don't interfere with Zhou Guangping's business.

622
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,150
And don't try to help him run away.

623
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,000
Why do you think he wants to run away?

624
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,560
Anyone would run away

625
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:35,910
with such a mother.

626
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,760
You have learnt about Mrs. Zhou.

627
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:45,360
Words are but wind,

628
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:47,080
and what you see may not be true.

629
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,230
Things are not

630
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,560
that simple.

631
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,600
Do you understand

632
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:52,870
my words.

633
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,760
Miss Zhu.

634
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,360
I don't get you

635
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,800
when you're serious.

636
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,520
What do you mean?

637
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,150
I'm not serious normally?

638
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,150
No.

639
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,080
But you're lovely

640
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,910
when you're fussing.

641
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,430
It's strange when

642
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,800
you were

643
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,630
talking to me seriously.

644
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,600
Well, tell me,

645
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,670
why did Zhou Guangping

646
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
come to you?

647
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,670
Qing.

648
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,040
You can't

649

do anything

650
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,190
but painting.

651
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:29,280
So, he asked you

652
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,150
to paint him

653
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,800
as his substitute.

654
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,390
And he can go away.

655
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,040
Right?

656
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,670
Terrible.

657
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,190
She guessed right.

658
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:41,000
Am I right?

659
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,150
I have various ways

660
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,120
to help me.

661
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,600
Not just the painting.

662
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,430
How about this, Qing?

663
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,390
You paint me

664
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,600
to host Tianxiang Restaurant.

665
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,520

666
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,190
I'll go wherever I want.

No one is hosting Tianxiang Restaurant.

Your Highness.

I've been practiced for years.

707
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,230
Puppet-string?

Tell me about it.

The puppet

00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,670
is manipulated by the puppet-string.

711
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,910
It can talk

712
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,950
and even bleed,

713
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,840

Good.

Changing the time and environment
