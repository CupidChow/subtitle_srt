I'm quite honored

192
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:29,880
to hold this competition.

193
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,070
It's a greater honor

194
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,360
that we've invited

195
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,440
Prince of Langya, new mayor of Wuxia

196
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,800
and mysterious Miss Zhu
from Tianxiang Restaurant.

197
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,920
- Nice.
- Nice.

198
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,390
Our judges are

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,190
Prefect Xu, Chieftain Xue,

200
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,800
Chief Constable Yang, and Chef Liu.

201
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,680
- Great.
- Great.

202
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,190
Hope you'll do a good job

203
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,920
in this competition

204
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,480
and make great pastries.

205
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,320
- Come on.
- Come on.

206
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,920
This looks good.

207
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,590
Look at that one.

208
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,440
Great, isn't it?

209
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,150
Who do you think

210
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,510
will be the champion?

211
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:30,590
Isn't that obvious?

212
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,800
It must be Miss Ji.

213
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,710
I don't agree.

214
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,120
Look at that young chef.

215
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,070
His green dumplings taste great.

216
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,880
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

217
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,560
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

218
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:47,320
Yingtao.

219
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,040
I'm back!

220
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,750
Cuiyan!

221
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,120
Yingtao.

222
00:11:59,390 --> 00:11:59,920
Miss Zhu.

223
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,320
Am I back too late?

224
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,590
Sugarcoated haws.

225
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,790
Sir, I'd like one.

226
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,230
All right.

227
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:33,000
This one?

228
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,640
No problem.

229
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,080
All right.

230
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,280
Excuse me.

231
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,520
Do you know where Miss Zhu

232
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,200
has gone?

233
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,230
You don't know?

234
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,520
His Highness is holding
the rain-praying ceremony.

235
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,960
Everyone in this restaurant
has gone there.

236
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,110
Thank you.

237
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,320
You're welcome.

238
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,520
Miss Zhu is fine.

239
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,150
This one?

240
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,640
Time's up.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Game over.

242
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,880
Time is up.

243
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,760
Please present your pastries.

244
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,640
Let's get a good look.

245
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:26,880
The competition now starts.

246
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,280
Judges, please come up here.

247
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,790
Osmanthus cake
from Drunken Immortals Hall.

248
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,550
Swallow Nest from Fenghe Restaurant.

249
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,320
Butterfly Roll from Fengqing Restaurant.

250
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:58,080
Spring Secret from Wanxiang Resto.

251
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,350
Fortune Cake from Xichun Restaurant.

252
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,910
Let me guess,

253
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,230
this is the best pastry
of Xunfang Resto,

254
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,760
Fancy Taste.

255
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:12,280
Exactly.

256
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,200
This is my Fancy Taste.

257
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,280
This pastry is expensive.

258
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,110
Ordinary people can't afford it.

259
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,230
That's right.

260
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,030
Enjoy it, judges.

261
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,400
Good.

262
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,000
It tastes good.

263
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,440
Really good.

264
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,440
Today, I'm lucky enough

265
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,080
to taste this pastry.

266
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,030
It's worth it.

267
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,960
Miss Ji will definitely win.

268
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,880
Yes, yes.

269
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:23,960
Awesome.

270
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,960
We're done tasting the pastries.

271
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,280
I'm here to report,

272
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:33,030
this year's champion

273
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,400
still goes to Ji Wenzhen
of Xunfang Resto.

274
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,000
Nice.

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,400
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

276
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,670
- Great.
- Wonderful.

277
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,200
Wait.

278
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,230
The pastry from Xunfang Resto

279
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,350
looks really beautiful.

280
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,520
Can I try some?

281
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,550
Of course.

282
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,080
Enjoy it.

283
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,520
Such a nice pastry.

284
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,910
It looks graceful.

285
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,440
It tastes great, too.

286
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,400
Sadly,

287
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,670
it doesn't taste as good

288
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:28,030
as a common pastry someone else makes.

289
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:28,710
Impossible.

290
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,350
Who can make better pastries than me?

291
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,550
Your silly junior brother

292
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,910
you often talk about.

293
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,320
He went over time.

294
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,030
He isn't qualified now.

295
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,760
He went over time,

296
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,110
but it doesn't mean
his pastry tastes bad.

297
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,710
Even if he's disqualified,

298
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,200
we can still taste his green dumplings,

299
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:50,790
can't we?

300
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,520
What's wrong?

301
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,400
Do you fear he outperforms you?

302
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,550
Then your reputation

303
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,910
and your restaurant...

304
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,760
Miss Ji, I believe

305
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,070
you also want to know

306
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:11,710
who does better pastries,

307
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:15,000
you or your junior brother.

308
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,800
What have I to be afraid of?

309
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,470
Since you want this, Miss Zhu,

310
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,590
let's do it, then.

311
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,070
I'm done.

312
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,680
Heaven and Earth in Spring is done.

313
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:25,880
It's done.

314
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:28,920
Finally.

315
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:29,880
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

316
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,590
Try some.

317
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:39,880
Shall we?

318
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,430
Is it really a green dumpling?

319
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,920
After I eat one,

320
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,710
why do I feel
I have strength all over me?

321
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,400
So amazing?

322
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,110
Is that true?

323
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,230
I'm in my forties.

324
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,640
I've never eaten such a great pastry.

325
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,760
Marvelous.

326
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,190
Really marvelous.

327
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,160
If Miss Ji makes the best pasties

328
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,310
in the mortal world,

329
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,830
Shi Yiwu makes the pasties

330
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,470
for immortals.

331
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
That's right.

332
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,190
Impossible.

333
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,640
It's impossible.

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,640
Totally impossible!

335
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,640
His hands...

336
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,880
What's wrong with his hands?

337
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,430
He couldn't have made this pastry.

338
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,310
You're wrong.

339
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,710
Miss Ji,

340
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:01,070
your junior brother Stone

341
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,880
actually made it.

342
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,880
You're just jealous of his talent

343
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,800
because he outperforms you.

344
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,470
You're lying.

345
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:08,920
You're all lying.

346
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,160
You're lying to yourself.

347
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,950
You're jealous of Stone.

348
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,000
Liar!

349
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,880
His hands are less sensitive.

350
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,640
How could he make this?

351
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,190
Miss Ji,

352
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,040
how do you know

353
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,040
his hands are less sensitive?

354
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,000
I broke his hands.

355
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,880
He couldn't have made it!

356
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,760
What...

357
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,400
What's she talking about?

358
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:31,830
She's so wicked.

359
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,160
I didn't know what to say

360
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,230
and I said it wrong.

361
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:45,760
Everybody,

362
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,430
did you hear Miss Ji?

363
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:49,560
Yes.

364
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,280
Yes, we did.

365
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,160
Nonsense.

366
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,830
If my men hadn't found him in time,

367
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,590
her junior brother

368
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,710
would have bled out.

369
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,190
Miss Ji,

370
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,070
you're so malevolent.

371
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,230
I don't know what you're talking about.

372
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,070
Miss Ji,

373
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,560
you appear to despise
your junior brother.

374
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,880
Actually, you're hiding

375
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,310
your jealousy and envy.

376
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,590
Stone is a real genius.

377
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,110
But you...

378
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,000
You can never outperform him.

379
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,070
What did you say?

380
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,920
I'm a genius.

381
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,040
I'm a real genius!

382
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,110
He's an idiot!

383
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,590
I've been learning for 15 years!

384
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,190
My restaurants are all over the city!

385
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,950
How could you say he's a genius?

386
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,680
He's a genius?

387
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,590
He is?

388
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,310
You say he's a genius.

389
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,310
How is he qualified?

390
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,680
We're Master's apprentices

391
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,710
and we grew up together.

392
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,280
But Master only taught him
to make Heaven and Earth in Spring.

393
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,110
He even made me vow to assist him.

394
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,400
What makes me inferior to him?

395
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,560
What makes me?

396
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,310
I hate him.

397
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,560
I just hate him.

398
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,070
So, I wanted to cut his hands.

399
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,760
It's your fault.

400
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,310
It's all your fault.

401
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,590
I'm a genius.

402
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,470
I'm a real genius.

403
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,560
I really am.

404
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:31,920
Wenzhen.

405
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,430
Stone.

406
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,310
Stone,

407
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,560
you have to do something.

408
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,590
Offer your pastry

409
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:47,280
to the Dragon.

410
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,710
Stone,

411
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,400
whether the Dragon comes out,

412
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,880
if your master saw you

413
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:13,800
make the best pastry

414
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,190
when he was in heaven,

415
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,430
he would be relieved.

416
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:23,590
Master.

417
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,190
Blood?

418
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,190
This is the last step.

419
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,830
With blood,

420
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:42,070
it's the real pastry.

421
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,070
Stone,

422
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,160
go ahead.

423
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,040
The world is big.

424
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,070
All creatures live together.

425
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:07,310
I'm the 12th generation
of the Mei's Pastry.

426
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,880
Greetings, Dragon.

427
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,520
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

428
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,680
With a drop of tear
and an honest promise,

429
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
it's made on this special day

430
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,190
when everything is in bloom.

431
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,640
This is the real
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

432
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:36,880
Miss Zhu.

433
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,190
Excuse me.

434
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,040
Miss Zhu.

435
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,000
Miss Zhu.

436
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:46,800
Miss Zhu.

437
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,230
Don't remove the umbrella.

438
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:50,880
It's very good for Miss Zhu.

439
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,190
Miss Zhu.

440
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,000
You've recovered.

441
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,350
Qing,

442
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:58,800
you...

443
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,470
How's your young girl?

444
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,230
Young girl?

445
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,310
What girl?

446
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,830
Mei,

447
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,000
is that you?

448
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,830
Dragon,

449
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:21,430
is that you?

450
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:22,880
I am...

451
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,040
I am the 12th generation
of the Mei's Pastry.

452
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:27,070
My ancestor promised
to make you the pastry.

453
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,110
I've brought it to you.

454
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,430
Great Grandmaster,

455
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,880
did you see that?

456
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,350
I made it!

457
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,950
The Dragon ate it!

458
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:35,800
I made Heaven and Earth in Spring!

459
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,190
I made it!

460
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,040
I made it.

461
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,280
I really did.

462
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,190
Look. What's that?

463
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,830
Demon. The Dragon Demon.

464
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,430
Run!

465
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,640
Run away!

466
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,520
Run!

467
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:23,710
This is Mei Sheng's heir.

468
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,000
He's here for your promise with Mei Sheng.

469
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,640
Mei Dongjing was dead all along.

470
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,160
But he has kept his promise.

471
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,280
It's a real dragon.

472
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,280
Watch out.

473
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,400
Stay defensive.

474
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,070
Dragon,

475
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,160
I've been waiting for this day.

476
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:15,710
This Dragon Scale Arrow

477
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,560
is specially made for you.

478
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,160
It's the Dragon Scale Arrow.

479
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,040
He's in Ji Wenzhen's carriage.

480
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,350
Go. Get the umbrella back.

481
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,790
Mr. Lu.

482
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,150
Darn it.

483
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,880
How dare you deceive me?

484
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,120
Miss Zhu,

485
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,480
who is this dragon?

486
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,310
His name is Gu.

487
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,640
In Bai Ze's Supernatural Creatures,

488
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:46,840
he has a human face and a dragon body.

489
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,480
He's Chi You's descendant.
[*Ancient tribal leader]

490
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,430
Unless he's awakened,

491
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,190
he'll slumber for centuries,

492
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,190
accompanied by drought.

493
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,910
I know how to wake him up.

494
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,270
Come on.

495
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:07,960
Mr. Chang Qing,

496
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,880
Stone's tools are broken.

497
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,480
Can you help me?

498
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:28,640
Stone,

499
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:30,550
they can't exist for too long.

500
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:32,760
You have to be quick.

501
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:27,910
Dragon,

502
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,550
the pastry is done.

503
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,270
Here it is.

504
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:35,520
Taste it.

505
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,120
Is it the right taste?

506
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,190
Mei Sheng,

507
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,150
this is the taste.

508
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,030
This is it.

509
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,760
You're back, Mei Sheng.

510
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,840
You're finally back.

511
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:06,960
I promised you.

512
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,150
When I was traveling,

513
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,600
I always remembered

514
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,880
you were obsessed with this taste.

515
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:13,840
But Dragon,

516
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,240
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:16,790
I've kept you

518
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,670
waiting for too long.

519
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:01,070
Boy, thank you for your persistence.

520
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,520
Dragon,

521
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,190
I knew

522
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,520
Master told the truth.

523
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,600
There is a dragon.

524
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:08,790
There really is.

525
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,390
I finally made it.

526
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,760
Master didn't lie.

527
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,390
You and Mei Sheng are alike in this.

528
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:26,790
Dragon,

529
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,670
may I borrow a drop of your blood?

530
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,270
Alright.

531
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,270
Mei Sheng and I

532
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,150
have to thank you.

533
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,190
Thanks.

534
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,790
The Dragon could have
flown away 500 years ago.

535
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,670
He didn't really want a soul.

536
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:27,880
He wanted an honest man

537
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,910
who would offer his soul.

538
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:33,430
For a little promise,

539
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:36,000
he was trapped under the bridge.

540
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,880
He knew he could get freedom

541
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,550
outside the city.

542
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,030
But he stayed here

543
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,030
for a mystical promise.

544
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,150
This kind of man

545
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,360
is actually a hopeless idiot.

546
00:34:12,430 --> 00:34:13,390
Mei Sheng and the Dragon

547
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,040
kept the promise to each other.

548
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,830
One of them traveled around

549
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,830
and went very far.

550
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:23,910
The other one stayed and waited.

551
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:26,430
They both kept their promise.

552
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:28,670
After 500 years,

553
00:34:29,390 --> 00:34:30,630
they finally met again

554
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,520
and fulfilled their wish.

555
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,830
I think it's been worth it.

556
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,110
The Dragon Scale Arrow
is made of dragon's scales.

557
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,910
If he's shot, he'll die.

558
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,520
I guess when he was in danger,

559
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:50,520
Mei Sheng came out.

560
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,590
The plum on the Red Plum Umbrella

561
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,520
is Mei Sheng's blood
he spat before he died.

562
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,320
The blood froze his soul
on this umbrella.

563
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,520
When Mei Sheng came out,

564
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,320
his soul

565
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,080
would disappear.

566
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:09,320
Qing,

567
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:10,430
go under the bridge

568
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,430
and get back the dragon's tailbone.

569
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,800
What do you need it for?

570
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,280
The dragon's body is useless.

571
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,630
But his tailbone

572
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,240
can be ground into a spoon

573
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,080
for hotpot soup.

574
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,720
Are you serious?

575
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,240
Yes. Just go.

576
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:39,280
Hurry.

577
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,040
Take Miss Zhu to my carriage.

578
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:42,320
All right.

579
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,910
Where were you just now?

580
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:01,080
The puppet strings

581
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,390
seem to be yours.

582
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,150
When Stone lost his hands,

583
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,830
I sensed something abnormal
with Ji Wenzhen.

584
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,110
I guess she also had a helper
who could do puppetry.

585
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:13,910
So, I secretly looked for this guy.

586
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,430
Unexpectedly,

587
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,110
that happened all of a sudden.

588
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,280
Sorry, I'm late, Your Highness.

589
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:23,910
Are you saying Ji Wenzhen did all this?

590
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:24,960
Bajiao.

591
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,590
Ji Wenzhen's maid.

592
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,240
I was looking for her.

593
00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:29,830
But she was gone.

594
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:33,670
Forget it.

595
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,630
Go arrest Ji Wenzhen and her minions.

596
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:37,080
I'm going home.

597
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,800
Forgive me, Your Highness.

598
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,110
My Lord,

599
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,630
I can do anything for you.

600
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:48,240
Why can't you understand?

601
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,110
Mr. Chang, get in the carriage.

602
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:34,670
Your Highness,

603
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,280
you escort Miss Zhu
to Tianxiang Restaurant.

604
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,430
I'm going to Physician Xuan now.

605
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:40,870
Stay safe, then.

606
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,190
You go back in

607
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,040
and tidy up.

608
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,240
Monk,

609
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,560
this tower is your body.

610
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:36,520
If a bit of your soul stays in it,

611
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:39,080
can you come out and see me?

612
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,240
I'm dying.

613
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,800
All I want is to see you again.

614
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:21,480
Monk.

615
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,870
Is that really you?

616
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,080
Miss Fifth,

617
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:27,840
it's me.

618
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,390
I didn't expect

619
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,230
to see you again.

620
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,870
It's been 500 years.

621
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:43,080
My wish has come true.

622
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:45,710
It's been 500 years.

623
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,320
You're still here.

624
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:48,840
Miss Fifth,

625
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:50,710
thank you.

626
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,910
I promised you this

627
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:54,670
and I'll always keep my word.

628
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:59,430
It's been such a long time.

629
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,190
How are you?

630
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,360
How am I?

631
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:09,800
From this day on, we'll fight together.

632
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,910
You're the fifth child of the dragon.

633
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:15,800
How about

634
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,230
