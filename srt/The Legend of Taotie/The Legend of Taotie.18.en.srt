[Episode 18]

23
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,320
Mr. Chang Qing.

24
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,270
Mr. Chang Qing, you're back.

25
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:24,960
Mr. Chang Qing.

26
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,720
Did you get the medicine?

27
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,270
She's healing.

28
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,910
Yes, yes.

29
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,750
Qing.

30
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,470
Qing.

31
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,600
Miss Zhu.

32
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,110
Qing.

33
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,160
You're awake.

34
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,360
Qing.

35
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,830
Where's Heng?

36
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,240
Where's Qing?

37
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,800
Where did Qing go?

38
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,640
You're still asking, Miss Zhu.

39
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,230
It's because you said,

40
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,040
"Qing,

41
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:21,040
where's Heng?"

42
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,270
that drove him away.

43
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,790
I just asked where Heng went

44
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,230
and didn't provoke him.

45
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,880
Who wakes up and first asks

46
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,270
not the person in front of them,

47
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:30,200
but someone else?

48
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,110
Who's the person in front of me

49
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,550
and who's someone else?

50
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,440
Don't know that yourself?

51
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,550
Your tongue

52
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,110
is getting sharper by the day.

53
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,230
I might grab a basin of water

54
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,440
and melt you away.

55
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,110
What are you two talking about?

56
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,440
I knew Qing treats me the best.

57
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,070
Stone just made this

58
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,070
and hasn't thought of a name yet.

59
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,790
He wants you to try it first.

60
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,040
It smells so good!

61
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,670
Stone is amazing!

62
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,390
Is it delicious?

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,920
Stone said,

64
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,320
if you think it's delicious,

65
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,600
then give it a name.

66
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,000
Miss Fifth in Pink.

67
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,270
Let's call it Miss Fifth in Pink.

68
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,950
Miss Fifth in Pink?

69
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,480
That's a good name.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,440
It's perfect for these

71
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:21,110
plump, pink buns.

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,110
What's so good about it?

73
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,790
Why Miss Fifth has to be in Pink?

74
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:26,480
Yeah, Miss Zhu,

75
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,390
what does it mean?

76
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,000
This is what it is.

77
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,830
Why Miss Fifth?

78
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:34,390
Miss Zhu just said it casually.

79
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,880
Who said I said it casually?

80
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,880
Look at these little buns,

81
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,720
don't they look just like me?

82
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,320
Your name is Zhu Chengbi.

83
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,200
You should call them green buns.

84
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,760
Why is it pink now?

85
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
You don't understand.

86
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,390
Anyway...

87
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,760
Anyway, I call them Miss Fifth in Pink.

88
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:45,790

89
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,320
Where's Heng?

90
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,350
It's the first thing you asked
when you woke up.

91
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,550
But you haven't answered me.

92
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,550
His Highness just wanted
to come see you,

93
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,070
but you fell asleep again.

94
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:55,920
Couldn't you

95
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,200
just wake me up?

96
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,720
Seeing how soundly you were sleeping,

97
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,160
His Highness went back home.

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,790
Buruo,

99
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,070
I'll call you Miss Fifth from now on.

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Miss Zhu.

101
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,320
Are you feeling sleepy again?

102
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,200
You should rest more.

103
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,440
That nap lasted quite a while.

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,790
Feels like in the blink of an eye,

105
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
500 years have passed.

106
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,830
That's because
your condition worsened earlier

107
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,040
and you became delirious.

108
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,320
How did you manage to cure me?

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,550
I inquired everywhere,

110
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,830
and heard about Mr. Xuan,
a miracle-working physician.

111
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,110
His Highness and I went to find him.

112
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,440
Physician Xuan?

113
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,350
With such an odd temper,

114
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,600
why would he help you

115
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,390
for no reason?

116
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,790
Nothing happens without a reason.

117
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,390
He is His Highness's uncle.

118
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,070
Is that so?

119
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,350
Then

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,200
I must go thank him.

121
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,000
Princess Wan'er's birthday
is in a few days.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,110
His Highness has already
returned to his residence

123
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,950
to prepare for her banquet.

124
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,640
In that case,

125
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,670
it would be improper to disturb him.

126
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
How about you rest a bit longer?

127
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,390
No.

128
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,880
The weather is so nice.

129
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,480
I want to go out
and eat something tasty.

130
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,110
No way!

131
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,070
You just recovered.
Don't eat recklessly.

132
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,950
If I can't eat freely after recovering,

133
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,350
I'd rather stay sick.

134
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,070
Cuiyan, Yingtao,

135
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,790
bring me my prettiest clothes.

136
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,110
Also,

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,350
none of you are to follow me today.

138
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,480
I want to go out and play alone.

[Ms. Li's Bun Shop]

140
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,670
Ms. Li, a bowl of porridge please.

141
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,920
And two buns.

142
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,510

Ms. Li.

146
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,000
I heard you just had a granddaughter.

147
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:57,670
Congratulations!

148
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,510
Yes.

149
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,440
If I can take care
of my granddaughter in the future,

150
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,640
I'll be content.

151
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,000
These buns are on me.

152
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,790
Thank you, Ms. Li.

153
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,550
Enjoy!

154
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,920
Ms. Li,

155
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,830
give me two buns.

156
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,830
Miss Zhu.

157
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,600
The buns here are still the best.

158
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,920
Ms. Li's buns

159
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,230
are famous far and wide.

160
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,760
If you come late, you don't get any.

161
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,040
Thank you, Ms. Li.

162
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,160
Miss Zhu.

163
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,230
I go to the Inspection Department
every day,

164
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,320
so I can get a few buns daily.

165
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:29,350
You don't come often.

166
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,600
I'll give these two buns to you.

167
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,400
You're much better than Lu Ying.

168
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,400
He's always so grumpy.

169
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,840
Mr. Lu has a bit of a dark face,

170
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:40,840
but

171
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,910
he's quite an extraordinary figure.

172
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,550
He got the Sun-seeking Bow
before he turned 15.

173
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:46,320
And after that,

174
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,960
he fought the Qiong Qi
and slew the Ba She,

175
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,880
and became a young hero.

176
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,030
He was truly impressive!

177
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,670
Where did you learn all this?

178
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:54,320
I...

179
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,150
I learned it from the only

180
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,110
blind storyteller in my village.

181
00:08:58,790 --> 00:08:59,400
And then?

182
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,470
He was famed for the battles.

183
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,280
But at that moment,

184
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,670
he discovered his closest friend

185
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:06,840
was actually a Bai Ze in disguise.

186
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,470
Betrayed terribly,

187
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,790
he rushed to Wuxia City in fury

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,110
to hunt down the Bai Ze.

189
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:13,840
What the storyteller said

190
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,000
can't be taken seriously.

191
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,520
That's true!

192
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,400
What's going on?

193
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,400
Wrong direction!

194
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,520
Hurry, hurry!

195
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,080
How are you?

196
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,590
Come, come, let me help you.

197
00:09:58,670 --> 00:09:59,110
Here.

198
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,320
Come on, lift him.

199
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,000
One, two.

200
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,150
Yundun.

201
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:21,400
How is it?

202
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:22,200
Are you alright?

203
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm fine.

204
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,640
Where is the assassin?

205
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:32,110
Looking at this build,

206
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,470
you don't seem like an assassin.

207
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Official Cai.

208
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:43,960
Hurry!

209
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,320
Grab a pen and make a record.

210
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:48,670
What?

211
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,640
Quickly!

212
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:51,670
Understood.

213
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,960
The rosefinch's feathers
are golden all over,

214
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,470
with four to five uneven tips
at the end.

215
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,590
It can ignite spontaneously.

216
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,590
Under no circumstances

217
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,280
should it be placed
near saltpeter and sulfur.

218
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,110
It seems this explosion

219
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,640
was caused by the golden feathers.

220
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,280
Exactly, exactly!

221
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,590
Golden feathers.

222
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,640
That's a rosefinch.

223
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,790
Since you knew they were
from the rosefinch,

224
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,520
why were they placed near sulfur?

225
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:39,200
Last night, when Mr. Lu
brought them back,

226
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:41,230
I didn't believe it.

227
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,030
So I decided to test it out.

228
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
So it was Official Cai
who caused this mess!

229
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,640
Then the reconstruction costs
for this explosion

230
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,070
will be deducted from your salary.

231
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,320
What do you know?

232
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,950
16 years ago,

233
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,070
I heard about an incident
involving the rosefinch.

234
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,920
After that, no one saw them again.

235
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:07,190
I thought they had gone extinct.

236
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,240
But now it seems

237
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
there's still hope.

238
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,000
There's still hope!

239
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,320
Where's Mr. Lu?

240
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,040
Mr. Lu went to Pingyue House.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,880
He went again?

242
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:22,830
When?

243
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:23,710
Last night.

244
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,630
It's already dawn.

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,390
This...

246
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,630
He was there the entire night?

247
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,360
The night of rendezvous
is always too short.

248
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,320
It would cost him

249
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,190
half a month's salary!

250
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,120
What are you talking about?

251
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,510
Is everything cleaned up?

252
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,120
Did you finish the 500

253
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,830
target practice shots?

254
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:39,710
Disperse.

255
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,040
Give me the pen, and you can leave too.

256
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:43,830
Yundun.

257
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,120
Cai.

258
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,190
What else?

259
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:47,950
- I'll record for you.
- I heard

260
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,480
you admire Mr. Lu greatly.

261
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,150
Of course!

262
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,590
Mr. Lu is a legendary figure

263
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:55,070
in our village.

264
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:56,360
He's the greatest archer.

265
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,590
It was his fame

266
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,710
that inspired me to become an archer.

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,320
In this case,

268
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,040
I'll open your eyes.

269
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,440
Let's go.

270
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,510
My buns!

271
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,560
My buns!

272
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,360
Let me ask you something.

273
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,830
When you heard that loud bang earlier,

274
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,510
why didn't you run inside?

275
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,750
Instead, you went around to the back.

276
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,070
Isn't that strange?

277
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,440
My reaction at the time

278
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,480
was fast.

279
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,440
My mind raced with possibilities.

280
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,120
Miss Zhu, think about it.

281
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,360
Our Inspection Department

282
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,000
usually just hunts beasts,

283
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,190
but who knows

284
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,590
we've offended some villain.

285
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,320
If there were indeed troublemakers,

286
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,750
I might have fallen into their trap

287
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,680
if I had gone
through the main entrance.

288
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,190
Luckily, I was cautious

289
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,040
and went to the back door

290
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,680
to climb up that crooked tree.

291
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,190
Holding a bun in your mouth, right?

292
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,630
Ms. Li's cooking is excellent.

293
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:49,880
I don't want to let it go to waste.

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,510
[Pingyue House]

295
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,040
We've arrived.

296
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,120
Pingyue House?

297
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,320
So this is the Pingyue House
they always talk about?

298
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,590
It's just an ordinary music house.

299
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,710
But why do they act so strangely

300
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,270
when they mention it?

301
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,750
And they even
lower their voices so much

302
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,240
like they're hiding something.

303
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,680
Do you really not know?

304
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,150
I really don't know.

305
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,070
In the first 16 years of my life,

306
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,150
I lived in Weiyi Mountain
north of Wuxia City

307
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,150
with my grandfather, who was a hunter.

308
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:23,040
I've only been in Wuxia City for a year.

309
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,680
There are lots of things I don't know.

310
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,390
That's understandable.

311
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,120
With the meager salary
of an archer like you,

312
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,000
you can't even afford
a single song here.

313
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,560
A single song

314
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,590
costs that much?

315
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,150
It's just for an ordinary singer.

316
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,950
If it's the famous girl Qu Yan,

317
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:39,560
your half a year's salary
might not be enough.

318
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Qu Yan?

319
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,680
Who is Qu Yan?

320
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,150
It costs that much?

321
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,710
I don't understand.

322
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,360
Do you really think people come here

323
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,390
just to listen to music?

324
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,000
Come, let me explain.

325
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,510
If you fancy a girl here,

326
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:55,510
coming to listen to her music

327
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,830
and spending a bit more silver,

328
00:14:57,270 --> 00:15:00,040
and you can have tea and chat with her.

329
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,190
If you spend even more silver,

330
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,150
you can go to her room

331
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:06,040
to discuss poetry and art.

332
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:07,040
Then,

333
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,150
what if I spend even more silver?

334
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,390
Smart question.

335
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,440
I was about to say

336
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,750
the more silver you spend,

337
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,190
the more you can do, right?

338
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,920
Exactly.

339
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,440
If you spend enough silver,

340
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,800
you can spend a romantic night with her.

341
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,630
Isn't that something

342
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:24,590
you do after marriage?

343
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:25,830
Come with me.

344
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,360
Miss Zhu,

345
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,270
that's not good.

346
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,390
I've already spent all my salary
for this month.

347
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,750
My guests,

348
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,440
what brings you here?

349
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,040
Bring Qu Yan to me.

350
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:56,560
Miss,

351
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,440
did you enter the wrong place,

352
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,510
mistake the location,

353
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,390
or are you asking for the wrong person?

354
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,270
I'm not mistaken.

355
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,390
I'm asking for the girl

356
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,240
who came uninvited last year

357
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,000
with a string harp,

358
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,360
suddenly appearing at the entrance
of Pingyue House,

359
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,480
Qu Yan.

360
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,560
Isn't this Miss Zhu
from Tianxiang Restaurant?

361
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,150
Apologies for not greeting you earlier.

362
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,070
I'm so sorry that

363
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,040
I didn't recognize you.

364
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,440
Well,

365
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,070
bring out all your performers.

366
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,800
This young man is so handsome.

367
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,560
His face looks so delicate.

368
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,000
Miss Zhu.

369
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,750
Last time at Tianxiang Restaurant,

370
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,710
the Bee Soup Wontons

371
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,320
that I had

372
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,880
is unforgettable to this day.

373
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
What brings you here today

374
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,480
to our place?

375
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,680
I really came here to find Qu Yan.

376
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,070
She's not available right now.

377
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
Has Lu Ying not left yet?

378
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,070
Miss Zhu.

379
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,150
Mr. Lu is quite busy.

380
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
He can't come here every day.

381
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,320
Then call her out.

382
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:02,920
I want to hear her music.

383
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:04,920
Miss Zhu.

384
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,680
You must be joking.

385
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,200
Why can Lu Ying listen

386
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,270
but I cannot?

387
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,600
Do you think I can't pay?

388
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,080
No, no.

389
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,630
Speaking of that night,

390
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,470
after the man in black
injured someone and fled,

391
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,510
Mr. Lu led a group of men

392
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,750
chasing all the way to Pingyue House.

393
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,350
They happened to meet Miss Qu Yan,

394
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:27,470
sitting behind a screen,

395
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,510
playing music.

396
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:05,390
Chase!

397
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,110
So, you see,

398
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,990
he saved her life.

399
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,440
That's incomparable.

400
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,230
Right, right, right.

401
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,200
Mr. Lu is not only an expert archer,

402
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,470
but also versed in music.

403
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,870
He could tell from the music
that she was calling for help.

404
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,990
It's truly remarkable.

405
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,750
If he isn't skilled,

406
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,920
how could he win Miss Qu Yan's favor?

407
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,110
It's said that Miss Qu Yan

408
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,990
has a frosty demeanor
and stands out uniquely.

409
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:30,750
Even a nobleman

410
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,600
whose name cannot be mentioned

411
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,150
traveled from Yunlong City

412
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,560
just to catch a glimpse of her beauty.

413
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:36,720
He was turned away at the door

414
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,390
and could only see her silhouette

415
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,350
through heavy curtains.

416
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,630
She is indeed beautiful.

417
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:44,510
That's right.

418
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,390
That nobleman said exactly these words

419
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:47,990
after seeing her silhouette.

420
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:56,720
A soulmate

421
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
is hard to find.

422
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,960
It's such a pity.

423
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,270
Miss Qu Yan is a famous

424
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,960
songstress.

425
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:05,110
Even if Mr. Lu is interested,

426
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,840
it may still be hard

427
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,960
to fulfill his wish.

428
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:11,680
Yundun.

429
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:13,840
Mr. Lu.

430
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,560
Why are you here?

431
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,350
Earlier at the Inspection Department,

432
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:21,680
there was an explosion.

433
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,080
I came specifically to inform you.

434
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,600
What?

435
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,680
Miss Zhu, I must take my leave.

436
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,150
This...

437
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,720
What's going on?

438
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,230
Miss Zhu,

439
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,470
please follow me upstairs.

440
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,270
The male bird
stands proudly on the branch,

441
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
while the female bird
joyfully spreads her wings.

442
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,080
Amidst the blossoms,

443
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,680
they gaze at each other lovingly.

444
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,390
You have ultimately fallen for him.

445
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,270
Miss Zhu.

446
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:11,920
You came

447
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:14,080
not just to hear me play, did you?

448
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,870
I came to tell you something.

449
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,390
After you hear it,

450
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,470
if you play me a tune as thanks,

451
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,350
it would only be fair.

452
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,110
If you were to smile,

453
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,560
what would it look like?

454
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,270
I suffered a tragedy in my early years,

455
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,470
and since then, I can no longer smile

456
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,110
nor cry.

457
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,680
Why did you come to Wuxia?

458
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,990
It's truly a sad story.

459
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:17,470
If a person is completely broken,

460
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,350
it doesn't matter where they go.

461
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,630
Coming to Wuxia

462
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,990
was merely a coincidence of fate.

463
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,470
I came to warn you.

464
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Lu Ying may already know

465
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,840
your true identity.

466
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,750
Why do you say that?

467
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,110
The explosion
at the Inspection Department earlier

468
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,800
was caused by the golden feathers
of the rosefinch.

469
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,870
Those feathers were likely

470
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:40,920
taken from you by Lu Ying secretly.

471
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,440
He gave them to Official Cai

472
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,390
to confirm if you are the rosefinch.

473
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,510
Those feathers

474
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,230
were given to him by me personally.

475
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:50,560
Why?

476
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,230
Excuse my boldness.

477
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,230
I gave him the feathers

478
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,350
so that you would follow the trail
to find me.

479
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,200
Why did you want me to find you?

480
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,040
Because rosefinch eggs

481
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,080
are the most coveted delicacy
in the world.

482
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,990
I've heard of your skill
in cooking beasts.

483
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,720
And you've always been searching

484
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,270
for the rarest ingredients in the world.

485
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,230
Rosefinch eggs, really?

486
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,510
You've reached the time

487
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,470
when you lay an egg every 16 years?

488
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,750
In the 16 years
since my late husband passed,

489
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,800
my heart has long been ashen.

490
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,720
I never thought that this year,

491
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,870
I would lay an egg as expected.

492
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,440
If there was no male bird,

493
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,560
then your egg

494
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,320
can't hatch anything valuable.

495
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,750
Rosefinch eggs are
rare ingredients in this world.

496
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,390
I'm willing to give it

497
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,720
to you.

498
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:13,560
Give it to me?

499
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,350
What are your conditions?

500
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,510
I know that you've protected Wuxia City

501
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:27,720
and guarded the Lotus Tower
for 500 years.

502
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,800
I'm willing to receive your protection.

503
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:33,080
If one day,

504
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,510
I find the murderer of my late husband

505
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,870
and avenge his death,

506
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,470
I hope you will not pursue my faults.

507
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,510
Stop talking about vengeance.

508
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:44,750
You're still young.

509
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,150
You may still meet a good man.

510
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,080
I think Lu Ying is a good choice.

511
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,600
We are from different worlds.

512
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,680
The distance between him and I
is not just a canyon.

513
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,960
It'd only bring unnecessary troubles.

514
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,200
Even with such a gap,

515
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,350
don't forget

516
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:01,600
you still have wings.

517
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,320
You make it sound easy.

518
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,600
But you also

519
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:08,990
have a human by your side,

520
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,080
and you dare not get too close

521
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,960
or let him go.

522
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,840
You've hesitated until now.

523
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,270
It's none of your business.

524
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,560
I have overstepped my bounds.

525
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,040
Forget it.

526
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,840
For the sake of the rosefinch egg.

527
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:39,720
But it's a pity

528
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,470
that this rosefinch egg
can only be eaten once.

529
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:44,800
Once eaten,

530
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,600
it'll forever settle in your bloodline.

531
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,750
Second time,

532
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,320
even a tiny bit will

533
00:25:52,390 --> 00:25:54,630
cause you to burn from the inside out.

534
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,110
So you must be careful.

535
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,350
Rest assured.

536
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,320
I'll definitely be careful.

537
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,870
And I will figure out a way to make it

538
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:03,150
so it can only be eaten once.

539
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,630
I have one more request.

540
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,990
I hope the rosefinch egg
will be expensive.

541
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,920
That way, for the diners,

542
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,150
it will seem precious to them.

543
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,150
Expensive?

544
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,080
What if no one comes to eat?

545
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,840
Once eaten,

546
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,920
it'll be unforgettable for life.

547
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,720
People will flock to it.

548
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:42,990
Mr. Chang.

549
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,600
I have specially
asked the imperial physician

550
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,800
to prepare some tonics

551
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,870
to nourish and strengthen the body.

552
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,270
They are all valuable medicinal herbs

553
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:50,320
and will greatly benefit
Miss Zhu's recovery.

554
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,040
Your Highness,

555
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:52,990
you came at the wrong time.

556
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,110
She's not here.

557
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,990
She went out for a bit.

558
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,870
She's just recovered
and already went out?

559
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,470
Miss Zhu's temperament
is truly remarkable.

560
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,270
Well then,

561
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,510
I will wait here.

562
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:05,510
Mingyan,

563
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:06,750
give them the herbs.

564
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:09,630
Cuiyan,

565
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
take the herbs.

566
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,350
Our Tianxiang Restaurant

567
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,750
doesn't lack in herbs.

568
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:18,150
Just take them.

569
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,600
Miss Zhu may use these

570
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,040
when preparing some trivial

571
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:21,920
medicinal dishes.

572
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:30,320
Yingtao,

573
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,750
pour tea for His Highness.

574
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,440
As what you said,

575
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,600
it seems like my actions

576
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,390
were unnecessary.

577
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,350
Thank you, Your Highness.

578
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:50,750
The herbs may not be used.

579
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,270
But the gesture is appreciated.

580
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,720
When Miss Zhu was seriously ill,

581
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,800
I didn't have time to care for her.

582
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,390
Thankfully, you looked after her
at Tianxiang Restaurant.

583
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,470
What I did is nothing.

584
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,390
How can it compare

585
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,510
your selfless actions

586
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,600
of seeking medicine for her?

587
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,960
I owe Miss Zhu 300 taels of silver,

588
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,200
so I should save her.

589
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,960
But I wonder

590
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,390
why you care so much about her.

591
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:17,440
Is there something you owe?

592
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,920
I didn't get a chance to ask you.

593
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,110
What did Physician Xuan say

594
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,110
when he called you in last time?

595
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,040
How did it work?

596
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,870
Are you sure you have to do this?

597
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,870
I've said it before,

598
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:44,990
it's not so simple.

599
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,750
Her injury

600
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,350
is an old wound from 500 years ago.

601
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,990
Accumulating over hundreds of years,

602
00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:52,750
it's already deeply afflicted.

603
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,680
In order to heal,

604
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,630
it will naturally
require an extraordinary price.

605
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,600
Aside from the herbs from these beasts,

606
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:06,350
she needs a human's life as a catalyst.

607
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,150
There must be someone

608
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,470
who is willing to sacrifice
their life for her.

609
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,110
So

610
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,840
you must quickly find such a person.

611
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,560
Decide quickly.

612
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,560
Her time is running out.

613
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,440
Alright.

614
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:41,960
I'll do it.

615
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,320
Are you sure you want to do this?

616
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,920
Once you sacrifice your life,

617
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,270
you'll only have
six months left to live.

618
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,390
Think it through carefully.

619
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:57,680
Don't regret it later.

620
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,840
Taking the herbs from the beasts

621
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:02,800
was already a grave sin on my part.

622
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:03,870
I cannot escape the blame.

623
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,270
How can I take someone else's life?

624
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,320
No need to say more.

625
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,470
I'm willing to do it

626
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,630
to save her.

627
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,080
Physician Xuan's skills
are extraordinary.

628
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,350
I'm just an ordinary person.

629
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,840
How could I understand
the methods he used?

630
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,870
Perhaps he was helping me

631
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:33,440
because of you.

632
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,960
If it were for my sake,

633
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,630
he'd have kicked you out right away.

634
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,440
Really?

635
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,560
Seems your relationship with him

636
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,870
is quite extraordinary.

637
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,270
You think he only knows
how to save lives?

638
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,230
He's better at preserving lives.

639
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:53,630
Qing.

640
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:56,990
Look.

641
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,720
What treasure did I bring back?

642
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,630
Heng, you're here.

643
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,870
What's this that you're holding?

644
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:09,720
How about I call you
Miss Fifth from now on?

645
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,510
Are you going

646
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,960
to steal my treasure

647
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,080
to celebrate the princess's birthday?

648
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,230
How could I?

649
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,390
That day, after you took the medicine,

650
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:31,150
you fell into a deep sleep.

651
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
I had to leave for something.

652
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,040
Miss Zhu, are you fully recovered now?

653
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,270
I'm fine now.

654
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,600
Everyone, look.

655
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,270
An egg?

656
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,350
This egg is so amazing.

657
00:31:59,270 --> 00:31:59,840
This

658
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,470
is a rosefinch egg.

659
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,990
Very delicious.

660
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,270
Miss Zhu.

661
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,800
Is this rosefinch egg tasty?

662
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,470
Of course.

663
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,630
Its taste is unforgettable.

664
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,110
It's just an egg.

665
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,150
What's so unforgettable about it?

666
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,080
Since it's so delicious,

667
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,350
how about boil it so we can try?

668
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,960
Boil it?

669
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,440
This is a rosefinch egg,

670
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,470
not a chicken egg.

671
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,870
You want to just boil it?

672
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,800
It's such a waste.

673
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:34,600
Miss Zhu,

674
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,630
how do you plan to prepare it?

675
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,840
I'll make Hibiscus Flame.

676
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,350
Hibiscus Flame?

677
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,270
Correct.

678
00:32:44,470 --> 00:32:46,630
The egg layers
are cooked one by one in the pot

679
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,560
like a blooming hibiscus flower.

680
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:49,870
The best ingredient

681
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,350
is this rosefinch egg.

682
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,200
Yingtao,

683
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:55,990
go get our fortune tube.

684
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:57,350
Add some more sticks

685
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,720
to make it 81.

686
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,270
Yes.

687
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,350
What is this for?

688
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,040
Are you going
to read fortunes for people?

689
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,470
You're still the accountant, huh?

690
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:10,870
One stick costs 100 taels of silver.

691
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:14,110
This time, Tianxiang Restaurant
will make a big profit.

692
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,560
One stick is 100 taels of silver,

693
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:19,990
then ten sticks is a thousand.

694
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,270
One egg costs 100 taels of silver.

695
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,230
No one will buy it at that price.

696
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:25,870
Cuiyan.

697
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,270
You were crying and cranky this morning.

698
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,960
And now you're thinking about money?

699
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,560
I don't understand you women.

700
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,560
You change too quickly.

701
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,230
Why do you care?

702
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:46,040
Okay, I'll go along with you.

703
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,470
Then tell me,

704
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:48,630
what's your plan to get rich?

705
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,720
Each stick costs 100 taels of silver.

706
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,350
Only those who can afford this price

707
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,320
are qualified to have their name
written on the stick.

708
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,110
But

709
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,440
one can only eat Hibiscus Flame once.

710
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,560
Every time,
it has to be decided by a draw.

711
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,870
It will be drawn by me personally.

712
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:02,600
Then, Miss Zhu,

713
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,870
how many sticks
should we draw at a time?

714
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,600
Let's wait until someone buys it first.

715
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,430
I'll be the first.

716
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,230
Mr. Chang Qing should support too.

717
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,080
I might as well take this stick

718
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,880
to calculate my own lifespan.

719
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,640
If that's the case,

720
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,950
you owe me 400 taels of silver.

721
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,230
Blush powder.

722
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,120
Spices from Persia.

723
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,600
Come have a look.

724
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,950
Blush powder from Persia.

725
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,230
Come have a look.

726
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,840
Here, here, blush powder.

727
00:34:55,950 --> 00:34:56,640
Have a look, is it good?

728
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,670
See if this works.

729
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,880
Blush powder, do you want it?

730
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,400
Stop the carriage.

731
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,320
Here, blush powder.

732
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:06,510
Lian.

733
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,080
Have a look.

734
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,160
Blush powder.

735
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,750
New blush powder.

736
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,320
Yutong.

737
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,190
Yutong!

738
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,080
What are you doing?

739
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:24,800
Yutong, it's me.

740
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,950
I'm Chen Ze, Yutong!

741
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:26,950
Yutong!

742
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,190
How dare you offend the Princess?

743
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:28,710
Go away.

744
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,990
Princess?

745
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,470
She is not the Princess, she is...

746
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:33,910
Wait.

747
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:34,270
She...

748
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,950
You, blush powder seller,

749
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,670
bring your stuff
to Jiangshan Restaurant.

750
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,560
I'll choose it myself.

751
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:57,710
Yes, Your Grace.

752
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,510
Yutong, look.

753
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:06,920
This is the new

754
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,710
Persian rose blush powder I got.

755
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,750
See if you like it.

756
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,600
You've mistaken me.

757
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,920
Eight years ago,

758
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:28,790
my childhood sweetheart Yutong

759
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:32,310
was bought by a family from the capital.

760
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,160
All these years have passed,

761
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,230
why do you still remember me?

762
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,160
You should've forgotten me long ago.

763
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,440
I can't forget, I can't forget.

764
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,230
It's all my fault.

765
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:46,640
Back then,

766
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,510
I didn't dare to ask my family
to propose to you.

767
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,160
It's all my fault.

768
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,080
I didn't dare to take you away

769
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,710
to elope.

770
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,030
I've always wanted to ask

771
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,990
what happened?

772
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,030
His Majesty betrothed
Princess Li Wan'er

773
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,230
to Prince of Langya.

774
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,920
But Li Wan'er died unexpectedly.

775
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,550
To preserve this royal marriage,

776
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,310
the Northern King Li Tingdong
secretly sent people

777
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,550
to find someone similar to Li Wan'er.

778
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
I was chosen.

779
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,160
There is no more
Qin Yutong in the world,

780
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,400
only Li Wan'er.

781
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,950
That day, we made
an appointment to meet.

782
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,920
I waited for you all night,

783
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,680
but you didn't show up.

784
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,550
Since that moment, I knew

785
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,640
man's promises and tears

786
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,360
are so worthless.

787
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,310
But I must thank you.

788
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,710
Luckily, you didn't take me away.

789
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:54,470
Otherwise,

790
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:55,990
I'd be

791
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,230
a countrywoman with children now,

792
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,750
with dirt forever stained

793
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,030
under my nails.

794
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,710
Go, leave Wuxia.

795
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:08,680
We'll never meet again in this life.

796
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,360
I beg you.

797
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,470
Please don't drive me away.

798
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,550
I swear.

799
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:16,120
I will never reveal

800
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,230
even a single secret of yours.

801
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,950
Now you have recognized me,

802
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,440
my father will not let you off.

803
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,310
He will send someone to kill you.

804
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:25,880
You should leave now.

805
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,920
Pretend you don't know me.

806
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,640
I'd rather die than leave you.

807
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,160
So Chen Ze, let me tell you.

808
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,710
In order to preserve my love for him,

809
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,270
I would rather kill you now.

810
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,640
Do you understand?

811
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:45,030
Why?

812
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,080
There is always one person

813
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,600
who makes you willing
to sacrifice everything for her.

814
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,310
And you

815
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,920
are the person I'm willing to do so for.

816
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:57,920
Stop talking.

817
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,270
It's too late for you
to say anything now.

818
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,790
Yutong.

819
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,550
Yutong.

820
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,550
Yutong!

821
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:06,920
Yutong.

822
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:42,640
Your Grace.

823
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:46,790
Your Highness.

824
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,950
Your Grace, you're back.

825
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,160
Yes, Your Highness.

826
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,470
I heard from the servants that
you went to the jewelry shop today.

827
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,600
Did you find anything you liked?

828
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,310
I...

829
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,200
I have enough of those things.

830
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,510
It's just that
I was a little bored in here,

831
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:06,200
so I just went out for a walk to relax.

832
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,550
How can you women

833
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,990
ever have too many jewels?

834
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,230
Even if you buy them
just to keep in your room,

835
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,160
it's still a joy to look at.

836
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:17,710
Even I'm moved

837
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,080
by Your Highness's love for Her Grace.

838
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:20,310
Mingyan.

839
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,080
When did you become so slick with words?

840
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:23,510
No.

841
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,920
I'm just speaking from the heart.

842
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:30,840
One man is wealthy beyond measure,

843
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,840
yet he is willing
to spend thousands for a woman.

844
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,790
While another man has only ten coins,

845
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:37,790
but he is willing
to spend it all on a woman

846
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,030
to buy rouge and powder.

847
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:41,600
Which one do you think

848
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:43,510
is truly more precious?

849
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,440
I think

850
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,200
the former one is more precious.

851
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,160
Your Grace, what do you think?

852
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,080
I think

853
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,470
the latter one is the most precious.

854
00:40:57,950 --> 00:40:59,120
This answer is the best.

855
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,790
I will take my leave first.

856
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,270
I won't bother you playing chess.

857
00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:24,270
It seems that today

858
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,790
Her Grace's not in a good mood.

859
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,600
But the birthday celebration

860
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,840
you're preparing for her

861
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,880
will surely make her happy.

862
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,270
I don't think so.

863
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,360
Lian.

864
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,880
I want to rest now.

865
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:45,590
Are you not coming to serve me?

866
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:48,590
Wan'er.

867
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,350
Your Highness.

868
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,960
It's still early.

869
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,120
Why not have some lotus seed soup
before going to sleep?

870
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,510
Thank you, Your Highness.

871
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,310
Your Highness.

872
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,680
This...

873
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,120
This is not lotus seed soup.

874
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,590
You don't look well today.

875
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,480
Is it because of

876
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,720
going out to meet friends?

877
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:44,550
Your Grace.

878
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:46,830
Your Grace.

879
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,440
Did you have a nightmare?

880
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,480
Your Grace, I...

881
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,120
It's nothing.

882
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,240
I just had a nightmare.

883
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:11,030
Why are you so restless today?

884
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:13,640
Your Grace.

885
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:14,720
I...

886
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,030
I just saw a ghost.

887
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:17,680
Nonsense.

888
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,160
In this grand residence,

889
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,200
why would there be any ghosts?

890
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:21,680
It's true, Your Grace.

891
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,480
That ghost even thought

892
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,790
I was secretly meeting
a peddler during the day.

893
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:34,590
So you said

894
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,480
I know that peddler?

895
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:36,680
I...

896
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:40,750
Your Grace, I...

897
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,510
Forget it.

898
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:47,160
Help me change.

899
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:48,990
I need to go see His Highness.

900
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,680
It's so late.

901
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,750
Why do you need
to see His Highness now?

902
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:55,270
His Highness

903
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:58,550
probably already knows.

904
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:14,750
Your Grace.

905
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:18,270
You two can leave first.

906
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:19,880
Yes.
