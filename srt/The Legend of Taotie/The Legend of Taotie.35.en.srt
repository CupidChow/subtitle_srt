Miss Zhu felt unwell.

25
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,800
So, I sent her back for some rest

26

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,670
Sesame seed cakes for sale.

194
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,200
Every day, people starve to death.

195
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,960
You can't pity all of them.

196
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,590
No.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,760
I'm thinking.

198
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,030
A blind man is said to know everything.

199
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:23,880
Maybe

200
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,710
he knows about the illegal food.

201
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,030
Sesame seed cakes.

202
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:30,710
I'll take one.

203
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:32,960
Here you are.

204
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,030
Sesame seed cakes.

205
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,030
Thank you so much.

206
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,590
Thank you.

207
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:51,880
Sir,

208
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
I'd like to ask you something.

209
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,080
I've heard some grains are being sold.

210
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,080
Is that true?

211
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,590
Soldiers die,

212
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,790
but illegal grains are sold.

213
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,790
So, it's true.

214
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,230
Sir, do you know

215
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,080
where the grains are sold?

216
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,280
Well,

217
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,230
I'm not very sure.

218
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,590
Do you smell the wine?

219
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,440
There's a wine market up the street.

220
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,550
There's an alley inside it.

221
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,590
Go there and ask around.

222
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you, sir.

223
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,280
Thank you so much.

224
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,440
Thank you, gentleman.

225
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,350
Your Highness,

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,550
the two of us will attract
too much attention.

227
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,030
Why don't you wait here?

228
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,590
I'll go.

229
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,030
Your gross look

230
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,910
attracts more attention.

231
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:05,910
Fine.

232
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,840
Stop.

233
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,790
What do you want?

234
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,840
Gentlemen,

235
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,910
I've heard grains are sold here.

236
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,910
My father has been sick in bed for days.

237
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,080
He won't close his eyes
until he eats something.

238
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,590
Have you brought enough money?

239
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,470
Each dou of grains

240
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,200
is worth two liang of silver.

241
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,910
So expensive?

242
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,470
I have only two liang of silver.

243
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,200
Can you give me a little more?

244
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,280
No money, no grains.

245
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:34,960
- Go.
- Go away.

246
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:35,640
- Leave.
- Leave.

247
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,910
Fine, fine.

248
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,230
I'll take one dou.

249
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,030
Money.

250
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,710
Here.

251
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,030
- Get in there.
- Get in.

252
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:04,960
Thank you, sir.

253
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,590
- Out you go.
- Go.

254
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,320
Let's go.

255
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:22,760
I bought some at a high price.

256
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:23,670
Check it.

257
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,320
It's the unhusked rice from the army.

258
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,150
How dare someone sell it illegally?

259
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,840
So, I'm right.

260
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,910
Some insider must
have colluded with them.

261
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,670
This is outrageous.

262
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,520
How dare they do that?

263
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,640
Let's go back.

264
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,550
Yes.

265
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,520
Mingyan.

266
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:57,710
These days,

267
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,790
I've been curious about one thing.

268
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,320
Why is Father

269
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,280
so interested in Miss Zhu?

270
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,840
Today, Father urged me many times

271
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,880
to take Miss Zhu to the palace.

272
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,350
Does he really want

273
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,150
a mere dish?

274
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,520
Mingyan.

275
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,470
What do you think

276
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,350
my father really wants?

277
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:26,350
I don't dare to guess.

278
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,320
Feel free to talk

279
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,440
in front of me.

280
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:30,960
I think

281
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,280
His Majesty has power and ladies.

282
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:36,590
What he wants most

283
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,670
must be immortality.

284
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:39,880
I heard

285
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:42,080
the flesh of a millennium demon

286
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,080
would make people immortal.

287
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,030
Millennium demon?

288
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,150
Is it...?

289
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:54,230
I've heard she is
the human shape of Taotie.

290
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,550
Mingyan,

291
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:00,760
prepare a carriage.

292
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,320
Send Miss Zhu out of town
at the first light of dawn tomorrow.

293
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
Why, Your Highness?

294
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,400
Don't ask.

295
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,590
Remember.

296
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,520
Don't let anybody know it.

297
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,230
I'm on it.

298
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:25,760
Zhu Chengbi will come tomorrow.

299
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,400
Make sure nothing will go wrong.

300
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,470
Your Majesty, have you decided

301
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,440
which prince will be used?

302
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,200
If you were me,

303
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,400
who would you pick?

304
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,520
Don't be angry, Your Majesty.

305
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:40,640
I don't dare to comment.

306
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
But I observed the stars.

307
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,590
The True Dragon has appeared.

308
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,590
Your Majesty, make a decision soon.

309
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:49,280
Your Majesty.

310
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:07,640
Miss Zhu.

311
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,880
Your Highness?

312
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,470
Mr. Chang is badly injured.

313
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:11,960
He's sent back to the camp for recovery.

314
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,150
What?

315
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,150
Chang Qing is badly injured

316
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,960
and he's dying.

317
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:17,960
Mingyan!

318
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,200
The carriage is waiting
at the back door.

319
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,790
Mingyan has prepared everything

320
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,880
you need for the trip.

321
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,550
Leave now.

322
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:25,000
Miss Zhu,

323
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,080
it's still early.

324
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,440
The carter will take you out of town

325
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,080
and ride to the frontier.

326
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,150
When you're out,

327
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,440
don't come back.

328
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,000
His Majesty is here.

329
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,320
I didn't know you would come.

330
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,400
I'm sorry, Father.

331
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,480
Do you plead guilty?

332
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,390
I do.

333
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,830
I shouldn't have tried
to let Miss Zhu out.

334
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,630
I didn't do what you asked me to do.

335
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,510
Punish me, Father.

336
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,000
You disobeyed me.

337
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,190
If I wanted to punish you,

338
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:16,000
you would have been dead.

339
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,070
Your Highness, you asked me to go

340
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,800
because you knew
His Majesty would hurt me, huh?

341
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,750
How dare you?

342
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,120
Kneel to His Majesty.

343
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,920
I never kneel for anyone

344
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,120
even if he's the emperor of humans.

345
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,560
You...

346
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,360
Somebody.

347
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:33,560
It doesn't matter.

348
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,120
Alright.

349
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I've heard

350
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,830
Miss Zhu is extraordinary.

351
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,000
Now, when I see you,

352
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,630
you're really excellent.

353
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,440
Why do you want me to cook for you?

354
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,560
Do you want the Immortality Dish

355
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,560
to make yourself immortal?

356
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,440
My father is beneficent.

357
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
He wouldn't kill people.

358
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,270
You're such a good son.

359
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,750
I'm guilty, Father.

360
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,880
His Highness isn't guilty.

361
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,350
If I want to leave,

362
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,080
no one can stop me.

363
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,560
His Highness is innocent.

364
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,840
You're bold, Miss Zhu.

365
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,110
It makes sense.

366
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,200
But today,

367
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,680
you're both wrong about me.

368
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:22,200
People live and die.

369
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,080
What I want

370
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,960
isn't the Immortality Dish.

371
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,230
So, I get you wrong.

372
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,350
As the emperor,

373
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,230
I must make contributions.

374
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,150
I must love my people.

375
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,680
If I want to be immortal

376
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,040
for thousands of years

377
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,350
while my people suffer from wars,

378
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,750
what will immortality help?

379
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,750
So, what I want

380
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,510
isn't a mere dish.

381
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:00,920
What do you want, then?

382
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,560
All right.

383
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,080
You leave us.

384
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,470
I'll talk to Miss Zhu alone.

385
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:16,560
Yes.

386
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,350
Cuiyan,

387
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,630
leave us.

388
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,990
Miss Zhu,

389
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,350
I know you're extraordinary

390
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,110
and you know everything.

391
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,560
So, you must know

392
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,600
why I wanted to see you.

393
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
You want me to make a dish.

394
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,960
But before you tell me,

395
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:48,560
how do I know which dish you want?

396
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,630
Miss Zhu, do you know

397
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:55,800
why my state has been peaceful

398
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,390
and my people

399
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:00,870
have been living a happy life?

400
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,870
I'm sure you're aware

401
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,600
I know the truth of the Garuda

402
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,320
and the Yao's Army on the frontier.

403
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,990
Why do you bother to ask?

404
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,150
Miss Zhu, you know that.

405
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,840
But my people don't.

406
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,510
They still believe the legend

407
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,680
that when the Garuda lives,
Da Liang will survive.

408
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,350
But now,

409
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,870
the Garuda's legend is gone.

410
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,350
We need a new legend.

411
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,800
Miss Zhu, you should know.

412
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,870
The legend of the True Dragon

413
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,800
is the best thing to help Da Liang

414
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,870
out of the trouble.

415
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,230
The True Dragon?

416
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:49,920
It's not that easy to have it.

417
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,960
I won't beat about the bush.

418
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,470
Whether we can have the True Dragon

419
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,870
depends on the dish you make.

420
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,080
I'll never make

421
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:03,920
such a wicked dish.

422
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,080
Besides,

423
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:08,040
the True Dragon is free.

424
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,110
It can come to this world

425
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,040
or fly anywhere else.

426
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,200
If you forcibly summon it,

427
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,270
your little state

428
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,390
can't bear the consequences.

429
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,150
Miss Zhu, what do you mean?

430
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,150
There has been a legend.

431
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:24,720
The True Dragon came twice
in ancient times.

432
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,680
It brought peace to the world

433
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,960
and people lived a good life.

434
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,080
But people don't know.

435
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,800
During that,

436
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,920
it possessed Emperor Fuxi once

437
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,080
and then it possessed Dayu.

438
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:39,350
The two of them were brave immortals

439
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:41,630
who could bless the world.

440
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,320
Now, the True Dragon
has been asleep for centuries.

441
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,720
Its power is out of control.

442
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,470
But humans

443
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,960
have been living a befuddled life.

444
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,720
They have far weaker bodies

445
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,150
than they had in ancient times.

446
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,470
I don't think they can
hold the True Dragon's power.

447
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,560
If you summon it forcibly,

448
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,960
I'm afraid it will

449
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,230
bring a crushing blow.

450
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,080
And I'm sure you know

451
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,440
what you need for this dish.

452
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,630
So,

453
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,390
Your Majesty,

454
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,840
you're really cold-blooded.

455
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,320
Watch your language, Miss Zhu.

456
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,150
I want you to rethink it.

457
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,680
As for the ingredient...

458
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:26,320
It's my family business.

459
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:30,320
You don't need to bother.

460
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,720
Do what you need to do.

461
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,230
Yes, Father.

462
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,600
Your Highness, why did you let me leave?

463
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,040
I thought

464
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:11,270
Father would make you into a dish.

465
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,040
You feared he would eat me?

466
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,680
Do you think that's possible?

467
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,720
I'm so terrible.

468
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:21,150
How could I suspect my father like that?

469
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,560
Don't worry.

470
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,920
The Immortality Dish

471
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,630
needs flesh and blood
from a voluntary demon.

472
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
I believe your father knows that.

473
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,440
But anyway,

474
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,960
he doesn't want this dish.

475
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,150
What does he want, then?

476
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:22,560
[Account Book]

477
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,470
It's indeed here.

478
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,680
[Account Book]

479
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,920
[The court offered...]

480
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,960
[Unhusked rice]

481
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,400
[Millet]

482
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,320
According to the record,

483
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,920
[Totally 2,000 dan]
there are 2,000 dan of grains.

484
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,990
Bandits robbed them of 1,000 dan.

485
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,680
This is obviously an excuse.

486
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:47,960
Nobody in the army knew

487
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,040
that grains were stolen.

488
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,870
Military grains
were escorted by soldiers.

489
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,350
However savage the bandits were,

490
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,470
they wouldn't dare to fight soldiers.

491
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,230
It must be an excuse.

492
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,840
Those escorting soldiers

493
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,200
must have been killed, too.

494
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,750
Your Highness,

495
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,680
Mr. Wu has been handling

496
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,040
the grain delivery.

497
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,630
Now, soldiers are starving

498
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:06,960
while nobody cares for them.

499
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:08,200
Someone

500
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,720
must have covered this case.

501
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,720
My Lord, you're back.

502
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:13,960
Hurry, Your Highness.

503
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,230
Your Highness.

504
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,560
We left in such a hurry.

505
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,320
We shouldn't have
left the account book.

506
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:27,390
Without the evidence,

507
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,390
you can't punish
these corrupted officials.

508
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
I'll go there again

509
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:31,960
to get back the account book.

510
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:32,920
Wait.

511
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,400
[320 dan of unhusked rice]

512
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,870

00:24:45,870 --> 00:24:48,640
[480 dan of wheat]

516
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,630
200 dan was delivered.

520
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,270
I can't believe

521
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,630
you forget nothing, Your Highness.

522
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,200
You remember everything

523
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,080
in that account book.

524
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,800
No wonder

525
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,150
so many grains are secretly sold.

526
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,230
They secretly took out

527
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,270
[One load of beans]
some of the grains.

528
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,470
It's done.

529
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,270
And some grains

530
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,840
were "robbed" by the bandits.

531
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:18,870
They make up

532
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:21,150
all the grains from the court.

533
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,680
It makes sense now.

534
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,320
I'll go catch that guy

535
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,560
and punish him by law!

536
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:27,920
Wait.

537
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,870

He has great power in court.

542
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,990
If we only punish the grain escort,

543
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,680
it's just a short-term solution.

544
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:42,230
We must send this message

545
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,920
back to Yunlong

546
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,720
and get our soldiers out of starvation.

547
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,870
Your Highness, you have a point.

548
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,080
We can't alert them.

549
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:49,680
You send a reliable man

Now, he's the only one I can trust.

553
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:57,960
Ask him to tell Father about it.

554
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,230
Yes, Your Highness.

555
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,080
How dare you?

556
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,080
You came all alone

to steal from the General's Mansion.

558

came with Prince Ai's letter.

571
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,440
Father, please give out an order

572
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:07,440
to inspect him.

573
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Keep it between us

574
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:13,150
in case we alert him.

575
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,990
Now, Mr. Wu commands the Palace Guards.

576
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,350
We can't let down our guard.

577
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,230
We need a perfect plan.

578
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,440
Yes, Father.

579
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,470
How's Miss Zhu doing in your mansion?

580
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Thanks for your concern.

581
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,040
She's fine.

582
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,840
When you're back, ask her.

583
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,840
Has she changed her mind

584
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,270
to make the dish for me?

585
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,560
Yes.

586
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,150
Miss Zhu, I have a question.

587
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,510
Tell me.

588
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:03,750
If you make the dish

589
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,990
my father wants,

590
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,840
will our people be united

591
00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:08,990
and our state be peaceful?

592
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,680
Do you know what dish it is?

593
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,510
I just know

594
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,390
this dish is good for our state.

595
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,080
This dish

596
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:23,150
is the Heart Skewer.

597
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,750
It can make everyone in your state

598
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,110
unite as one

599
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,110
and fight against their enemy.

600
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,110
But the hard part is...

601
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,470
It needs a special ingredient.

602
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,720
What is it?

603
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,230
Mr. Wu.

604
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:55,990
Sit.

605
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:03,440
Our spy sent a message from the palace.

606
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,510
His Majesty decided
to make that dish again.

607
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:09,960
That dish?

608
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,630
The Third Prince...

609
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,150
He's still young.

610
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm afraid...

611
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,200
We'll stick to our plan.

612
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,230
Don't breathe a word of this.

613
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,320
It's you, Qu.

614
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,230
Father.

615
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:36,990
Come over here.

616
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:38,510
Your Majesty,

617
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,630
the Third Prince hunted

618
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,960
a dear today.

619
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,080
It's made into a venison pancake.

620
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,600
Please taste it.

621
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,390
Qu,

622
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,200
it's so sweet of you.

623
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,390
I'll taste it when I have time.

624
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,630
It tastes good when it's hot.

625
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,350
Don't be too tired, Father.

626
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,440
Have one to refresh yourself.

627
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,350
Qu,

628
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,750
you really care for Father.

629
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,990
Hope you'll grow up soon

630
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,510
and help Father.

631
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,990
Today,

632
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,510
I have important things to do.

633
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,390
How about you go back?

634
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,680
I'll take my leave, then.

635
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:16,510
All right.

636
00:31:27,630 --> 00:31:28,230
Your Majesty,

637
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,150
let me test it.

638
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,440
All right.

639
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,200
If you insist on helping your father

640
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,350
to make this dish,

641
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,510
you'd better think
about who will be sacrificed.

642
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,080
Or...

643
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,200
Has your father made the decision?

644
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:11,750
Your Majesty.

645
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:12,630
Your Majesty.

646
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,230
You must not eat the pancake.

647
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,470
Eunuch Cheng tasted it

648
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,680
and he bled to death.

649
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,470
Go.

650
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,430
Go get me Zhao Qu.

651
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:41,720
Yes, Your Majesty.

652
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,390
Tell me your opinions.

653
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,000
The Third Prince is proven guilty.

654
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:14,510
As the emperor and his father,

655
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,510
how shall I punish him?

656
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,510
Why are you silent?

657
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,550
Fine.

658
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,390
Send him to the Court of Judicial Review

659
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,640
and punish him by law.

660
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,120
Father.

661
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,670
Please rethink it, Father.

662
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:38,480
Qu is...

663
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,910
He's a little boy.

664
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,310
He wouldn't do anything like that.

665
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,430
Zhao Heng,

666
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,960
how can you prove he's innocent?

667
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,640
Please give me some time, Father.

668
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:55,840
I will find out the truth.

669
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,030
Your Majesty,

670
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,960
this case remains unclear.

671
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,480
And you usually

672
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,550
love the Third Prince.

673
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:10,840
Someone must have

674
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,790
used him to hurt you.

675
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,790
Your Majesty, if you

676
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,920
kill the Third Prince,

677
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,310
you'll regret it.

678
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,200
Mr. Wu,

679
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,230
the Third Prince is your grandson.

680
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,310
I understand it

681
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,360
when you plead for him.

682
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,550
But yesterday,

683
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,990
if a eunuch hadn't tasted the cake,

684
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,840
you would be here in mourning clothes.

685
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,120
Do you think I fell for that?

686
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,710
Or do you think I'm too fatuous

687
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
to tell right from wrong?

688
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:06,750
Send the Third Prince
to the Court of Judicial Review.

689
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,510
Whoever pleads for him

690
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,440
will be punished the same way!

691
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,750
The court is done!

692
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,950
I heard the Third Prince is in custody.

693
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,120
Yes.

694
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,360
Don't you think it's too coincidental?

695
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,790
When a prince is needed,

696
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:57,790
the Third Prince is available.

697
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:01,470
But anyway, you're lucky.

698
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Your father

699
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,790
didn't pick you

700
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:06,750
for the Heart Skewer.

701
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,840
If one prince has to be sacrificed,

702
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,310
I would rather sacrifice myself.

703
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,790
Why don't you sacrifice the Third Prince?

704
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
He seems to be the best choice.

705
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,120
When I was his age,

706
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,470
I grew up alone in the lonely palace.

707
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Without Zhao Ai,

708
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:31,160
I would have died in such a place

709
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,510
full of schemes and lies.

710
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,880
If Father really

711
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,080
set my brother up

712
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,400
just to make this dish,

713
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,510
I would rather die.

714
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,310
After all, I'm a prince, too.

715
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,310
And I'm his eldest brother.

716
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:54,790
Besides,

717
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,310
I may not live long.

718
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,880
Have you...?

719
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,680
Really made up your mind?

720
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,230
I didn't expect His Majesty

721
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,510
to set Qu up and imprison him so soon.

722
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:21,600
He's even accused
of killing His Majesty.

723
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:23,710
We're too late.

724
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,270
Under such circumstances,

725
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:30,030
Your Majesty has decided

726
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:31,550
to use Qu for that dish.

727
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:35,230
What can I do?

728
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,440
Take it easy,

729
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,030
Mr. Wu.

730
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:40,510
Miss Zhu hasn't agreed to cook.

731
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,270
So, the Third Prince

732
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,950
must be safe now.

733
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,600
But we need a careful plan

734
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,120
to get him out.

735
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,920
I have only one single daughter.

736
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,440
Qu is my only grandson.

737
00:37:59,270 --> 00:38:00,120
At whatever cost,

738
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,680
I must get him out.

739
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,510
Please tell me what to do.

740
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,270
You're here to plead for Qu, huh?

741
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,230
Father,

742
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,160
it's not that I'm finding an excuse.

743
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,470
But...

744
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,670
All the things that have happened lately

745
00:39:11,910 --> 00:39:13,640
seem to be related to Mr. Wu.

746
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,320
This is really weird.

747
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:16,950
And the venison pancake...

748
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:18,190
Qu is a little boy.

749
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:19,950
He would never do that.

750
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:21,430
I thought about it.

751
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,710
Only Mr. Wu is suspicious.

752
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,670
I guess he made a risky move.

753
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,950
When he killed you,

754
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,160
he could take everything under control

755
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,750
and overthrow your reign.

756
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,910
Father, I request

757
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:36,950
to imprison Mr. Wu and his clan

758
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,840
and investigate all these cases

759
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,670
to vindicate my brother.

760
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,040
You're very clear-headed.

761
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,910
But it's not that easy

762
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,080
to take down Mr. Wu.

763
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:55,190
He has great power in court.

764
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:57,840
So now, we have to stay quiet.

765
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,560
Father,

766
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,840
we have enough evidence.

767
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,360
Embezzling military rations alone

768
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,710
will get him beheaded.

769
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,560
Why do we have to stay quiet?

770
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,640
He's been working for decades

771
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,750
and his power is fertile.

772
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,670
He dares to move so recklessly

773
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:36,880
just because he knows
I can't do anything to him.

774
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,910
Don't forget.
He commands the Palace Guards.

775
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,040
So, we must not make a move

776
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,160
unless we have to.

777
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,320
When he moves,

778
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,320
we'll move accordingly.

779
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,600
But Father...

780
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:53,710
All right.

781
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:55,510
Say no more.

782
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:57,910
You may leave.

783
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:01,510
Yes, Father.

784
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,360
I'll take my leave.

785
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,040
Miss Zhu,

786
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:31,750
my third brother is young.

787
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,230
Is there any other way
to make the Heart Skewer?

788
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:36,710
No.

789
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:38,910
And how can you be sure

790
00:41:38,910 --> 00:41:40,600
His Majesty wants the Third Prince?

791
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,320
She's right.

792
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,080
Not everyone

793
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,990
can easily figure out

794
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:46,990
what His Majesty wants.

795
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,800
In this case,

796
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,360
who is the True Dragon?

797
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,320
Your second or third brother?

798
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,430
I thought about it all night.

799
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,910
I've made up my mind.

800
00:41:59,190 --> 00:41:59,910
Whatever it takes,

801
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,840
I'm willing to sacrifice
for my brothers.

802
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,160
Why do you have to sacrifice yourself?

803
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,080
You're close to Zhao Ai.

804
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,160
I understand

805
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,160
you don't want him to die.

806
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,190
What about Zhao Qu?

807
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,270
He's a mere prince

808
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:12,560
who hasn't grown up.

809
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:13,990
If we sacrifice Zhao Qu...

810
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,910
First,

811
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:17,670
he's the best choice
among the three of you.

812
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,190
Second,

813
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,040
we can use him
to get rid of the toughest force.

814
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,470
Third,

815
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,510
your father loves him instead of you.

816
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,430
Sacrificing him

817
00:42:25,670 --> 00:42:27,510
is the best choice for you,

818
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,320
isn't it?

819
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:31,990
Over the years,

820
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,750
I haven't stayed in the palace.

821
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:37,400
Zhao Ai grew up with Zhao Qu.

822
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,430
They have been really close.

823
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,320
When Zhao Ai returns

824
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,040
and knows Zhao Qu

825
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,750
was killed by Father,

826
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,320
he would be crazy.

827
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,080
I'm Zhao Ai's brother,

828
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:54,270
but I can't always keep him company.

829
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,710
You used to be cynical.

830
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,230
I can't believe
you'll sacrifice yourself

831
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,230
just to stop your brother
from feeling sad.

832
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,430
When I was little,

833
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,400
because I was a semi-demon,

834
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,080
Father gave me the silent treatment.

835
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:19,600
Everyone in the palace excluded me

836
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,750
until I met Zhao Ai.

837
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,040
When I saw him,

838
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,880
I thought he was the little me.

839
00:43:28,750 --> 00:43:31,160
He was so timid,

840
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:33,270
sitting alone in a corner.

841
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:34,880
Eat it.

842
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,750
For a mere piece of rice cake,

843
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,750
he trusted me so much.

844
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,560
Whatever others said about me,

845
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,160
he defended me all the time.

846
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,230
He was my only playmate in my childhood

847
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,800
and my only brother.

848
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,910
I care for Zhao Ai.

849
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,120
I believe

850
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,510
he feels the same about Qu.

851
00:43:59,950 --> 00:44:00,840
I must do my duty

852
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,160
as their eldest brother.

853
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,120
I get it.

854
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:13,670
But now,

855
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,230
I'm not sure about something.

856
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:18,510
I remember you said

857
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,470
your mother was from Yujiang.

858
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,270
Yes.

859
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,990
Do you remember how she passed away?
