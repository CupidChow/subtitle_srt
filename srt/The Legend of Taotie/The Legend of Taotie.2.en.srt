[Episode 2]

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,880
It smells so good. So good.

27
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,000
Why does it smell so good?

28
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm hungry now.

29
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,270
Do you want to sell it?

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,160
How much should I pay?

31
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,720
How dare you!

32
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,960
This is the Prince of Langya, the new Mayor of Wuxia.

33
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,470
Behave yourself!

34
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,240
Girl,

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,030
why did you say that just now?

36
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,830
Do I smell of something special?

37
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,160
Because you're a beast.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,470
And a very fragrant one.

39
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,190
You're asking for it!

40
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,000
Easy.

41
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,550
I've always heard

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,800
Miss Zhu is best at cooking beasts.

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,030
You deserve your reputation.

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,440
But I didn't expect you

45
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,520
to be so interesting.

46
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,440
Come here.

47
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,880
This girl is the best chef in the world?

48
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,520
This is

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,880
fried with sea salt.

50
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,800
Have a taste.

51
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,320
How's it?

52
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,030
It's really extraordinary.

53
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,470
However, Miss Zhu,

54
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,440
it's still inferior to what I brought.

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,320
The Black Turtle from Beidi.

56
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,030
Chisel its tortoise shell to get its meat

57
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,630
and pickle it with gold foil

58
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,190
to preserve the flavor forever.

59
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,830
It is the best of the best in the world.

60
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,030
No wonder you smell like a beast.

61
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,950
It's its smell.

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,830
Mingyan.

63
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,270
Your Highness.

64
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Don't you understand?

65
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,160
Put your sword back.

66
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,270
You want me to cook it?

67
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,070
Exactly.

68
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,070
No.

69
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,160
How dare you!

70
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:41,760
Miss Zhu.

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,440
I also have temper.

72
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,320
Exactly.

73
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,110
You're a prince.

74
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:55,510
You!

75
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:57,720
Your Highness.

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,000
What Miss Zhu means…

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,200
The beast is spiritual.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,070
The fresher, the better.

79
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,880
Sashimi is the best.

80
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,480
Braising and scalding take second place.

81
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,110
Steaming and boiling take last place.

82
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,550
You have kept this meat for so long.

83
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,920
It has long lost its spirituality.

84
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,350
Even if the flavor does not change,

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,720
what's the difference with a piece of ham?

86
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,390
I take your point.

87
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,110
I take your point.

88
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,480
Miss Zhu.

89
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,270
If we don't do business today,

90
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,230
I'll go up and hang the white cloth

91
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:30,070
to avoid misunderstanding.

92
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,390
Why did you hang it earlier?

93
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,070
He's so handsome!

94
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,830
He is also a prince.

95
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,160
I have never seen

96
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,550
such a handsome man in my life.

97
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,760
How long do you live in this life?

98
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:49,790
However, Miss Zhu,

99
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,760
even if the cloth hung out,

100
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:53,320
what if I want to eat it?

101
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,670
Can you do me a favor?

102
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,510
This meat should not be cooked by me.

103
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,670
Take it back to your royal chef,

104
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,600
Zhao Heng.

105
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,040
You know me?

106
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:06,230
Yes, of course.

107
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,060
Zhao Heng, the Prince of Langya.

108
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,200
Everyone knows you.

109
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,600
But you didn't come to Wuxia

110
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,830
just to let me cook this meat, did you?

111
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,510
I am good for nothing.

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,440
I was not able to stay in the capital.

113
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,550
So I was sent here

114
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,480
in charge of the Inspection Department.

115
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,920
Inspection Department?

116
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:34,880
So from today on,

117
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,830
thank you, Miss Zhu.

118
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,110
I can't take your gratitude.

119
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,550
But if the Inspection Department

120
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:46,000
catches any rare beast in the future,

121
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,000
you must think of me.

122
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,070
Absolutely.

123
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,670
Rare animals

124
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,670
must be shared with Miss Zhu.

125
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,670
It sounds like I am so greedy.

126
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,200
But I tell you what,

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,070
if there's any beast secretly hidden

128
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,270
in Miss Zhu's Tianxiang Restaurant

129
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,550
and you don't tell me,

130
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,110
I won't allow it happen.

131
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,550
I heard that someone carried a jar

132
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,670
into the Tianxiang Restaurant yesterday.

133
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,270
Was that the merman?

134
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,110
The merman eats people.

135
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:21,760
If it's hidden here,

136
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,480
that'll be very dangerous.

137
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,880
Let's go.

138
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,880
I ate the perch yesterday

139
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,950
raw with mustard.

140
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,660
Your Highness is late.

141
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:45,640
Where's others?

142
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,830
Just the two of us.

143
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:48,950
No one else.

144
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,510
Look.

145
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,550
My taste

146
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,110
is really light recently.

147
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,670
I really want to eat a special dish.

148
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,790
Since Miss Zhu cooks beasts

149
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,040
so well, then…

150
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,230
I don't have any beasts here.

151
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,000
Look at my Tianxiang Restaurant.

152
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,320
It's been closed for a long time.

153
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:12,440
Get out of the way.

154
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,000
Mingyan.

155
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,030
Let's get back.

156
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,280
Official Xu.

[Inspection Department]

158
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,400
Official Xu.

159
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,670
Official Xu.

160
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:38,710
Official Xu.

161

Official Xu.

162
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:50,440
Official Xu.

163
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,110
I am Xu Shuying, an official of Imperial Academy.

164
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Greetings, Your Highness.

165
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
Official Xu, please.

166
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,110
Thank you, Your Highness.

167
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:07,150
I have long heard

168
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,520
that Official Xu

169
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,030
has written the book
“Records of Beasts in the Continent”

170
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,790
In the book, you described
all the rare animals in the world.

171
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,320
This time, I am ordered by my father

172
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,640
to be in charge of the Inspection Department.

173
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,590
About the Lotus Tower,

174
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,590
I need to consult with you.

175
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:23,960
Your Highness, please.

176
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,350
I heard that

177
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,320
500 years ago, Monk Lotus's kindness

178
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,590
secretly influenced the beast Taotie

179
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,670
who broke into the world.

180
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:34,230
This led the Portal open

181
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,080
and a large number of beasts
have broken into the human world.

182
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,110
Some of them were ambitious.

183
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,670
Led by the Black Qilin King,

184
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,080
they intended to massacre human
and occupy two worlds.

185
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,670
Monk Lotus fought with him in Wuxia,

186
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,440
which is the closest place

187
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,470
between the two worlds.

188
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,150
Although he did not win a complete victory,

189
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
he suppressed him

190
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,080
by turning his body into the Lotus Tower.

191
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,350
Is this true?

192
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,400
Your Highness,

193
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,640
that's right.

194
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,880
That is the origin of the Lotus Tower.

195
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
From this point of view,

196
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,350
the Lotus Tower is down and the Black Qilin King is out.

197
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,960
It's true.

198
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,640
Is the damage to the Lotus Tower recently

199
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,640
related to the Black Qilin King?

200
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,080
About this matter,

201
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,840
I'm not sure.

202
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:18,280
Please forgive me.

203
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,960
Your Highness, you went to
Tianxiang Restaurant today.

204
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,470
What information have you got?

205
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Why did you say so?

206
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,670
Miss Zhu's origin is a mystery.

207
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,640
She cares about Lotus Tower very much.

208
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,790
It has long been rumored

209
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:36,110
that she was

210
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,880
the incarnation of that Taotie.

211
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,230
Jiao.

212
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:57,710
Jiao.

213
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:10,640
Jiao.

214
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:13,760
Jiao.

215
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,200
Hard work for you, Jiao.

216
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:36,590
Not at all.

217
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:48,080
Are you okay?

218
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
Miss Zhu.

219
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,440
What's the matter with you?

220
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,200
You're a lady.

221
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
In broad daylight,

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,790
it's not decent.

223
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,550
How can you fall asleep

224
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,670
while chatting in front of a strange man?

225
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,000
If you hadn't stopped me last night,

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,790
I would have gone to bed early if I was full.

227
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,200
Why did I talk so much nonsense?

228
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,000
You still want to eat Jiao?

229
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,000
Actually, before going out,

230
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
I have eaten Jiao.

231
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,280
You're lying.

232
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:22,910
No.

233
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,590
Then I'd be blind.

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,470
I have been here for so long.

235
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,710
What little trick

236
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,840
can you hide from me?

237
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:31,760
Besides,

238
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,880
As long as you lie,

239
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,150
your eyes

240
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,320
will turn around.

241
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,280
If I knew it,

242
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,590
I would starve you to death at the door
of Tianxiang Restaurant.

243
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,030
Tell me the truth.

244
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,760
What are you up to?

245
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,320
Do you really want to give Jiao
to Prince of Langya?

246
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,150
Yeah.

247
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,440
If you do this,

248
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,520
you're hurting Jiao.

249
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,840
The Inspection Department's job
is to catch beasts.

250
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,520
I'm just making use of an opportunity.

251
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,470
Oh, I see.

252
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,030
Do you want to take a chance
to have a finger in the pie?

253
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,000
There's no way.

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,670
I'm hungry.

255
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,350
You!

256
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:10,280
Why do you have such big temper?

257
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,880
Qing!

258
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,710
Jiao.

259
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:18,640
Jiao.

260
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,000
Stop. Stop.

261
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,670
I want to see Jiao.

262
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,640
- I want to see Jiao.
- Stop.

263
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,350
- Stop.
- Jiao.

264
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,030
- Stop.
- Jiao!

265
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:23,710
You cannot enter.

266
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,520
So here you come.

267
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:26,880
Mister Chang Qing.

268
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,440
Mister Chang Qing.

269
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,640
I want to get Jiao back.

270
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:31,910
I can't make the decision.

271
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,000
Mister Chang Qing.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,640
Who is it?

273
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,840
Who dares to shout in my Tianxiang Restaurant?

274
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,000
Miss Zhu.

275
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:39,710
Cuiyan.

276
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,280
Mister Gao Cong.

277
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:44,320
I'm afraid you don't know

278
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,840
the rules of my Tianxiang Restaurant.

279
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,840
Miss Zhu.

280
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:49,840
Miss Zhu.

281
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,280
Miss Zhu.

282
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,230
I regret it.

283
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,230
Didn't you let me go back

284
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,760
and think about it?

285
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,550
I thought it over.

286
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,110
I shouldn't have sold Jiao.

287
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,000
After all, she is my beloved woman.

288
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,470
There are many fortunes in the world,

289
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,840
but Jiao is always my only treasure.

290
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,880
Please let me get my love back.

291
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,520
You called her monster when selling her.

292
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,440
But now you call her your lover.

293
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,400
Ridiculous.

294
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,030
I thought of Jiao's kindness to me in the past.

295
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,400
I really regret it.

296
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,320
It's all my obsession

297
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,230
that I did such an indecent thing.

298
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,000
Please give her back to me.

299
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:28,440
I will treat her well!

300
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,760
Mister Gao Cong.

301
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:31,590
How can you

302
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,840
easily regret it

303
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,320
when doing business?

304
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:35,590
If this goes out,

305
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:36,880
how can Tianxiang Restaurant

306
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,440
do business?

307
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:39,960
Miss Zhu, please show mercy.

308
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,790
I was just in a moment of madness

309
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,550
to do such a shameful thing.

310
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:45,710
Miss Zhu.

311
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:47,030
Please give Jiao back to me.

312
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,000
I would be very grateful.

313
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,030
Even if I agree,

314
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Jiao may not want to go back with you.

315
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:58,030
Since she is your wife,

316
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,880
you have to follow her wishes.

317
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:04,440
Here's the thing.

318
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,790
If she wants to go back with you today,

319
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,280
I will help you two.

320
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:11,470
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

321
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,910
You really want him to get Jiao back?

322
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,000
Jiao.

323
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:26,470
Jiao.

324
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,470
Jiao.

325
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,150
Jiao.

326
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,030
I'm inhuman!

327
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,150
It's all my fault!

328
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:31,910
I'm inhuman!

329
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,150
I'm inhuman!

330
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,030
We should live together

331
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,470
and die together.

332
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,280
This is the vow that can be made

333
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,590
between the closest relatives and loved ones.

334
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,590
We took vows before.

335
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,760
But I sold you out

336
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:49,760
because I wanted to be rich for a while.

337
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,790
I spent more than ten years studying in vain,

338
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,960
but lived as a wife seller

339
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,520
and ungrateful bastard.

340
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,430
Now,

341
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,230
I regret it.

342
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,470
If I treat you bad again from now on,

343
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,590
I will be doomed

344
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,880
eternally.

345
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:31,680
My dear.

346
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,830
Would you forgive me?

347
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:00,000
My Tianxiang Restaurant is not your home.

348
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,160
If you want to cuddle, go back to your home.

349
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:03,880
My dear.

350
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Let's go home.

351
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,040
Sure.

352
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,680
Not going?

353
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,520
Stop hanging around in front of my eyes.

354
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,110
Thank you, Miss Zhu.

355
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:15,920
Let's go. Let's go.

356
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,280
Let's go.

357
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:21,590
Is what you said

358
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,710
a little too mean?

359
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:39,260
[Jia Residence]

360
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,400
What are you doing?

361
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,590
What are we doing?

362
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,800
You ate so many of our brothers.

363
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:53,400
You're plump now.

364
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,560
It's time for us to have a good meal.

365
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,230
No!

366
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,280
Mr. Jia.

367
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,230
Your nightmares

368
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,590
come more and more frequent.

369
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,190
The plan has been implemented.

370
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,640
I will surely give the merman to you.

371
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,190
After you eat the merman,

372
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
it will cure the nightmare.

373
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:08,920
How much is this?

374
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,760
This water spinach costs a penny for a catty.

375
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,280
Is it fresh?

376
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:12,800
Yes.

377
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,520
I just pulled it out of the ground this morning.

378
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,070
The Inspection Department is handling cases.

379
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:14,520
What about this?

380
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,710
The merman once appeared here.

381
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,280
No trace can be left behind.

382
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:17,680
Yes!

383
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,760
What's the matter?

384
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,400
Have you heard of it?

385
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,920
Someone

386
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,310
saw the merman nearby.

387
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,400
Don't frighten me.

388
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,830
How could I frighten you?

389
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,830
They really landed?

390
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,470
Is it true or not?

391
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,000
Lady.

392
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,830
Why are you leaving?

393
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,070
Do you want this?

394
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,520
We have been wearing the same dress

395
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,070
for two months.

396
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,710
When can Mister

397
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,710
draw a new one for us?

398
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Indeed.

399
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,000
I saw a pair of cherry red earrings

400
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,760
on the street the other day.

401
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,470
They are perfect for me.

402
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,830
If I wear it,

403
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,400
I must be so beautiful

404
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,830
that the Prince of Langya can't even
open his eyes.

405
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,350
Can't open his eyes because of your beauty?

406
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,400
I think you will be so ugly

407
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,470
that even the Prince of Langya
dares not look at you.

408
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,000
Cuiyan, what are you talking about?

409
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,710
I'm teaching you a lesson!

410
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,160
Cuiyan, stop!

411
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,920
Cuiyan!

412
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:36,830
Stop!

413
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,110
Stop!

414
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
In the daytime,

415
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,350
it won't be a ghost, right?

416
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,710
What kind of ghost dares to come
to Tianxiang Restaurant?

417
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,920
Don't frighten yourself.

418
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:48,640
Yes.

419
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:50,520
Go.

420
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,000
Okay. Go.

421
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,000
Go.

422
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,000
This is the third time this month.

423
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,280
A ghost in the daytime?

424
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,590
Are you really afraid?

425
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,750
Mister.

426
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,230
Since Miss Zhu plays so hard,

427
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
of course we should cooperate.

428
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,000
Miss Zhu.

429
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,640
What are you up to this time?

430
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm hungry.

431
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,640
My illness is getting serious.

432
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,400
Look, my hands can't even move.

433
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:46,830
Qing.

434
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,760
I'm so sick.

435
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,950
Don't you care about me?

436
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,590
Of course I do.

437
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:52,830
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

438
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,280
Go and fetch Miss Zhu's Taotie Cauldron.

439
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,000
Mister.

440
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,920
Draw me new clothes.

441
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,230
Draw me new earrings.

442
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,590
You two go get the thing first.

443
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,070
Mister.

444
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,640
Why does Miss Zhu get whatever she wants?

445
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We get nothing we want.

446
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,590
Exactly.

447
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,920
Although you look good,

448
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,400
you're very biased.

449
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,470
All right.

450
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,470
You two maidservants have gone bad.

451
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,160
Let me redraw two

452
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,280
to replace you.

453
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,920
I don't want Taotie Cauldron.

454
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,800
Qing!

455
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,880
You know what I want!

456
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,590
I know your bodies are stiff

457
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,560
and you love sleeping.

458
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,040
But what's wrong with you now

459
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,110
is not about that.

460
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,280
The problem lies in your appetite.

461
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,110
Since I met you two years ago,

462
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,070
I knew you have the problem of eating beasts.

463
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,000
You can be cured by smelling before.

464
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,070
Why not now?

465
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,230
It changed, okay?

466
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,680
You just try to eat the beast.

467
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,230
Yes!

468
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,950
Here comes Prince of Langya.

469
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,800
It seems that

470
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,640
I come at the wrong time.

471
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,280
At the right time!

472
00:23:58,710 --> 00:23:59,280
Wait a second.

473
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,190
Don't go.

474
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,430
Why does he come again?

475
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,430
Where's the turtle?

476
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,190
Miss Zhu, what's the matter with your hands?

477
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,190
Your Highness.

478
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:10,880
Mingyan.

479
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,640
I am here to deliver meat.

480
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:14,950
Cuiyan, Yingtao.

481
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,640
Bring my incense.

482
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,000
You.

483
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:22,590
Follow me.

484
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:23,230
What are you going to do?

485
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,430
You don't let me eat any beast.

486
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,040
I'll show you.

487
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,560
Gluttonous girl.

488
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,310
You know this bacon

489
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:19,280
has long lost its spirituality.

490
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,520
It's the same as ordinary ham.

491
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,920
Why are you so obsessed?

492
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,800
I just want to tell you today that

493
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,800
as long as I am willing to do,

494
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,350
dead things can also become alive.

495
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,920
Didn't you say it was bacon?

496
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,590
Just watch.

497
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,310
It's alive!

498
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,350
Marvelous.

499
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,400
You do it.

500
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,830
Enjoy it.

501
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,470
This meat

502
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,830
melts at the mouth.

503
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,000
The gravy is filling.

504
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,230
Even the taste is the same as ordinary fresh meat.

505
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:32,880
No.

506
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,430
It should be better.

507
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:36,430
Miss Zhu's cooking skill

508
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:38,160
is worthy of being the best in the world.

509
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,590
This is called reincarnation of beast.

510
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:44,350
This is called never change.

511
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,040
Leave him alone.

512
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:53,710
Miss Zhu.

513
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:54,950
He's gone.

514
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:55,920
Don't pretend.

515
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,310
What do you mean by that?

516
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,070
The meat of the beast,

517
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:01,280
I have tasted it before.

518
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,430
Even if Miss Zhu is a good cook,

519
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:04,950
you can't control life and death.

520
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,160
The so-called theory of reincarnation

521
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,680
is just physical change

522
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,040
instead of qualitative change.

523
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,760
Even if the meat is delicious,

524
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,310
there is no spirit of beast.

525
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,830
You can tell it.

526
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,680
If cooking

527
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,430
can solve all the problems,

528
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,040
I don't have to fight with that stinky Qing.

529
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,280
Qing?

530
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,800
This nickname is quite interesting.

531
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,040
Interesting?

532
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,190
Let me tell you.

533
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:34,640
I'm really good at nicknames.

534
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,710
Look at them.

535
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,110
The green is called Chunjiu.

536
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,430
The red is called Xiefen.

537
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,560
Are they good?

538
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,680
Chunjiu, Xiefen.

539
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,880
Let me give you one, too.

540
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,310
You're Heng.

541
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:45,760
You!

542
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:46,470
You

543
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,310
are Choudoufu.

544
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,520
Miss Zhu.

545
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,190
My surname is Zhao and my given name is Heng.

546
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,310
Just call me by my name.

547
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,640
Heng, you come to me again today.

548
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,880
Is there no delicious food at home?

549
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:05,640
Recently, there have been traces

550
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,880
of merman in the market.

551
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,680
The mermen are cruel

552
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,520
and dangerous.

553
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,160
I came to remind Miss Zhu.

554
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,040
But I also heard that

555
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,230
the meat of merman is delicious.

556
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,190
Don't you want to taste it?

557
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,470
Sure enough.

558
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,800
You can still see me through.

559
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,310
What is that?

560
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:05,640
Monsters! There are monsters!

561
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,190
Monsters!

562
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,160
There are monsters!

563
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,310
Let's go.

564
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,760
Go.

565
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,880
Husband!

566
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,280
Husband!

567
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:37,710
Father.

568
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:38,920
Daughter.

569
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,430
Go back with me.

570
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,830
Father, I can't leave him.

571
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,040
Father.

572
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,230
Husband!

573
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,160
Jiao!

574
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,950
Husband!

575
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,230
Husband!

576
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:58,350
Run fast!

577
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:00,800
They're mermen!

578
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,350
Husband!

579
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,430
Husband!

580
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:39,640
Chase!

581
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,430
Chase!

582
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,470
Hurry up.

583
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:50,950
How are you?

584
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,230
I'm the one who dragged you down.

585
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,310
If you and I never met,

586
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,070
you would not be expelled from the Gao

587
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,590
and you would not end up with a broken leg.

588
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,070
I have dragged you down from beginning to end.

589
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,190
Now my father and brother have come.

590
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,430
It's time for me to leave.

591
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,040
No.

592
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,950
Jiao.

593
00:32:18,230 --> 00:32:18,710
No.

594
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:19,830
Don't leave me.

595
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:20,520
No.

596
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,760
Don't leave me.

597
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,710
Jiao. Jiao.

598
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,280
Husband.

599
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,280
Husband, you…

600
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,920
Jiao.

601
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,350
No, don't leave me.

602
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,950
Now even you don't stay with me,

603
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,920
in the big world,

604
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:43,710
where is my shelter?

605
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,560
How can I protect you?

606
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,230
Husband.

607
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:56,950
Husband.

608
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,520
You must take it with you.

609
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,000
Don't lose it.

610
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,640
I heard that the emperor doesn't like you

611
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,110
and put you in exile in disguise.

612
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,190
If I say yes,

613
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,590
what do you think?

614
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,760
Then you must not be his own son.

615
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,470
I am!

616
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,760
It's so late.

617
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,040
You're not sleeping yet.

618
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,680
Didn't you just come back?

619
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
It's getting late.

620
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,310
I'm leaving.

621
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,230
That's good.

622
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,560
Goodbye.

623
00:33:57,350 --> 00:33:57,880
Heng!

624
00:33:58,880 --> 00:33:59,430
Bye-bye!

625
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,190
You drank so much.

626
00:34:27,870 --> 00:34:28,600
What were you talking about?

627
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,360
We talked about how to eat the mermaid.

628
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,710
You still want to eat Jiao?

629
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,910
It's all her fault.

630
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:37,910
Does falling in love with a foreign race

631
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,120
mean taking the blame?

632
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:39,950
What's wrong with her?

633
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,360
Do you care

634
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,150
if I starve to death or be sick to death?

635
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,390
Even Gao Cong could come around.

636
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,840
Why are you still obsessed?

637
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,360
All living beings are equal.

638
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,520
Do you have to hurt the innocent

639
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
to satisfy your appetite?

640
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:55,080
The meat of beast is meat.

641
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,840
Isn't the meat of chicken, duck and fish meat?

642
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,670
You say that all living beings are equal.

643
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,390
Should the whole world be vegetarian?

644
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,800
Are vegetables and fruits lifeless?

645
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:03,280
You!

646
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,000
Where are you going?

647
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,520
Go fishing at sea.

648
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:15,470
Monk.

649
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,840
The Lotus Tower has cracks.

650
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,840
Is there anything big to happen?

651
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:22,950
I am Taotie.

652
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:24,120
All things in the world

653
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,760
should be my food.

654
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:27,760
But you just told me

655
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,910
that the human world is a world with temperature

656
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:31,230
and emotion.

657
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:34,670
But is it really a good thing

658
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:37,520
to have emotion?

659
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,840
It's all your fault.

660
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,120
If it wasn't for my promise to you,

661
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,150
I wouldn't be constrained

662
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,600
in this small city.

663
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:52,710
What kind of promise makes

664
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,560
Miss Zhu so attentive?

665
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,760
Don't you know that

666
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,080
no one is allowed to enter the Lotus Tower?

667
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,360
But there is no sign at the door.

668
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,390
This is the rule

669
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:02,670
that everyone in Wuxia knows.

670
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,230
I am a newcomer.

671
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,230
Those who don't know are innocent.

672
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,520
But I don't know who set the rule.

673
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,840
I set it.

674
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,840
You're quite able to find excuses for yourself.

675
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:18,630
Your Highness.

676
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,120
Please go back.

677
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,630
Miss Zhu, rest assured.

678
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:26,150
I am not interested in your secret.

679
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,430
It's just that it's getting late.

680
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,910
Why don't I take you back?

681
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,080
Miss Zhu.

682
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:42,950
Your Highness.

683
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:44,670
Please go back.

684
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,150
Don't hold up if you feel unwell.

685
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:12,870
Have more.

686
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,040
Eat more.

687
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,870
I want to eat that.

688
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,760
Hot pot.

689
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,630
It's low-class.

690
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,280
Only like-minded people

691
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,950
can get together to eat hot pot.

692
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,630
Obviously,

693
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:29,520
she's not with us.

694
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,280
I heard

695
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,950
someone was brought back yesterday.

696
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:43,630
You dare to say?

697
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,520
It's you who won't let me eat the beast!

698
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,120
It makes my legs weak.

699
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,520
I'm Taotie!

700
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,630
I can swallow the whole Tianxiang Restaurant
in one bite.

701
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,390
Neither this

702
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,080
nor that can I eat.

703
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,230
How about

704
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,280
I draw a mermaid for you?

705
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,800
Good.

706
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,760
Where is your pen?

707
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,280
Draw now!

708
00:37:59,390 --> 00:37:59,760
Come on. Come on.

709
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,630
Where is your pen? Where is your pen?

710
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,190
I…

711
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,950
When you have stomach-ache,

712
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,120
you will cry on the table again.

713
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,040
Miss Zhu hasn't eaten for several days.

714
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:08,000
If you can draw one,

715
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,320
let her try.

716
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,430
Yeah.

717
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,600
You completely forget who drew you two out.

718
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,910
You help her now.

719
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,600
Is eating so easy?

720
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,630
Do you think she's just eating the meat?

721
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,760
What's wrong with them two helping me?

722
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,470
Who is the Miss now?

723
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,430
Do you know how to trick me now?

724
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,760
What you have eaten before are ordinary beasts.

725
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,670
But Jiao

726
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,910
has human feelings now.

727
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,190
What's wrong with human feelings?

728
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,910
She's so miserable.

729
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,670
What's wrong with me helping her out of her pain?

730
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,710
The relief she said

731
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,360
is to eat Jiao.

732
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,190
It's killing!

733
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,230
What's more,

734
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,910
whenever she devours a painful beast,

735
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,000
the beast will be free,

736
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
but she has to live with pain.

737
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,870
That is to say,

738
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,120
if Miss Zhu eats Jiao,

739
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:48,950
Miss Zhu will bear the pain of Jiao

740
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,800
and go on living.

741
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:50,800
You're right.

742
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,910
That's something big.

743
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,120
Then we have to find some

744
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,390
happy beasts for Miss Zhu.

745
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:55,760
Or we can help Jiao

746
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,670
to be happy,

747
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,120
then Miss Zhu can eat it.

748
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:58,760
Exactly.

749
00:39:00,390 --> 00:39:01,470
What's wrong with you?

750
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,230
You're absolutely wrong!

751
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,230
What's wrong?

752
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,120
I think they understand it quite well.

753
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,080
With your reason,

754
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,150
if neither of them can understand,

755
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:07,910
who else can understand?

756
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,150
I think you two are right.

757
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:09,630
Yes.

758
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,390
Let's make Jiao very happy first

759
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,710
and then let Miss Zhu eat her.

760
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,190
Miss Zhu will be happy then.

761
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,280
Yeah, I think so.

762
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,190
I think Cuiyan is quite right.

763
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,080
She will not be unhappy anymore!

764
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,080
Miss Zhu, do you think so?

765
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,280
Cuiyan is right.

766
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,280
If Jiao became happy,

767
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,870
I could be happy after eating her.

768
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:22,470
Right?

769
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,800
Very good.

770
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,280
That's right.

771
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,630
Cuiyan.

772
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,280
In the future, we will catch more beasts.

773
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,560
I am like living among a group of old hens.

774
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,390
How did Cuiyan become so smart?

775
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:31,430
You're quite right.

776
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:32,590
If Jiao became happy,

777
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,910
I could be happier after eating her.

778
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:37,230
I just want to eat happy beasts!

779
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,590
They had a fight again?

780
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,430
Every day is like this.

781
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:35,230
Let's go.

782
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,600
Why are you looking at me?

783
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,760
How do you know I'm looking at you

784
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,280
if you don't look at me?

785
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,950
What did Gao Cong come to see you today?

786
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,630
He gave me a gift on the Mid-Autumn Festival.

787
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,760
Giving you gift without reason

788
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,630
must be asking for something.

789
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,800
What did you promise him again?

790
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,950
Can't he just give me gifts?

791
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:04,080
He is not such a person.

792
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,470
If he had something valuable,

793
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,520
he'd already sell it.

794
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,000
He thanked me.

795
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,910
I let him and Jiao

796
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,910
live a happy life again.

797
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,000
Right?

798
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:14,080
Yes.

799
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,630
As long as you give up the idea
of eating the mermaid,

800
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,710
you will benefit everyone.

801
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,080
By the way,

802
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,120
well,

803
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,840
how do we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival?

804
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:32,950
I beg your pardon?

805
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,560
How do we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival?

806
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,910
None of your business.

807
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:41,600
I'm just asking.

808
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,630
I don't care about you.

809
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,560
Here comes Prince of Langya.

810
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,600
Miss Zhu.

811
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
Nice to meet you again.

812
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,950
Why doesn't Your Highness stay at home

813
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:08,950
with your family tonight?

814
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,520
Why do you come to Tianxiang Restaurant again?

815
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,120
Of course, I specially invite Miss Zhu

816
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,800
to go to the Mid-Autumn Festival Feast.

817
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,520
This is the first time that I spent the Mid-Autumn Festival
in Wuxia.

818
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:20,390
Without the delicious food of Miss Zhu,

819
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,150
isn't it a pity?

820
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,950
Miss Zhu is not going anywhere today.

821
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,470
We will be reunited at home.

822
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,520
How?

823
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,230
There is nothing to eat at home.

824
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:33,470
Heng.

825
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,280
I'm going.

826
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,080
Your Highness, please wait for a second.

827
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,230
I'll change into a beautiful dress.

828
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,000
Wait.

829
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:41,870
Let her go!

830
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:44,520
Qing.

831
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,430
Watch your manners.

832
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,800
Miss Zhu.

833
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:53,630
Don't be so harsh.

834
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:54,760
He's just a

835
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,520
little accountant.

836
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:58,120
Mingyan.

837
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:07,000
It's so beautiful!

838
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:07,600
Get back.

839
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,520
I don't know if this golden silk dress

840
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,190
can meet the wishes of Miss Zhu.

841
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:12,760
Very good.

842
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,710
Extremely good.

843
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,840
You two.

844
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,280
Help your Miss to get dressed.

845
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:21,190
Sure.

846
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:28,230
Let's go.

847
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:33,630
