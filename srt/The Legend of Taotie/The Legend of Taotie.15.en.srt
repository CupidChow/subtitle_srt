How is he?

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,910
Not too bad.

green dumplings too soon.

when the Umbrella is lost,

29
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:47,630
we can get it back.

30
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,110

Just kidding.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,270
I'm not lying, Stone.

37
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,550
Are you serious?

38
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,720
Yes.

39
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,110
Haven't you heard this?
The more annoying you are,

40
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,390
the longer you'll live.

41
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,880
I have this restaurant

42
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,750

43
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,160
But actually, I'm very annoying.

44
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,390
Because I'm not like you.

45
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,160
Every morning, you make green dumplings.

46
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:18,670
I'm really lazy.

47
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,440
My restaurant isn't usually open.

48
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,470

I'm a terrible restaurant owner

No, I'm not.

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,440
I only cook when I'm in a good mood.

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,520
When I cook,

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,000
I hang up the lantern.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,750
When I'm in a bad mood,

58
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,240
I hang up the curtain

59
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,470
and sleep in my room

60
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,670
for a whole month.

61
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,270
Have you seen

62
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,960
such a lazy chef?

63
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:49,470
Miss Zhu,

64
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,720
I visited the constable.

65
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,520
He said the criminal was rather skillful.

66
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,360
No suspicious clue was found.

67
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,600
Only the Umbrella was gone.

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,110
Stone,

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,160
do you suspect anyone?

70
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,190
It must be his senior sister Ji Wenzhen.

71
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,360
Who else would it be?

72
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,640
Wenzhen isn't that sort of woman.

73
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:20,510
Stone,

74
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,440
we're not sure yet.

75
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,510
Now,

76
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,110
you stay here and get well.

77
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,950
Do you want it?

78
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,320
Then, I'll eat it.

79
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,830
You never stop eating.

80
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,550
This isn't an ordinary shell.

81
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,230
It's the Mirage Shell

82
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,920
from the Southern Sea

83
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,350
that spits mist and generals a mirage.

84
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,070
Miss Ji, what do you mean?

85
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,720
I don't understand.

86
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,550
I'm here

87
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,270
to ask you and Miss Zhu for a favor.

88
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,600
What is it?

89
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,670
My junior brother is young.

90
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:18,550
He's a minor.

91
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,000
And he's simple-minded.

92
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,000
If Miss Zhu is interested,

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,110
she can play with him.

94
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,230
But...

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,790
Don't teach him

96
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,070
to make Heaven and Earth in Spring.

97
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,920
Sounds interesting.

98
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,320
Mr. Chang Qing, you have no idea.

99
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,440
My master and Stone

100
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,160
once stayed hidden on Cangwu Mountain.

101
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:41,760
My master firmly believed

102
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,550
the Dragon lived under Duiying Bridge.

103
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,720
He offered the Dragon
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

104
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,790
The authentic pastry

105
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,640
will disappear into thin air

106
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,440
and bring out the Dragon.

107
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,160
Yiwu believed this story

108
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,160
and has been crazy about it.

109
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,270
Sadly, he's too young.

110
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,230
I don't want him to follow my master

111
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,000
who wasted his valuable youth

112
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,070
on something that didn't exist.

113
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,000
So, what do you want?

114
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,600
I want him to give up.

115
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,950
Now, Yiwu

116
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,200
is desperate.

117
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,070
He puts all his hope

118
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,830
on Miss Zhu.

119
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,600
Very well.

120
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,550
Ask Miss Zhu to do something

121
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,270
and send him away.

122
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:30,790
So,

123
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:32,390
you came here

124
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,510
for your junior brother.

125
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,040
Exactly.

126
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,320
Life is short.

127
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,440
But I think

128
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Shi Yiwu is very persistent

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,200
when focusing on something.

130
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:51,390
That's admirable.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,600
In my opinion,

132
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,880
you just don't want him

133
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,230
to steal your thunder in Wuxia.

134
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,070
Cuiyan.

135
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,320
What's that terrible taste?

136
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:16,600
I've never eaten

137
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,880
anything so weird.

138
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:20,790
Hey, girls.

139
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,600
Why did you run out?

140
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,640
Yingtao.

141
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,350
Miss Zhu, I want no more.

142
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm serious, Miss Zhu.

143
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,600
Cuiyan.

144
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,040
No, no, no.

145
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:28,880
No, thanks.

146
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:35,040
Come on, girls.

147
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,230
How dare you disobey me?

148
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,200
Your Highness.

149
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,830
Your Highness, help.

150
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,670
Your Highness.

151
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:43,440
Help us, please.

152
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,110
Help.

153
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:45,720
You're back from Yunlong?

154
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:46,670
Yes.

155
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,390
What's going on here?

156
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,670
I'm in a good mood today.

157
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:52,270
I made them so many pastries.

158
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,160
But they ran away after eating a little.

159
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:54,760
Taste it.

160
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:55,790
Miss Zhu,

161
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,270
they have no taste for food.

162
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,640
You're right.

163
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,230
Look at the flaky pastry.

164
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,390
It looks nice.

165
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,480
Tastes great.

166
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,790
Really great.

167
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,920
So sweet.

168
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,480
Try it.

169
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,790
It's really tasty.

170
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,720
Girls, taste it.

171
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,510
Come on.

172
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,070
Heng, would you like some?

173
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,720
Sure.

174
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,320
I had a desire for food.

175
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,110
I missed your pastries

176
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:28,950
and came here for some.

177
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,790
Girls,

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,150
go back there and fetch

179
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,670
all my pastries.

180
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:34,910
All right.

181
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,790
Heng, it's your lucky day.

182
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:39,960
I've made a lot of pastries.

183
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,150
You have to taste it.

184
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,000
Try it.

185
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,520
I will, then.

186
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:11,440
How does it taste?

187
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:17,960
Miss Zhu,

188
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:20,080
is it the new pastry?

189
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,280
Other chefs make pastries with sugar.

190
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,910
But you used salt.

191
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,200
I said the wrong thing.

192
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:32,840
It's sugar.

193
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,960
You used sugar.

194
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,760
I'm sure.

195
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,760
Lately, I don't eat Stone's pastry.

196
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,000
Have I lost my sense of taste?

197
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:02,960
Taotie,

198
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,520
you're a demon beast,

199
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,350
but you protect the Lotus Tower

200
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,000
and stop me from opening the Portal.

201
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,840
You deserve this.

202
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,550
This is the Soul Hook

203
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:14,760
I refined with my blood and flesh.

204
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,280
When you took the wounds for him,

205
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:19,760
the poison got into your body.

206
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,000
Soon, it will infiltrate your inner core

207
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,960
until you lose your five senses

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,320
and your body dissipates.

209
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,670
You'll be totally destroyed

210
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,640
and disappear from the world.

211
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,520
Bai Ze!

212
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,000
Miss Zhu.

213
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:10,960
Miss Zhu.

214
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,670
Her body...

215
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,280
Why is it so light?

216
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,790
When Lu Ying met you for the first time,

217
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,110
he mistook you for Bai Ze.

218
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,230
I asked you.

219
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,030
But you've never explained.

220
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,670
I... I don't remember.

221
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,280
Bai Ze...

222
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,520
Who on earth is he?

223
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,320
Does he

224
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,640
really look like me?

225
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,400
What about your brush?

226
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,280
Why can your paintings come alive?

227
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,470
Who gave it to you?

228
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,200
I don't know.

229
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,400
Since I can remember,

230
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,790
I've been keeping this brush.

231
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,110
Really?

232
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:39,790
Chang Qing,

233
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,880
you still haven't told the truth.

234
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:52,520
I feel bad.

235
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,350
I feel so bad.

236
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,760
Living in this world is too painful.

237
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:00,030
We want to go home.

238
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,200
We want to go home.

239
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,400
We want to go home.

240
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,710
Because Taotie

241
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,000
guards the Portal against the demons,

242
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,550
they have to wander around the world

243
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,670
and suffer all the time.

244
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,520
Go to Tianxiang Restaurant,

245
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,230
get close to Zhu Chengbi,

246
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:20,280
and open the Portal.

247
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,520
Let the demons go home.

248
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,550
Qing?

249
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,080
Qing.

250
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:54,590
What are you doing up?

251
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,400
I had enough sleep.

252
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,110
I'm here to tell you.

253
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,520
What Stone makes

254
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,400
is the authentic
Heaven and Earth in Spring.

255
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,200
Get in and sit for a while.

256
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,230
Are you saying Stone made

257
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,400
the authentic pastry?

258
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,880
What he makes

259
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,760
is the same as that in my memory.

260
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,200
This pastry is for immortals.

261
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,110
Mei Dongjing was clever.

262
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,550
He made the same pastry

263
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,590
with ingredients in the mortal world.

264
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:30,400
Then why

265
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:32,080
wasn't it approved by the Dragon?

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,080
Because of the adjuvant, I think.

267
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:38,000
At the feast
of the Queen Mother of the West,

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,790
I tasted this pastry.

269
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,400
You swaggered in,

270
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,670
ate some food, and then left.

271
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,350
Meanwhile,

272
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:45,150
you broke a lot of cups and dishes.

273
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:46,110
That's right.

274
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,080
But I tasted it, anyway.

275
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:49,030
Yes, you did.

276
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,280
You absolutely did.

277
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:50,880
Anyway,

278
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,550
before this pastry is eaten,

279
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,760
something red must be put in the middle.

280
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,400
What is that?

281
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,400
Blood.

282
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:04,760
The pasty has four layers of fillings.

283
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,030
When the eater chews it,

284
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,520
he has different feelings
from each layer.

285
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,080
With the blood,

286
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,400
the taste will keep changing.

287
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:18,550
If this is what the Dragon wants,

288
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,030
it would be very hard.

289
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,880
I tasted it.

290
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,350
But sadly, I can't recall

291
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,550
what kind of blood it was.

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,280
It tasted very familiar.

293
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:38,880
Dragon's blood.

294
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,150
Dragon's blood has hundreds of favors.

295
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,750
Maybe it will work.

296
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,240
Qing.

297
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,040
Dragon's blood?

298
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,590
No.

299
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,440
It's not time to use it yet.

300
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,920
I'll think of another way.

301
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,440
Chang Qing,

302
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,270
you could have
grabbed it during the day.

303
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,230
Why did you hesitate

304
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,920
and miss the chance?

305
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,080
Lord Bai Ze,

306
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:43,990
you've never told me

307
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,150
the Dragon's blood
is in Miss Zhu's chest.

308
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,150
And there's a drought.

309
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,800
The world is in chaos and people die.

310
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,150
I should help them.

311
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:53,230
Chang Qing,

312
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,870
you've known the beast language.

313
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,200
You always know

314
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,110
the demon beasts want to go home.

315
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:02,960
They've been tortured for 500 years.

316
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,990
Don't forget what they've suffered.

317
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,080
But Miss Zhu

318
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,630
is weakened due to Tiger's Paw.

319
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:10,390
How can I help her?

320
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,200
She's a demon beast,

321
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,600
but she fights for humans.

322
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,080
She deserves this.

323
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,270
But now, people

324
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,510
are stuck in torture and pain.

325
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,230
Only Miss Zhu can save them.

326
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,270
Lord Bai Ze, I know

327
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,350
you only want the demons to go home

328
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,960
instead of hurting the humans.

329
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,040
Magpies leave the branch in moonlight.

330
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,800
Since you want to save her,

331
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,560
go get her a human physician.

332
00:19:55,270 --> 00:19:56,110
Bai Ze.

333
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,080
Who on earth is he?

334
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,200
And what does he mean?

335
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,870
Human physician.

336
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,390
Moonlight.

337
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,150
Branch.

338
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,960
Is it...?

339
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,350
Zhegui Mountain.

340
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,270
Oh, it's you.

341
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,440
Hi, Mr. Chang Qing.

342
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,320
Your Highness,

343
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,840
where are you going?

344
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,040
To Zhegui Mountain.

345
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:57,680
For something important.

346
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:36,560
Oh no.

347
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,990
My brush doesn't work on the water.

348
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,440
Mr. Chang.

349
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,990
We have the same destination.

350
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,630
How about we share the boat?

351
00:22:58,320 --> 00:22:58,840
Well...

352
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,390
Thanks, Your Highness.

353
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,350
We're almost there.

354
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,440
Your Highness, you usually travel

355
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,750
on a horse or in a carriage.

356
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,800
Have you tried

357
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,110
such tough mountain roads?

358
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,960
Miss Zhu is in grave danger.

359
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,200
I have to go now.

360
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,920
It's pointless to get rid of me.

361
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:28,960
Without me,

362
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,510
Physician Xuan wouldn't see you.

363
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,800
You're not him.

364
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,600
How do you know

365
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,440
if he'll see me?

366
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,200
I just know.

367
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,150
Hi, young lady.

368
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:06,320
May I ask

369
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,600
if Physician Xuan lives here?

370
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,440
He sent me to tell you

371
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,680
he wouldn't see a stranger.

372
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,750
My friend is fatally injured

373
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:14,390
and she's dying.

374
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,350
Only Physician Xuan can save her.

375
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,990
Please tell him I'm here

376
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:18,960
and explain this to him.

377
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,440
He said

378
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,390
he had retired

379
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,080
and wouldn't save people.

380
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,750
I told you, huh?

381
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,960
He won't see you.

382
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:32,840
Miss,

383
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,720
please tell Physician Xuan

384
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:36,800
Prince of Langya wants to see him.

385
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,640
[Leisure House]

386
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,150
Get in, Your Highness.

387
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,350
Greetings, Uncle.

388
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,470
I'm not your uncle.

389
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:18,350
Call me something else.

390
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:21,800
Uncle,

391
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,510
don't be kidding.

392
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:26,870
Tell me.

393
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,680
What are you doing here?

394
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,990
I beg you, Uncle.

395
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,350
A friend of mine is badly injured.

396
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,110
She's too sick.

397
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:36,990
She's lost her five senses.

398
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:39,150
Without a timely cure,

399
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,390
she may...

400
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,600
Are you talking

401
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,840
about a Taotie
who's a thousand years old?

402
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,630
I'm talking about Miss Zhu
of Tianxiang Restaurant.

403
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,270
That's her, exactly.

404
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:53,680
Judging from your description,

405
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,630
her soul

406
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,270
has started to dissipate.

407
00:26:59,390 --> 00:26:59,870
Uncle,

408
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,600
since you know her condition,

409
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,230
I'm sure you can cure her.

410
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,470
I told you.

411
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,110
I don't save people anymore.

412
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,270
But Uncle,

413
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,680
if you promise to cure her,

414
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,350
I'll do anything for you.

415
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,350
What if I ask you to kill your father?

416
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,320
I guess

417
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,680
you love this woman.

418
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,270
A man is out there.

419
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,600
He came with you, right?

420
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,630
Gentleman,

421
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,800
Physician Xuan will see you.

422
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:57,960
Thank you.

423
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:06,960
Physician Xuan.

424
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,230
Did you come here

425
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,390
for Taotie?

426
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,560
You and the Prince

427
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,600
want the same thing.

428
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,440
The prescription you want

429
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,600
is on the table.

430
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,680
Can it really cure Miss Zhu?

431
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,920
If you don't believe it,

432
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,800
go get another physician.

433
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,280
[Prescription]

434
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:03,560
Do I have to kill these demon beasts?

435
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,200
Is there no other way out?

436
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,720
No, obviously.

437
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,040
And there's more to this.

438
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:14,200
You need to get these beasts quickly.

439
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,350
And you must give them to me soon.

440
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,630
I'm not helping you

441
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,150
for your own sake.

442
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,390
It's just because

443
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,840
I hate Zhao Heng.

444
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,200
Your Highness,

445
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,390
why did Physician Xuan say

446
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:53,870
he hated you?

447
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,630
It's my family stuff.

448
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,080
None of your business.

449
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,680
He gave me this prescription.

450
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,750
It can't be wrong, huh?

451
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:10,230
My uncle has a queer temper.

452
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:11,920
But he won't lie to us.

453
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,040
You know what?

454
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,470
His seclusion spot

455
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,320
is so scenic.

456
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,840
It's like a fairyland.

457
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:26,150
Of course.

458
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:31,990
The words...

459
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:34,270
Why have they gone?

460
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:37,870
Oh no.

461
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,440
I'll go back and ask Uncle.

462
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,750
How did this happen?

463
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,350
Shall we move along?

464
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,150
It looks normal now.

465
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,230
Mr. Chang,

466
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,390
check the prescription again.

467
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:07,600
The words are back.

468
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,960
I read it again

469
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,040
and I've kept it in mind.

470
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,470
Let's go.

471
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,350
It's blank again.

472
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,200
Weird.

473
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,390
I can't think of anything
on the prescription.

474
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:42,350
But just now,

475
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,630
I memorized it.

476
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,630
Mr. Chang,

477
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,440
look at both sides.

478
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,390
There's a sun above each side.

479
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,560
The sunglow has combined.

480
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,230
And the scenery on this side

481
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:01,270
is identical with that
on the other side.

482
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:04,440
So, we seem to be

483
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,600
in an asymmetric world.

484
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,560
Is it an illusion?

485
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,230
Maybe we're in a mirror world.

486
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:15,960
So, we can't

487
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
take out the prescription.

488
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,200
My uncle tricked us.

489
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:42,840
In this case,

490
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,270
we're standing

491
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:47,990
on the dividing line
of illusion and reality.

492
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,040
How about this?

493
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,350
Let's stand on each side

494
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,390
and memorize this

495
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,600
in halves.

496
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:10,960
Are you saying...?

497
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,390
Your Highness,

498
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,350
please memorize the second half.

499
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,110
Are you done?

500
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:45,150
Yes.

501
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,040
It's back to normal.

502
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,270
At last.

503
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,870
If we care for nothing,

504
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,950
we won't be upset.

505
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,510
The mirror world

506
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:12,710
is illusory.

507
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,750
It's a reflection of the real world.

508
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,120
I guess Physician Xuan

509
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,430
just wants you and me

510
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,040
to work together.

511
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,910
Mr. Chang, you have
magic painting skills.

512
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,430
You're smart, too.

513
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,950
What did you say, Your Highness?

514
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:41,600
Can you say it again?

515
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:49,910
How stingy.

516
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:16,950
Why doesn't it work?

517
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,990
Taotie,

518
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,430
since you're injured,

519
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:54,510
why don't you give me your soul?

520
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,710
When I have it,

521
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,470
no humans or demon beasts

522
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,670
can threaten me anymore.

523
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,800
If I hadn't pretended to be injured,

524
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:05,470
I wouldn't have lured you in.

525
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,950
Somebody!

526
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:29,990
Somebody help!

527
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,840
Anybody here?

528
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:33,400
Help!

529
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,950
Anybody here?

530
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:35,710
Let's go.

531
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:36,430
Hurry.

532
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:37,750
Hurry up.

533
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,270
Miss Zhu.

534
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,230
Miss Zhu.

535
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,360
Are you alright?

536
00:36:58,840 --> 00:36:59,320
Go after him.

537
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,560
No need.

538
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,040
That umbrella captures souls.

539
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:07,510
You're no match for him.

540
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,040
Miss Zhu,

541
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:10,160
are you badly hurt?

542
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,270
Before His Highness left,

543
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,040
he asked us to secretly protect you.

544
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,880
So, he saw this coming.

545
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,800
Did you find him?

546
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,560
No.

547
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,640
[Pingyue House]

548
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,160
Did you see a man in black come in?

549
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,040
No.

550
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:52,990
No, I didn't.

551
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,400
Mr. Lu, he isn't here.

552
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,750
Let's go search out there.

553
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:09,880
Go after him.

554
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:10,600
Yes.

555
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:16,750
Mr. Lu.

556
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:28,510
Thank you.

557
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,230
You're welcome.

558
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,950
It's my pleasure.

559
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,710
Miss Zhu.

560
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,190
Miss Zhu.

561
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,270
Miss Zhu.

562
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:32,950
Miss Zhu.

563
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:36,880
She can't hear clearly.

564
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,320
She has blurred vision, too.

565
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:43,670
Miss Zhu.

566
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,750
You're finally awake.

567
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,400
Who are you?

568
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:47,840
I... I'm Qing.

569
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:48,670
I don't care.

570
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,430
I have something to tell Stone.

571
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,190
You can tell me.

572
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:53,270
What do you want to say?

573
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,320
Alright.

574
00:40:58,670 --> 00:40:59,320
Miss Zhu.

575
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,470
So, Uncle is right.

576
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,120
Miss Zhu is getting worse.

577
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,400
If it continues,

578
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:23,990
before we collect
what's in the prescription,

579
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,470
she may have...

580
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,040
I'm leaving today.

581
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,560
Some archers will go with me.

582
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,320
They're familiar with demon beasts.

583
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,880
They'll help a lot.

584
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:37,800
I will go instead.

585
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,600
First, the drought is terrible.

586
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,560
You need to take care of Wuxia.

587
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,190
Second, Miss Zhu is awake.

588
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,560
When you're around,

589
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,670
she may get happier.

590
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,560
Third, I dealt with demon beasts.

591
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,560
I'm familiar with them.

592
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:02,160
Then, I'll stay
to take care of Miss Zhu.

593
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,320
But I still suggest

594
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,120
you go with some archers.

595
00:42:07,470 --> 00:42:08,640
They can help find the beasts.

596
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,670
They can protect you.

597
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,120
Fine, then.

598
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,640
Miss Zhu was just assassinated.

599
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:19,430
I don't think the assassin will stop.

600
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,600
You should have more men protect her.

601
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:24,230
And Stone...

602
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,360
Please take care of him, too.

603
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:30,190
Deal.

604
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,400
Mr. Chang.

605
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:08,430
Leave me alone.

606
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,190
Tonight, I'll guard Miss Zhu.
