I can consider teaching you in my free time,

11
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,620
but first,

12
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,500
you have to show your sincerity.

13
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,780
What are you referring to?

00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,820

The unspoken rules.

17
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,340
I was reading the tabloid the other day,

18
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,060
and it said that the crews

19
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,140
might have unspoken rules.

20
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,370
It might be a rumor.

21
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,450
But you need to keep alert.

22
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:10,430
Don't come any closer.

23
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,420
Any closer and I'd kick you!

24
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,780
What do you think?

25
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,220
I think,

26
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,650
as an actor,

27
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,330
the best sincerity

28
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,220
is to do your job well.

29
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,180
To better understand your character,

30
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:46,140
and generate chemistry with other actors.

31
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,430
I hope your performance

32
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,159
makes our one month waiting worth it.

33
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,140
Rest assured, Mr. Mu.

34
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,810
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

35
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,270
I'll give you one day

36
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,540
to prove your worth.

37
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,530
Mr. Mu,

38
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,820
what did you mean by that?

39
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,860
If you act badly,

40
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:24,770
you'd still be replaced.

41
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:27,420
You'll never get the chance

42
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,980
to act again.

43
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,970
Good night.

After that,

47
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,560
it'll be very difficult for you to act again.

48
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:35,380
Good night.

49
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,850

The Jade Emperor, or Buddha?

52
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,370
You really think you're the Grand Tutor.

53
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,300
You think my fate

54
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,820
relies on you?

55
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,260
Although

56
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
I didn't want to be in the limelight,

57
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,870
if I'm fired like this,

58
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,720
that's too embarrassing.

59
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,610
Who are you?

60
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:04,860

But whatever happens

It's quite delicious.

147
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,300
Actually, it's quite normal for you

148
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,460
to feel nervous when you act for the first time.

149
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,060
It's totally fine. Don't think too much about it.

150
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,940
Let's eat.

151
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,140
You don't know about my first acting experience.

152
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,620
That is really something embarrassing.

153
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,260
There was a line in the script.

154
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,260
"We are so anxious

155

00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,820
At that time

157
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,140
I was so nervous

158
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,020
that I said

159
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
"we are so anxious

160
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:36,060
like left eye staring at right eye."

161
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,780
Everyone at the scene burst out laughing.

162
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,820

163
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,460
"Come on. Show us

164
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:43,500
how to use your left eye to stare at your right eye."

165
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,540
I was in a devil of a hole.

166
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,840
I was too nervous at that time.

167
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,960
The more nervous you are, the more likely you will fail.

168
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,020
Actually, I think you act quite well.

169
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,290
The expressions in your eyes, those small details

170
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,290
were really good.

171
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,580
Maybe it's just because you are unfamiliar with the environment.

172
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,510
You can't fully express yourself.

173

00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:06,780

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,320
really didn't know what to do.

176
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
It's my pleasure.

177
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,540
Mr. Mu

178
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,460
is really good at acting.

179
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,780
I am quite jealous of you to have the opportunity

180
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,220
to learn from him.

181
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,990
You should cheer up.

182
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,160
You can do this.

183
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:22,860
Come on.

184
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,620
Come on.

185
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,620
Hurry up, it's getting cold.

186
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,940
Look at Chen Zhang.

187
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,760
He made Ming Wei smile only by a few words.

188
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,170
You shouldn't be always so serious.

189
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:35,030
Don't give her too much pressure.

190
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:38,180
So you blame me for her poor performance?

191
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:38,980
Of course.

192
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,500
Who would not be nervous to work with the Best Actor for the first time?

193
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,020
Let alone Ming Wei is just a novice.

194
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,550
You should take care of her.

195
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,060
I don't think a novice needs to be taken care of.

196
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,290
As long as you are an actor

197
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,620
you should set high standards for yourself.

198
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,020
There are no exceptions.

199
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,780
Boring.

200
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,060
Hello?

201
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,060
Sister,

202
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,060
how is your acting going?

203
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:29,940
Not good.

204
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,370
I am on the verge

205
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,150
of being kicked out of the crew.

206
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,380
Who is trying to kick you out?

207
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,180
Tell me, I will handle it for you.

208
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,020
You can't handle this for me.

209
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,350
I have to rely on myself.

210
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,500
Tell me.

211
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,460
I am getting anxious.

212
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,380
What happened?

213
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,220
Mu Tingzhou gave me one day

214
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:48,730
to let me prove my ability

215
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:51,020
or I will be out.

216
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,220
Mu Tingzhou.

217
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,490
He thought he was famous

218
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,150
so he could push you around?

219
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,450
He didn't push me around.

220
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,120
It was me who didn't perform well.

221
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,040
But his entertainment agent was quite nice.

222
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,099
Very kind.

223
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,099
Xiao Zhao?

224
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,740
Yes, you know him?

225
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:09,810
Yeah.

226
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,180
The grapevine talks about him all the time.

227
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,710
He's from a wealthy family.

228
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,500
But sis,

229
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,690
this guy

230
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,540
is nice to every girl,

231
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,819
like a central air-conditioner.

232
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,680
Don't get fooled by his kindness.

233
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,500
I know that. Don't worry.

234
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,160
Sister, was acting interesting?

235
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,859
Can I visit you when I am free?

236
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:28,020
Of course.

237
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,370
Just call me

238
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,600
whenever you don't have classes.

239
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,020
Qiao, I have to go.

240
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:40,100
I've got something to do, goodbye.

241
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,220
Mr. Xiao.

242
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,900
Ming Wei.

243
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,400
What's the matter?

244
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,440
I have a question about acting

245
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,020
that I would like to ask Mr. Mu.

246
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,560
Could you please give me his number?

247
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,270
Sorry.

248
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,790
Do you recognize my acting?

249
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,020
No.

250
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,770
I will leave the crew tomorrow morning.

251
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,720
You don't want to act anymore?

252
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,050
You said I was a poor actress

253
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,300
and you don't want me to act for the show, right?

254
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,900
Now you ask me if I want to act.

255
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,620
Of course I want to act,

256
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,360
but you won't let me continue.

257
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,780
So I'll leave.

258
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:24,620
I really don't recognize

259
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,700
your acting.

260
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,110
But you have talent.

261
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,900
If you put your heart into it,

262
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,300
the character you perform

263
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,580
probably can make the audience get connected with you.

264
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,020
I could teach you some acting skills

265
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,480
at some appropriate time.

266
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,540
So

267
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,190
I agree to let you stay.

268
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,540
Really?

269
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:43,620
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

270
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:57,180
I will leave you some homework. Take it seriously.

271
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,040
What homework?

272
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,340
After the day work, you should

273
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,290
go over the parts you will act the next day

274
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:02,220
according to your schedule.

275
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,480
Understand the character from your view

276
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,500
to go deep into the character's inner world.

277
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,100
Apart from your understanding of Princess Ming Hua,

278
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,260
you should also try to understand

279
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,330
other characters.

280
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:12,460
Write down your thoughts to

281
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,790
express your understanding in words.

282
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:16,380
I will give it to you as soon as I finish.

283
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,700
The homework is not for me.

284
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,220
You don't need to hand it to me.

285
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,280
It's only for you to better understand the characters.

286
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,330
I will take it seriously.

287
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,670
How come he always doesn't have a good ending?

288
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,340
We have more acting work

289
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,400
in the latter part.

290
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,380
No problem.

291
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,620
You told my room number to Ming Wei?

292
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,380
Why would I bother to do that?

293
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,600
But you are in the same crew

294
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,820
and you are colleagues.

295
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,340
It's quite normal to have your room number.

296
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,860
I can't be with you all the time.

297
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,190
What kind of entertainment agent you are!

298
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,140
Tell me,

299
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,060
when did you come back last night?

300
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,460
Why? Are you spying on me?

301
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,980
I don't want you to get into trouble.

302
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,500
Everybody, it's time for lunch.

303
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:26,860
We'll go back to work after lunch.

304
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,540
Thank you.

305
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,340
Ming Wei.

306
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,540
Come. We have tasty fried meat today.

307
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,400
I've got yours.

308
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:42,700
Thanks.

309
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,250
[Pick Up Food Here]

310
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,750
Have a seat.

311
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,600
Here you go.

312
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:58,600
[I've been...]

313
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:01,240
[I've been...]

314
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,470
These chopsticks.

315
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,350
I've prepared these for you.

316
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,020
From today on,

317
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,700
you could eat with me here

318
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,710
and have a rest.

319
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,390
Thanks.

320
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,620
Let's eat.

321
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,230
Try this.

322
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,290
Thanks.

323
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,870
Look at them,

324
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,360
a man and a woman eating together.

325
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,480
And me,

326
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,880
eating with a man everyday.

327
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,550
It really spoils my appetite.

328
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,090
I could give you a box of Laoganma Chili Sauce,

329
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,950
then you'll have a good appetite.

330
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,290
Do you think

331
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,960
the consort will take it seriously and make the drama become true?

332
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,450
It's none of your business.

333
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,580
No, it's not mine.

334
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,810
But it's yours.

335
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:54,680
I thought you would be unhappy.

336
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,750
You know about it.

337
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,690
I never fall in love with a colleague.

338
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,240
It's stupid.

339
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,050
Don't brag yet.

340
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:08,790
You might eat your words.

341
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,560
Do I look good?

342
00:23:28,730 --> 00:23:31,730
You're more beautiful than the fairy, Your Highness.

343
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,010
Over there, Your Highness.

344
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,830
This way, Grand Tutor.

345
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,960
The princess is admiring flowers here.

346
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,100
Who are you?

347
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm Mu Yun,

348
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,370
Your Highness.

349
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,360
You've scared away my butterfly.

350
00:24:58,390 --> 00:24:59,740
You must compensate me for another one.

351
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,400
Otherwise,

352
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
I won't let you go.

353
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,710
Why don't you move?

354
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,340
The butterfly was scared away by Eunuch Li.

355
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,340
I shouldn't take the blame for that.

356
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:18,050
You're guilty if I say so.

357
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,260
Go get me a butterfly.

358
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,070
Cut.

359
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,490
Everybody did a good job today.

360
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:05,330
Especially Ming Wei. You made big progress today.

361
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,810
Thanks, director. Thanks, director.

362
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,770
Thank you guys.

363
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,640
Ming Wei.

364
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:33,560
Mr. Mu.

365
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,150
Is there any problem?

366
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,520
I'm looking at the upcoming scenes.

367
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,580
I feel like sometimes

368
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,210
you have to keep a steady pace,

369
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,310
hit that emotion right on point,

370
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,170
and pay attention to the details.

[Grand Chief Cabinet Minister]

374
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,920
The Book of Rites

375
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,060
is what all the princes and princesses

376
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:58,150
must learn.

377
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:01,360
Your Highness, you can't leave here today

378
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,850
until you finish these ten pages.

379
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,030
Ten pages?

380
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,670
But I want to play outside.

381
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:11,340
Your Highness lives in the palace

382
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,810
and should know rites and social forms

383
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:14,820
so that you set a good example for thousands of your people.

384
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,960
It's your responsibility.

385
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,160
How could you say you wouldn't learn it?

386
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,870
I didn't say that.

387
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,060
Your Highness.

388
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,860
Grand Tutor.

389
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,550
You may arise.

390
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:35,120
What is that?

391
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,290
His Majesty really loves his daughter.

392
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:39,550
He rewards you this facial mud cleanser.

393
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,570
Please send him my appreciation for this.

394
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:43,970
Your Highness, I'll leave you be.

395
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,840
Your Highness.

396
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,130
Grand Tutor, do you think

397
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,060
if I would become more beautiful

398
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,820
if I use this facial mud cleanser?

399
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,210
Your Highness is the daughter of His Majesty.

400
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,140
You were born with natural beauty.

401
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:17,530
Come.

402
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,280
Finish these ten pages first.

403
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:23,240
I don't want to.

404
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,220
I still want to play outside.

405
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:28,320
Today is the Firework Festival.

406
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,580
Do you still remember?

407
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,850
I heard it is so much fun when it's Firework Festival.

408
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,830
I was wondering if

409
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,430
I could get out before the gate is closed.

410
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:42,190
I know it might be inappropriate.

411
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:43,020
But,

412
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,830
how could a princess set a good example for her people if she

413
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,850
always lives in the palace and doesn't know

414
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,710
what her people are worried about

415
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,440
or what they are happy about?

416
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,240
Grand Tutor,

417
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:55,030
am I right?

418
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,820
Finish these ten pages, then you may go.

419
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,700
After study,

420
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,440
I'll report to His Majesty

421
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,840
that I shall go with you.

422
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,180
Grand Tutor, it's amazing.

423
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,780
Your Highness, how's that? Is it beautiful?

424
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:48,380
Yes, it is!

425

431
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,450
Such a disappointment to come

432
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,880
out with them!

433
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,630
It's all for your safety, Your Highness.

434

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,570
Of course.

You have transgressed the bounds of decency.

Wait for me, sister!

448
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,800

459
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,380
for this plot,

460
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:13,870
you still need to show the effeminacy and innocence as the princess.

461
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,980
Even her caprice.

462

But deep inside your heart,

463
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,580
you care about the Grand Tutor.

464
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,790
So you should have dissatisfaction and grievances

465
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,179
in your emotions.

466
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,370
Of course you should also feel reluctant to leave.

Do you understand?

00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,050
Yes, director.

your role has already realized that he starts

471
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:32,389
to have feelings at this time.

472
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,250
So you would ask to leave the capital.

473
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,360
No problem, right?

474
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:38,630
Alright.

Please rehearse the lines with Ming Wei later to

help her understand better.

00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,140
How could you leave without saying goodbye?

483
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:53,110
Your Highness, you have come to set me off.

484
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,710
I really don't deserve such an honor.

It is not a good place to stay.

486
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,740
Your Highness, it is better for you to go back to the palace as soon as possible.

487

Why would you go to the North?

489
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,240
it is your own decision.

Is it true?

491
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,990
The country is not stable without ruling the North.

492
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,390
It is my own decision to garrison the North.

493
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,080
How long will you be gone?

494
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,410
When will you come back to the capital?

495
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,360
Please take care, Your Highness.

no matter how long you will be gone,

I will be waiting for you.

499
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,830
Your Highness, you have offered an inappropriate present.

500
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:37,760
I cannot take it.

501
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,880
It is not an inappropriate present.

502
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,580
I am not going to come back to the capital.

503
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,180
Your Highness, you don't have to wait.

504
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:45,780
His Majesty will hire a new tutor for you.

505
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:48,610
You are not only a tutor

506
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:52,330
to me.

507
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,720

Very good, very good!

512
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,950
Ming Wei's emotions are very realistic.

513
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:23,970
You have demonstrated the grievances and dissatisfaction of the princess

514
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:24,830
right on point.

515
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,460
Good job, Ming Wei!

516
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,000
Let's switch the set up!

517
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,380
Great move!

518
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,900
He really deserves to be the best actor.

519
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:34,890
Please pass it to me.

520
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,490
Thank you.

521
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,530
You are welcome.

522
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,340
Your boyfriend is here to visit you?

523
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,260
Ex-boyfriend.

524
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,940
Let me give a brief introduction to you.

525
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,070
This is the main scene of the TV series,

526
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,530
the imperial garden.

527
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,440
We have filmed most of our

528
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,110
plots here.

529
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,900
To be honest, in order to build this scene at that time...

530
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:13,630
What are you thinking?

531
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:15,070
I have gone through the documents of

532
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,890
architectures and gardens from that era.

533
00:39:16,890 --> 00:39:17,640
Nothing.

534
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,880
It is said that this Mr. Cheng

535
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,810
has invested a lot of money to our crew.

536
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,200
He is a well-known rich princeling who

537
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,410
invests films and TV shows to

538
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,740
chase after actresses.

539
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:28,930
Let the audiences

540
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,000
experience that era.

541
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:40,060
Come, Mr. Cheng. Please come this way.

542
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,400
You know each other?

543
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,380
He just smiled at you,

544
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,720
didn't he?

545
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,450
I don't know him.

546
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,210
A guy like him must

547
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,100
smile at

548
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,630
all the young actresses.

549
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,710
Fair enough.

550
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:00,950
Ming Wei, as a rookie,

551
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,420
you have to be very careful.

552
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,020
Don't let people take advantage of your words.

553
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:07,080
I know, thank you.

554
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,570
[Cheng Yao.]

555
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,450
Wei, I am looking forward to seeing you at the dinner party.

556
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,100
Do you have anything to do

557
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,330
with me being nominated as the heroine?

558
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,880
I will tell you in person tonight.

559
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,120
The banquet is going to start,

560
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,050
you are really not going to show up?

561
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,110
You know I don't attend

562
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:11,380
meaningless social events.

563
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:15,120
An event which is organized by so many sneaky investors

564
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,420
down there.

565
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,100
Ming Wei is so pretty and innocent.

566
00:41:19,570 --> 00:41:22,630
You really don't care that they might take a move on her?

567
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:25,410
Why would I care?

568
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,740
Enjoy your meal.

569
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,380
Alright, we will go first.

570
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,020
OK, OK.

571
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,880
-Let's go, there. -Alright.

572
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,710
Thanks for your work.

573
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:46,950
It is not easy to succeed this year

574
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,150
in this environment.

575
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:49,820
Miss Ming!

576
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,250
Hello, hello.

577
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:53,760
Hello.

578
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,110
Hello.

579
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,730
This is the heroine Miss Ming, right?

580
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,110
Stunning as expected.

581
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,470
Miss Ming is surely a heavenly beauty.

582
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,400
I don't know if you can come

583
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,080
to our company in the future.

584
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,800
Ming Wei,

585
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,940
I haven't seen you for a long time.

586
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,160
You have become more beautiful.
