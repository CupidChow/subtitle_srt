00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,860
Why?

5
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,420
You promised me already,

6
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:40,980
why are you marrying someone else?

7
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,579
I abide by the late Emperor's edict to teach Your Highness,

8
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,850
I have never had other thoughts.

9
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,090
I don't believe that.

10
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,040
If you don't feel anything for me,

11
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:53,420
then why did you keep the Double Seventh Festival promise?

12
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,020
I have never had affections for Your Highness.

13
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,650
It is my fault

14
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,890
to have given Your Highness the wrong impression.

15
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,540
Wrong impression?

16
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,540
You can tell me that

17
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,840
you have your own pain and difficulties,

18
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,940
or you have to marry someone else.

19
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,020
As long as you admit that

20
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,990
I have indeed lived in your heart once.

[Virtue can give off real fragrance.]

22
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,650
I was born of a humble family.

23
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,780
I wouldn't dare to out-marry Your Highness.

24
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,240
I'm begging Your Highness

25
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,340
to let me go.

26
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,459
You said "to let you go"?

27
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:21,740
Fine.

28
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,260
Since it was my misunderstanding,

29
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,980
it is not your fault.

30
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,020
Look at me.

31
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,620
I will let you go as you wish,

32
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,140
but I will make you

33
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,900
never forget about me.

34
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:29,850
I thought I could feel

35
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,340
at least a little sincerity from you by doing this.

36
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,220
Seems like I was wrong.

37
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,590
You really have no feelings for me.

38
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,280
What else do you want me to do, Your Highness?

Grand Tutor,

42
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,050
please report to His Majesty and Empress Dowager that

43
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,620
I'm willing to marry him.

44
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,950
As for the date of marriage,

45
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,520
let's make it the same day

46
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,380
as yours.

47
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,940
In fact,

48
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,940
my first choice is Grand Tutor,

49
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,360
and the second is His Royal Highness.

50
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,380
Since you have already committed to someone else,

51
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:46,020
I won't impose myself on you.

52
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,060
I won't make it

53
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,540
to your wedding.

54
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,740
I can only congratulate you in advance.

55
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,070
May you have a baby soon.

56

Yes.

62
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,740
So Her Highness's wedding

63
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,270
must be even more luxurious than this, right?

64
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,740
The Chief Cabinet Minister is only below His Majesty.

65
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,299
As for such an important event,

66
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,890
his ceremony may not be inferior to the royal family.

67

You are right.

68
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,750

Chief Cabinet Minister, have you thought it through?

If you break in any further,

78
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,220
it will be resistance to the edict.

79
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,220

Yes. If the late Emperor is still alive,

he must be so distressed

I can't afford this.

All that I pursue in life

139

is to make sure Your Highness

can always be superior,

you also denied my life-long pursuit.

156
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,540
haven't done anything for you,

00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,380
and even put you in such a situation.

three months after the wedding.

165
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,660

166

and named him Mu Ze.

Does Mu Ze treat you well?

He treats me like his real father.

170

If everything started all over again,

171
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,620
would you lie to me again?

172
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,430
His Majesty has ordered

173
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,550
to hold me in confinement at the Princess Palace.

174
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,370
I can't get out

175
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,940
from now on.

176
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,940
You...

177
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,070
need to take good care of yourself.

178
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:43,320
Don't do everything yourself

179
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,420
at this age.

180
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,340
If there's an afterlife,

181
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,660
I wish we wouldn't do each other wrong again,

182
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,060
and could stay together.

183
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,260
If there's an afterlife,

184
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,420
I, Mu Yun, will definitely put everything behind,

185
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,180
only to stay with you

186
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,060
for a lifetime.

187
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,990
Grand Tutor.

188
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,540
Grand Tutor, without His Majesty's order,

189
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,020
you can't break into the palace.

190
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,210
I have to see His Majesty today.

191
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,860
If I let you in, I will die.

192
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:20,580
Move.

193
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,270
Grand Tutor.

194
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,670
[Hanyuan Palace]

195
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,920
Your Highness.

196
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,580
Your Highness, big trouble.

197
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:33,860
Your Highness, big trouble.

198
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,160
What happened?

199
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,270
News just came from the Imperial Palace.

200
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,340
His Majesty wouldn't withdraw the edict.

201
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,800
Two lords were already sent to the dead cell.

202
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,580
Tomorrow, between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., they will be...

203
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,660
They will be...

204
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,900
If he can't persuade His Majesty...

205
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,090
Prepare my zither

206
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,930
and wine for me.

207
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,020
Your Highness.

208
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,340
[Hanyuan Palace]

209
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,140
Because of me,

210
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,420
you lost your title as Chief Cabinet Minister.

211
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,880
Do you regret living an ordinary life with me

212
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,500
in this village, for the rest of your life?

213
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,660
For you,

214
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,500
not only in this life,

215
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,840
but for infinite days and nights,

216
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,910
I'd like to be a countryman willingly,

217
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:57,770
and will never regret it.
