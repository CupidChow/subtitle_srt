10
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,020
Your Highness, are you here to persuade me too?

11
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,940
Yes.

12
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,180
Go ahead, Your Highness.

13
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,900
Although they are not your parents,

14
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,980
seeing them so desperately

15
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:18,420
miss their child,

16
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,620
I can't bear rejecting them.

17
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,180
I believe

18
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,730
that you can't bear

19
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,150
letting them down, either.

20
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,740
Your Highness, do you really want me to turn back to Mu Tingzhou,

21
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,740
and thereafter

22
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,510
forget everything between us,

23
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,700
and become total strangers?

24
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,820
Of course I don't.

25
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,980
I hope that Grand Tutor will never leave me.

26
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,140
But that will be

27
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,340
too selfish.

28
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:50,840
So selfish that

29
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,030
for the sake of my romance,

30
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,240
I have to deprive Mu Tingzhou of his right to recover

31
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,940
and the love between him and Xu Lin,

32
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:05,350
and deprive his parents of their sentiment of missing.

33
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,700
My conscience won't allow me to do that.

34
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:12,940
So Your Highness would rather sacrifice yourself

35
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,050
to let me go, right?

36
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,120
If you are certain that you are Mu Yun,

37
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,670
not Mu Tingzhou,

38
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,540
just go to the places you once visited with Xu Lin

39
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,520
to prove that you are Grand Tutor.

40
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:38,390
Now that Your Highness said it,

41
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,260
I will do it

42
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,540
and try to prove my identity.

43
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,460
But Your Highness,

44
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,380
please go with me.

45
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,980
That's the only thing I wish for.

46
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,620
Is this a punishment for my greed

47
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,620
to let me witness Grand Tutor's past

48
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,420
with another woman?

49
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,540
OK. I promise.

50
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:17,140
Tingzhou, do you remember this bookstore?

51
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,170
We used to come here together.

52
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,820
I wondered if it would still be open before we came.

53
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,880
I didn't expect that it's still here.

54
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,490
Look at this comic book.

55
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,580
I asked you to buy it for me at that time,

56

you used to play basketball here,

to give flowers and gifts to you.

82
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:09,940
However,

83

you never cared about their feelings

as an excuse,

But do you know how many girls and fans

89

When I failed my exams back then,

00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,000
Tell me why you feel so sad.

177
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,160
I'll help you deal with it, OK?

178
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,470
Don't be sad.

179
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,520
I don't want to be separate from the Grand Tutor.

180
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,010
I really love him.

181
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,690
Do you know that

182
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,780
I've never been so in love before.

183
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,820
I really love him.

184
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,380
Love him a lot.

185
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,410
Come here.

186
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,860
You must feel sick.

187
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:44,690
You must feel sick after drinking too much.

188
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:45,660
Have some water.

189
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,180
Slowly.

190
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,270
Slowly, slowly.

191
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:00,980
Listen.

192
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,140
Actually,

193
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,060
I had some feelings for Mu Tingzhou before.

194
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,140
Just a little bit.

195
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,900
And that Cheng Yao.

196
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,630
But compared with the Grand Tutor,

197
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,530
they are nothing.

198
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:26,090
I really love the Grand Tutor.

199
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,700
I love him so much.

200
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,980
I love him.

201
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,130
I don't want to be separate from him.

202
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:36,540
I really don't.

203
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:37,380
I'm...

204
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,340
I'm going to be selfish for once.

205
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,010
I have to.

206
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,380
I don't want to be separate from him.

207
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,500
No, I don't.

208
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,120
I don't want to.

209
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,020
Do whatever you want.

210
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,700
Don't be separate from him if it makes you sad.

211
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,300
It's OK if we are selfish for once.

212
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:54,830
Alright?

213
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,900
OK.

214
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,030
Don't be sad.

215
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,330
Don't be sad.

216
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,119
I don't want to be separate from the Grand Tutor.

217
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,780
I won't.

218
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:34,500
I won't be separate from you.

219
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,740
Do you love me?

220
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,860
Do you love me?

221
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,140
Tell me.

222
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,100
I don't want to be separate from you.

223
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,620
I don't want to be separate from you.

224
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
No separating.

225
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,510
No separating.

226
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,600
OK, Your Highness.

227
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:56,100
I promise you.

228
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,870
I won't be separate from you, ever.

229
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,220
No separating.

230
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,290
Where am I?

231
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,420
I haven't brushed my teeth.

232
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,280
No kissing yet.

233
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,590
I don't mind.

234
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,540
I do.

235
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,980
What happened last night?

236
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Why are you here?

237
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,320
No separating.

238
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,980
I won't be separate from you.

239
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:11,940
Whatever.

240
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,460
I don't care if you are Lin, Jing, Mi, or Dou,

241
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,790
or whatever you are,

242
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,540
just back off.

243
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,500
Or

244
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,900
I won't go easy on you.

245
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,620
I won't go easy on you.

246
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,020
I won't break up with him.

247
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,280
No breaking up.

248
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,820
No breaking up.

249
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,360
Alright, alright.

250
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,460
Come here. We won't break up.

251
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,660
Sit down.

252
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:39,220
I...

253
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,380
I don't ever want to break up with Your Highness.

254
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,300
No matter it's Lin,

255
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,740
or Cat, or Jing, or Qian.

256
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:47,060
I won't even look at them.

257
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,230
Come on, Your Highness.

258
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,670
Take some sober-up decoction.

259
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,420
Your Highness, if you sleep with that makeup on,

260
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,880
it will be bad for you skin.

261
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,820
Last night,

262
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,660
I didn't look good, did I?

263
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,140
Your Highness was born with natural beauty.

264
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,260
In my heart,

265
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,760
you'll always be the most beautiful.

266
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,260
Wait a second.

267
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,580
How come it's so clean?

268
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,440
t's silky and soft.

269
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,700
It doesn't feel like a drunk face at all,

270
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,700
and I am not even wearing the makeup.

271
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,500
Last night,

272
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,310
I was not supposed to be able to remove the makeup.

273
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,840
Your Highness,

274
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,380
run away with me.

275
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,260
Your Highness,

276
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,310
as long as we get out of here,

277
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:33,380
we will get rid of all the chaos,

278
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,300
and be together forever.

279
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,980
Grand Tutor,

280
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,020
it's easier said than done.

281
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,780
Now there are all over

282
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,810
fans and reporters staring at us.

283
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,700
If we just leave,

284
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,080
how am I supposed to deal with my work?

285
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,880
What are my family going to do?

286
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,140
I know.

287
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,340
You don't admit you're Mu Tingzhou,

288
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,540
but you'll face the same issues with me.

289
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,620
If we just leave

290
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,010
and they couldn't find us,

291
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,540
they will get worried sick.

292
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,300
In terms of the work,

293
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,340
we could leave after you finish filming the South City.

294
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,870
Even if you run away with me,

295
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,030
you can still contact your family.

296
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,500
It's okay to make phone calls.

297
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,020
When the crisis is over

298
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,020
and no one keeps their eyes on us,

299
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,350
I'll go with you to your hometown, Su City,

300
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:21,940
to visit your parents.

301
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,200
We'll then get together with the family.

302
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,810
It turns out

303
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
you've already thought it through.

304
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,870
Your concern

305
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,540
is my concern.

306
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,220
I've already thought about all those issues.

307
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,620
It's not just an idea coming out of nowhere.

308
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,430
It's what I've thought about over and over again.

309
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,820
[Lingering Garden]

310
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:03,050
[Dali Chongsheng Temple]

311
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,380
Your Highness, would you like to go somewhere cold

312
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,620
or warm?

313
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,390
We'd better go somewhere warm.

314
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,860
You're afraid of cold,

315
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,580
and your hands and feet get cold in winter.

316
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,540
Well, I should

317
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,460
find some ways to solve this problem and keep your body healthy,

318
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,570
or it will also affect the pregnancy.

319
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,420
Grand Tutor,

320
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,820
what are you talking about?

321
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,380
OK.

322
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,180
Then let's move to the south,

323
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,300
to somewhere warm.

324
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,180
Right,

325
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,220
do you like spicy food

326
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,500
or not?

327
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,620
Maybe not too spicy.

328
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,420
It's likely to get acne if you eat too much spicy food.

329
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,010
OK.

330
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,980
You cares about beauty

331
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,060
and especially your skin.

332
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,740
Then, we should go to places like Guangzhou, Hong Kong,

333
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,980
where people don't eat spicy food.

334
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,860
Or,

335
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:49,700
we could leave China

336
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,440
and go somewhere farther.

337
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,590
The world is big,

338
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,830
and I believe we'll find the place where we belong to.

339
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,060
Then,

340
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,510
what are we going to making a living by?

341
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,700
How about

342
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:06,760
I picking up the Italian translation job and making money for you?

343
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:08,220
I'm a decent man.

344
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,060
How can I live on you?

345
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,220
I'll feel ashamed of it.

346
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,350
There's no dignity.

347
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,090
I just did the calculation.

348
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:17,900
Depending on the current assets of Mu Tingzhou,

349
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:18,980
if we tighten the purse strings,

350
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,500
it's enough for us to live on that for the whole life.

351
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,900
We could find somewhere with beautiful views

352
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,900
to set up a school

353
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,260
specializing in teaching traditional cultural etiquette.

354
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,450
We could teach children how to write poems,

355
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,890
spread Chinese culture,

356
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,540
and also make money for a living.

357
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,060
I didn't expect

358
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:37,060
Grand Tutor had such a thorough plan.

359
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,980
If you want to do the translation, just do it.

360
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,500
I won't trap you at home.

361
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,620
But if you don't want to work,

362
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,740
then stay at home with our children and me.

363
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,140
We could raise several kids.

364
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,060
Work and live together,

365
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,460
and enjoy our happy life.

366
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,920
Who's gonna have babies with you?

367
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,260
Our kids

368
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,100
must be beautiful and talented.

369
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,500
It'd be nice if all these things would come true.

370
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,660
It sure will.

371

00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,290
Your Highness,

375
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,090
didn't you rest well last night?

376
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,060
I'm okay.

377
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,580
I'd like to do some groceries today.

378
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,380
Is it okay for Your Highness to go to the scene by yourself?

379
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:25,940
OK.

380
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,620
Help me take this.

381
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,770
Sure, Sir.

382

Please wait a moment.

383
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,340
This way.

Hello, Ms. Shen.

Here's the thing.

396
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,100
The series is about to wrap soon.

397
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,740
And I think now is the time for you to strike while the iron is hot

and to act in some good plays.

I...

I'm not in a hurry to shoot new plays.

You can say it and we can discuss together.

I...

408
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,660
I don't have any plan.

409
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,420
I just want to

410
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,260
rest for some time.

411
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,620
Rest?

412
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,810
Certainly.

413
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,270
I respect your opinion.

414
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:46,560
You definitely need some rest

Is one month enough?

I really think

00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,370
it is a golden period for your career.

420
