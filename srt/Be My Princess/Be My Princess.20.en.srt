82
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,630
that he is sincere to me.

83
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,580
Even if he retrieves his memories someday,

00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,370
This doll

177
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,360
was from my dad when I was a kid.

178
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,550
Look, isn't it well preserved?

179
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,470
Back then, Ming Qiao

180
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,970
always wanted this doll.

181
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,020
I was not willing to give her.

182
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:02,940
If I gave her,

183
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,160
this doll's arms and legs would be long gone.

184
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,020
Your Highness is really kind and cautious.

185
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,500
This was taken when my parents took me to a park

186
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,100
when I was six.

187
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,090
What do you think?

188
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,820
Was I cute?

189
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,430
The little princess was very cute.

190
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,590
She is the most beautiful girl I have ever met.

191
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,140
My parents

192
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,190
treated me like I was a princess when I was little.

193
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,620
Now Grand Tutor is treating me like I'm a princess.

194
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,100
I'm so lucky.

195
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:59,020
Your Highness deserves to be treated well by everyone.

196
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,220
I'm afraid that I'm not treating you well enough

197
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,580
and making you wronged.

198
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,270
Why will I be wronged

199
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,590
with Grand Tutor being with me?

200
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,240
Your Highness,

201
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,300
are those books

202
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,690
you read to learn the foreign language?

203
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,340
Yes.

204
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,700
All of them.

205
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,390
Let me show you something else.

206
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:47,140
For love is as strong as death.

207
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Action.

208
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,160
[Grand Tutor looks at the scent bag with deep eyes.]

209
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,540
Grand Tutor.

210
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,060
Grand Tutor.

211
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,380
Come here.

212
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,540
Look.

213
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,640
These are the pictures taken when I was a kid.

214
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:25,700
This was taken

215
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,900
when I won a Chinese zither competition.

216
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,830
Look. There is Chinese zither too.

217
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,530
Oh my God. I wore braces when I was a kid.

218
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,820
Look. That was ugly.

219
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,530
What do you think?

220
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,990
How is my cooking skill?

221
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,100
You want me to tell the truth?

222
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:52,960
It's too thick.

223
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,780
Even my dad makes better porridge than you.

224
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,220
Am I being too straightforward?

225
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,950
It tastes good. Really.

226
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,740
No. No.

227
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:05,780
The scene of your dad beating

228
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,780
Tingzhou just appeared in my mind,

229
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,910
and I suddenly felt cold from the back.

230
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,630
Your dad even beat Tingzhou, a decent man,

231
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,340
let alone someone who was not well-behaved like me, right?

232
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,800
Oh right. And your sister.

233
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,620
She looked down upon me in the beginning.

234
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:25,020
Even Tingzhou told me to stay away from you,

235
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,640
because he thought I didn't deserve you.

236
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,820
Don't worry.

237
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,380
You got me.

238
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,350
What are you looking at?

239
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,700
I'm searching online

240
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,630
to see if there is anything that attention should

241
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,510
be paid to when marrying a person who has lost memory.

242
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,610
What does it say?

243
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,900
It says

244
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,020
as long as the documents are complete,

245
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,500
and both the man and the woman are willing to get married,

246
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,829
nothing can stop them from being a couple.

247
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,180
To be honest,

248
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,740
I don't know if it's right to agree to

249
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:15,050
the marriage of Wei and Mu Tingzhou.

250
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,500
But I can see that

251
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,050
Tingzhou is sincere to Wei.

252
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,180
I believe his sincerity.

253
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:30,620
However, he is suffering from memory loss.

254
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,270
No matter what happens in the future,

255
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,140
I'm here.

256
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,380
If Mu Tingzhou

257
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,710
dares to make Wei feel wronged,

258
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,100
I won't let him walk away.

259
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,840
I won't allow our daughter to be taken advantage of.

260
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,900
Ming Qiang,

261
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,940
Wei is

262
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,740
so lucky to

263
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,010
have a father like you.

264
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,740
It is also my luck.

265
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,010
Thank you.

266
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,620
Don't say that.

267
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,580
Since you married me with Wei,

268
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,990
she has been like a biological daughter to me.

269
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,940
After we get married,

270
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,860
I will follow the rules in the modern society,

271

Miss Ming,

346
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,080
we invited you here

347
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:35,330
to help our son retrieve his memories,

348
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:37,260
not to fool with his feelings.

349
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:38,660
Mrs. Mu.

350
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,860
It is our fault

351
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,180
not having discussed about this in advance

352
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,240
with you and Mr. Mu.

353
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,330
I understand what you are concerned about.

354
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:48,540
But we have thought it through carefully.

355
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,390
Just tell me.

356
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,900
How much is enough for you

357
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,260
to leave my son?

358
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,830
I never thought that

359
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,860
you had agreed to help us

360
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,840
with kindness,

361
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,310
only for such an impure intention.

362
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,910
Stop talking nonsense.

363
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,460
Mr. Mu.

364
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,820
No matter if you remember us,

365
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,950
if you recognize us,

366
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,950
we are your parents anyway.

367
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,710
You can't treat us like this.

368
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,620
Miss Ming.

369
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:24,690
I believe you are a rational person.

370
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,490
Tingzhou is muddled due to the illness,

371
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,830
but you should not follow him.

372
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,200
Mr. and Mrs. Mu.

373
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:37,580
Please cool down.

374
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,940
This is not going to solve the problem.

375
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,420
How about this?

376
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,000
I will handle this together with Shen Su.

377
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,660
I have been friends with Tingzhou for so many years.

378
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,740
I won't do him bad,

379
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:46,700
right?

380
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,310
Are you alright?

381
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,600
As a public figure,

382
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,300
shouldn't you keep your entertainment agents informed

383
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,100
before doing anything?

384
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,780
Sorry, Ms. Shen.

385
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,410
We were too rash in this.

386
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
What fault does Your Highness have?

387
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,410
When our relationship was disclosed,

388
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,740
Her Highness didn't know about it either.

389
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:35,420
To be honest,

390
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,660
I don't consent to you two being together at all.

391
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,320
I know what I say won't matter.

392
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,410
But you don't have to

393
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:43,060
make it go viral like this.

394
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,820
Keep a low profile, okay?

395
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,300
Keeping a low profile

396
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,420
would make us look guilty.

397
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,460
Thus anyone can jump out

398
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,700
and stand in the way of

399
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,700
me and Her Highness's relationship.

400
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
As far as I can see,

401
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,500
we are better off showing it to the public.

402
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,140
I am in a dignified relationship with Her Highness.

403
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,540
And since the fact is out,

404
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,540
no one would dare to butt in.

405
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:07,780
Even if there will be some boring people talking nonsense,

406
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,700
Her Highness and I have nothing to hide,

407
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:10,960
so we won't fear rumor.

408
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,620
But have you considered Ming Wei's situation?

409
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,980
If you are Mu Tingzhou right now,

410
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,180
I believe many people will be there

411
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,310
to support you and wish you happiness.

412
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,490
After all, you are both unmarried.

413
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,660
And you are a very good match.

414
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:23,900
However,

415
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,260
the fact now is that you don't have Mu Tingzhou's memory,

416
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,660
but you keep the identity of the Best Actor.

417
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,340
A lot of people will have the same feeling

418
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,500
as your parents,

419
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:34,100
that Ming Wei approached you for an impure intention.

420
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,700
No one will do anything to you,

421
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,360
but they will target Ming Wei.

422
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,660
I can release another claim,

423
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:41,830
announcing that

424
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,820
it was me who forced Her Highness.

425
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,080
Don't ever post on Weibo casually again.

426
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,940
This will only make it even worse.

427
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,920
From my point of view,

428
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,000
you two had better spend some time separately

429
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,540
to let the gossip cool down.

430
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,060
Can you listen to me for a minute?

431
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,500
We have been through the whole journey.

432
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,670
Others may not know,

433
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,520
but you two are very clear.

434
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,080
I broke up with Grand Tutor

435
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,420
just for the reason you said.

436
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,310
But we were both very miserable

437
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,530
after that break-up.

438
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,140
So

439
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,480
why don't we just cherish the happiness for now,

440
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
cherish the time we can be together?

441
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,180
If we could fight for this

442
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
and try hard,

443
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,560
even if we will encounter the problems of your concern,

444
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,700
we won't regret.

445
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,260
We are facing too many problems.

446
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,300
At least

447
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,500
we can get your support,

448
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,090
right?

449
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,830
Alright.

450
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,920
What is done cannot be undone.

451
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,450
Let's just try to find a way

452
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,540
to lower the bad influence as much as we can.

453
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,980
It is easy for you to say.

454
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,220
Don't you know what kind of influence

455
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,580
this type of gossip will do

456
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,240
to a new actress like Ming Wei?

457
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,740
I won't consent to it.

458
00:26:59,300 --> 00:26:59,980
Be assured.

459
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,900
You have got the superior entertainment agent, me.

460
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:03,860
Thank you.

461
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,800
Lin, Lin.

462
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,820
Don't go. Don't go.

463
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,350
Let me in.

464
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,380
It is really a bad time now.

465
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,100
I have to tell Tingzhou

466
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,220
Ming Wei is a liar.

467
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,020
Let me in.

468
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,460
Calm down.

469
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,500
Calm down, okay?

470
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,420
I can't.

471
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:37,340
What problem can you solve

472
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,430
except for making a scene?

473
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,370
That person inside is not Tingzhou now.

474
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:41,540
You raising hell like this

475
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,340
will only make him hate you more.

476
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,410
Who's brother are you?

477
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,100
Ming Wei's or mine?

478
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,490
Why are you always on her side?

479
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,660
I...

480
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,900
I hate you.

481
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,930
Lin, Lin.

482
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:06,900
Lin, come back.

483
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,540
Your Highness,

484
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:24,230
are you still worried about what Shen Su said?

485
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,700
Do you need me to

486
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,140
talk to her?

487
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,500
No.

488
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,660
Actually,

489
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,310
I know Ms. Shen is doing good for me.

490
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,060
I will talk to her later.

491
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,210
Although she is against our marriage,

492
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,100
she thinks for Your Highness all the time.

493
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,430
She is a pretty good entertainment agent.

494
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:51,760
Your Highness.

495
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:54,180
Let me do these

496
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:56,410
chores.

497
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,410
I just want to join you

498
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,180
and share the joy with you

499
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,500
during this process.

500
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,840
It suddenly occurs to me that

501
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,050
after you marry me,

502
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,970
I will change the study upstairs

503
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,570
into Your Highness's study.

504
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,780
Your Highness can read scripts in there.

505
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,540
And I will put a beanbag sofa there

506
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,460
that I read about online,

507
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,150
so that Your Highness can rest when tired.

508
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,860
I will also collect all kinds of movies

509
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,950
for Your Highness to watch.

510
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,500
Sounds great.

511
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,720
Lying on the beanbag sofa, watching a movie.

512
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:36,970
Super cozy.

513
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,780
However,

514
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,020
if I occupy that study,

515
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,060
what will you do?

516
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:45,310
I will be by Your Highness's side.

517
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:47,470
You read the script, while I look at you.

518
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,530
You watch a movie, while I look at you.

519
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:52,260
I feel very good, too.

520
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,780
Grand Tutor, you are becoming more and more frivolous.

521
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,510
It is more than sensible that I look at my own wife.

522
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,220
Besides,

523
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,380
I will go find

524
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,740
the best wood in the world by myself.

525
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:06,980
I will make a baby's crib

526
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,100
for our child with my own hands.

527
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,740
Grand Tutor, you are thinking too far.

528
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,780
Besides, we can just buy one.

529
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,180
The child of us

530
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,460
must use the best things

531
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,300
that are unique in this world.

532
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,440
Your Highness,

533
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,540
do you like boys or girls better?

534
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,540
Come on.

00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,820

536
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,300
Grand Tutor.

537
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,260
What's wrong with you?

538
00:30:59,330 --> 00:30:59,890
Nothing.

539
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,380
I just felt a bit dizzy.

540
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,500
I will be okay after taking a rest.

541
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,740
Mu Yun, hang in there.

542
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,070
Don't get disturbed by the heart demon from a different world.

545
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,310
You are looking good on this, Grand Tutor.

546
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,600
You are so pretty, Your Highness.

547
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:34,910
[Happiness]

548
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,330
Come here.

549
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:39,860
Let's go see upstairs.

550
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:46,460
[Happiness]

551
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,050
OK.

552
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:59,730
[Happiness]

553
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,960
Your Highness.

554
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,060
do you like it?

555
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,430
As long as that's what you do for me,

556
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,210
I like it all.

557
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,250
I didn't change the third floor.

558
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,030
It is still Your Highness's bedroom.

559
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,290
I think whenever it is,

560
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,020
Your Highness will need a place

561
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,550
where you can be on your own,

562
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:28,540
despite that I won't give Your Highness the opportunity to be alone.

563
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,670
I will fill up every second in your life

564
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,420
with the rest of my life.

565
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,200
Let me show you something.

566
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,140
This is our first two-shot.

567
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,490
You were very aloof back then,

568
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,860
the Best Actor looking down from high above.

569
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,620
Look,

570
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:05,260
I was crying like this,

571
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,900
but you still weren't willing

572
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,020
to retake a photo with me.

573
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,219
That was Mu Tingzhou.

574
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,100
I would never have done this to Your Highness.

575
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:12,760
From now on,

576
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,699
no matter it's inside or outside of our house,

577
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,940
Your Highness will be in charge

578
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:16,860
of everything.

579
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:18,900
Really?

580
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,900
Promise.

581
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,820
A word spoken

582
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,060
is an arrow let fly.

583
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,980
Alright, here is enough.

584
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,600
Your Highness.

585
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,460
I know.

586
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,590
You have reminded me so many times.

587
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,570
Tomorrow morning,

588
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:11,870
as soon as the Civil Affairs Bureau is open,

589
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,060
we will meet there.

590
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,220
I will get all the documents

591
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,160
ready tonight.

592
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,350
I won't forget anything.

593
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,140
Don't worry.

594
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,460
Your Highness.

595
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:26,140
Starting tomorrow,

596
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,780
we will be husband and wife.

597
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,110
No matter what happens in the future,

598
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,190
or how many difficulties are there awaiting,

599
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:36,470
I beg Your Highness

600
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,530
to trust my true heart.

601
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:44,180
Don't let me go.

602
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,860
I trust you.

603
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,780
I will trust you forever.

604
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:25,020
Did you tell your sister about us?

605
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,820
I haven't got the chance.

606
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,860
I think I will wait

607
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,060
till she settles things down with Mu Tingzhou

608
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,210
tomorrow,

609
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,340
and then tell her.

610
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,520
[Did you tell your sister about us?]

611
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,300
Qiao, you are home.

612
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,020
I'm home, Wei.

613
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,260
Do you have my

614
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,800
blue amino acid clay mask?

615
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,900
Yes, I will get it for you.

616
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,140
Can't wait to get ready for tomorrow?

617
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,060
We will take photos.

618
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,540
I have to make sure it's perfect.

619
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,680
I'm counting on this pore-cleaner.

620
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:09,600
Don't worry.

621
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,220
No matter how ugly you are,

622
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,770
Grand Tutor won't give you up.

623
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:13,700
What do you mean?

624
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,660
He won't give me up

625
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,190
no matter what I'm like, OK?

626
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,120
Do you want me to go with you tomorrow?

627
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:20,920
Better not.

628
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,200
I'm afraid too many people there will draw attention.

629
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,040
OK.

630
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:27,850
So,

631
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,530
getting married tomorrow?

632
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:30,730
What's your feeling?

633
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,950
A little joyful.

634
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,670
A little excited.

635
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,230
A little nervous.

636
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:41,520
And a little unbelievable.

637
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,230
Why is it unbelievable?

638
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,790
I have never thought,

639
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,610
or dared to think that

640
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:52,040
I would marry Grand Tutor one day.

641
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:55,150
Nor have I ever thought that Grand Tutor would be so determined

642
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,150
and we could end up getting married.

643
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:01,450
Wei,

644
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:03,170
do you feel that

645
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,700
Grand Tutor and Mu Tingzhou

646
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,700
are two separate persons all along?

647
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,990
At the beginning,

648
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,250
I felt that they were the same person.

649
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,180
But as I spent

650
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,830
more and more time with Grand Tutor,

651
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,800
I started to feel like

652
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,530
he is a completely different person

653
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:23,670
from Mu Tingzhou.

654
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,510
The one that I love

655
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,320
is Mu Yun,

656
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,340
not Mu Tingzhou.

657
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,130
He is really perfect,

658
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:36,180
and very nice to me.

[Mu Yun]

660

There is only one person in his heart and eyes,

you seem to be really deep in love.

664
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,150
So it seems like

665
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,760
Grand Tutor is a prince charming.

666
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,340
Grand Tutor must be a gift sent from heaven.

667
00:38:57,850 --> 00:38:58,780
I think that

668
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,500
the one that has been loved by Grand Tutor

669
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,830
will be very hard to fall for other people.

Apply more.

676
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:25,700
Apply some yourself, too.

677

No, no.

for a long time.

689
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,640
Thank you for

690
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,000
giving me so much help.

691
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:25,340
What are you thanking me for?

692
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,150
We have known each other for almost 20 years.

693
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,880
I have always kept you company.

694
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,590
Seeing you are happy now,

695
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,330
I'm really happy for you.

696
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:36,490
No matter you are Grand Tutor or Mu Tingzhou.

698
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,630
What's wrong with Grand Tutor?

699
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:17,880
It is already half past eight.

700
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,210
Why is he still not here?

701
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:22,600
He is not that kind of person to be late.

702
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,740
Isn't this Ming Wei?

703
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,900
She's Ming Wei, so what?

704
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,360
I have only you in my heart.

705
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:50,720
Xiao Zhao.

706
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,380
Ming Wei, get in and come with me to the hospital.

707
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,420
Where is Grand Tutor?

708
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,620
Let's talk in the car.

709
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,310
What's wrong?

710
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:58,170
What happened?

711
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,260
He didn't get up this morning.

712
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
I went to call him,

713
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:11,260
but he wouldn't wake up.

714
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,780
I didn't know what to do, so I called an ambulance and sent him to the hospital.

715
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,830
The doctor examined him and said

716
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,470
there was nothing wrong with his vital signs.

717
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:17,870
But he just won't wake up.

718
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,640
Is this...

719
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,270
Is this the sequela

720
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,910
after he fell down the horse?

721
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:26,960
It is all my fault.

722
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,570
Grand Tutor, please.

723
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:31,880
Please come to life.

724
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,230
Why is he still not awake?

725
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,510
I will ask the doctor again.

726
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,180
Grand Tutor,

727
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:08,330
you are awake.
