00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,520
It's said on the Internet that

175
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,830
all the girls hope to

176
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:16,190
give their first kisses to their boyfriends.

177
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:17,530
So now,

178
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,450
am I your boyfriend?

179
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,620
It's good, it's good.

180
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,460
Alright, alright.

181
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,450
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

182
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,620
What brand is your lipstick?

183
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,500
It smells good.

184
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,300
If you like it,

185
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,400
I will send you the link next time.

186
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,540
Where is Grand Tutor?

187
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,290
Every time I am done with shooting,

188
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,550
he is always the first one to be by my side.

189
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:13,740
Ming Wei,

190
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,260
there is no position for me

191
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,820
to speak of your personal life.

192
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,740
But as a friend,

193
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,980
I still want to give you some suggestions.

194
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,630
Please, go ahead.

195
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,620
The Grand Tutor is a good man,

196
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:28,620
and I can see that he treats you with all his heart.

197
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,920
I am also happy for you.

198
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,510
But after all, it is a special time for him.

199
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,260
I hope you can protect yourself

200
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,990
when you are in a relationship.

201
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,420
Don't fall too deep into it.

202
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,020
Otherwise you will get hurt.

203
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,340
I will bear it in mind.

204
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,780
Don't worry.

205
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,540
Actually,

206
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:49,020
I've always wanted to confess my feelings to you.

207
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,680
But to lose to the Grand Tutor,

208
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,940
I am also sincerely convinced.

209
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,070
Although we cannot be lovers,

210
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,550
we can still be friends.

211
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,730
Ming Wei, please remember that

212
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,700
you have a good friend named Chen Zhang.

213
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,140
Whatever happens to you,

214
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,820
I will be there and do my best to help you.

215
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,220
Thank you, Chen Zhang.

216
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,140
No need to stand on ceremony.

217
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,220
You are the princess, and

218
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,150
I am the consort.

219
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:21,730
We have bowed to heaven and earth on the wedding ceremony.

220
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,070
Grand Tutor,

221
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,730
how come you are here?

222
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,940
I have been looking for you.

223
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,670
The work is done, let's go home.

224
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,940
It's nothing.

225
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,340
What's wrong?

226
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,740
I am...

227
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,420
I just...

228
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
have a heartache.

229
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,500
Heart...heartache?

230
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,830
It is not a heart disease, is it?

231
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,060
Let's go to the hospital.

232
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:12,620
No, no.

233
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,420
Don't.

234
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:15,660
It is not a heart disease.

235
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,380
It's just an anxiety.

236
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,260
Are you jealous?

237
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:29,970
You are jealous!

238
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,490
No wonder you didn't come to see me

239
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,290
when I was in the act of shooting.

240
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,380
Grand Tutor,

241
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,860
I swear an oath to you with my life

242
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,640
that it was not a real kiss.

243
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,880
It was all fake.

244
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,380
For real?

245
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,260
And I promise

246
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,180
I'll never take kiss shooting anymore.

247
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,260
Alright.

248
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,420
Go.

249
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,660
Go. You two.

250
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,550
My car is by the door.

251
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,170
Ah.

252
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,780
Ming Qiao said she would come here soon

253
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,040
to have dinner with us.

254
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,550
Is Ming Qiao coming?

255
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,980
Why didn't I know?

256
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:06,870
She didn't tell you?

257
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,060
No.

258
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,120
She just told me on WeChat.

259
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,540
Come.

260
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,160
Help yourself.

261
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,710
Please, Your Highness.

262
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,740
Mr. Mu.

263
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,100
To you.

264
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,010
You saved my sister before.

265
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:51,050
Thank you.

266
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,140
I hope in the future,

267
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,460
no matter how many things you have to go through,

268
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,330
you'll always be good to my sister.

269
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:58,900
I'll treat her with all my heart.

270
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,610
Grand Tutor.

271
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,510
Help yourself.

272
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,300
Try this.

273
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:23,040
It's tasty.

274
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,780
Your Highness, the temperature is just good.

275
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,580
What the hell!

276
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,180
I came to witness PDA.

277
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,890
You just see it for a little while.

278
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,550
I've been with them everyday,

279
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,830
and I have enough of it.

280
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,600
Have some more.

281
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,060
Grand Tutor.

282
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:53,940
Your Highness.

283
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:55,740
There you go.

284
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,500
Xiao Zhao.

285
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,640
This is the soup I just scooped out of the pot.

286
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,820
I've blown it.

287
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,700
The temperature is just good.

288
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,260
Try it. Is it good?

289
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,220
Thanks, Ming Qiao.

290
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:22,500
Here's one for you.

291
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,420
I can scoop it myself.

292
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,170
Xiao Zhao.

293
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,430
Try this shrimp.

294
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,680
Thanks, Ming Qiao.

295
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,860
Now you see your sister get along with Tingzhou,

296
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,460
and you should rest assured.

297
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,450
I came to see her

298
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:04,780
not just because I was worried about them.

299
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,060
Xiao Zhao.

300
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:10,980
Do you... Do you have time on New Year's Eve?

301
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,480
New Year's Eve?

302
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,030
Nothing scheduled.

303
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,820
Really?

304
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,140
I have a band that I like very much.

305
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,460
They happen to have a performance on New Year's Eve.

306
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,420
I've bought two tickets.

307
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,150
Let's watch the show together.

308
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,570
You just reminded me. I almost forgot

309
00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:27,430
I have something to do that night.

310
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,300
You just said you had nothing to do.

311
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,500
Now you just changed.

312
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,730
It's about work.

313
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:33,660
Very hard to say.

314
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,340
It must be difficult for you to buy the tickets.

315
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,060
Why don't you take your classmates out?

316
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:38,920
Don't waste it.

317
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,100
Isn't your work

318
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,380
taking care of my sister's husband-to-be?

319
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:45,640
I could call my sister.

320
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:48,490
Grand Tutor would listen to my sister.

321
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,380
I'll let him to grant you a day-off.

322
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,060
No. No. No.

323
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,060
It's too late.

324
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,720
Your sister must be sleeping.

325
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,020
I can't bother my sister.

326
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,500
I'll call her tomorrow.

327
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,180
No.

328
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,740
I mean. Don't call her.

329
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,790
I'll try to arrange some time off that day.

330
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,540
Seriously?

331
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,340
Yes.

332
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,510
It's a deal then.

333
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,880
We'll go to the concert together on New Year's Eve.

334
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,500
OK.

335
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,960
I'm gonna go upstairs.

336
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,060
Good night, Xiao Zhao.

337
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:15,780
Good night.

338
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,580
Xiao Zhao,

339
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,860
what are you doing?

340
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,500
Didn't you promise Ming Wei

341
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,360
to keep a distance from Ming Qiao?

342
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,780
Well,

343
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,540
if it's only going to a concert,

344
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,010
it should be okay.

345
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,460
Xiao Zhao,

346
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,740
you always call yourself as a veteran of picking up girls.

347
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,780
How come you are puzzled

348
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,240
by a little girl this time?

349
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:05,880
Don't you think

350
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,630
there's something going on between Ming Qiao and Xiao Zhao?

351
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,699
I think they're good.

352
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:13,870
They get along with each other.

353
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:16,620
Yeah.

354
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,460
The problem is they're getting along too well.

355
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,940
That's what makes it weird.

356
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,940
A few days ago, Ming Qiao told me

357
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,560
she had a crush on someone.

358
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,300
I was just wondering

359
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,500
if it could be Xiao Zhao.

360
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,260
Is it because he has been taking care of her lately,

361
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,980
so that Ming Qiao misunderstood him?

362
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,370
Your Highness, please rest assured.

363
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,420
I'll talk to Xiao Zhao.

364
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,580
Good.

365
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:40,670
Grand Tutor,

366
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,389
I'm gonna go wash up.

367
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,780
Have a good rest. Don't stay up late.

368
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,340
Your Highness.

369
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,460
What, Grand Tutor?

370
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
Let me help you take off your makeup.

371
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,980
Alright.

372
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,270
Grand Tutor.

373
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,720
It'll hurt my skin if you keep kissing me.

374
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,260
I know I'm guilty,

375
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,590
but I can't control myself.

376
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:55,260
Grand Tutor,

377
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,250
are you jealous?

378
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,780
I've got lip balm on.

379
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
It's the lip balm got kissed, not me.

380
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,190
I've applied it inside as well.

381
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:20,640
We kissed it like this.

382
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,320
Alright. Alright.

383
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,530
OK.

384
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,120
Your Highness.

385
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,140
Grand Tutor, you...

386
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,820
Why did you get your knees down?

387
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,680
Your Highness,

388
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm getting more and more greedy.

389
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,240
I know it's not right, but I just can't control my emotions.

390
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,540
You know you're guilty,

391
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,550
then will you do that again?

392
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,420
Well,

393
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,000
it depends on whether Your Highness will punish me.

394
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Punish you?

395
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,020
If you

396
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:28,020
kiss me without my permission again,

397
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,940
I'll punish you

398
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,940
by taking care of me as a princess all your life.

399
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,500
Then do it.

400
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,900
I'd love to do it.

401
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,220
The crew rarely changes the spot.

402
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,680
We could have two days off.

403
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:27,680
Your Highness,

404
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,060
do you know

405
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,420
how to ride this bicycle?

406
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:33,860
Of course.

407
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,300
I'm good at it.

408
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,950
Not only can I ride,

409
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:39,460
but also I can do it without holding on to it.

410
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:40,900
Just let it go.

411
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,500
Quickly.

412
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,500
Are you stepping on it?

413
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,900
Take your hands off of it.

414
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,900
I'm gonna take it seriously.

415
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,660
Alright.

416
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,700
Take it slow. Take it slow.

417
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,660
Grand Tutor, are you stepping on it?

418
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,500
Do this like me. Step on it with both your feet.

419
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,340
OK.

420
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:14,630
Grand Tutor.

421
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,540
I'm gonna take my hands off of it.

422
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:19,220
Watch out, Your Highness.

423
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:33,440
Let me tell you something. This is really tasty.

424
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,280
You tried Stinky Tofu before?

425
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:38,460
Sure. There are a lot in my hometown.

426
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,390
The chitterlings taste good, too.

427
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:44,010
How's it?

428
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,310
Really delicious.

429
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,420
Have some more.

430
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,120
Your Highness.

431
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,260
You've got something on your lips.
