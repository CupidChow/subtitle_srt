124

That would be unprofessional.

125

The main figure Grand Tutor, Mu Yun, from the show

144
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,060
is the one you care about for your whole life

145
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,380
as Princess Ming Hua.

146
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,660
So I want to ask,

147
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,500
what is Grand Tutor's

148
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,090
greatest charm?

149
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,820
As Ming Wei,

150
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,180
are you also moved by this character?

151
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,100
Grand Tutor is surely a character

152
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,740
Princess Ming Hua likes,

153
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,170
and so do I.

154
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,560
This character created by the scriptwriter

155
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,500
is nearly perfect.

156
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,340
That is a really high rating.

157
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,980
Enough, Tingzhou, stop watching it.

158
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,110
The dishes are cold.

159
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,220
Hurry up.

160
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,180
The life of Grand Tutor

161
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,420
is a magnificent upsurge and is about sacrificing himself.

162
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,980
He has a handsome and imposing appearance,

163
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,860
and within,

164
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,950
he is profoundly learned and extraordinary.

165
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:08,260
Even though he didn't end up with Princess Ming Hua,

166
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,500
he loved her for his whole life,

167
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,120
and always guarded her silently.

168
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,360
He has done so many things for her,

169
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:18,660
yet he had a lonely and sorrowful life himself.

170
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:21,450
I think if a man like Grand Tutor

171
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,780
doesn't deserve to be called perfect,

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,510

Grand Tutor is not the same person as Mu Tingzhou,

so there is nothing to compare here.

Best Actor has great acting skills.

she wouldn't cross paths

00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,410
But why was it awkward

346
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,060
when we met

347
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,630
his dad at the hotel?

348
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,090
Qiao, answer me first.

349
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,540
Why isn't Xiao Zhao's family name Xu?

350
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,000
Xiao Zhao's family name is Xu.

351
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,150
Xiao Zhao is just a disguised name.

352
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,480
His real name is Xu Run.

353
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,780
Run,

354
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,840
do you remember the auntie

355
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,030
I told you when you were little?

356
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,300
Is that auntie

357
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,940
Ming Qiao's mother?

358
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,420
I

359
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,940
met her at a party.

360
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:13,900
She

361
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,820
was invited to play the Chinese zither.

362
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,460
Graceful.

363
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,940
Gentle and refined.

364
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:26,320
I can still remember her look when she was playing the instrument.

365
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,450
But Run, do you know?

366
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,710
Your grandma looked down on her

367
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,700
and opposed us to be together.

368
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,340
She even went to Jiang Yue secretly

369
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,670
and forced her to leave.

370
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,700
But your grandma didn't know

371
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,120
that she was pregnant.

372
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,390
Why didn't you find her back

373
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,860
since you knew she was pregnant?

374
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,980
I tried,

375
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,180
but I couldn't.

376
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,100
I thought she hated me

377
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,700
for not dealing with it well.

378
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,980
So she left without a message

379
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:08,740
and I had no trace of her since then.

380
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,010
Thinking about it now.

381
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,620
I was so incapable at that time.

382
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,750
Run, do you think

383
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,540
Ming Qiao

384
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,340
is that child?

385
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,540
Mr. Mu.

386
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,300
Did

387
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,320
anything happen to your brain again?

388
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,760
It is just the routine follow-up.

389
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,260
Why do you

390
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,300
ask me to be here?

391
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,390
The flowers are pretty.

392
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,330
Ming Wei.

393
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,870
Your body condition

394
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,780
is not suitable to act for The Butterfly Lovers.

395
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,820
You can quit.

396
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,690
We discussed about this

397
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,340
before.

398
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,340
You encouraged me to act for it then.

399
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,380
And

400
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,290
I'm in good health. Why?

401
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,880
Don't hide it anymore.

402
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,420
I have known it.

403
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,270
To be honest,

404
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,820
you should seize the opportunity

405
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,020
since you are in the rising period of your career.

406
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:01,220
And act in more plays.

407
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,400
But as the reality is here.

408
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,550
Don't worry.

409
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,900
I will take my responsibility.

410
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,340
Mr. Mu,

411
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,460
what are you talking about?

412
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,780
I can understand nothing.

413
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,540
The child

414
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,340
is Grand Tutor's, right?

415
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,260
Don't worry.

416
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,980
I will be responsible for him.

417
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,660
And,

418
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,760
it is my child, too.

419
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,860
What... What child?

420
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,980
Mr. Mu,

421
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,110
is your memory wrong again?

422
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,740
Aren't you pregnant?

423
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
When...

424
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,690
was I pregnant?

425
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,420
Well, that day.

426
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,500
I saw you vomit.

427
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,060
I had something bad that day. It was enterogastritis.

428
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,460
Do you need to make a fuss?

429
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,460
But I heard you

430
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,420
talk over the phone that day,

431
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,460
saying you cannot raise him.

432
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,660
If you raise him, you cannot work.

433
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:14,420
This?

434
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,380
That's the dog of Ming Qiao's friend.

435
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,500
It had baby dogs.

436
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,180
We were discussing about raising the dogs.

437
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,220
Really?

438
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,020
That's why you

439
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:37,140
let Xiao Zhao buy sour grapes to test me.

440
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:44,260
I always like sour stuff since I was little.

441
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,820
Mr. Mu,

442
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,140
you should let the doctor check you once more.

443
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:52,440
I will leave first.

444
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:16,510
What are you doing?

445
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Dragging me here.

446
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,540
I notice you have something in mind.

447
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,660
Qiao is at home.

448
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,330
I was afraid it was not convenient.

449
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:26,990
That's why I dragged you here.

450
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,220
I figured it out.

451
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,380
Xu Xiu

452
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,940
is the one you told me, right?

453
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,710
For all these years,

454
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:47,720
I was worried.

455
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,040
I didn't imagine

456
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,360
the day has finally come.

457
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,180
I... I am not afraid to meet him again.

458
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,890
I

459
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,820
just don't

460
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,940
want past things

461
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,510
to influence our children.

462
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:10,630
What about this?

463
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,420
We can hide it from the children.

464
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,420
If Xu Xiu stays calm,

465
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,510
we won't say anything to the children.

466
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,100
OK?

467
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,950
It's the parents meeting event today.

468
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,500
It should be good today.

469
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,330
I really don't know

470
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:07,380
why it turned out to be like this.

471
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,590
What should come will come.

472
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:15,900
Things

473
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,410
cannot be avoided

474
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,740
because you don't want it to happen.

475
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,100
Qiao,

476
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,820
did your mom say anything to you

477
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,100
about today?

478
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,460
No.

479
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,620
I asked her.

480
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,460
But she didn't say anything.

481
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,010
Did my mom and your dad

482
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,340
bear any grudges?

483
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,990
Did your father tell you anything?

484
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,900
No, nothing.

485
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,140
Then, why?

486
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,940
I need to ask them.

487
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,100
Don't.

488
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,060
I think

489
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,670
we should ask later.

490
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,820
They are not in good mood anyway.

491
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,620
Don't think too much.

492
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,760
It will be alright.

493
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,220
Why do a single lady like me

494
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,060
see such a scene when I enter?

495
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:25,570
Don't torture me.

496
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,180
Sis, you are back.

497
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,180
Xiao Zhao,

498
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,710
congratulations.

499
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,500
You are about to be the son-in-law of Family Ming.

500
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,460
Behave well.

501
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,900
I will wait for you to call me sis.

502
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:39,780
OK.

503
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,820
I won't bother you here.

504
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,230
I will go home soon, sis.

505
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,660
Qiao.

506
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,420
What? Did you call me, sis?

507
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,100
Are you in a bad mood?

508
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,720
What happened today?

509
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,310
Did dad and mom not like Xiao Zhao?

510
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:40,820
What's wrong?

511
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:50,980
Today, Xiao Zhao invited our parents out for lunch,

512
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:54,200
and we met Xiao Zhao's father.

513
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:57,100
After mom saw his father,

514
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:58,710
she went away immediately.

515
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:00,620
I...

516
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,700
I am not sure if they had a thing before,

517
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:07,020
but it ended up in a very unpleasant situation.

518
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,890
Mom and Xiao Zhao's father?

519
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,620
It's impossible.

520
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,060
One is a housewife,

521
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,780
and the other is an entrepreneur in this city.

522
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,660
They have no connection at all.

523
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,920
That's what I thought.

524
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,260
So I am confused.

525
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,980
It's okay.

526
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:30,300
I'll ask about it next time.

527
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,360
It should be no big deal. Don't worry.

528
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,180
Do you think

529
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,140
his father would look down upon our family?

530
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,340
He looks down upon us?

531
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,400
They are not attractive to us.

532
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,940
Forget it.

533
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,380
As long as you and Xiao Zhao really love each other,

534
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,420
it is enough.

535
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:49,420
Don't worry.

536
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,560
Cherish those around you.

537
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,540
Once you lose them,

538
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,220
no matter what beautiful things you have experienced,

539
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,620
they wouldn't come back.

540
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,180
Are you thinking of Grand Tutor?

541
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,790
I told you not to take this show of The Butterfly Lovers.

542
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,500
Mu Tingzhou is not Grand Tutor.

543
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,900
Looking at his face everyday

544
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,230
is basically a torture.

545
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,500
Work is work.

546
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,430
It needs to be separated from love.

547
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,660
Anyway,

548
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,090
Mu Tingzhou is only my colleague now.

549
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:35,940
That's it.

550
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,360
Do you really think so?

551
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,020
You should know

552
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,500
your sister's psychological qualities.

553
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:03,340
Dad.

554
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:04,740
Run.

555
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,340
I've been thinking about it over and over again.

556
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,340
I should go ask Jiang Yue in person

557
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,780
and figure it out.

558
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,580
What do you think?

559
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,139
Dad, if you meet Ms. Jiang,

560
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,280
it will be awkward.

561
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,540
And she may not agree to meet you.

562
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:19,580
So I feel like

563
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,590
it would be better for me to ask her.

564
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:23,659
Alright.

565
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,340
You're right.

566
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,620
Thank you, son.

567
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,860
But hang on it with Run.

568
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:32,820
Sure, got it.

569
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,620
Madam.

570
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:50,600
Please have a seat.

571
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:03,540
Madam, what would you like to have?

572
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,740
Let me help you get it.

573
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,190
The reason you asked me out

574
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,920
is not really to buy me a coffee.

575
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,360
I know it sounds abrupt

576
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,720
if I ask you about this,

577
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,220
but there's one thing

578
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,500
I need to confirm with you.

579
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,140
Shoot.

580
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,020
Back then,

581
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,090
you left my father during pregnancy.

582
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:29,890
Years passed,

583
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,270
my father has always been looking for you.

584
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,660
I don't want you to get together with Ming Qiao.

585
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,220
Moreover,

586
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:46,630
I don't want to see any relationship between our families.

587
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,060
So

588
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,690
just stop here.

589
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:00,900
[Ming Qiao: Xiao Zhao, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?]

590
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:18,200
[Xiao Zhao, would you like to have dinner with me tonight?]

591
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,710
Aren't you busy today?

592
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,940
No.

593
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,500
Then why don't you go out and have a date?

594
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,580
You blamed me

595
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,950
for not giving you time to have a date, didn't you？

596
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,740
It's also important to accompany you.

597
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,540
Do you think I need your company?

598
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,390
[Ming Qiao]

599
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:29,970
Hi.

600
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,060
Hi.

601
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,220
Do you see the weather today?

602
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,420
It's a nice day toady.

603
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,840
Let's go have lunch together.

604
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,300
Do you have time this afternoon?

605
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,740
I really want to see this movie.

606
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:41,140
How about we go together?

607
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,900
I'm kind of busy today,

608
00:38:44,890 --> 00:38:46,290
so I can't accompany you.

609
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,940
How about the dinner?

610
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,020
It's okay. If you are busy,

611
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,080
I could come to you.

612
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,400
I probably need to stay up late today.

613
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,700
What have you been up to?

614
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,790
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

615
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,740
Sorry, Ming Qiao.

616
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,300
I have to hang up.

617
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,700
Xiao Zhao.

618
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,540
Say it.

619
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,780
What happened?

620
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,260
Why did you keep away from Ming Qiao?

621
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,980
No.

622
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:31,600
Nothing. For real.

623
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,210
Good for you.

624
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:35,480
You are hiding something from me.

625
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,510
I am warning you.

626
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,380
Never trouble trouble till trouble troubles you.

627
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,080
OK. Fine. I'm gonna go.

628
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,540
I'm out of here, okay?

629
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,500
Mom, try this.

630
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,860
It is on me today.

631
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,060
Order anything you want.

632
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:03,620
Enjoy yourself.

633
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,110
It's enough.

634
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,410
We've got so many dishes here.

635
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,020
It's not easy for you to make money.

636
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:08,880
Don't waste it.

637
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:09,740
Mom.

638
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,310
It doesn't cost much.

639
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:13,380
I'm gonna be on board with the crew.

640
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,440
There will be a while before we see each other again.

641
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,820
Today, let's just have a feast.

642
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:20,060
Yeah, it's nice of Wei to treat us.

643
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:21,550
Have some more.

644
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:23,740
Wei,

645
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,380
this time you go to work

646
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,780
and act with Mu Tingzhou,

647
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:28,740
you should be more careful.

648
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,170
If he wants more from you,

649
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,340
tell me immediately.

650
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,870
I will go teach him a lesson.

651
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,500
Dad,

652
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,780
t will be okay.

653
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,980
Mu Tingzhou is not a monster.

654
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,500
We are only

655
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,910
colleagues working together.

656
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:43,860
Anyway,

657
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:45,630
if we have any conflict,

658
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:48,060
Qiao and Xiao Zhao will stand up for me.

659
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:52,780
Yeah. Right.

660
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,860
This Xiao Zhao,

661
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,640
he even uses a fake name.

662
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:03,370
He must be that kind of rich kid

663
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,620
who just seeks fun

664
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,510
and is not dependable.

665
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,420
He uses the name only for work.

666
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,340
You can't say he is undependable only because of that.

667
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,600
Do you really know him?

668
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,380
Girl,

669
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:16,950
I don't have discrimination against rich kids.

670
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:19,100
It's just I feel like they have grown up

671
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,170
with abundance,

672
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,100
and are picky on girls,

673
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,980
and arrogant.

674
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,020
He may not treat you with all his heart.

675
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,260
My girl is not supposed to be

676
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,260
picked by him.

677
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,740
In my opinion, you two had better break up soon.

678
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:33,740
Who picks me?

679
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:35,980
How come you know he doesn't treat me sincerely?

680
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,170
You just met him for a few minutes,

681
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,900
and you knew he was not sincere?

682
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,500
Qiao,

683
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:45,510
your dad didn't mean it.

684
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,420
He just doesn't want you to waste your time.

685
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,580
Right, Qiao.

686
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,580
Don't be mad.

687
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,500
Dad. Mom.

688
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,820
I know Xiao Zhao well.

689
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:57,460
He is a man with a strong sense of responsibility,

690
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,380
so don't worry.

691
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,460
Dad. Mom.

692
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,240
Then tell me something

693
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,260
about you and Xiao Zhao's father.

694
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,420
What happened between you guys?
