00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,070
In other people's eyes,

178
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:29,460
you are still Mu Tingzhou.

179
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,420
Mu Tingzhou has his own life.

180
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,580
In his life,

181
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,260
I might just be

182
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,780
a tiny part without any importance.

183
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,980
How will I face the waken Mu Tingzhou

184
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:56,460
if I wear this ring?

185
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:05,100
You only care about the Best Actor, Your Highness.

186
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,230
Have you ever considered my feelings?

187
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,490
If I'm destined to sleep and never wake up again.

188
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,690
Have you thought that

189
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,440
whether I would have feelings

190
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,470
and something that I want to finish

191
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,820
before I fall asleep?

192
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,830
But I don't want to give up.

193
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,950
If I could live to be old,

194
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,660
why should I give you up, Your Highness?

195
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,020
If I'm destined to disappear,

196
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,500
why don't I cherish the

197
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,830
limited time with you?

198
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,340
Are you eager to give me a promise

199
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,420
by proposing me?

200
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:42,460
What are you afraid of?

201
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,020
This hair clasp is precious.

202
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,980
I think

203
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,840
I need to give it back to you by myself.

204
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,820
Is there nothing I can do

205
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,430
between you and me, Your Highness?

206
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,980
Grand Tutor,

207
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,000
I have figured it out.

208
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,220
The person

209
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:00,320
you care about most is Princess Ming Hua.

210
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,220
After when you woke up from the car accident,

211
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,780
you have been good to me

212
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,190
only because you took me as the Princess.

213
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,380
If I keep acting with you,

214
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,420
not only will we fail the original goal of bringing back your memory,

215
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,540
but I, the normal one,

216
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,810
will be affected by you and get ill.

217
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,060
It will cause the Princess Syndrome.

218
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,030
It's better to rip the band-aid off

219
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,020
and bring it to an end.

220
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,630
It will be better for both of us.

221
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,240
Sorry I made you feel so miserable

222
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,500
and made you cry.

223
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,580
It's my fault.

224
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,980
But I have to clarify that

225
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,520
I first saw you as the Princess

226
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,020
so I respected you

227
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,410
and thought nothing more than that.

228
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,870
Your Highness was innocent and hardworking

229
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:11,180
so I had a crush on you.

230
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,140
You asked me

231
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,980
who I really loved.

232
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,900
I am not sure.

233
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,780
But I am sure

234
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,100
that all my life

235
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,860
I have only had one crush.

236
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,580
The reason I love you

237
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:27,150
is definitely not because of your title, Your Highness.

238
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:35,490
From today on, I will be by your side.

239
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,260
Please take care.

240
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,340
Wei, is this all your things?

241
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,010
Let's go.

242
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,610
Everything here

243
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,880
was given to the Princess by Grand Tutor.

244
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,380
I can't take them away.

245
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,660
Sometimes,

246
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,260
we don't get to choose.

247
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,990
Whatever is supposed to happen

248
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,780
will happen.

249
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,200
[Mom]

250
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,260
Hello.

251
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,620
Wei.

252
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,310
What are you up to today?

253
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
Are you tired from shooting?

254
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,660
I... Everything is good.

255
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,420
I... I had so much fun here with the crew.

256
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,460
What's wrong?

257
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
You sound weird.

258
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:09,340
You have a strong nasal voice.

259
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,460
Did you get a cold?

260
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,660
I just woke up.

261
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,300
Maybe it's because of that.

262
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,600
It seems like you are tired today.

263
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,020
It's nothing,

264
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,820
Mom just missed you

265
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,330
and wanted to talk to you.

266
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,980
It's okay. Go back to sleep.

267
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:27,900
Wait a second.

268
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,500
Your dad wants to talk to you.

269
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,610
Wei, when are you coming back?

270
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,180
Dad misses you.

271
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,820
I... Probably around the New Year.

272
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:44,460
That's great.

273
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,100
It will not be long before the New Year.

274
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,820
Your dad and I have bought a lot food that

275
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,150
you and Qiao like to eat.

276
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,440
Come back home and we can be together.

277
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,220
OK.

278
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,140
I'll come back then.

279
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,220
See you soon.

280
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,670
Mom, I'm gonna go back to sleep.

281
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,700
Bye.

282
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:10,460
Alright. Go on, go to bed.

283
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,640
Your Highness only fears the Best Actor.

284
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,880
Have you considered my feelings?

285
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,220
If I were to fall asleep

286
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,450
and never wake up,

287
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,620
have you thought about

288
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,560
whether I would have feelings

289
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,070
and something that I want to finish

290
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,260
before I fall asleep?

291
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,340
Grand Tutor.

292
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,020
I'm sorry.

293
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,540
She has not left her room.

294
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,220
Same here.

295
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:53,860
This is the first time my sister has fallen so deeply for someone.

296
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,660
I'm really worried she won't be able to get over it.

297
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,060
But what can I do?

298
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,470
Matters of the heart

299
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:01,780
can only be resolved by those involved.

300
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:03,740
As bystanders, we can only watch.

301
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,380
They are obviously in love.

302
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,900
Why can't they be together?

303
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,540
People in love

304
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,880
can't always be together.

305
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,660
That's probably God's twisted plan.

306
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:35,780
Did Ming Wei leave

307
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,910
because Mr. Mu regained his memories?

308
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,220
At the moment, he has not fully regained his memories

309
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,140
but there's definitely been improvement.

310
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,620
Tingzhou has started to remember things from the past.

311
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,810
Going forward, we will continue treatment

312
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,670
and strive for a speedy recovery.

313
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:51,260
If the treatment doesn't progress,

314
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,940
will Mr. Mu

315
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,780
continue to be Ming Wei's assistant?

316
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,060
No one knows when

317
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,490
Tingzhou will recover.

318
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,740
He is much better now, thanks to

319
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,300
Miss Ming's patient companionship and assistance.

320
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,060
Although I'm not sure if Tingzhou

321
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,890
will remember what he went through as Grand Tutor

322
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:07,660
when he regains his memory,

323
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,620
we will certainly not forget

324
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:11,820
the kindness that Miss Ming has shown us.

325
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,580
We also hope that there will be...

326
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:17,739
-More opportunities to work together. -More opportunities to work together.

327
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,540
Would there still be opportunities in the future?

328
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,159
What are you doing?

329
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:29,850
Wei,

330
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,460
please cheer up.

331
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,540
We came from the same womb.

332
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,100
In more than 20 years together,

333
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,020
I have never seen you so down.

334
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,699
What about I take some time off

335
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,300
and we go somewhere to relax?

336
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,980
Let's leave this place.

337
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,120
Maybe you will recover more quickly.

338
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,310
There's no need.

339
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,850
Shen Su has already gotten an advertisement job for me.

340
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:52,900
I want to turn my sadness into strength

341
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,100
and put all my energy into my work.

342
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,739
I will use work to numb myself.

343
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:57,300
Please,

344
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,020
how are you going to work

345
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,980
in this state?

346
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,540
You look like you are going to visit a grave.

347
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,580
Oh yes,

348
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,540
you said you

349
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,620
had someone you like.

350
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,580
How's that going?

351
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,090
Wei, I have thought about it.

352
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,420
I do like him.

353
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,180
Then,

354
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,280
have you thought about

355
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,740
whether he likes you too?

356
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,940
What if

357
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,460
he only sees you as a friend

358
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,700
or

359
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,080
he treats all girls like that?

360
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,660
I am not sure

361
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,780
if he likes me or not.

362
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,710
But that's alright.

363
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,660
I like him.

364
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,020
As long as I like him,

365
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,020
I'd work hard.

366
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,300
Qiao,

367
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,750
I really admire you.

368
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,620
You are so brave with your feelings.

369
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:00,100
But what if the ending isn't what you wanted,

370
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,740
and you get hurt?

371
00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:04,140
If I try, I might get hurt.

372
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,400
If I don't try, I will certainly get hurt.

373
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,420
Wei, Wei.

374
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,340
Don't think about it.

375
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,540
Don't think about it.

376
00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,340
Hello,

377
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,700
Xiao Zhao.

378
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,620
Do you have some time?

379
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,580
I have something to tell you.

380
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,540
Can't you say it over the phone?

381
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,020
I can't.

382
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:07,940
I have to say it to your face.

383
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,100
What is going on?

384
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,150
Is your sister feeling better?

385
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:14,180
She can't get her spirits up.

386
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,460
She keeps saying she wants to use work to numb herself.

387
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,540
What about Mr. Mu?

388
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,470
He isn't doing well.

389
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,020
Since Ming Wei left,

390
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,740
he doesn't speak much

391
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,140
and often locks himself in his room.

392
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,620
It's only been a few days

393
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:37,600
but he's lost a lot of weight, and has not shaved.

394
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:40,210
The handsome Mu Tingzhou

395
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,670
has now become a dispirited uncle.

396
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,510
He is also a fool in love.

397
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,200
If not for the fact that

398
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,220
Mu Tingzhou may wake up any time

399
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,900
and hurt Ming Wei,

400
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,060
I would ask him

401
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,620
to get Ming Wei back right this instant.

402
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,420
Isn't life all about happiness?

403
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:56,540
Don't you think that

404
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,300
suffering for

405
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,660
an unknown future

406
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,160
is really painful?

407
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,860
That's right.

408
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,420
So, for some things,

409
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,920
you need to cherish them while you have them.

410
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,980
Don't treat yourself badly.

411
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,340
You have to be braver.

412
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:20,660
What if you regret this?

413
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,340
Am I right?

414
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,290
I want to sing a song for the person I like.

415
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,300
Lend me your guitar.

416
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,140
OK.

417
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,860
I want to sing a song.

418
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:50,130
It may not be any good.

419
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,800
Please forgive me.

420
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,380
This song

421
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,640
is for someone that I like.

422
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,820
Great, that's good. Yeah.

423
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:57,940
It was good.

424
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,740
I'm rooting for you, Ming Wei.

425
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,740
From tomorrow on,

426
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,550
you will start working.

427
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,310
Why are you back so late?

428
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,390
Didn't you take time off today?

429
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,380
What did you do?

430
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,480
I went to confess my feelings.

431
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,180
Xiao Zhao?

432
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:13,210
You knew?

433
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:16,770
I guessed.

434
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,860
How was it?

435
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:19,980
Did he agree to it?
