and Ming Wei is also my friend.

Tingzhou is your brother-in-law now,

Of course.

Since Tingzhou and Ming Wei are now in a relationship,

176
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,180
you are surely my sister.

177
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,700
You have a biological sister?

178
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,500
My sister never mentioned about it.

179
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,960
She doesn't know, either.

180
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,820
Your Highness?

181
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,770
I had so much fun on New Year's Eve.

182
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,720
[Ming Qiao.]

183
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,990
Thanks to Xiao Zhao's companionship.

184
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,859
What's wrong?

185
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,380
What's wrong?

186
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,430
Who were you with

187
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,690
last night?

188
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,579
Ming Qiao.

189
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,940
What is it?

190
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,430
Why were you with Ming Qiao on New Year's Eve?

191
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:37,670
It's New Year's Eve.

192
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,020
Your schedule should be packed.

193
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:43,690
She said she wanted to see a live performance of a band.

194
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:45,300
And she didn't want to trouble you guys, so

195
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,780
she called me.

196
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,710
It's better that you

197
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,790
keep your distance with Ming Qiao.

198
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:04,140
What are you guys thinking?

199
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,060
I have my rules.

200
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,650
You don't dip your pen in the company ink.

201
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:09,060
What can I possibly do to Ming Qiao?

202
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,590
She is basically my sister.

203
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,850
It is not that, it is because

204
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:19,140
Ming Qiao might grow feelings to you

205
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,980
due to your special care.

206
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,340
How could that happen?

207
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,940
I need to deal with something at the company today,

208
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,940
and you guys can go to the crew first.

209
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,220
I will be there later.

210
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,680
Your Highness,

211
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,170
I think

212
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,580
Xiao Zhao can misbehave sometimes,

213
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,320
but his personality is not bad.

214
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,920
He said Ming Qiao and he are sister and brother.

215
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,260
I think,

216
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,100
he knows the boundaries.

217
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,380
Let's eat first.

218
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:20,140
Your Highness,

219
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,140
let me help you with the lines.

220
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,900
Alright.

221
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:24,670
Your Highness and.....

222
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,020
My Lady,

223
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,130
Should we go back to where we came from or

224
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,530
should we change a route?

225
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:03,180
Come and check this out.

226
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,140
This is the crew.

227
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,510
Look, Tingzhou is right there.

228
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,260
Tingzhou,

229
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:19,720
I am here to see you.

230
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,380
I am Mu Yun,

231
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,820
not Mu Tingzhou.

232
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,620
It's alright,

233
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,180
I am back.

234
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,620
Everything will be alright.

235
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:01,410
Lin,

236
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,140
I have told you before.

237
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,040
Tingzhou is like this now.

238
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:08,440
He already forgot all the things that happened before.

239
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:09,980
Right,

240
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,140
let me introduce to you here.

241
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,070
This is Ming Wei.

242
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:13,550
Ming Wei,

243
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,740
this is my biological sister,

244
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,580
Xu Lin.

245
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,860
Xu Lin and Tingzhou grew up together,

246
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,580
so Tingzhou is very important

247
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,500
to her.

248
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,390
Hello, Ming Wei.

249
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,940
I am Xu Lin.

250
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,900
Alright.

251
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,820
Let me do the lipstick by myself.

252
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:08,660
Ming Wei.

253
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,920
How do you think of the eyebrow shape?

254
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:12,620
Ming Wei?

255
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:19,980
It's good. Thanks.

256
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,670
I will go and get the wig bag.

257
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,420
That woman,

258
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,740
what's her deal?

259
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,590
Let's talk about it!

260
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,380
It seems like there is something going on between her

261
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:44,310
and Mu Tingzhou.

262
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,990
Look at the way she is today.

263
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,270
That's the real girlfriend there!

264
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,130
Help me out here.

265
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,620
Aren't you easily cheated on?

266
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,940
Why would this kind of stuff always

267
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,180
happen to you?

268
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
I bet this time,

269
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,940
you would not leave easily

270
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,520
as you did to Cheng Yao.

271
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,100
It hurts, isn't it?

272
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,180
Not all people like the womanizers like

273
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,620
you do.

274
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,860
Action!

275
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,740
Thank you, My Lady.

276
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,900
Thanks for all the works, My Lady.

277
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,760
We are going back to the hometown.

278
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,140
Alright, cut.

279
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,100
This shot is OK.

280
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,870
Let's switch to another setup.

281
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:40,860
Thanks for all the works.

282
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,170
Thanks for all the works.

283
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,020
Goodbye.

284
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,680
Your Highness.

285
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,980
Your Highness, I swear.

286
00:23:57,780 --> 00:23:59,110
I don't know that woman.

287
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,420
I know.

288
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,900
Grand Tutor must not know the people

289
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,230
that Mu Tingzhou knows.

290
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,060
But,

291
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:11,020
it does not mean that there is no relationship between you.

292
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,350
But I really don't know.

293
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,930
It's not your fault.

294
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,300
It has nothing to do with you.

295
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,380
That's why I am sad the most.

296
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,590
It seems like I am cheated on

297
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,860
again.

298
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,220
But I cannot

299
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,260
blame anyone else.

300
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,590
I can only blame myself.

301
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,930
Ming Wei.

302
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,970
Am I interrupting here?

303
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,670
It's alright.

304
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,190
You guys can talk first.

305
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,260
Chen Zhang,

306
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,580
what is it?

307
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,790
I just want to rehearse the lines with you.

308
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,260
It's alright.

309
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,320
You can talk first.

310
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,180
OK, I will go rehearse with you.

311
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,020
Grand Tutor,

312
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,020
let's talk later.

313
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,260
OK.

314
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,300
Let's go.

315
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,180
Xiao Zhao,

316
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:53,660
is Xu Lin your biological sister?

317
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:57,400
How come you guys don't share the same last name?

318
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:01,620
My name is actually Xu Run.

319
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,960
Have you heard of the Xu Group.

320
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:07,460
The well-known Xu Group,

321
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,920
of course I have heard.

322
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,260
The president of Xu Group, Xu Xiu

323
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:13,820
is my father.

324
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,780
I should have listened to him and

325
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,100
taken over the family business.

326
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
But I like the entertainment business,

327
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,850
and I and Tingzhou grew up together.

328
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,420
So I have become his entertainment agent in the

329
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,540
name of Xiao Zhao.

330
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,060
It turns out

331
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,350
there are so many things that I don't know.

332
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:33,320
Maybe we should go have your favorite hotpot

333
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,860
first

334
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:38,340
and go watch a movie to relax?

335
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,380
Grand Tutor,

336
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,740
let's go back and talk.

337
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:49,940
Alright,

338
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,200
whatever you like.

339
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,020
All set.

340
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,860
Take it easy.

341
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,690
Tingzhou, you are back!

342
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,940
I have cooked the dishes with Auntie Zhao today.

343
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,860
Come and have a try to see

344
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:18,260
if I made any progress on my cooking skills.

345
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,310
You made so many dishes!

346
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,910
Brother,

347
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,740
you are piggybacking on Tingzhou today,

348
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,660
do you know that?

349
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,380
Is that so?

350
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:31,980
Madam Zhao,

351
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,500
why did you let some stranger in?

352
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:38,900
This...

353
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,660
This... She...

354
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,490
Tingzhou.

355
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,780
Don't blame Auntie Zhao.

356
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,980
I came here by myself.

357
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:44,700
I used to be

358
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,980
your stylist.

359
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:47,780
I was responsible for

360
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,550
the outfit of your attendance at the events.

361
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,310
You really can't remember?

362
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,460
I have made an appointment with the princess.

363
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,990
We are going to have hotpot.

364
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:58,020
Please leave now.

365
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,470
Grand Tutor.

366
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:00,940
She is my sister.

367
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:02,450
I have told you before.

368
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,260
I can leave.

369
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,460
But before I go,

370
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,040
I am wondering if Miss Ming

371
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,140
could give me ten minutes.

372
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,620
Let's have a talk.

373
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,640
Lin, what do you want to do?

374
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:21,780
Your Highness,

375
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,140
you don't have to talk to her.

376
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,740
Sure.

377
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,000
Here used to be Tingzhou's study.

378
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,650
We used to

379
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,230
talk about his style in this place.

380
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,520
I didn't expect

381
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,190
him to change this place into this.

382
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
To be exact,

383
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,740
it was changed by the Grand Tutor,

384
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,670
not Mu Tingzhou.

385
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,870
Apart from this one,

386
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,200
he also changed the bathroom and the cloakroom.

387
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,170
You may not know that

388
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:05,500
the Xu's family and the Mu's family are old friends.

389
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,300
I grew up with Tingzhou.

390
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,400
I have known Tingzhou for many years.

391
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,900
Apart from me,

392
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,960
there have been no close female friends around him.

393
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,180
Tingzhou

394
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,100
likes me a lot.

395
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,940
We had agreed to

396
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,570
travel around the world together

397
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,700
when I came back from studying abroad.

398
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,620
But now that I am back,

399
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:42,060
he has forgotten about all our agreements.

400
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,020
Miss Xu.

401
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,860
If it's like what you said,

402
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:55,710
there were agreements and promises between you two,

403
00:29:56,450 --> 00:29:57,580
after his accident,

404
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,370
where were you?

405
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,030
Why are you only showing up now?

406
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,780
Because my brother thought my appearance

407
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,240
would irritate Tingzhou.

408
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,890
So he asked me to hide for a while.

409
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,500
My brother has told me that

410
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:13,870
your company for Tingzhou

411
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,490
is only to treat his illness.

412
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,780
Miss Ming,

413
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,420
I am grateful

414
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,780
for your willingness to step forward at this time

415
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:21,940
to help us.

416
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,840
But, with all due respect,

417
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,420
this kind of treatment is very ridiculous.

418
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,820
For Tingzhou,

419
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,180
the most important thing now is to help him find his memory back.

420
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,540
Your role-play

421
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,460
will not only fail to wake him up,

422
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,260
but also make him drown deeper and deeper

423
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,660
into that virtual world.

424
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,790
The sweet moment you have with the Grand Tutor

425
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,740
is at the cost of Tingzhou's life.

426
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:49,860
Have you ever thought about Tingzhou?

427
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,590
What did you say to Ming Wei?

428
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,100
Nothing special.

429
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,140
You seem to be quite protective of Ming Wei.

430
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,740
No.

431
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,940
I just think that

432
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,460
there are many things that you can't force.

433
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,420
Tingzhou and Ming Wei are having a great time now,

434
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,300
why do you have to step in?

435
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,330
This is the business of us three.

436
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,740
I am not asking you to help me,

437
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,400
but please don't get in my way.

438
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,820
I just don't want you to get hurt.

439
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,300
Tingzhou is just having a memory loss.

440
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,500
Why do you think he will choose Ming Wei?

441
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,680
Your Highness.

442
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,410
Your Highness.

443
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,940
Is she gone?

444
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,060
Yes.

445
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,380
They called me in

446
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,650
to help Mr. Mu find his memory.

447
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:29,580
But,

448
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:32,780
now I can't help thinking

449
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,310
it will be nice if this life continues.

450
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:42,780
Am I being selfish?

451
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,040
Your Highness.

452
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,870
Don't think in this way.

453
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,100
Whether Mu Tingzhou will come back

454
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,240
is not to be dominated by

455
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,550
your idea, Your Highness.

456
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,780
We love each other.

457
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,100
There is nothing wrong

458
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,550
if we want to live forever like this.

459
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:29,380
But I only thought about my own feeling,

460
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,820
and ignored the existence of Mr. Mu.

461
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,300
All my decisions

462
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,580
may affect his life.

463
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,820
This is unfair on him.

[A Record of the Strange World]

465
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,270
[A Record of the Strange World]

466
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,370
[Xiao Zhao]

467
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,600
If you can't sleep,

468
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:02,220
how about coming downstairs for a chat?

469
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,200
Tingzhou accompanied Lin as she grew up.

470
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,820
He was cold to every woman,

471
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,300
except for Xu Lin.

472
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:20,980
But

473
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,740
I really have no idea

474
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,260
what's their relationship like in private.

475
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,460
But they are more like

476
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,830
brother-sister kind of friendship to me.

477
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:29,930
But I am sure that

478
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,140
when Tingzhou was acting in the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister,

479
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,200
his attitude to you

480
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:35,510
is more like a romantic relationship.

481
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:39,640
We can't presume Mr. Mu's idea by ourselves.

482
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,060
Xu Lin was right.

483
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,540
The sweet moment I have with the Grand Tutor

484
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,860
is at the cost of Tingzhou's life.

485
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,940
This is unfair on him.

486
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,180
Look at Tingzhou now.

487
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,900
We don't know if he will ever recover.

488
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,380
and when is that.

489
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,970
I blame myself for it.

490
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,430
And I'm very perplexed.

491
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,460
I know I should not get stuck in this relationship.

492
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,740
But it's hard for me to let it go.

493
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,460
Ming Wei.

494
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:20,130
I know this is hard for you to choose.

495
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,860
And almost all the pressure is on you.

496
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,300
Although Xu Lin is my sister,

497
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,110
I will not favor either of you.

498
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,940
I hope to see you happy too.

499
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,460
Tingzhou, Xu Lin

500
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,460
and you

501
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,970
are all very important

502
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,260
to me.

503
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,580
Thank you, Xiao Zhao.

504
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:43,940
I will think about this carefully.

505
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,620
Lin's idea is great.

506
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,260
Let's do this in her way.

507
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,940
Lin.

508
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,810
You are willing to come back and help Tingzhou.

509
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,060
You don't know how grateful

510
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,500
I and your aunt feel.

511
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,940
You are welcome.

512
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,170
You two

513
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,580
have watched me grow up.

514
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,540
Tingzhou's business

515
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,670
is also my business.

516
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,500
Ming Wei.

517
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,500
Here.

518
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,440
Take a seat.

519
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,300
We have finally come up with

520
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,260
a way to help Tingzhou find his memory back.

521
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:25,920
Take a seat.

522
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,140
Sit here.

523
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,930
Come, have a seat.

524
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,140
Go ahead, please.

525
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,920
It's like this.

526
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,940
Xu Lin grew up with Tingzhou.

527
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,710
They have experienced a lot together.

528
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,900
So we think

529
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,940
Lin can take Tingzhou

530
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:48,800
to hang around the places they have been before.

531
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,930
Probably this will trigger

532
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,250
Tingzhou's memory, right?

533
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:58,420
Yes.

534
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,380
Lin.

535
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,700
It's so nice to have you back.

536
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,740
Now Tingzhou is like this.

537
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,210
I don't know what to do.

538
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,580
Everything will be alright, aunt.

539
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,060
Tingzhou will recover.

540
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,350
You two have been together since you were little.

541
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,860
I have to count on you now.

542
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,020
Don't worry, aunt and uncle.

543
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,260
You have got me.

544
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,220
This idea

545
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,020
is indeed quite good.

546
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,370
I won't go.

547
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:47,700
Tingzhou.

548
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,130
Why don't you go?

549
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,140
Just go get some fresh air.

550
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,140
By the way,

551
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,860
Lin comes back from so far away.

552
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:55,990
It will be nice of you

553
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,930
to accompany her

554
00:38:56,930 --> 00:38:57,820
just to relax.

555
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,980
Sorry.

556
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,740
I don't know you

557
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,620
and I have never met

558
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,380
this Miss Xu.

559
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,470
I have no reason to go on a memory-recover trip

560
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:17,860
with a stranger.

561
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,700
The only mission for me here is

562
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,400
to accompany and protect the princess.

563
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:24,900
Other things

564
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,840
have nothing to do with me.

565
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,700
Tingzhou,

566
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,350
whether you admit it or not,

567
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,980
you are our child.

568
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:34,900
We are begging you

569
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,180
to go.

570
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,300
I am sorry, but I won't go.

571
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,700
Tingzhou.

572
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:51,300
I think

573
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,070
the Grand Tutor will only listen to

574
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,300
Ming Wei's words.

575
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,170
Ming Wei,

576
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:06,980
would you please help Tingzhou?

577
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:09,550
Ming Wei,

578
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,350
we have been bothering you for a long time.

579
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,670
But we still hope you can persuade Tingzhou.

580
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,020
I am begging you.

581
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,820
Okay.

582
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,300
I will try.

583
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,330
Your Highness, are you here to persuade me too?

584
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,260
Yes.

585
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:06,420
Go ahead, Your Highness.

586
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,180
Although they are not your parents,

587
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,220
after seeing them so desperately

588
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,700
miss their child,

589
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,660
I can't

590
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,940
say no to them.

591
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,380
I believe

592
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,010
you can't bear to

593
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,140
let them down, either.

594
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,960
Your Highness, do you really want me to turn back to Mu Tingzhou,

595
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:37,980
and thereafter

596
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,710
forget everything between us,

597
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,820
and become strangers to each other?
