there is a place for me in your heart.

Is this a dream

or reality?

If it's a dream,

I shouldn't be this shy.

Am I being too ugly?

22
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,940
I should be more initiative

23
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,060
and aggressive.

24
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,830

The Ministry of Revenue has drafted the Land Measuring Regulations.

Local governments have to measure the land

you should be more careful in choosing a wife.

it is easy for me to train you.

00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,410
But this happens too fast.

176
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:47,060
Could you give me some time and

177
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,390
let me think it through?

178
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,180
Of course.

179
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,900
I have brought a brokerage contract

180
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,140
of Dongying Group and

181
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,820
a future plan of yours.

182
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,200
Please take a look when you have time.

183
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,920
Alright, Ms. Shen.

184
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,340
Work hard,

185
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:04,370
but you should settle your contract as early as possible.

186
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:05,560
It could provide you a big help

187
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:07,020
in this industry.

188
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,030
Alright.

189
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,620
I will get back to you as soon as I am done with thinking.

190
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,300
You should be exhausted after one day of shooting.

191
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,210
Have an early rest.

192
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:13,820
Alright.

193
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:15,680
Good Night.

194
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,100
Good Night.

195
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,950
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

196
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:30,700
Thank you!

197
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,620
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

198
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,550
Thank all of you!

199
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,900
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

200
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,500
Thank you!

201
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,030
Mr. Mu, Happy Birthday!

202
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,170
Thanks.

203
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,840
It's Mr. Mu's birthday today?

204
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,810
His fans are pulling a banner outside.

205
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,740
You don't see it?

206
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,240
I did not notice it.

207
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,340
There is a birthday event after shooting tonight.

208
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,400
Do you want to join?

209
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,970
I did not prepare any birthday present for him.

210
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:54,940
How can I go?

211
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,140
It is not late to prepare now.

212
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:09,580
Mr. Mu,

213
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,900
Happy Birthday!

214
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,400
Mr. Mu, please change the clothes first.

215
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,260
Get ready.

216
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,630
Can you give me a direction?

217
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,030
It is a closed-book exam, don't ask me.

218
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:35,110
I will be waiting for your surprises.

219
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,780
Surprise!

220
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,620
Surprise!

221
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,740
Mr. Mu.

222
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:02,180
I... I just want to make a good meal

223
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:04,500
to thank you for taking care of me.

224
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,960
I didn't expect I would mess it up.

225
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,460
So I felt ashamed and

226
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,020
hid there.

227
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,500
Mr. Mu, I didn't mean that to happen.

228
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:15,980
Mr. Mu,

229
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,590
I have cleaned it up for you.

230
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,140
I am going to leave first.

231
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,660
Wait!

232
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,200
You have messed the dinner up.

233
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
What would you give him for present?

234
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,820
Mr. Mu,

235
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,540
what do you want for present?

236
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,020
Cut, cut, cut.

237
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,350
Ming Wei, what are you giggling about?

238
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,540
Princess Ming Hua and the Grand Tutor

239
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,930
are in separation between life and death.

240
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:55,190
Where is your sadness?

241
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,380
Director, sorry.

242
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,440
Let me work on my emotions.

243
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,340
Damn, I had too much fun yesterday.

244
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,980
I cannot concentrate now.

245
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:09,980
Ming Wei,

246
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,200
after shooting these scenes,

247
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:22,120
the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister is scheduled to wrap.

248
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,450
Do you know what this means?

249
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,980
Some actors would only work together

250
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,310
for once in their lives.

251
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,140
In other words,

252
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,100
after the wrap,

253
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,210
we might not see each other again.

254
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,540
Director,

255
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,160
can we shoot one more time?

256
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,620
OK.

257
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,580
I didn't know you were here, Your Highness.

258
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,660
Forgive me.

259
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,040
Your Highness.

260
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,830
I can't afford this.

261
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,400
Your Highness, please get up.

262
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,580
The consort was accused of conspiracy.

263
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,500
I am not asking for forgiveness.

264
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,780
But please save my two children.

265
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,900
They are innocent.

266
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,660
Now His Majesty only listens to you.

267
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,300
I have already decided to see His Majesty before going to court tomorrow,

268
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,380
and ask for forgiveness for two lords.

269
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,980
Your Highness, don't worry.

270
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,500
Even if I have to die,

271
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:07,100
I will protect them.

272
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,980
All that I pursue in life

273
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:25,020
is to make sure Your Highness

274
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,570
can always be superior,

275
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,410
and never have to bow down to others.

276
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,700
Your Highness, when you knelt down,

277
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,180
you also denied my life-long pursuit.

278
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,710
I failed the late Emperor's trust.

279
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,420
I...

280
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,940
Even death cannot atone for my offense.

281
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,880
Your Highness, please get up.

282
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:05,610
I will.

283
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,510
Get up too, Grand Tutor.

284
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,480
Thank you, Your Highness.

285
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,780
You have done nothing wrong.

286
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,500
In this world,

287
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,700
no one else can be like you.

288
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,140
You have considered everything for me.

289
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,250
But I

290
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,380
haven't done anything for you,

291
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,220
and even put you in such a situation.

292
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,300
I have no regret

293
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,020
in my life

294
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,140
since I have met you.

295
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,780
If there's an afterlife,

296
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,000
I wish we won't do each other wrong again,

297
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,210
and stay together.

298
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,660
If there's an afterlife,

299
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,820
I, Mu Yun, will definitely put everything behind,

300
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,660
only to stay with you

301
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:41,580
for a lifetime.

302
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,520
Your Highness.

303
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,180
Your Highness, big trouble.

304
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,460
Your Highness, big trouble.

305
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,760
What happened?

306
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:24,870
News just came from the Imperial Palace.

307
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,940
His Majesty wouldn't withdraw the edict.

308
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,400
Two lords were already sent to the dead cell.

309
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,180
Tomorrow, between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., they will be...

310
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,260
They will be...

311
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
If he can't persuade His Majesty...

312
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,700
Prepare zheng

313
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,540
and wine for me.

314
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,620
Your Highness.

315
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,470
Grand Tutor.

316
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,020
Grand Tutor, without His Majesty's order,

317
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,500
you can't break into the palace.

318
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,700
I have to see His Majesty today.

319
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,340
If I let you in, I will die.

320
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,060
Move.

321
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,900
Grand Tutor,

322
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:03,790
[Hanyuan Palace]

323
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,620
Grand Tutor,

324
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:51,050
[Virtue can give off real fragrance.]

325
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:37,340
[Virtue can give off real fragrance.]

326
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,940
Cut.

327
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,420
Wrap.

328
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,870
-Great! -It's wrapped! It's wrapped!

329
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,380
Let's take some rest.

330
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,170
Goodbye, Your Highness.
