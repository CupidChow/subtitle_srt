2
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:21,340
Your Highness, you need to remember this.

3
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,060
No problem.

4
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,060
Your Highness,

5
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,240
here you go.

6
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:03,740
Here.

7
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,100
Your Highness, please.

8
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,579
Your Highness, remember

9
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,890
when you drink with others,

10
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,700
raising a toast from afar is sufficient.

11
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,300
Do not clink glasses with others.

12
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,930
Why?

13
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,460
For us,

14
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,740
only spouses

15
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,579
can perform such a ritual.

16
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,660
What's wrong?

17
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,740
Did I do it wrong?

18
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,020
It's alright.

19
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,460
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

20
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,530
You don't have to follow my customs for every little thing.

[Episode 12]

23
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:51,820
Grand Tutor.

24
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,980
I find you're increasingly willful.

25
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,940
It's been a long time

26
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,100
for you to come from the Ning dynasty to modern society.

27
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,980
You've seen many films and dramas,

28
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,460
why can't you accept an actor

29
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,460
doing kissing scenes?

30
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,220
It's alright for other actors, but not for Your Highness.

31
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:06,700
Your Highness is precious,

32
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,860
you cannot be tainted by others.

33
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,250
Grand Tutor, you're exaggerating.

34
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,330
Tainted? That's too much.

35
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,460
Grand Tutor,

36
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,460
I am commanding you to eat

37
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,420
as the Princess.

38
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,500
If you don't, that's insubordination.

39
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,580
Your food is at the door.

40
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,620
I have to work,

41
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
you can decide if you want to eat.

42
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,220
Whether you were Mu Tingzhou or the Grand Tutor,

43
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,420
I've never seen you eat

44
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,540
so sloppily.

45
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:39,820
Besides,

46
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:42,250
you've gone a little too far now.

47
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,340
Is it that good?

48
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,090
Let me tell you,

49
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,930
I have my boundaries.

50
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,420
If I don't resolve it this time,

51
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,140
the Princess may still

52
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,340
be cheated or tempted by Chen Zhang in the future.

53
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:06,700
Honestly, Grand Tutor,

54
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,930
neither you nor the Princess can return to the Ning dynasty.

55
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,660
Since you can't go back,

56
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,290
why adhere to ancient etiquette?

57
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,500
Even if,

58
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,220
you can say you're just protecting the Princess.

59
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,300
But she has to get married sooner or later.

60
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,380
You can stop her now.

61
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:21,900
Stop her from filming kissing scenes.

62
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:23,700
But

63
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,970
you can't prevent her from marrying someone else.

64
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,780
What right do you have to do that?

65
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,700
Why would I stop her from meeting someone suitable?

66
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,060
Chen Zhang is very suitable.

67
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,100
He was her consort in the show.

68
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,860
They played husband and wife.

69
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,620
In reality,

70
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,180
Chen Zhang is also rich and famous.

71
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,290
More importantly,

72
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,740
he's also caring and takes care of the Princess.

73
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,060
I know you dislike Chen Zhang, Grand Tutor.

74
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,820
You also think Grand Chief Cabinet Minister is a false tale.

75
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,980
But I think

76
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,420
the Princess likes Chen Zhang.

77
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,500
Grand Tutor, don't interfere in the Princess's freedom to marry

78
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,690
in the name of discipline.

79
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,020
Since you're so optimistic

80
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,500
about the marriage between Princess and Chen Zhang.

81
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,380
Then why did you tell me

82
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,340
about their kissing scene?

83
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,220
I just wanted to

84
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,860
see your reaction.

85
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,020
Tell me honestly,

86
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,540
when you saw Chen Zhang kiss the Princess,

87
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:17,860
besides rage,

88
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,900
did you feel anything else?

89
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,340
Such as

90
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,100
jealousy, or did you want to replace him?

91
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:27,660
Nonsense.

92
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:34,539
Grand Tutor.

93
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,820
Do you really have no feelings

94
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,820
for the Princess?

95
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,500
Grand Tutor.

96
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,620
Why are you standing here?

97
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,460
Have you eaten?

98
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,140
Your Highness, you've worked the whole day.

99
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,260
Go and rest.

100
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,660
I've boiled some ginseng chicken soup,

101
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:35,940
it will be ready soon.

102
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:38,420
Alright.

103
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,740
Grand Tutor,

104
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,820
you keep staring at me.

105
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,500
Is anything wrong?

106
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,500
Just tell me.

107
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,260
I'm feeling oddly nervous

108
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,450
with you staring at me like that.

109
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:14,660
Your Highness, do you

110
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,100
like Chen Zhang?

111
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,130
No, I don't.

112
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,620
When actors are filming,

113
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,740
they cannot consider their personal emotions.

114
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,650
You once told me,

115
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,480
only when actors immerse themselves in a role,

116
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,060
would audiences lose themselves in the show.

117
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,610
It's just like Wang Yingying and I.

118
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,590
She's my stepmother in the show.

119
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,530
Although we are almost at the same age,

120
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,820
in the show, I have to see her as my stepmother.

121
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,420
Outside of the show, I can see her as a peer.

122
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,340
Since Your Highness doesn't like him,

123
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,980
how can you tolerate

124
00:10:56,330 --> 00:10:57,980
skin-to-skin contact with him?

125
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,420
Why are you so concerned about skin-to-skin contact?

126
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,100
In the minds of some ancient men,

127
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:14,500
women are men's possessions.

128
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,620
Her body belongs to the man,

129
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,580
and can only be touched by her husband.

130
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,420
If she is touched by other men,

131
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,020
the woman is unclean.

132
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:26,050
Grand Tutor, you strongly oppose filming kissing scenes.

133
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,760
Is it because you believe

134
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,050
that if I filmed such scenes,

135
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,620
I would be unclean?

136
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,900
I wouldn't be as precious as before?

137
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,620
Your Highness, you are royalty.

138
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,980
I won't allow anyone

139
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,420
to take advantage of you.

140
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,130
Chen Zhang

141
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,700
is also a handsome man with tens of millions of fans.

142
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,580
Grand Tutor, you think he is taking advantage of me.

143
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,020
His fans think

144
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,740
that I am taking advantage of him.

145
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,450
Nonsense.

146
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,530
There are billions of people in this country.

147
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,380
Besides my parents,

148
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,660
only you think I'm a princess.

149
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,580
Actually, in the eyes of others,

150
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,500
including Xiao Zhao,

151
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,900
I'm just a newbie in the entertainment industry.

152
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,380
Your Highness, don't worry.

153
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,860
Your acting is great.

154
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,820
Over time,

155
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,740
people will love you.

156
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,760
If I'm not even daring enough to film a kissing scene,

157
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,180
how can my acting be great?

158
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,300
Grand Tutor,

159
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,100
I really enjoy acting.

160
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,340
In shows,

161
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,420
I can act as different roles,

162
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,100
and experience different lives.

163
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,940
That's a really valuable experience.

164
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,770
I really hope to improve my skills

165
00:12:45,210 --> 00:12:46,500
and become a good actor.

166
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,340
In order to become one,

167
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,260
I cannot change the script

168
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,660
according to my personal preferences.

169
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,420
That is a disrespect for the art.

170
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:13,370
If Your Highness is so insistent,

171
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,820
I will not stop you.

172
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,180
Grand Tutor.

173
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,140
You agreed!

174
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,340
That's great, Grand Tutor.

175
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,340
Grand Tutor,

176
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,530
why are you

177
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,570
so tense?

178
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,490
Like Xiao Zhao,

179
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:10,940
my body is getting stiff.

180
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,140
My body

181
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,210
has been ruined by Mu Tingzhou.

182
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,140
I have checked his resume.

183
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,860
Over ten years of his acting career

184
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,980
he has been injured many times.

185
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,740
If not for his disregard for his health,

186
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,500
I would not have strained my waist when I fell.

187
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,420
Mr. Mu does his best when he is acting.

188
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,780
He deserves the title

189
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,860
of Best Actor.

190
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,900
Although I don't know Mu Tingzhou,

191
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,660
judging from his experiences and achievements,

192
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,620
he is someone respectable.

193
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,220
Your Highness, would you stand up first please.

194
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,980
Although I haven't tried

195
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:54,250
modern massage techniques.

196
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,980
After your massage

197
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,380
I feel quite relaxed.

198
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,100
My waist doesn't hurt any more.

199
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,140
Your Highness，

200
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,810
how did you learn such skills?

201
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,330
This is nothing special.

203

All of these

205
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,930
are my mistakes.

206
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,780
Grand Tutor, this...

207
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,180
this has nothing to do with you.

208
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,780
If I woke up

209
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,330
and reunited with Your Highness earlier,

210
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,980
Your Highness wouldn't have to depend on others for a living

211
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,130
and suffer so much.

212
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,940
Grand Tutor, that's not true.

213

Ming Qiao is my family.

214

We grew up with our parents' care.

How is this depending on others for a living?

216

the cake you made is so delicious!

All of these were made by Mr. Mu.

235

He got up at four to make them.

237

make so many delicious dishes?

238
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,140
He learned it from me.

239

he will learn all my skills

so he can make them for Your Highness at any time.

she doesn't do so intensely.

Tell me about it.

325

But actually, this kind of character

328

is out of date.

Nowadays, the audience likes women

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,860
I think you should stop before it is too late.

349
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:19,540
What are you talking about?

350
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,380
I don't understand.

351
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,540
It doesn't matter if you understand it or not.

352
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,460
If you try to obstruct Ming Wei again

353
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,380
don't blame me for doing that back to you

354
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,700
the next time we act together.

355
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,620
What spell has Ming Wei cast on you?

356
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,010
You guys

357
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,660
keep treating her like a princess.

358
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,050
But I think you should

359
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,020
give up while you can.

360
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,140
Just compare the status of Mu Tingzhou

361
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,620
with yours.

362
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,380
How can you compete with him?

363
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,170
You don't need to worry about this.

364
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,210
[Title The South City Director Gao Yong Cameraman Noah]

365
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:58,940
All right, here, be prepared.

366
00:23:59,340 --> 00:23:59,980
Clap the board.

367
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,660
Action.

368
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,380
The business of Yu family has been set up.

369
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,780
It fell in a second.

370
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,930
Your father vomited blood and died.

371
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,540
I can't afford to raise you.

372
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,340
Let's seek ways to survive on our own.

373
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,780
Do not regard yourself as the princess of the Yu family anymore.

374
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,180
Follow the procuress from Xi Hong Building.

375
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,300
It's for your own good.

376
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:32,900
Good.

377
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,530
Pass!

378
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:00,500
Here.

379
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,700
This way.

380
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,580
Here, get in.

381
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,780
Here.

382
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,140
I'll pack Ming Wei's things.

383
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,330
Your Highness.

384
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
This is brown sugar water.

385
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,300
I know you have a stomachache, so

386
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,420
I asked Xiao Zhao to prepare this in advance.

387
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:09,530
Your Highness.

388
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,770
Your Highness, have more of this.

389
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:31,980
Your Highness.

390
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,380
Do you feel warmer now?

391
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:06,660
When Mr. Mu

392
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,020
came in with Miss Ming in his arms,

393
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,620
he didn't even change his wet clothes

394
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,740
but got busy helping with her.

395
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,260
They would be a good couple

396
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,780
from what I see.

397
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,420
If Mu Tingzhou is into this,

398
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,420
I'm not quite sure about it.

399
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,540
He just has no sense of romance.

400
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,740
But he is the Grand Tutor.

401
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:33,500
Grand Tutor is more active than Mu Tingzhou.

402
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,620
I think they could be together, too.

403
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,620
No matter he is Mr. Mu or Grand Tutor,

404
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,860
is there any difference

405
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,010
between their characters?

406
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,380
No.

407
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:44,820
In my opinion,

408
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:47,020
they have always been the same person.

409
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,260
Mr. Mu fell in love with Miss Ming

410
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,090
when he was in the act of shooting.

411
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,220
After he lost his memory,

412
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,620
he could not forget Miss Ming in his mind.

413
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,140
So he thought he was the Grand Tutor,

414
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,820
who needed to guard the princess all the time.

415
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,610
They are

416
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,500
meant to be together.

417
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,500
Cupid

418
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,290
connected them

419
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,500
long time ago.

420
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,660
That makes sense.

421
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,700
I've been through that.

422
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,780
What can't I understand?

423
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:21,980
We will

424
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:24,890
just wait for their wedding.

425
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,700
What's wrong?

426
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,220
Madam Zhao,

427
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:41,340
hurry up and make some nutritious warm soup.

428
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,530
Her Highness needs to have some.

429
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,420
OK.

430
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,300
I will take it to her after it's ready.

431
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,100
Thank you.

432
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,780
Did Mr. Mu hear what we said?

433
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:14,540
I think

434
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,620
the Grand Tutor

435
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,500
would definitely try to explain

436
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,340
if he really heard anything.

437
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,690
He never

438
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,420
says uncle.

439
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,460
Unless, it is the truth.

440
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,100
So, there is no need to explain it.

441
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,220
Your Highness, please go to bed quickly.

442
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,260
Be careful not to get cold.

443
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,060
Your Highness,

444
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,100
please have the soup first.

445
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,220
Thank you, Grand Tutor.

446
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,380
Grand Tutor,

447
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,780
you should dry your hair

448
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,780
and change your clothes.

449
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,820
I'm fine.

450
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,020
Be careful, Your Highness.

451
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,860
It can be hot.

452
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:37,580
Your Highness,

453
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,170
after you finish the soup,

454
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:41,180
I will dry your hair for you.

455
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,700
I will help you...

456
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,860
Do you need me to ask for a leave to the crew

457
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,090
so that you can have a rest tomorrow, Your Highness?

458
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:09,870
Grand Tutor,

459
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:12,780
I'm much better now.

460
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,300
I know myself.

461
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:15,850
Relax.

462
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:17,750
OK.

463
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,530
-Your Highness. -You.

464
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,420
Why do you kneel down again?

465
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,500
I would like to

466
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:04,940
propose to you, Your Highness.

467
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,700
I'm 15 years older than you.

468
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,420
According to the rules of the Ning Dynasty,

469
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,900
I should pick

470
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,540
a bridegroom

471
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,620
with matched age and talent for you,

472
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,260
and dare not ask you to marry me.

473
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:24,170
However, you and I are trapped here.

474
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,850
I don't know when we can be back.

475
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,700
I cannot trust the others.

476
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,340
Therefore, I would like to ask Your Highness to marry me,

477
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,420
so that I can take care of you easily.

478
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:34,940
So,

479
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:37,410
you ask me to marry you

480
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,260
so you can take care of me?

481
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,300
After you and I are married,

482
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,260
the others will not judge us

483
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,770
in the situation

484
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,620
like today.

485
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,140
You worry too much, Grand Tutor.

486
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,460
I will call Ms. Shen tomorrow morning

487
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,660
and ask her to find a reliable female assistant for me.

488
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,540
And the assistant can help

489
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,170
me do the things you are not convenient to.

490
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:13,060
Sorry I just offended you, Your Highness.

491
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,060
I was disrespectful to you.

492
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,660
I would like to be punished.

493
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,340
You mean hugging me

494
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,260
and drying my feet for me?

495
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:27,660
It's no big deal.

496
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,020
In the upcoming scenes,

497
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,020
Chen Zhang will hug me,

498
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,580
kiss me,

499
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,100
marry me,

500
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,100
and even sleep with me in a scene.

501
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,780
Do I

502
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,900
need to marry him

503
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,700
due to the traditional rules?

504
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:54,330
I will not marry anyone for rules.

505
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,900
I must marry someone

506
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,980
who loves me from his heart.

507
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,620
If I get wet in the rain,

508
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,340
he would warm me up

509
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:04,980
and dry my feet.

510
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,220
He doesn't care about

511
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,650
the relationship between an official and the princess.

512
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,300
He just cares about me

513
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,340
and wants me to be comfortable.

514
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:23,100
I would like to sleep. Please leave.

515
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:33,900
Have a good rest, Your Highness.

516
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,700
I will leave you be.

517
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,420
Does he like you or not?

518
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,250
It seems yes.

519
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,340
But it also seems

520
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,820
it's all because of responsibility, too.

521
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,300
Ming Wei,

522
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,060
you are so stupid

523
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,490
to fall in love with

524
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,820
a patient with wrong memories.

525
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,380
He will be well

526
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,860
sooner or later.

527
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,730
Then he will

528
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,860
become that arrogant Best Actor again.

529
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,780
You

530
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,290
will only look at him silently at the corner.

531
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,490
Everything will

532
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,100
be like a dream.

533
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:06,210
You

534
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:09,180
will be nobody's princess.

535
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,900
He will be nobody's Grand Tutor.

536
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,020
It seemed like

537
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,940
she didn't even want to look at me.

538
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,010
Maybe she doesn't like me at all.

539
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,380
Right.

540
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,140
Her Highness is so beautiful

541
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,740
and young.

542
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,700
In modern words,

543
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,580
I'm just a bad old man

544
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,060
to her.

545
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,060
I can never match her

546
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,380
in background, status or age.

547
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,220
I'm just not a good match.

548
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,650
I smelt the good when I entered.

549
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,500
Why don't you speak?

550
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,020
Did you have a fight?

551
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,300
No words when eating.

552
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,120
Your Highness, we should go now.

553
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,530
Go?

554
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,900
Where is Xiao Zhao?

555
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,140
Starting from today,

556
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,940
I will be

557
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:31,420
your driver.

558
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,500
Mu Tingzhou does have a driving license.

559
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,820
And I have practiced for a while.

560
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,740
There is no problem.

561
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,660
Please don't worry, Your Highness.
