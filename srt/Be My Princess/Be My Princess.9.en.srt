00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,010
Place your ankle onto the hammock,

176
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,260
to align with the vertical line.

177
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,900
The feet on the floor should point to the mirror.

178
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,680
And then flex your feet back.

179
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,180
Put both hands on your hip,

180
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,460
start to bend down from the lower back area.

181
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:58,420
But I can't bend down here.

182
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,580
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

183
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,620
Come in, please.

184
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,060
Your Highness.

185
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,620
This is for you.

186
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,540
Thank you, Grand Tutor.

187
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,340
Your Highness,

188
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,860
are you still thinking about what happened earlier?

189
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,460
It's all my fault.

190
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,140
It has nothing to do with you, Grand Tutor.

191
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,420
It's not your fault.

192
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,410
This is the consequence

193
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,180
that I should have thought of a long time ago.

194
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,540
I didn't do a good job protecting Your Highness,

195
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,930
which makes you worry more.

196
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,140
But I ask Your Highness to give me

197
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,570
a chance to make amends for my mistake.

198
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,540
Your Highness, please move into

199
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:24,780
my humble home,

200
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,160
so I can be at your service, every day and night.

201
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,220
That's not necessary, Grand Tutor.

202
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,260
It is all right.

203
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,380
We will discuss this later.

204
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:38,860
Your Highness,

205
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,050
you were disturbed today.

206
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,140
Please have a good rest.

207
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,340
If you need anything,

208
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,660
I will be at your service any time.

209
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,900
Thanks, Grand Tutor.

210
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:49,090
I will leave you be.

211
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,180
I will file a complaint.

212
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:11,940
I have to complain about you.

213
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,380
Sorry.

214
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,730
This must be a misunderstanding.

215
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,260
Ming Qiao, apologize to him.

216
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,330
Why should I apologize?

217
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:19,770
He harassed me in the first place.

218
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,700
It was self-defense.

219
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,510
Why should I apologize?

220
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,960
Don't sling mud at me.

221
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,370
I didn't touch you at all.

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,610
You can get the surveillance video out and check.

223
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,570
You broke my hand out of no reason.

224
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:29,780
You have to apologize to me.

225
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,100
I won't.

226
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,420
Dismiss her.

227
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,740
What do you keep this kind of personal coaches for?

228
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,620
I'm telling you,

229
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,000
if you don't dismiss her,

230
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,280
I will file a complaint.

231
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,060
No.

232
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,650
I will sue you.

233
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
I am contacting my lawyer now.

234
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,540
Then do it.

235
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,610
Let's both contact our lawyers.

236
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,980
And bring the video of your attempted harassment

237
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:52,660
to the court.

238
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,980
Let's both do our thing,

239
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,300
and see what the judge will say.

240
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,500
Who are you?

241
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,700
What does this have to do with you?

242
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,860
I don't owe you an explanation.

243
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,340
But you need to be clear that

244
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,820
I will have my hand in everything about her.

245
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,180
How is it?

246
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,260
Have you thought it through?

247
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
Will you sue me,

248
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,060
or shall I send you the lawyer's letter?

249
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,100
By the way,

250

[Shanghai Jiading Law Firm Lawyer Du Jianqi]

256
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,820
I am only worried that after the press conference,

257
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,980
my sister would be influenced.

258
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,460
How is she now?

259
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,140
Don't worry, she's fine.

260

She is living with Tingzhou now.

261
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,570
She is just concerned about you living alone.

262
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,780
How about

263
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,420
I book a room in the hotel

264
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,170
and you can live there for a while?

265
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,380
No need.

266
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,180
I can protect myself well.

267
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,620
What happened just now is...

268
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,860
Anyway, I have promised your sister

269
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,980
that I will take good care of you.

In your work,

do you deal with this kind of incidents often?

276
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,050
Usually it's about female trainees.

277
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,300
This is also the first time for us.

278
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,340

Trust me in dealing with these things.

What other orders do you have for me?

289
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,980
I have had a really long day.

290
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,060
Do I

291
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,980
have other real estate?

You

293
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,570
don't.

294
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,220
Does Mu Tingzhou

295
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,260
have other real estate?

296
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,380
What do you want?

297
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,980
I want to build a palace for Her Highness.

298
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,570
Somewhere she can stay

299
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,900
no matter what happens.

300
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:41,220
For the time being,

301
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,620
we can only let Her Highness

302
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:45,890
put up with the villa.

303
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,660
For the rest,

304
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,020
we will give further thoughts to it.

305
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,660
What do you want to do?

306
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:16,980
What are you doing?

307
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,300
You are a consort kin,

308
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,980
so you can't live with Her Highness.

309
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,650
So please,

310
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,020
move out.

311
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,100
What consort kin?

312
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,840
I have done my research.

313
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,020
You have earned a lot as a topnotch entertainment agent.

314
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,780
You won't have nowhere to go.

315
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,110
Madam Zhao has packed

316
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,260
your baggage for you.

317
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,470
Why?

318
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,880
You are also a consort kin, aren't you?

319
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,280
Given the current situation,

320
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,970
I have to stay and protect Her Highness.

321
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,780
Also, I'm very strict with myself.

322
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,540
I won't have inordinate thoughts about Her Highness.

323
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,740
So you mean that

324
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,260
I will have inordinate thoughts about her?

325
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,060
Since I moved here,

326
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,340
I have overheard you talk on the phone with many different women,

327
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,380
in an intimate way.

328
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,020
It is obvious that you are playing the field.

329
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,780
But considering that you are quite diligent in what you do,

330
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,740
I tolerated that.

331
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,010
But Her Highness

332
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,380
is not someone you can treat with levity.

333
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,900
You are not the only one who owns a villa.

334
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,380
Who wants to live in your shabby room?

335
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,740
I would have moved out long ago

336
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,580
if not for taking care of you.

337
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:16,690
Steward Xiao,

338
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,980
if you really want to stay,

339
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:19,980
there is only one way.

340
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,690
Moving in after castration.

341
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,500
Excuse me.

342
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,090
Don't forget to come to work on time.

343
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:41,890
Ruthless.

344
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,060
One day you will beg me to come back.

345
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:08,740
So tidy.

346
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,500
Who cleaned it?

347
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,420
Good morning.

348
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,420
Good morning.

349
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,020
After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon is still bright

350
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,010
in spite of the wane.

351
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,930
Gao Changsheng slowed down

352
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,690
and walked shoulder-by-shoulder with Wanyin.

353
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,180
Every several meters along the road,

354
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,210
there is a classical-style lamp.

355
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,280
Under the lamp,

356
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,200
Gao Changsheng glanced aside at Wanyin.

357
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,690
The soft light shined upon her delicate face,

358
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:18,230
like applying a thin layer of blusher to it.

359
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,660
It added some subtle teasing charm

360
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,510
into the pure and naive youth beauty.

361
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,920
OK, please sit down.

362
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,460
This paragraph

363
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,820
describes the environment and figures.

364
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,460
But what we read out just now

365
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,900
lacked some sentiments.

366
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,740
Not hearty enough.

367
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,210
We can slow it down a little,

368
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,940
so that we can foil the atmosphere

369
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,300
in a slow manner.

370
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,860
Now let's take a ten-minute break,

371
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,140
and carry on later.

372
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:44,740
Thank you.

373
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:51,450
[Grand Tutor]

374
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,860
Grand Tutor hasn't contacted me all day.

375
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,300
It is not like him.

376
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,540
Ming Wei.

377
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,860
Your lipstick color is so beautiful, Ming Wei.

378
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,140
Where did you buy it?

379
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,980
If you like it,

380
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,610
I will send you the link.

381
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,500
Great, love you.

382
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,980
Wei, how about taking a photo with me?

383
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,280
OK.

384
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,420
Done. Wei.

385
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,380
I will leave you be.

386
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,740
Being on trending topics every day,

387
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:47,940
how do you feel?

388
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,220
Not good,

389
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,940
always restless.

390
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,180
It is like living under a magnifying lens.

391
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,420
No space of my own at all.

392
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,410
This is the price you have to pay

393
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,020
when you enjoy

394
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,260
the interest of your fame

395
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,700
as a public figure.

396
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:09,780
If you are not prepared for that,

397
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,340
why would you be an actress?

398
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,460
I'm not so prepared as you.

399
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,180
But I act

400
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,860
not for fame or interest,

401
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,900
so there's no need for me to pretend.

402
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,540
Especially,

403
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,100
in front of you.

404
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,380
You don't need to goad me with this.

405
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,530
I have seen

406
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,620
a lot of people like you.

407
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,100
My advice for you is that

408
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:35,420
being in this industry

409
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,180
is to deal with fame and interest.

410
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,620
Interest comes with fame.

411
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:41,060
No matter what you become famous for,

412
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,780
it brings huge interest.

413
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,540
If you have to say that you don't want anything,

414
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,860
then it is a waste of resources.

415
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,260
You had better make full use of your resources.

416
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,620
My words may sound unpleasant,

417
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,820
but you are just too immature.

418
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,620
So easy to be taken advantage of.

419
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:02,980
What do you mean?

420
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:04,820
Fool.

421
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,180
Refresh your Weibo thread.

422
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,310
[@Mu Tingzhou@Ming Wei1018 Photo with the Princess #Be My Princess#]

423
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:21,660
So clout-chasing.

424
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,900
Grand Tutor.

425
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,810
Your Highness, I came to take you home.

426
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,900
Home?

427
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,660
Please.

428
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,780
Hurry, be prepared.

429
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,420
Welcome home, Your Highness.

430
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,260
What is going on?

431
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,940
Where did he hire these extras?

432
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,420
Grand Tutor, this is...

433
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,860
Your Highness.

434
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,460
Please.

435
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,460
Your Highness.

436
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,940
According to the rules,

437
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,900
you should have eight nannies

438
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,140
and eight wet nurses.

439
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,820
Besides, there should be servants

440
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,380
in charge of clothing, bedding, and needlework,

441
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,420
in charge of washing and starching,

442
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
in charge of lighting,

443
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,940
and in charge of cooking.

444
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,620
In total, there should be forty servants.

445
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,980
But now, I have tried recruiting everywhere.

446
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,700
And I put up recruitment information online,

447
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,340
but only few applied.

448
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,860
Their costume is unified.

449
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,450
I wonder which crew Xiao Zhao

450
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,780
borrowed these from.

451
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,740
And Madam Zhao

452
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:07,780
has been appointed as the Madam in Chief,

453
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,660
commanding all these Palace maids.

454
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,540
Xiao Zhao must have been through a lot

455
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,500
to cooperate with Mr. Mu.

456
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,660
There should also be forty eunuchs serving Your Highness,

457
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,220
but no one applied

458
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,940
even though I put up notice everywhere.

459
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,980
The only one meeting our requirements

460
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,700
refused to be castrated.

461
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,980
He has been kicked out of the villa.

462
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,420
He is only allowed to come in and out in the daytime.

463
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,220
I'm ashamed of my incapability.

464
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,100
Please punish me, Your Highness.

465
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,010
Please punish us, Your Highness.

466
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,500
Please get up, Grand Tutor.

467
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,500
Please get up.

468
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,860
Get up.

469
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,260
Grand Tutor,

470
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,380
this is already a spectacle.

471
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,420
I don't know what to do.

472
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,660
There is no need to do this, Grand Tutor.

473
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,860
Your Highness is so kind-hearted

474
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,170
that you wouldn't blame me for not fulfilling my duty.

475
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,290
Your Highness,

476
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:58,970
please come upstairs

477
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:01,260
and check out the palace that I prepared for you.

478
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:05,260
More surprise?

479
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:07,780
Your Highness,

480
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:10,990
please.

481
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,180
Please come in, Your Highness.

482
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,290
Your Highness,

483
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,380
please come in.

484
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,460
Your Highness plays zheng well.

485
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,100
Thank you, Grand Tutor.

486
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:45,260
Your Highness,

487
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,180
come inside.

488
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,410
Unifon?

489
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,820
Did you prepare this for me?

490
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,940
This makeup box has a beautiful peony pattern,

491
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,300
with phoenix bird flying above.

492
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,020
It's an inheritance of artistry in royal court

493
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,020
called levigation by nine waters.

494
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,860
It can make your skin looks like jade after using it.

495
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,260
And it's royal cosmetology for Your Highness.

496
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,580
You know about this kind of stuff?

497
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,820
Tender flower royal makeup box

498
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:31,380
has adopted the imperial consort's skin care routine

499
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,060
to clean and nourish.

500
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,340
So that you can have the appearance just like a tender flower,

501
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,980
and the unsurpassed beauty.

502
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,780
Her Highness will definitely like it.

503
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,170
I want this superior royal makeup box.

504
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,100
Your Highness,

505
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,340
please.

506
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,460
Please take a rest, Your Highness.

507
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,970
Allow me to leave first.

508
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,650
Grand Tutor,

509
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,660
how could I repay you

510
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,740
for everything you did for me?

511
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,340
I can't take so much kindness.

512
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,780
Your Highness,

513
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,410
please don't say something like this.

514
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,500
It's already my honor

515
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,700
to serve you closely.

516
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:10,460
At this moment,

517
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:12,740
I don't have the ability to take you back to the Ning Dynasty and

518
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,180
we can only stay in this strange world.

519
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,620
The only thing I can do is to

520
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,860
make Your Highness

521
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,820
carefree and comfortable.

522
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:22,510
If Your Highness would let me to accomplish this,

523
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,570
my wish would be fulfilled.

524
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:27,160
Grand Tutor,

525
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,340
would you listen to me

526
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,020
on this one thing?

527
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:33,180
Please say it, Your Highness.

528
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,330
Please let people at down stairs leave.

529
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,130
I am not used to let these many people serve me.

530
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,780
Also,

531
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,820
it affects everybody's rest

532
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,780
if we have this many people at home.

533
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,980
But according to palace rules,

534
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,700
it is already inconvenient for Your Highness

535
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,780
with so few servants.

536
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,370
If we reduce even more,

537
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:56,140
there would not be enough helpers

538
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:58,340
for daily life and outing.

539
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,100
Your Highness, it's imperial bodyguard Bao.

540
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,580
What is it?

541
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,290
Bao, I am absolutely unrivaled.

542
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:05,850
Don't worry about it.

543
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,450
-Good at all housework and cleanings. -Alright, alright.

544
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,220
Your Highness,

545
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,810
What do you need, Your Highness.

546
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,020
It is a robot.

547
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,100
It can help to carry things,

548
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,860
make phone calls, record voices, chat,

549
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:17,940
play videos and many other things.

550
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,140
It has all the functions.

551
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,540
This is good, this is good.

552
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,220
It is good enough for me.

553
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,660
Please let the rest

554
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,220
of the people leave.

555
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,700
How can such a small object do

556
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:31,580
so many things?

557
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:32,620
Of course.

558
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:33,980
If you don't believe it,

559
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,340
I can show you.

560
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:36,780
But I just heard

561
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:37,930
that it has the voice of a man.

562
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:40,210
It's not appropriate to

563
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,290
let a male stranger get close to Your Highness.

564
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,170
It's my fault.

565
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:44,740
I forgot to set up the voice.

566
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,010
Actually, it can be male or female.

567
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,170
No, no, no.

568
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,900
It doesn't have a gender.

569
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,940
It is just a piece of metal.

570
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,660
It depends on your

571
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,050
personal preference.

572
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:59,060
Grand Tutor, don't worry.

573
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,860
Speaking of your world,

574
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,540
although the rules and manners are unenlightened here

575
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,500
comparing with the ones in the Ning Dynasty,

576
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,260
some objects are surely

577
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,140
interesting.

578
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,100
That's very wise of you, Grand Tutor.

579
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,220
Sister.

580
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:36,220
Qiao, how's everything going there?

581
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,810
I am doing well here.

582
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,460
Xiao Zhao is taking good care of me.

583
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,220
Don't worry.

584
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,810
How are you doing there?

585
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,420
Let me take a look at your room.

586
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:44,820
Wait a moment.

587
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:52,140
This is a room with musical instruments.

588
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,060
See, there is a Chinese zither.

589
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,410
This is the bedroom.

590
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:02,060
Over there, there is a bathroom

591
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,540
and a closet.

592
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,610
This is so dreamy.

593
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,980
Qiao,

594
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,570
I just wanted to pretend to be the princess

595
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,810
and stay by Mr. Mu's side, to help him

596
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,140
recover his memories.

597
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:22,820
I have been caring about him

598
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:25,180
and regarding him as a patient.

599
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:26,460
But,

600
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,780
he is seeing me as the Princess all the time.

601
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,140
How do you feel about that?

602
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,220
To say it frankly,

603
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:36,820
I feel a little bit of a smug.

604
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:37,780
Right?

605
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,320
Not to mention that you are involved,

606
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,900
I envy you

607
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,990
even as an outsider.

608
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,260
Right.

609
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,620
There is someone

610
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:47,340
who cares about you and spoils you.

611
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,100
The feeling of being

612
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,760
held in someone's palm

613
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,260
is really great.

614
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:58,090
But I am in such a dilemma.

615
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,060
I know

616
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,700
it is irrational to do this,

617
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,490
and I should say no.

618
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:05,850
You are afraid that

619
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,740
you can not face Mu Tingzhou

620
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,940
when he gets his awareness back one day?

621
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,700
Right.

622
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,180
I even feel more pressure on me

623
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,540
when Grand Tutor treats me better.

624
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,980
I don't know how to pay him back.

625
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,580
If one day,

626
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,290
he wakes up and becomes

627
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,820
Mu Tingzhou,

628
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,900
I don't know how to face him.

629
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,290
My emotions have been messed up by Grand Tutor, for real.

630
00:32:32,970 --> 00:32:33,900
Sister, in my opinion,

631
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,090
you don't have to think too much.

632
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:39,020
No matter he is the Grand Tutor or Mu Tingzhou,

633
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,700
he is only happy when

634
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,660
he treats you well.

635
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,090
You don't have the right to take other people's happiness away,

636
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,260
right?

637
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,090
Maybe he is in a good mood one day,

638
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,220
and not resist against people around him

639
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,540
anymore.

640
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,290
What you have done to help to cure his illness

641
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,100
are also count as virtuous achievements.

642
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:56,780
Really?

643
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,580
Yes, of course.

644
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,260
You don't have to give yourself

645
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,660
so much pressure.

646
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,020
Relax,

647
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,260
OK?

648
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,540
You are only there to help to get his memories back,

649
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,300
and you cannot control

650
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,340
all the things that happened.

651
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,370
Furthermore,

652
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:11,850
we can just leave

653
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,140
when he is alright.

654
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,410
You are not hoping to get anything from him anyways.

655
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,250
You are right.

656
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,180
I just

657
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,540
want Mr. Mu to get well soon for now.

658
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,380
Then my goal will be reached.

659
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:41,190
[Grand Chief Cabinet Minister]

660
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,449
[Grand Chief Cabinet Minister]

661
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,460
Grand Tutor,

662
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,370
what else can you do

663
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,700
other than reading?

664
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,700
My tutor

665
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,820
cannot be a nerd

666
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,620
who can read only.

667
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,500
Your Highness, are you aiming to

668
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,780
test me?

669
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,330
To manage...?

670
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,900
Grand Tutor, what does this mean?

671
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:04,030
[...Follow Heaven's way to cultivate people's ...]

672
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:02,860
This one here?

673
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,780
Your Highness.

674
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,340
Your Highness, Your Highness.

675
00:36:13,810 --> 00:36:14,540
Your Highness,

676
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,660
are you alright?

677
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,060
It's alright if you are fine.

678
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,060
Sorry, Grand Tutor.

679
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,300
I accidentally smashed that vase.

680
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,580
Tell me how much does that cost.

681
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,020
I will pay you back.

682
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,180
Your Highness, you are joking.

683
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,420
This is only

684
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,140
a vase which is passed down from the Ming Dynasty.

685
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:39,650
There are so many of these bottles and cans

686
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,980
in the Palace.

687
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,380
This...

688
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,490
Is this antique?

689
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,540
Is this the real stuff from the Ming Dynasty?

690
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,460
Yes, of course.

691
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,460
How could a fake one enter the palace?

692
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,900
Damn.

693
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,530
I cannot afford it even if

694
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,140
I sell myself.

695
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,450
Your Highness, you're joking.

696
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,300
Your Highness, you are noble,

697
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,250
how could you lower yourself

698
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,260
by comparing your worth to the vase?

699
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,850
My money is yours.

700
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,700
Don't worry, Your Highness.

701
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:16,940
Let me clean this up.

702
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:19,140
Your Highness, please allow me to do it.
