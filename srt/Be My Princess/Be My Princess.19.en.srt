it was the birthday of Princess Ming Hua.

The firework ceremony

12
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,860
was the birthday present given by His Majesty.

72
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:35,340
is this the first time you've felt so unsure of yourself?

73
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,700
Is this the first time you've been hung up about someone

74
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,980
and cannot be cool?

75
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,380
Do you know?

76
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,820
This is the real feeling of liking someone.

77
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,740
Why is my heartbeat so fast?

78
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,500
I feel so bad

79
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,900
seeing his condition now.

80
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,390
I have been thinking these days

81
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,130
if I was wrong.

82
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,220
If I could communicate with him more often,

83
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:38,740
especially

84
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,090
spending more time with him when he was little,

85
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,860
maybe

86
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:47,740
he would not be so distant from us now.

87
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,820
Don't think too much.

88
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,730
It has all passed.

89
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,380
He just

90
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,130
lost his memory now.

91
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,780
That's why he didn't know us.

92
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,660
Everything will be fine

93
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,180
after his memory is back.

94
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,380
I always think it is my fault.

Go ahead.

Go ahead.

are the fireworks in the Ning Dynasty as beautiful as these?

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:13,860
Yes.

129
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,720
They are much more beautiful.

130

Every year at New Year's Eve,

131
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,260
there would be fireworks in the palace.

132
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,040
Her Highness was little at that time.

133
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,670
She was always the happiest one

I envy

140
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,310
and am even jealous of Ming Wei.

141
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,380
Because no matter what happens in the future,

142
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,000
and whether Mu Tingzhou will be back,

143
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,740
she has got the real love.

144

takes care of her

00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:22,890
and loves her.

149

I'm also a woman.

150
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,820
I hope to meet such a man as well

151

I'm here. Don't be afraid.

155

How can't my daughter go back home

because of them?

157

Let's go.

158
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,760
I will protect you.

159
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,550
She's back. She's back.

160
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,220
Miss Ming Wei,

161
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,900
is Mu Tingzhou's condition better?

162
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,580
Do you still have connections with him after you left?

163
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,020

Miss Ming.

166

Make way. What to shoot?

167
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,140
Mu Tingzhou. Mu Tingzhou.

168
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,200
All they asked was about Mu Tingzhou.

169
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,540
Dad, have a seat.

170
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,380
Don't be mad.

171
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,510
How come I am not mad?

172
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,590
What did they mean by

173
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,300
"lucky enough to get the opportunity to get close to the Best Actor"？

174
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,620
It's a bullshit opportunity.

175
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,740

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,020
for Your Highness and me.

350
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,150
How come it is a game?

351
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,860
Honestly, Your Highness,

352
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,620
do you still lack confidence

353
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,420
in our relationship?

354
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,960
Do you still have doubts about me?

355
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,110
I...

356
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,100
How come I have doubts about you?

357
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,950
I'm sorry that I'm incapable of

358
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,310
finding a way back to the Ning Dynasty,

359
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,110
nor helping Your Highness move back to the imperial palace.

360
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,810
So I can only

361
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:52,700
dedicate my heart

362
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,020
to Your Highness,

363
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,630
at the place where we broke up.

364
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,380
Why are you on your kneels again?

365
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,260
Get up first.

366
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,160
Your Highness,

367
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,750
please allow me to finish my words.

368
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,710
I had a dream that Your Highness said you hated me.

369
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,900
I was confused at first,

370
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,060
but now I've realized

371
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,380
the reason I show up in this world

372
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,340
is to make up for my regrets.

373
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,280
I sincerely ask Your Highness deign to marry me.

374
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,660
Okay.

375
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,430
Did you mean "yes", Your Highness?

376
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,580
Yes, I will marry you.

377
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,580
It's so obvious. They did it on purpose

378
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,040
and thought I didn't know?

379
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,020
Hello.

380
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:15,900
Miss,

381
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,500
what can I get you?

382
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,020
The hardest liquor.

383
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,780
Are you sure?

384
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:22,060
Just a friendly reminder: this is not a safe place

385
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,820
to get drunk.

386
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,430
I want the hardest liquor anyways.

387
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,540
Okay.

388
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,100
Miss, here is your drink.

389
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,460
Thank you.

390
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Wow, it really is you.

391
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,030
I thought I've mistaken you for someone else.

392
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,940
Is it because I look so differently before and after the makeup?

393
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,610
Yes.

394
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,340
But you look prettier

395
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,470
without the makeup.

396
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,790
I'm wearing makeup.

397
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,100
Do you come here often?

398
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:01,380
Yeah.

399
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,420
I come here when I need to relax.

400
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,940
Can people really be relaxed

401
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,800
by spending time here?

402
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,000
Do you want to give it a try?

403
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,340
No worries.

404
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,510
I will be there looking out for you.

405
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,350
[Sending message]

406
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,700
[Xiao]

407
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:00,040
[Are you coming?]

408
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,460
Okay, Mom.

409
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,920
We will go back in a couple of days.

410
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,260
You and Dad don't need to prepare anything.

411
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,750
I just want to take him home to meet you.

412
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,540
Okay. Bye.

413
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,920
You've told your family about us?

414
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,660
I worry if I take you home without telling them first,

415
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,860
they will be shocked.

416
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,820
Do I look so terrible?

417
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,540
No, I didn't mean that.

418
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:32,660
You just need to behave well by then.

419
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,100
Please don't worry, Your Highness.

420
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,360
I will be well prepared

421
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,570
and won't disappoint them.

422
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,060
How was that?

423
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,390
Xiao Zhao will be here soon.

424
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,520
Do you know him?

425
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:02,280
We are friends.

426
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,060
-This drink has a strong after-effect. Don't drink like this. -Don't drink like this.

427
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,580
This drink has a strong after-effect. You can't take it so fast.

428
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,300
You can't drink so fast.

429
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,020
Put it down.

430
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:20,400
You will get drunk.

431
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:21,670
Put it down. Now.

432
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,470
You can't...

433
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,830
What are you doing, Xiao Zhao?

434
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,130
What's going on?

435
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,940
Come here, you brat.

436
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,920
He has nothing to do with this.

437
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,320
Must be some relationship disputes.

438
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:40,580
You just gave her this kind of drink?

439
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,660
She ordered it.

440
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,080
You stay away from her.

441
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,740
Slow down. Slow down.

442
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:32,800
Here. Here.

443
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,680
Let me help you go to your room.

444
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:35,780
Come.

445
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:37,580
Don't touch me.

446
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,390
Well, what do you want to do?

447
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,260
Say it.

448
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,580
Jerk!

449
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,180
You are right.

450
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,300
I always am.

451
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,790
You should have known earlier.

452
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,570
I'm telling you this.

453
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,700
You can date other women.

454
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,580
You can dislike me.

455
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,770
But you can't upset me on purpose.

456
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,260
You can't upset me on purpose.

457
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,220
You upsetting me is what really hurts me.

458
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:45,280
Do you understand?

459
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,100
You told Mu Tingzhou to live for the moment,

460
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:12,540
but why can't you give us a chance?

461
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,220
Xiao Zhao,

462
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,110
is this the first time you've felt so unsure of yourself?

463
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,780
Is this the first time you've been hung up about someone

464
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,980
and cannot be cool?

465
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,460
Do you know?

466
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,390
This means you truly like someone.

467
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:47,890
Well.

468
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,180
Those things outside...

469
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:50,950
Sir,

470
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,900
do you think there are things that I missed?
