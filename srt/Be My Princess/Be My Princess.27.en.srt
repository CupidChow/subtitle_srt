and tell her I always like her deeply.

00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,380
I believe she will

84
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,540
forgive me and accept me.

85
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,640
I don't think it is good for you to do this.

86
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,180
Why?

87
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,330
You turned into Grand Tutor back then

88
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,990
and kept chasing her tightly,

89
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:26,220
then you brought back your memories

90
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,550
and broke up with her without hesitation.

91
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,470
Now you remember all the things

92
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,140
and you want to get back together with her because of the same reason.

93
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,740
Are you fooling with her?

94
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,500
Even if Ming Wei won't be mad,

95
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,020
I as her brother won't allow you to do that.

96
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,540
So I think you should wait for a while

97
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,200
and see how the things move on.

98

100
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,870
I have made up my mind

101
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,140
to chase her back.

102
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:55,940

It's not a good habit of betting.

106
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,220
I am not in favor of it.

107
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,380
Say it if you don't dare.

108
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,470
Don't use that as an excuse.

I would do whatever I could.

134

00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,330
Your Highness must be tired acting these days.

175
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,070
I have brought your favorite Mud Facial Cleanser

176
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,460
and the food you like.

177
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:11,700
Come here.

178
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,770
Take care of yourself when shooting with the crew.

179
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,820
These are pastries I tried to make by myself.

180
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,820
Try it and see if you like it.

181
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,440
So much yummy food.

182
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,100
There you go.

183
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,700
Is it good?

184
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,590
What do you want?

185
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,700
Qiao,

186
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,650
I have something to tell you.

187
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,860
Could you give me a chance to explain?

188
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,780
I don't want to hear you explanation.

189
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,510
I am busy now.

190
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,790
When are you available?

191
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,100
I will come to you.

192
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,760
I have been busy recently.

193
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,260
Go have lunch with Ming Wei

194
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,780
in Tingzhou's RV.

195
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,240
It's cold here and the wind is strong.

196
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:39,900
Okay?

197
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,770
Save it.

198
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,370
Thanks.

199
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:47,980
Qiao,

200
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,630
let me help you.

201
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,060
Thanks.

202
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,800
Go mind your own business.

203
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,300
Get in the car.

204
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,900
I will drive you to the scene.

205
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:00,830
You drive by yourself?

206
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,340
From now on, as long as I am available,

207
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,540
I will give you a ride.

208
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:11,940
From now on,

209
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,540
I will be

210
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,460
Your Highness's driver.

211
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,220
Safety belt.

212
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,980
Don't run too hard, Qiao.

213
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,430
Have some water.

214
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,760
Let me help you open it.

215
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,220
Why?

216
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,430
Why do you leave when I come?

217
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:54,900
Go away.

218
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,550
You forgot your water.

219
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,230
Don't you call yourself Romeo?

220
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:24,460
How come you look so depressed?

221
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,260
Ming Qiao is really...

222
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,910
She is really stubborn.

223
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
She was stubborn when she chased me,

224
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,310
and now again...

225
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,270
I can't ask her back no matter what I do.

226
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,200
You deserve it.

227
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,060
I will win her back.

228
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,900
Tingzhou,

229
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
you gotta help me.

230
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,180
How?

231
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,980
Shanbo,

232
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,180
do you remember

233
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,390
the old days when we studied together?

234
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,640
Of course, I will never forget it.

235
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,619
Express some emotions, will you?

236
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,109
Of course I remember...

237
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,460
Why?

238
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,010
I don't know who it is.

239

[Xiao Zhao]

240
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,260
Qiao.

241
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,460
it's me.

242
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,940
Sorry,

243
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,960
I am really sorry about it,

244
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,820
but I really miss you.

245
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,490
I really miss you.

246
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:54,490
Xiao Zhao... Is he drunk?

247
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,140
Who knows?

248
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,220
[Message Recalled]

[Xiao Zhao]

250
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,220
Answer it.

251
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,380
Answer it.

252
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,540
[Xiao Zhao]

253
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,180
Xiao Zhao, where are you?

254
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,980
Are you drunk?

255
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,520
Ming Qiao, it's me,

256
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,380
Tingzhou.

257
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,200
Xiao Zhao is drunk.

258
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
He cried and made a scene.

259
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,960
He kept yelling your name.

260
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:33,570
I didn't notice before when he...

261
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,020
-It has nothing to do with me. You answer it. -It's a voice message.

262
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,660
I helped him recall the message.

263
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,190
I thought since you broke up

264
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,390
and it was late at night,

265
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,060
we shouldn't bother you.

266
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,180
I feel ashamed of him.

267
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:48,490
Where are you now?

268
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,860
Why did you allow him to drink this much?

269
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,220
Couldn't you hold him back?

270
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,220
Even if I wanted, I couldn't make it.

271
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,870
He said he was heartbroken.

272
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,280
He said he was sorry for what he did to you.

273
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,240
So he kept drinking more and more.

274
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,180
Qiao.

275
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,700
Why... Why do you come here?

276
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,740
You are an adult.

277
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:27,660
Why do you make people worry about you?

278
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,720
You drank too much.

279
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,860
Get out of here with me.

280
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,460
No.

281
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,500
I... I didn't drink much, Qiao.

282
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,800
You come here. I...

283
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,380
I am happy.

284
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,220
I feel guilty.

285
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,760
I am sorry for what I did to you.

286
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:47,580
But I do really love you, Qiao.

287
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:48,500
I...

288
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,220
Keep your mouth closed. Everyone can hear you.

289
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,020
What are you yelling for?

290
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,500
I...

291
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,700
Let's come back first.

292
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,830
Is that your friend?

293
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:55,860
Yeah?

294
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,100
Are you okay?

295
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,540
Xiao Zhao.

296
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,340
What's wrong?

297
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,700
He doesn't feel good.

298
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,520
Well, he got drunk.

299
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,260
He got drunk?

300
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,720
He can't drink.

301
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,890
He can't drink?

302
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,770
No way.

303
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,540
I have never seen him drunk.

304
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,980
You friend is calling you.

305
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,620
Excuse me.

306
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,810
Excuse me. I shall leave now.

307
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,000
I've got a headache, Qiao.

308
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,840
Stop faking it.

309
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,820

Qiao.

312
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:47,940
I am not faking it.

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:48,380
I...

314
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,900
Qiao. Qiao. Qiao.

315
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,140
Sorry. Sorry.

316
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,940
It's my fault.

317
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,300
You... Please don't get mad at me, okay?

318
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,380
You pretended to be drunk and fooled me to care for you.

319
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,710
Good for you, Xiao Zhao.

320
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,020
You have the talent for being the Best Actor.

321
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,820
Don't. Don't.

322
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,300
Qiao, I was wrong.

323
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,140
I knew I shouldn't lie to you,

324
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,220
but I had no other choice, Qiao.

325
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,450
I was grasping at straws.

326
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,940
I didn't mean to lie to you.

327
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,060
I just wanted to ask you back.

328
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,980
I got mad even if you didn't mean to lie.

329
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,620
No, Qiao.

330
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,820
That is not what we want.

331
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,420
Mr. Mu.

332
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,580
Aren't you someone cautious

333
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,620
and upright?

334
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,580
How come you helped Xiao Zhao do this kind of thing?

335
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,980
Weren't you throwing gasoline on a pretentious fire?

336
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,440
Well, I was like Xiao Zhao,

337
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,980
grasping at straws.

338
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,900
Ming Wei...

339
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,300
Ming Wei. You...

340
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,260
Ming Wei.

341
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,460
You...

342
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,420
It's all your fault.

343
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:57,700
You forced me to lie with you.

344
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Now it's all over.

345
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,100
Ming Wei won't accept me anymore.

346
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,810
Teacher, the stage is ready.

347
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,070
Let's go over the play.

348
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,780
Sure.

349
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:22,500
Let's go.

350
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,830
[The view is beautiful tonight with gentle wind, I will be waiting for you by the river.]

351
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,130
Time is up.

352
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,020
Get ready.

353
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,210
Don't worry.

354
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,700
Is she coming?

355
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,060
Take a look.

356
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:44,620
Coming, she is coming.

357
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:45,140
Hurry up. Hurry up.

358
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,010
Light the fire.

359
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,420
Light it up.

360
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,300
Even you can think of such a brilliant idea.

361
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,380
When Ming Wei sees this,

362
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,110
she definitely will accept it.

363
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,900
Xiao Zhao, I love you.

364
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,850
The voice sounds like Ming Qiao.

365
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:33,820
Qiao.

366
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,310
You are so romantic.

367
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,580
You put a card in my coat

368
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,880
to ask me to come to see the fireworks.

369
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:48,500
Is it what you wanted to tell me

370
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,540
in the morning?

371
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:52,180
Yes.

372
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,300
I just want to get your forgiveness, and

373
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,080
I want to pursue you again.

374
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,740
So will you accept me?

375
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:02,840
You have made such a grandiose scene,

376
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,500
so I will accept it.

377
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
But you know what,

378
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,210
this is the last time.

379
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,540
If you try to leave me again,

380
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,820
I will ignore you forever.

381
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,330
Sure.

382
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,600
There will never be a second time.

383
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:56,100
You are here.

384
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,820
Xiao Zhao asked me to come

385
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,130
and comfort your hurt feelings.

386
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:07,980
If there is a selection of the most unlucky person of the year,

387
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:09,580
I will definitely be chosen.

388
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,300
I thought the coat was yours.

389
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,140
Why is it Ming Qiao's?

390
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,380
The coat is Ming Qiao's.

391
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:17,990
I borrowed it today.

392
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,820
Who knows we are so lucky.

393
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,820
I didn't realize

394
00:27:25,570 --> 00:27:28,060
the Best Actor also has moments of depression.

395
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:29,060
In my heart,

396
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:31,170
you are always so confident.

397
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,420
Yes, I am confident.

398
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,650
But my confidence is useless

399
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,820
in front of you.

400
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:45,040
Ming Qiao told me about

401
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,140
the fireworks tonight.

402
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,990
It's beautiful.

403
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,360
However beautiful it was,

404
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,930
you didn't have the chance to see it.

405
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,740
I saw it.

406
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:07,860
Really?

407
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,140
I saw it in my heart.

408
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,460
Thank you.

409
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,180
Ming Wei,

410
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,540
I may be good at acting.

411
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,320
But in front of someone I love,

412
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,060
I don't have any acting skills.

413
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,380
All my emotions are real.

414
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,330
If in the past,

415
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,590
I fell in love with you as the Grand Tutor.

416
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,460
This time,

417
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,860
I fell in love as

418
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,780
Mu Tingzhou.

419
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,100
Maybe it is destiny

420
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,350
that made me meet you

421
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,350
and fall in love with you

422
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,460
every time.

423
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,560
I have hurt you before.

424
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,100
I know I am terrible at communicating with others and I have low EQ.

425
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,260
I am also not loved by girls.

426
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:22,940
But.

427
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,120
But I am willing to change for you.

428
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,280
I am willing to wait for you

429
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:34,500
until you accept me.

430
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,380
I will consider it.

431
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:57,940
After all the mess,

432
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,140
it turns out the fireworks were set up by Mu Tingzhou

433
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,180
to my sister.

434
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,020
It has nothing to do with you!

435
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,000
So silly of me to be that happy!

436
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:06,660
You can't say it like this.

437
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,350
I brought the fireworks after all.

438
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,040
I also put my heart into it.

439
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,270
I don't care.

440
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,020
I want to withdraw what I have said.

441
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,150
I don't love you now.

442
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,180
No, honey.

443
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,900
You just promised me to be my girlfriend.

444
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,300
How can you take it back?

445
00:30:21,390 --> 00:30:22,140
How about this?

446
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,900
I can set you a show of fireworks later,

447
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,050
bigger and more beautiful than this one.

448
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,690
Okay?

449
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:28,700
Who cares.

450
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,020
Then tell me what you like.

451
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,950
You tell me and I will definitely do it for you.

452
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,870
This time, you will pursue me.

453
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,140
Until I am satisfied.

454
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:52,780
Sure.

455
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,170
That's a deal.

456
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:00,710
Then you can come after me now.

457
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:03,230
Wait, let me take you back.

458
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,320
I am here to say goodbye to you.

459
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:49,590
Where are you going?

460
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,710
Aren't you mad at me?

461
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,250
You even care about where I am going.

462
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,860
We grew up together,

463
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,700
why would I be mad at you?

464
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,180
Yes.

465
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,350
We grew up together.

466
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,580
Do you think I didn't know

467
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,740
that I don't stand a chance with you?

468
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:16,820
Lin,

469
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,450
I believe

470
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,480
one day

471
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,430
you will find someone who loves you

472
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,580
and appreciates you.

473
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,980
Who knows where he is?

474
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,630
This time, after I go back to the UK,

475
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,900
I may not be back for a long time.

476
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,760
Take care of yourself.

477
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,260
Can I have a word with Ming Wei in private?

478
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,140
I will wait for you in the front.

479
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,940
Sure.

480
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,320
What do you want to tell me?

481
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,330
I am here to apologize to you

482
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,100
for the slap

483
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,500
and for those words I have said to you.

484
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,330
I am sorry.

485
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:51,970
It's okay.

486
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,300
It's all past now.

487
00:33:58,540 --> 00:34:00,470
Although biologically speaking,

488
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,260
we are sisters.

489
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,520
But I have to admit,

490
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:08,110
I can't accept you as my sister yet.

491
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,800
And I am not able to say things like

492
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,580
best wishes to you and Tingzhou.

493
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:17,739
So,

494
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,790
let's just leave it to the time.

495
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:26,110
There are many things which

496
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,139
we can't force.

497
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,620
May be time will give us the answer.

498
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:38,340
We have known each other for a long time,

499
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,580
and this is the first time

500
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,060
for us to talk in peace.

501
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:43,900
That's true.

502
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:48,420
Do you plan to stay in the country

503
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,239
or go back to the UK?

504
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,580
Back to the UK.

505
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,780
I want to finish my study.

506
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,449
You should

507
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,100
do well in your career.

508
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,820
When you are famous one day,

509
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,430
my fashion brand

510
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,960
can ask you to help with the sales.

511
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:07,940
Sure.

512
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,300
Then.

513
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:12,900
Take care.

514
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,580
Take care.

515
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,140
Shanbo.

516
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:10,980
I have said

517
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,610
we will never separate.

518
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,380
This love will never end.

519
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,550
Even we are not born together,

520
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,590
we should die in the same place.

521
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,260
You are gone.

522
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,620
I will not live alone.

523
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,620
Today,

524
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,780
I am coming to you.

525
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,650
You are alive.

526
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,500
Is this the reality or a dream?

527
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:16,300
Or do we meet at the netherworld?

528
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,380
This is not a dream.

529
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
You should know.

530
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,630
No matter life or death,

531
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,820
I will always be with you.

532
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,090
Yingtai,

533
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,120
we will never separate again.

534
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,620
Cut.

535
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,780
Everyone, thank you for your hard work.

536
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,660
It's wrapped!

537
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,590
-Good. -It's wrapped!

538
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,340
Congratulations on the wrap of the play for you two.

539
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,800
This is the flower for you.

540
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,820
Thank you.

541
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,300
-Great! -Great.

542
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,260
Where are you going?

543
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:33,820
I am going to see Ming Wei.

544
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,260
She have left the crew.

545
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,020
She is gone.

546
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,040
How do you know?

547
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,180
Ming Qiao told me.

548
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,740
Why don't you tell me?

549
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:45,780
Right.

550
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,940
She don't want me to tell you.

551
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,590
I ask you.

552
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,060
Is it in your heart

553
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,130
Ming Qiao is more important than me?

554
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:55,900
Of course.

555
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,220
You value girlfriend more than me.

556
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,790
The bet we made, I will definitely win.

557
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,170
Coming.

558
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,660
Auntie Zhao.

559
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:35,420
Miss Ming, long time no see.

560
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,960
Come in please.

561
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:38,780
I will get you a cup of water.

562
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,420
Sure.

563
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,110
Auntie Zhao.

564
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:54,480
Why do you bring a flower here?

565
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,300
Miss. Ming.

566
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,410
I think you know

567
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:02,560
these flowers are given by Grand Tutor to you right?

568
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,770
Yes.

569
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,890
Does

570
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:12,630
the Grand Tutor ask you to bring them here?

571
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:13,980
Yes.

572
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,900
The Grand Tutor told me to bring them

573
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,500
when he was about to leave.

574
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,860
But today I am here

575
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,660
is not just to bring this flower.

576
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,060
I also want to tell you one thing.

577
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,760
You see this phone.

578
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,360
It is used by the Grand Tutor before he had the car accident.

579
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:39,020
It was broken during the accident.

580
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,560
But it was fixed later.

581
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,270
The Grand Tutor didn't want to use Mr. Mu's phone.

582
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:45,300
So

583
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:47,180
I have been keeping this for him.

584
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:50,460
Recently, I suddenly remembered this.

585
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,180
I would like you to see the things inside the phone.

586
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,300
It's Mr. Mu's phone,

587
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,180
I think it's not appropriate for me to look.
