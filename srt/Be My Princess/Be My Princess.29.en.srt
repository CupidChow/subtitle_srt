you don't even care, do you?

343
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,980
I don't know what are you talking about, Your Highness.

344
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,580
You don't even care if I marry

345
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,200
Royal Highness or not.

346
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,420
If I marry him,

347
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,860
there is nothing to

348
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,340
stop you from

349
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,480
marrying that sickly person, right?

350
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,770
Looking at men from all the aristocratic families,

351
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,620
none of them is more talented or more handsome than Royal Highness.

352
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,820
I personally think

353
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,540
this is a perfect match.

354
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,460
Your Highness, please kindly consider it.

355
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:57,860
Don't refuse it lightly.

356
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,540
Great,

357
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,250
that's so nice of you.

358
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,060
If Your Highness has no other commands,

359
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,790
please allow me to leave first.

360
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,460
I hate you!

361
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,260
I will hate you for the rest of my life.

362
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,620
I am never going to forgive you.

363
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,940
You hear me?

364
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,100
I hate you!

365
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:47,700
Your Highness, Your Highness!

366
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,240
Don't follow me anymore.

367
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,020
-Your Highness. -Your Highness.

368
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,420
According to emperor's edict,

369
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:13,510
the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister, Mu Yun, is of a marriageable age.

370
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,100
A virtuous lady should be chosen to marry him.

371
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,760
The daughter of Guo Family is not betrothed yet.

372
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,940
She is respectful, prudent, elegant, smart, gentle and kind.

373
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,820
Therefore, she has been granted to Mu Yun as his wife.

374
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,219
The ceremony will be held on an auspicious day.
