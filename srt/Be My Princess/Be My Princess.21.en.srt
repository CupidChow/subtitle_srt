We just did a comprehensive

checkup for Mr. Mu.

46
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,890
There is nothing wrong.

47
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,180
He can leave the hospital and go home.

48
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:38,580
But to be on the safe side,

49
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,720
we suggest that

50
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,860
he should come back to the hospital for a check regularly.

51
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,700
He only remembered

52
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,580
the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister back then,

53
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,500
but now it's the only thing that he has forgotten.

54
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,300
Why?

55
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,580
That's not my expertise.

56
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,110
First of all,

57
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:54,540
Mr. Mu's situation today

58
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,600
marks a good start.

59
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,380
He has started to retrieve his memories

60
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,710
and become Mu Tingzhou.

61
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,820
Next,

62
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,400
I hope when you go back,

63
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,460
you can tell him

64
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,390
what happened amid his memory loss

65
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,020
to avoid further confusion.

66
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,020
Finally,

67
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,340
some of his memories are still lost after all.

68
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:09,980
Thus,

69
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,420
he needs to come to me regularly for treatments.

70
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,910
OK. Thanks.

71
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:14,740

00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,470
there is nothing wrong with his physical health,

75
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,500
but he just doesn't remember me, right?

76
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,500
Strictly speaking,

77
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,890
he doesn't remember the whole filming process of the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister

78
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,660
or

79
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,030
anything after he became Grand Tutor.

You just said it, right?

84
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,640
The doctor said

85
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,820
the current situation is the best

86
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,940

Auntie and I can also do it.

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:26,260
Right. Right.

We have bothered Ming Wei

101
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,870
for quite a while back then.

102
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,260
Auntie,

103
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,860
the doctor just asked us

104
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,500
to tell Tingzhou about everything

105
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,900
that happened recently,

106
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,890
right?

107
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:38,539
Ming Wei is the person

108
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,539
who had the most contact with Tingzhou recently.

109
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:41,299
You don't want anything else to happen to Tingzhou,

110
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:41,789
right?

111
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:43,940
Mom,

112
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,640
let Lin drive you home.

113
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,010
OK.

114
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,340
I should go now.

115
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,420

Tingzhou,

120
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,820
Miss Ming Wei tolerated a lot of your unreasonable requirements

121
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,700
when you were ill,

122
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:00,750
and she helped you a lot.

123
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:08,620

Last April,

126
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,580
the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister started filming.

127
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,740
Ming Wei played the role of the princess,

128
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,870
and you played the role of Grand Tutor.

129
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,540
Later in October,

130
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,120
you lost your memories

131
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:25,460
in a car accident when you went for dubbing.

132
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,820
You had considered yourself the Grand Tutor

133
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,620
since the car accident till yesterday.

134
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,820
You also kept on at Ming Wei and

135
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,480
regarded her as the princess.

136
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:33,770
Right,

137
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,710
there are videos online that can prove it.

138
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,460
How do you feel about it?

139
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,220
After you watched these videos,

140
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,550
do you recall anything?

141
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,740
Isn't it a commercial

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,070

you only remembered Ming Wei,

157

so we could only ask Ming Wei

to come over and comfort you.

You two fell in love with each other.

160
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:19,660
You even gave her a jade hair clasp

161

to Ming Wei as a token of love.

162

Everything was good

were childhood sweethearts.

166
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,870
Probably she felt like

167
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,420
it might cause problems

168
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,060
to have a relationship with Grand Tutor,

169
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,520
Ming Wei broke up with you.

170
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,300
Grand Tutor got heartbroken.

171
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,560
When he came back home,

172
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:41,740
he stayed in his room carving wood

173

day and night.

174
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,180

00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,350
-Sister. -Grand Tutor.

519
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,260
Sister.

520
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,330
Sister.

521
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,610
What time is it?

522
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,310
Is there any news about me?

523
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:19,740
No.

524
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,340
There is no news about you.

525
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,770
I am already experiencing the worst thing.

526
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,220
What else

527
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,340
can't I accept?

528
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,340
Mu Tingzhou and Xu Lin appear inseparable.

529
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,180
[The identity of Mu Tingzhou's real girlfriend is revealed and Ming Wei is sure to be the mistress.]

530
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,250
The female designer who grew up with Mu Tingzhou

531
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,820
is the actual girlfriend.

532
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,690
Ming Wei's mistress identity is confirmed.

533
00:39:03,790 --> 00:39:04,320
Sister.

534
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,690
Grand Tutor.

535
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,180
Where are you now?

536
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,510
Have you gone back to the Ning dynasty?

537
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,460
I miss you so much.

538
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,140
I feel so sad.

539
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:01,740
Chen Zhang.

540
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,390
Why are you here?

541
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,500
Tingzhou,

542
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,760
I found a very delicious canteen.

543
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,660
How about we go together one day?

544
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,220
Sure.

545
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,500
Mu Tingzhou.

546
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:32,460
Who are you?

547
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,640
I am Ming Wei's sister, Ming Qiao.

548
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,320
I have a few questions for you.

549
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,490
Go ahead.

550
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,280
Is she your girlfriend?

551
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,830
No.

552
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:42,960
Do you have any girlfriends?

553
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:43,580
No.

554
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,580
Then in this case,

555
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:46,300
why my sister is seen as a mistress?

556
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,180
She helped you kindly

557
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,500
with your recovery treatment.

558
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,470
You not only forget the commitments you made

559
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,860
but also let her bear the criticism as being a mistress.

560
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,660
Do you still have any conscious?

561
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,140
Miss Ming.

562
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,410
After Tingzhou gets his memories back,

563
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:58,220
we don't have any connection

564
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,380
with your sister.

565
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,140
Don't you think your acrimonious attitude

566
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,270
is a little too much?

567
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:05,270
You don't have any connection with my sister.

568
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,460
But that doesn't mean you won't lead

569
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,820
this kind of fake news.

570
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,650
[The identity of Mu Tingzhou's real girlfriend is revealed and Ming Wei is sure to be the mistress.]

571
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,720
My sister can't work normally

572
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,900
and have to bear the stigma.

573
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,900
Do you dare to say it has nothing to do

574
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,160
with you, Mu Tingzhou?

575
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,300
Just because of your brain problem,

576
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,180
she has to pay such a heavy price.

577
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,420
I don't think my sister has done anything wrong.

578
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,140
The only mistake she has ever made is

579
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,940
to fall in love with Grand Tutor.

580
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:33,860
Here.

581
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,120
Take it slowly, don't get choked.

582
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:43,950
The moment I get online,

583
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,620
there fans of Mu Tingzhou

584
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,900
mocking me.

585
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,150
When I go out of the door,

586
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,220
there are reporters waiting and throwing all kinds of questions at me.

587
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,620
Besides staying at home,

588
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,220
I have nothing else to do.

589
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,260
Thank you Chen Zhang.

590
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,180
When I am in trouble,

591
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:02,750
you still remember me.

592
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:04,500
I said

593
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,340
I am your friend forever.

594
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,210
So no matter when,

595
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:10,340
I will always stand by your side.

596
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,900
As for the work,

597
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,580
I think there is no need for you to be anxious.

598
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,370
Ms. Shen is already working on it.

599
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:16,980
And you still have me.

600
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,900
People always talk about the precious

601
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,230
of giving help when others are in trouble.

602
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,690
Thank you so much.

603
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,020
The rumors will eventually pass.

604
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,260
You have to put yourself together.

605
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,060
I will be here with you all the time.

606
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,190
You should also eat.

607
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,540
I shall answer this first.

608
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:41,180
Okay.

609
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,900
Hello, how is it?

610
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,680
It is like this.

611
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,420
I have basically figured out.

612
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,080
It's just as you have guessed.

613
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:57,540
This thing

614
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,620
is manipulated by someone behind the scene,

615
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,620
or it won't grown to this scale.

616
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:06,260
Even the thing about Mu Tingzhou's hanging around with Xu Lin

617
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,660
can be linked to Ming Wei.

618
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,950
There is definitely someone behind.

619
00:43:10,410 --> 00:43:11,220
I am wondering

620
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,500
who is the person.

621
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,050
Did you give the journalists some

622
00:43:46,050 --> 00:43:47,140
misleading news

623
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,820
which lead to the appearance of these online stories?
