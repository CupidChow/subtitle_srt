Doctor,

00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,180
I have some issues.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,940
But I...

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,220
I don't know how to put it.

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:17,660

Mr. Mu?

12
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,650
What exactly is the problem?

13
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:36,460
You've been talking for a while,

14
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,980
but I still don't get it.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,730
Is your illness getting worse?

16
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:42,460
No.

21
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,060
okay?

22
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,100
It's just, there's someone,

00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,940
every time I see her...

24
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,900
It's a woman. A woman.

I just get...

26
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,500
Do you get it?

27
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,610
Not really.

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:14,100
Do you get nervous? Does your heart beat faster? Do you sweat more?

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,860
Or do you feel dizzy?

30

Why did you call the police to arrest my dad?

41
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,650
If you don't like me,

42
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,020
go against me!

43
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,170
Why my dad?

44
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,380
What did my father do wrong?

45
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,140
Ms. Ming,

46
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,340
please calm down.

47
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,460
My dad was arrested.

How can I be calm?

Let me tell you something, Mu Tingzhou.

50
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,340
If anything happens to my dad,

51
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,500
I'll get you for that!

It's my first time seeing this.

53
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,740
Watch your step, auntie.

54
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,620
Why is the batterer is so self-righteous?

55
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,370
The batterer?

56
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,579
That's impossible.

57
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,210
Although my dad is hot-tempered,

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,750
he doesn't hit anyone.

59
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,090
Are you saying

60
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,500
we blackmailed you on purpose?

61
00:03:45,579 --> 00:03:46,250
Look at this.

62
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,370
Is auntie's wound fake?

63
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,220
We all saw it.

64
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,829
It was your father who pushed her.

65
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,100
OK, it's enough.

66
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,290
Yeah,

68

How come she is so aggressive?

Enough is enough.

This is my stuff.

71
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:05,460
I can deal with it myself.

72
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,130
Mom, go back to your room and have a rest.

73
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:13,370
You guys talk nicely.

74
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,780
OK.

75
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,740
Did my father hurt auntie?

76
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,420
It was just an accident.

77
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,580
Mr. Mu,

78
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:39,820
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,500
I apologize to you and auntie.

80
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,810
Can you set my father free?

81
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,850
He's getting old

82
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,070
and has never been through this before.

83
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,710
I'm afraid he can't stand it.

84
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,280
Mr. Mu,

85
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,430
please.

86
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,180
We could compensate you

87

for all the medical expenses of your mother.

88
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,420
I apologize to all of your family on behalf of my father.

89
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,820
As long as you agree to set my father free,

90
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,710
I promise,

91
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,300
from now on,

92
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,560

nor have any interaction with you.

94

we're all responsible for it.

it's all my fault.

104

My fault is

105
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,940
when you said you were the Grand Tutor

106
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,010
I was so kind that I stayed with you.

107
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,020
My fault is,

108
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,420
although I knew it's only a character from a show

109
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,460
I fell in love with him.

110
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,940
But, I don't regret it.

111
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,220
Because he's worth it.

112
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,340
Thank you for your understanding.

113
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,180
I hope, from now on,

114
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,980
you'll stay in your life, and I'll stay in mine.

before the police set me free.

122

it's all because of me

123
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,140
I put you through all this.

124
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,940
It's all because I insisted on marrying Grand Tutor

125
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,340
so it ended up like this.

126
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,260
Sorry, it's my fault.

127

Poor kid, what are you talking about?

128
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,340
You don't have to apologize to your family.

Also,

130
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,220
what kind of parents would blame their own kids?

I'll get them for it.

137
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,730
Well, I think

138
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,260
it might be good for Wei to withdraw from the entertainment industry.

139
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,740
See, although there's something good about entertainment industry,

140
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,860
there're also bad parts.

141
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,580
Even if there's nothing serious,

142
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,100
it'll be exposed to the public.

143
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,900
There's no personal privacy.

144

That's why so many problems occurred.

145

We'd better

stay away from Mu Tingzhou,

147

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,660
Most importantly,

176
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,060
he always sees his wife and kids

177
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:23,260
as the most valuable in his life.

178
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:25,780
Now my sister is going through things,

179
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,300
and my mom worries about her,

180
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,820
but he can't do anything about it.

181
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,100
Although he says it's okay

182
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,020
and keeps comforting us,

183
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,810
I know

184
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,300
he must be blaming himself in his heart.

185
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,980
Sorry, Qiao.

186
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,500
I apologize to your family

187
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:01,020
on behalf of me and Xu Lin.

188
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,090
Don't do that.

189
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,540
It's not your fault.

190
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,140
If there is someone to be blamed, it should be Mu Tingzhou.

191
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,740
He's the troublemaker.

192
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,660
Qiao,

193
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,900
actually,

194
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,780
before Ming Wei went to Tingzhou's home,

195
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,000
he already asked me

196
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,160
to let the police

197
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,260
free your father.

198
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,210
So even if Ming Wei hadn't come today,

199
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,220
your father would have been home soon.

200
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,500
And it was not Tingzhou who called the police,

201
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:31,980
it was Xu Lin.

202
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,140
Are you putting in a good word for him?

203
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,370
No, I'm not.

204
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,780
I'm only telling the truth.

205
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,530
Your sister is annoying.

206
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:46,820
It's none of her business.

207
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,500
Why would she stick her nose into it?

208
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,980
Yes, in terms of that,

209
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,340
I'll talk to her later.

210
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,620
But as to what happened,

211
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,430
if we change the perspective,

212
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,100
it might be a good thing.

213
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,180
You call this a good thing?

214
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,620
I know,

215
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,900
ever since Tingzhou recovered his memory,

216
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Ming Wei has been in low spirits

217
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,740
and hasn't walked out of it.

218
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,180
But although Tingzhou

219
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,900
took it a little too far,

220
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:18,500
it might make Ming Wei give up

221
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,580
and get over the breakup.

222
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,700
After all, Grand Tutor will never come back.

223
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,140
Maybe you're right.

224
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:37,420
Alright,

225
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,060
I will keep my eyes on Tingzhou and Xu Lin,

226
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,100
and Ming Wei will gradually get over it.

227
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,500
Everything will get better.

228
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,700
What are you looking at?

229
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,340
It's likely that my sister will never

230
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,660
meet Mu Zhouting again.

231
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,540
The Mus and the Mings

232
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,260
will live their lives separately,

233
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,950
and have no connections anymore.

234
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,660
It's freezing cold.

235
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,770
Why are you standing here?

236
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:33,090
I'd like to talk to you, bro.

237
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,380
Good. I'd also like to chat.

238
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,980
Why didn't you hold her back today?

239
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,210
Why did you have to call the police?

240
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,940
I knew you'd ask me that.

241
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,820
At the time, auntie fell on the ground.

242
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,060
She was in so much pain that she couldn't straighten her back.

243
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,450
Tingzhou was really angry.

244
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,130
I didn't know Ming Wei's dad,

245
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,500
he looked so fierce

246
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,940
as if he wanted to fight.

247
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,620
If I hadn't called the police,

248
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,650
who knows what would've happened next?

249
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,500
To prevent things from getting worse,

250
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,380
I called the police.

251
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,340
I knew you'd come up

252
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,220
with some reasons for this.

253
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:06,700
You don't have to agree with me,

254
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:07,570
but I have to say it.

255
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,610
It was Ming Wei's fault to

256
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,660
allow her father to come here

257
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:11,900
and cause a ruckus.

258
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,020
Does everything have to be solved

259
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:14,930
with a fight?

260
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,420
I just don't get it.

261
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,290
I can't understand your logic either.

262
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,500
Brother,

263
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,980
I'm your sister.

264
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,900
I'm your blood sister.

265
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,310
How could you say that about me?

266
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,630
Do you think I did that on purpose?

267
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,620
I think you're enchanted by Ming Qiao.

268
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,450
Everything you're saying

269
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,970
is leaning towards the Mings.

270
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,370
I don't get it.

271
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,180
You've had so many girlfriends.

272
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,150
Which one of them was no better than Ming Qiao?

273
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,720
What do you see in her?

274
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,260
Have you had too much Michelin,

275
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,610
that you're curious about roadside stalls now?

276
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,330
Xu Lin!

277
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,530
Try me one more time.

278
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,260
Mind your own business.

279
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,170
Don't stick your nose into my affairs.

280
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,540
I know,

281
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,940
ever since I returned,

282
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,740
you and Tingzhou have been unhappy with me.

283
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,140
We used to get along well.

284
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,660
We have so many good memories.

285
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,620
You and Tingzhou treated me

286
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:20,690
like your only blood sister.

287
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,460
You doted on me.

288
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,860
But why did everything change

289
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,180
after Ming Wei came?

290
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,540
I know

291
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:31,340
you'd think I'm being petty.

292
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,010
But

293
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,620
it's because I love Tingzhou too much,

294
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,490
so I don't want to lose him.

295
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,460
Brother,

296
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,180
don't blame me.

297
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,020
Alright, alright.

298
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,740
Alright, I got it.

299
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,420
Stop crying, stop crying.

300
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,820
Alright, you're a big girl now,

301
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,100
you shouldn't cry anymore.

302
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,020
It's cold, let's get inside.

303
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,180
Come in.

304
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,340
Let's go.

305
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,660
Grand Tutor.

306
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,570
I know you'd never come back.

307
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,460
And I know

308
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:50,700
Mu Tingzhou isn't you.

309
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:52,930
In the past,

310
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:55,060
I hoped that Mu Tingzhou

311
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,660
would remember something.

312
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,620
Now I realized

313
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,820
how ridiculous it was.

314
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
You are you.

315
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,170
How could you become replaced by someone else?

316
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,020
From now on,

317
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,300
I'd bury you in my heart forever.

318
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,500
I'd bid farewell to the past.

319
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,329
You are my personal, precious memory.

320
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,290
No one can take you away from me.

321
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,260
I'd listen to you,

322
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,859
like what you told me to,

323
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,260
live well

324
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,060
and stand up again.

325
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,530
You were looking for me?

326
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:08,820
What's up?

327
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,540
I know

328
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,740
I did wrong today.

329
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,820
I should have stopped Xu Lin.

330
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,410
But it had already happened.

331
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,540
How can I make it up for it?

332
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,020
I know

333
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,220
Ming Wei would feel insulted

334
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,900
by being offered compensations.

335
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,820
But I really cannot think of a better idea.

336
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,410
Brother,

337
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,940
you finally get it.

338
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,900
Ming Wei isn't someone

339
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,250
who can easily be bought over

340
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,980
or tempted by money.

341
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,910
Material compensation

342
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,890
would be an insult to her.

343
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,570
So what should I do?

344
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,740
Well, I think

one is that it is what the plot needed,

498

the other is that

499
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,620
you acknowledged the acting skills of your partner,

00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,100
This is pretty good.

517
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,100
I'd like to take this one.

518
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,940
No problem, I'll handle it.

[The Butterfly Lovers]

521
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,700
Ming Wei,

522
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,660
I have to tell you something.

523
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,140
What's up, Shen?

524
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,570
You look so serious.

525
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:50,170
Mu Tingzhou decided to act in The Butterfly Lovers.

526
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,220
Tingzhou.

527
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,980
I think

528
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,780
it's for the best if you don't take The Butterfly Lovers.

529
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,860
Why?

530
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,620
I only knew about this when I talked to the producer that

531
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,380
they chose Ming Wei as the leading lady.

532
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,700
You'd better drop it,

533
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,340
or it'll be awkward for both of you.

534
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:20,260
I'm an actor.

535
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,580
When I come across a good script,

536
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,740
I won't give it up

537
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,660
for my own reasons.

538
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,530
Right?

539
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:29,340
OK, it's you who insist on doing it.

540
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,780
But I'm not sure if Ming Wei will reject it

541
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:32,380
because of this.

542
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,140
If she is professional enough,

543
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,300
she won't give up a good script

544
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,250
just because of me.

545
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,300
Makes sense.

546
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,820
OK, keep on exercising.

547
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,220
Mu Tingzhou is working with my sister again?

548
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,740
Yes.

549
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,340
I don't know what he's thinking about.

550
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,620
But he's just an acting addict.

551
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,540
I think it's because

552
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,260
he really likes the script.

553
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,940
Can you talk him out of it?

554
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,420
I beg him to let go of my sister.

555
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:09,940
What's all this animosity?

556
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,690
I can't change his mind.

557
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,060
Once Mu Tingzhou makes a decision,

558
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:14,340
he won't change his mind for whatever it takes.

559
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,060
But can you try to talk to your sister?

560
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,659
Don't let Mu Tingzhou bother her.

561
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:25,300
She should keep on working,

562
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,460
and Mu Tingzhou

563
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,780
is just a normal colleague.

564
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:30,940
Why are you on Mu Tingzhou's side all the time?

565
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:31,980
I...

566
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,830
Why should my sister compromise all along?

567
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,340
Isn't she tired from work every day?

568
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,280
And she has to try and adjust her mood.

569
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,699
What's passed is past.

570
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,179
Can't they just carry on with peaceful lives?

571
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:42,139
I'm not taking Mu Tingzhou's side.

572
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,300
Don't be angry.

573
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,730
I just don't know what to do.

574
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:48,219
Why are we so involved

575
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,020
in their contradictions?

576
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:52,940
I'd say

577
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,300
they had a bad romantic relationship in the previous life.

578
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,139
That's why they are destined to be entangled in this life.

579
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,820
Don't be mad.

580
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,980
Come in.

581
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,300
What are you doing?

582
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,420
I'm reading a book. Why?

583
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,780
An Actor's Work.

584
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,140
Have you decided?

585
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:25,860
Will you take this show

586
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,380
or not?

587
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,580
I've made up my mind.

588
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,220
I won't take it.

589
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,260
If I have to work every day

590
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,740
with a man

591
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,820
who looks exactly like my boyfriend,

592
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,580
I can't control my feelings.

593
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,050
I don't want to give myself a hard time.

594
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,930
I can seek for a script more suitable for me.

595
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,300
Mu Tingzhou is such a jinx.

596
00:35:57,610 --> 00:35:58,740
Xiao Zhao is also useless.

597
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,660
He can't talk him out of it.

598
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,450
Don't be angry for this.

599
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:05,340
Mu Tingzhou has the right to choose.

600
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,300
I have no standing to complain.

601
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,300
Besides,

602
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,580
I don't want to affect your relationship with Xiao Zhao

603
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,420
because of our affair.

604
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,820
It's not worth it.

605
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,020
OK.

606
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,020
When you go on set this time,

607
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,420
I'll definitely go with you.

608
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,580
You still don't have an assistant.

609
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,300
I'll be your assistant this time.

610
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,130
Great.

611
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,980
As long as it won't affect your schoolwork,

612
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,490
of course I'm happy that

613
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,590
you can be my assistant.

614
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,520
Then lie down.

615
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:37,380
Let me show you

616
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,660
the superior service of a superior assistant.

617
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,620
Superior service?

618
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,660
Is it expensive?

619
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,620
Priceless.

620
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:49,980
By the way, Wei,

621
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,180
mom and dad said they're going to drop by in a few days.

622
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,660
They are worried that we eat take-out food all day,

623
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,690
and want to cook for us.

624
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,620
Great.

625
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,860
If I don't take The Butterfly Lovers,

626
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,220
I'll have enough time to spend with them.

627
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:04,340
It's good.

628
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,500
Come on.

629
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,380
Close your eyes.

630
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,020
I'm so sorry, Mr. Liu.

631
00:37:17,250 --> 00:37:18,140
We've considered it carefully,

632
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,340
and decided that Ming Wei won't take

633
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,850
the role of leading woman in The Butterfly Lovers.

634
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,300
This is our problem.

635
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,660
If there's a penalty needed,

636
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,340
we'll pay it according to the contract.

637
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,740
I'm sorry, Shen.

638
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,260
It's OK.

639
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,100
You don't have to pay the penalty.

640
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,700
Just now, Mu Tingzhou

641
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,860
had Xiao Zhao inform me that

642
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,980
if Ming Wei quits,

643
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:42,340
they'll pay the penalty

644
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,740
for Ming Wei any time.

645
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,500
So

646
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:47,060
you don't need to worry about this.

647
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,620
It's not OK.

648
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,310
It's my own problem.

649
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,840
The consequences

650
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,620
should be taken by myself.

651
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,460
It shouldn't be others' burden.

652
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,300
Mr. Liu,

653
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,260
please inform Mr. Mu that

654
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,380
we've accepted his kind gesture.

655
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,260
But as for the money,

656
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,700
I'll pay it myself.

657
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,300
Yes.

658
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,380
OK, got it.

659
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,580
Unsurprisingly,

660
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,860
Ming Wei refused to act in The Butterfly Lovers.

661
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,180
Also, she refused to take

662
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
your offer to pay her penalty.

663
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:43,060
She also asked the producer to convey her gratitude.

664
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,020
It's such a mess.

665
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,900
I think

666
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,300
Ming Wei's heart was completely broken by the past things,

667
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,740
that she's willing to give up

668
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,340
on such a good script.

669
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,060
Mr. Mu.

670
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,530
What do you want me for?

671
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,450
It's about the penalty.

672
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,410
I guessed that

673
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,340
the reason why you won't take it

674
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,170
is because of me.

675
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,540
That's why,

676
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,500
since I liked this show

677
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,490
and insisted on taking it,

678
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,860
I felt that I need to share some responsibilities

679
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,460
on your rejection.

680
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:10,740
You haven't been in industry for long.

681
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,420
The penalty

682
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,730
must be a large number for you.

683
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,380
So I want to help as I can,

684
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,260
to pay the penalty for you.

685
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,660
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

686
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:27,580
I am very touched

687
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,060
that you consider so much for me.

688
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,540
But

689
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,820
it is my choice

690
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,260
not to take this script.

691
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,850
It is not your problem.

692
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,540
If you pay it for me,

693
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,780
I will be restless.

694
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:45,100
I'll pay it myself.

695
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,460
In the future,

696
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:01,410
will you stick to the acting industry?

697
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,220
Or do you want to experience life

698
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,580
and go back to being an interpreter?

699
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,450
Of course acting.

700
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,500
Actually, I've also thought about

701
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,420
this question before.

702
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,690
The longer I work in this industry,

703
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,900
the more

704
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:24,580
fun and fulfillment I can achieve from it.

705
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,420
I've truly fallen in love with acting.

706
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:28,860
So,

707
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:30,980
I'll keep on doing it.

708
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,250
Now that you've chosen to continue

709
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,930
and be a professional actor,

710
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,250
don't you think that what you did today

711
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,880
is very unprofessional?
