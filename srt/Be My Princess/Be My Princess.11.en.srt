00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
I ask that Mr. Chen

178
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,870
you should keep distance from Her Highness

179
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,260
both on set and off set.

180
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:30,660
Grand Tutor.

181
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,070
Do you mind?

182
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,620
I...

183
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,700
Let's go together then.

184
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,700
We can practice our lines on the way.

185
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,260
I'd take my leave.

186
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,100
[Changde Lane]

187
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,620
Brother,

188
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,260
you are making me dizzy.

189
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,500
Why don't you close your eyes?

190
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,060
What do you want?

191
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,180
I should be asking you that.

192
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,120
You're walking back and forth in front of me.

193
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,240
What are you doing?

194
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,260
I'm looking for Ming Wei, to practice our lines.

195
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,700
That's our job as actors.

196
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,380
Mr. Mu, you used to be an actor too.

197
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,980
I'm sure you can understand.

198
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,210
Of course I can,

199
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,240
I support Her Highness

200
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,910
and I support your work.

201
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,860
But Her Highness is resting,

202
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,500
so it's inconvenient for me to get her.

203
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
If you wait here,

204
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,760
you will be wasting your time.

205
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,830
That's fine, I can wait for a while.

206
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,160
You are always having to wait here for Her Highness,

207
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,220
I feel bad about that.

208
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,580
Why don't

209
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,240
I practice the lines with you?

210
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,700
It's alright.

211
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,500
How could I trouble you with that?

212
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,700
I will memorize my lines on my own first.

213
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,060
Don't stand on ceremony.

214
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,580
Mr. Mu,

215
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,980
this isn't very appropriate.

216
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,510
How is this inappropriate?

217
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,590
I am doing this out of goodwill.

218
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:03,900
You really don't have to.

219
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,570
Come, come.

220
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,140
Really.

221
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,980
Mr. Mu, I can do it myself.

222
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,820
Come.

223
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,500
279.

224
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,650
Aren't you just a driver?

225
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,100
All you have is this shabby rickshaw.

226
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,160
You have no status.

227
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,580
How dare you behave in such a presumptuous manner?

228
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,860
Bitch,

229
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,260
I may be shabby now,

230
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,220
but I have courage and charisma.

231
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,280
One day, I might just change my fortune and get rich.

232
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,980
You are just a stupid, boorish fellow,

233
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,640
yet you still sing your own praises, of your courage and charisma.

234
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,220
You are pretty as a flower,

235
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,680
yet you speak harshly.

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,800
But I just love

237
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,100
your smart mouth.

238
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,660
Just wait,

239
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,330
one day you will be crying and screaming

240
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,640
to be married to me.

241
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,300
That's a bold statement.

242
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,820
Aren't you afraid of spraining your tongue?

243
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,810
Come back again

244
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,430
when you can afford

245
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,339
an imported car.

246
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,540
I thought you would have higher standards.

247
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,099
But it seems that an imported car

248
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,849
would be enough to impress you.

249
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,180
An imported car

250
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
would just give you an edge with me.

251
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,270
If you want to impress me,

252
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,750
you might have to wait till your next life,

253
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,190
when you are born again.

254
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,780
That's the end of it.

255
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,840
Your Royal Highness did pretty well.

256
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,900
Are you satisfied?

257
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,540
Who's that?

258
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:06,660
Tingzhou.

259
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:07,940
What's up?

260
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,020
This...

261
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,080
What time are you leaving?

262
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,220
Today? Eight.

263
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,230
Mr. Chen, Miss Ming, your scripts.

264
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,250
Thank you.

265
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,060
What's going on.

266
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,180
Why did they change so many scenes?

267
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:32,710
Exactly.

268
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,780
Didn't they say the script had been confirmed?

269
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,100
I'm not sure, the director asked to change these.

270
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,030
We had to work overtime last night.

271
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:38,980
-OK. Thank you. -I will leave you to it.

272
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,490
Sure.

273
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,580
Thank you.

274
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,140
Why...why have all my scenes been changed?

275
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,180
And my lines have changed so much. Look.

276
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,040
This scene has two pages of lines.

277
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,060
Mine didn't change much.

278
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,580
I have been memorizing my lines for days.

279
00:18:58,580 --> 00:18:59,980
Now it's all for nothing.

280
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,700
I took a look,

281
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:10,290
it has indeed become more exciting after the changes.

282
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,140
It seems like this director is quite talented after all.

283
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,340
Let's put in our best,

284
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,880
for the sake of a good show.

285
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,040
Alright.

286
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,180
Like this.

287
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,440
Mr. Chen, new scripts.

288
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,380
We are changing the scenes?

289
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,900
Why are there new scripts again.

290
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,630
I'm sorry, I don't know either.

291
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:17,810
[Shopping page]

292
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,910
You won the lottery?

293
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,030
Would I, the Chief Cabinet Minister of the Ning Dynasty,

294
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,230
need to get rich by winning the lottery?

295
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,930
Then you must have learnt the secret of the universe

296
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,300
and found a way back to the Ning Dynasty.

297
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:42,580
If I knew that,

298
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,620
would have brought Her Highness back with me long ago.

299
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,460
You know,

300
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,940
this Mu Tingzhou's title of Best Actor,

301
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,220
is really something.

302
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,760
You... what did you do?

303
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,020
You really see Mu Tingzhou as your blood brother.

304
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,420
I just mentioned him and you got so nervous.

305
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,270
Say it quickly, what did you do?

306
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:04,810
I just

307
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:06,780
helped the director to analyze the plots of the South City

308
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,700
as Best Actor.

309
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,010
He thinks what I said make sense.

310
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:11,860
Make sense.

311
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,100
What is it?

312
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,280
He would let you to rewrite the plots?

313
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,800
Why would director let you to revise the script?

314
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,140
I, the Grand Tutor with sophisticated literary grace.

315
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,770
The director would be delighted to receive

316
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,210
my constructive comments.

317
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:31,740
And he is willing to revise the script overnight.

318
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:33,780
I am not the one who is asking him to do so.

319
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,620
Good for you.

320
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,620
I have read

321
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,540
all the novels and plays which write about the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister.

322
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,420
They all say that I would fall in love with Her Highness,

323
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,440
[Grand Chief Cabinet Minister]

324
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,890
but she would marry Pingxi Royal Highness.

325
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,100
Those are made up and

326
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,900
lack of responsibilities.

327
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,420
His Royal Highness who is suffered from memory loss

328
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,300
has zero contribution to my plan of

329
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,700
protecting Her Highness and returning to the Ning Dynasty.

330
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,560
Nevertheless,

331
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,380
he is covetous on Her Highness and act recklessly,

332
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,780
I have to finish him off.

333
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,590
It sounds nicer than it is.

334
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,860
You know well enough what

335
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,020
is going on.

336
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,740
Of course I know.

337
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:03,740
You know it?

338
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,530
Do you know that

339
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,340
you are being jealous?

340
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,690
You are getting back at Chen Zhang because you are jealous of him.

341
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,270
It is all because

342
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,470
you fell for Her Highness.

343
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,410
These are groundless accusations and sheer nonsense.

344
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,610
This is pure slander.

345
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,620
I would not forgive you

346
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,550
if I hear these groundless statements next time.

347
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,870
Please leave.

348
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,170
I am entrusted by the late emperor

349
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,340
to guide Her Highness and crown prince.

350
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,740
I cannot transgress the bounds of decency.

351
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,140
She is Her Highness,

352
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,740
and I am only her Grand Tutor.

353
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:45,300
I am going to leave.

354
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:45,820
Good-bye, Madam.

355
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,680
Good-bye, bye.

356
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,100
Ming Qiao.

357
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,110
Are you alright, Ming Qiao?

358
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:51,980
You asked me to come over,

359
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,370
is it because that guy has harassed you again?

360
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,660
No, I am fine.

361
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:57,660
Xiao Zhao,

362
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,200
why don't you come to see me recently?

363
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,500
I...

364
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:03,950
I have been busy.

365
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,940
I am not disturbing you, am I?

366
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,820
No, no, no.

367
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,840
So why did you call me here?

368
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
Just to repay your kindnesses to me.

369
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:23,860
Is it the payback you mentioned?

370
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,140
Correct.

371
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,700
See, you have helped me that much.

372
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
I have been thinking how to pay back.

373
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:32,740
It came to my mind that I can offer a yoga class.

374
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,830
Personal training is very costly.

375
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,610
No, no.

376
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,460
I am too clumsy to do this.

377
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,270
Furthermore, I don't need you to pay back.

378
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,140
So....

379
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,860
if I would be bullied

380
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:48,940
or my house would be robbed ever again,

381
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,220
I am afraid I cannot bring troubles to you.

382
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,100
After all,

383
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,190
I don't like to owe anybody.

384
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,060
But...

385
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,080
But I did not bring suitable clothes.

386
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,630
I have prepared for you.

387
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,270
You are here.

388
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,700
Try it, it is just a couple of movements.

389
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,030
I am going to let it pass.

390
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,140
This is not a payback.

391
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,290
You are here to get back at me.

392
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,290
It's very simple.

393
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,190
I am telling you, Xiao Zhao.

394
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,420
You have too little stretch so that

395
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,360
you are clumsy.

396
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,660
According to researchers' study,

397
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,500
ten years of life extension is followed by one inch strengthening of tendon.

398
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,580
Let me show you.

399
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,150
You need to find a central point first.

400
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,100
It's simple, isn't it?

401
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,160
Look, does it look like drawing a bow?

402
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,260
You would look like Hou Yi when you do this.

403
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,660
For real, very handsome.

404
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,860
I... Can I do it?

405
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:05,180
Of course you can, it is very easy.

406
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:05,940
Try it!

407
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,980
Alright.

408
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,160
Find the central point first.

409
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,220
Right.

410
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,260
Face the part between the thumb and index down, and push the hammock aside.

411
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,820
Right.

412
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,180
Move your left foot up, go up.

413
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:19,900
Is it correct?

414
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,540
Step on it, right.

415
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,870
Move your knee forward,

416
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,700
and move your hand a little bit up.

417
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,380
More up.

418
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,160
More up.

419
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,080
Up to grab here.

420
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,020
More up.

421
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,310
Alright.

422
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,660
Right.

423
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,620
Pull your dorsal muscles.

424
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,780
Go up.

425
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:35,980
Up?

426
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,020
I cannot help you here.

427
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,620
You need to go up by yourself.

428
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,260
You went up too hard.

429
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,060
You would make it swing this way.

430
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:44,290
Go gently, slow down.

431
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:03,700
Xiao Zhao,

432
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,380
what is wrong?

433
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,500
Your sister,

434
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:09,420
good for her.

435
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,540
Ming Qiao?

436
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,500
She hit you?

437
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:15,500
Hit me?

438
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,340
It is more sour than being hit.

439
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,290
What did you do to her?

440
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,620
Did two of you...?

441
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,580
Don't take it to the wrong way,

442
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,040
it is not what you thought.

443
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,520
Ming Qiao gave me a lesson of aerial yoga.

444
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,140
You know I am clumsy,

445
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,000
it gave me so much pain after that.

446
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,100
I have misunderstood.

447
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,900
It's alright.

448
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,500
Get down to business.

449
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,220
It's going to be the shooting of kissing scene tonight,

450
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,010
I bet

451
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,110
Grand Tutor would not let you do it.

452
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,380
But, the plots need it.

453
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,350
It is work and

454
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:51,220
I cannot say no to it.

455
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,300
I have an idea.

456
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,890
Great.

457
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:15,840
Your Highness,

458
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,020
you call it a day early today.

459
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,500
How about we go have a facial treatment,

460
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,500
a whole body care,

461
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,210
then we will dine at the restaurant you like.

462
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,940
Sounds good?

463
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,750
Grand Tutor,

464
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,780
I am tired and sleepy.

465
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,530
I want to go to bed early.

466
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,610
Then, Your Highness, please have a good rest.

467
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,290
Call me for anything.

468
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,210
It is not for me, is it?

469
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,220
Damn.

470
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,170
Your Highness,

471
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,230
you haven't had dinner yet,

472
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,580
have some milk first,

473
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,880
otherwise you would feel hungry later at night.

474
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,640
Your Highness.

475
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,460
Her Highness is taking a shower,

476
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:45,850
or is sleeping now.

477
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,090
You better stop knocking.

478
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:49,380
It's not cool if you disturb Her Highness.

479
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,100
Let's go.

480
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,160
I'm a little hungry by the way.

481
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:58,780
How about giving it to me?

482
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:04,970
Thank you.

483
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:16,700
Thanks.

484
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,140
Hurry up with the adjustment.

485
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,620
Come here, quickly.

486
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,420
Don't set it up so high. Move down a little bit.

487
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,460
The next scene

488
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:35,380
is about Gao Changsheng going north to do business.

489
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:39,380
Before he leaves, he asks Yu Wanyin

490
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,660
to meet him.

491
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,700
Yu Wanyin detests him,

492
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,220
but deep inside,

493
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,290
she has developed some feelings for him.

494
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,100
So she decides to go and meet him.

495
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,110
What kind of man is Gao Changsheng?

496
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,330
He is a rough guy

497
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,050
who does whatever he wants.

498
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,300
Right after Yu Wanyin arrives,

499
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,630
he pushes her against the wall and kisses her passionately.

500
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,700
Okay. Now you go get ready.

501
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,420
Alright?

502
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:11,780
Okay.

503
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:12,860
Sure.

504
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,160
-Thank you, Director. -Sure.

505
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,100
Are you nervous?

506
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:23,940
A little.

507
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,790
What are you looking at?

508
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,430
Don't worry.

509
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,060
I have brushed my teeth twice today,

510
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,260
and chewed five gums.

511
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,360
Now my mouth tastes sweet.

512
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,300
Sorry,

513
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,060
I didn't prepare anything.

514
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:42,660
It's okay.

515
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,690
Whatever you do is fine by me.

516
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:52,710
Don't mention death all the time.

517
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,140
You wouldn't want me to die, would you?

518
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:02,280
What are you doing?

519
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,940
He is about to kiss her.

520
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,139
It's about to happen.

521
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:10,900
It's happening.

522
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,460
What... What's wrong?

523
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,260
Go!  Go and check what's going on?

524
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,560
What's wrong with you?

525
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,320
I'm sorry, Mr. Gao.

526
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,949
Sorry for causing so much trouble.

527
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,000
I have thought about it but

528
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,550
I need to clear things up with Mr. Mu first.

529
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:01,780
So I'm afraid

530
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,700
that I can't finish this scene today.

531
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,430
But I promise

532
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,370
I will finish my work as soon as possible,

533
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,100
including this kissing scene.

534
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:12,900
Well, let's postpone the kissing scene

535
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,980
then.

536
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,860
You go talk to Tingzhou.

537
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,740
Okay. Thank you, director.

538
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,420
No problem.

539
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:19,420
Thanks again.

540
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,390
Sure.

541
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,220
Did you get hurt?

542
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,590
No, I'm fine.

543
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,230
I just worry about you more.

544
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:33,860
Mu Tingzhou is the best actor

545
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,260
and you are only a newbie.

546
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,500
If your work is compromised because of him,

547
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,380
it could bring you bad reputations

548
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,660
If he denies everything that happened between you

549
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:42,140
when he got his memories back.

550
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,690
What are you going to do then?

551
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,460
I believe

552
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,430
that Mr. Mu is not like that.

553
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:48,900
Alright.

554
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,370
I'm just worrying about you.

555
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,140
Remember,

556
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,980
no matter what happens,

557
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,500
don't make yourself suffer for anybody else.

558
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,300
I will always stand by your side.

559
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,260
Thank you.

560
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,780
I will handle this properly.

561
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,120
Your Highness,

562
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,380
let's go.

563
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,910
Let me change my clothes first.

564
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,620
You changed sides at the last minute,

565
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,150
why did you do that tonight?

566
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,740
It's my fault.

567
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:55,900
But Grand Tutor is extremely smart.

568
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,260
How could this little trick of mine

569
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,120
get him fooled?

570
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,440
He would see me through immediately.

571
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,340
Grand Tutor,

572
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,820
I... The reason I did this

573
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,180
is to not let you get upset

574
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,250
or make you worry.

575
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,360
So the way that Your Highness ease my worries

576
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:19,860
is to lie to me?

577
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,660
No. No. No.

578
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:22,740
Grand Tutor.

579
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,600
I didn't mean to lie to you.

580
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,110
It was a tough situation for me.

581
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,520
Gran Tutor on one side,

582
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,180
the director on the other side.

583
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,340
I can not do anything

584
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,500
but take full responsibility.

585
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,140
Your Highness, It seems that you

586
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,200
still don't regard me as your person.

587
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,180
You would rather take all the pressure yourself

588
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,740
than asking for my help.

589
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:41,860
Grand Tutor,

590
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,420
you have misunderstood what I've said.

591
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,620
I didn't do anything wrong.

592
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,180
Why would I admit it?

593
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,140
It is my fault.

594
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,460
It's me being annoying to You Highness.

595
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,460
And it's me who failed at looking after Your Highness.

596
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,270
Grand Tutor.

597
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,190
Are you okay, Grand Tutor?

598
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,100
Grand Tutor!

599
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,540
Grand Tutor!

600
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,650
Xiao Zhao, I feel so cold.

601
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:06,680
I feel sick.

602
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,540
Grand Tutor! Grand Tutor!

603
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,580
Let's go to the hospital.

604
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,420
Xiao Zhao, drive to the hospital. Hurry!

605
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:12,220
I'm not going.

606
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,060
Fallen leaves return to the roots.

607
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,520
I would rather die at home.

608
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:17,860
Something terrible could happen if you don't go, Grand Tutor.

609
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,780
Your Highness, if you still would listen to me,

610
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,440
don't send me to the hospital.

611
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,780
Okay, fine. Then...

612
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,290
Xiao Zhao, let's go home.

613
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,660
Drive back home.

614
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,660
Xiao Zhao, hurry!

615
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,660
Okay. Okay. Driving back now.

616
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,120
Grand Tutor, are you okay?

617
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,020
Grand Tutor.

618
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,660
Grand Tutor, are you alright?

619
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,860
Why is this happening?

620
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,590
Grand Tutor.

621
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:41,100
How could someone be this shameless?

622
00:38:56,980 --> 00:38:57,860
I can't take it.

623
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,920
I feel so terrible.

624
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,390
Grand Tutor, hang in there.

625
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,630
Grand Tutor.

626
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,060
I have got a ice-cold pad for you,

627
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,660
it will make you feel better.

628
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,980
Don't bother taking care of me, Your Highness.

629
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,260
I don't deserve it.

630
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,580
Grand Tutor,

631
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,740
what exactly do you want me to do,

632
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,210
so you can cool down?

633
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:41,620
Tell me,

634
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,500
and I promise I will do it.

635
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,480
Please don't lie to me again, Your Highness.

636
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,060
And don't ever do that kind of scene.

637
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,220
Promise me.

638
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:56,990
Grand Tutor,

639
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,380
I will never lie to you again.

640
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,380
But

641
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,380
I can't promise you I won't

642
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,590
do any intimate scenes.

643
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:12,460
I guess when you were the actor Mu Tingzhou,

644
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:15,260
you would'n not make that kind of promise, either.

645
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,060
I am an actress

646
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,780
and this is my job.

647
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:23,390
What Your Highness said

648
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,190
meant no difference from asking me to die.

649
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,370
I have failed to look after Your Highness.

650
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:30,700
I'm unworthy of the late Emperor's trust.

651
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,620
I shall die to offer my apology.

652
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,140
This old life of mine

653
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:36,840
will only be Your Highness's burden.

654
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,870
Grand Tutor.

655
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:38,820
-Grand Tutor. -Don't stop me.

656
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,500
Calm down.

657
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,130
Let me go.

658
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:41,220
Grand Tutor, if you die,

659
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,380
what will happen to the Ning Dynasty?

660
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,180
Don't stop me.

661
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,540
How could you do this?

662
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,700
Let me die.

663
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,450
Grand Tutor.

664
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:47,100
Don't stop me.

665
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:47,830
Grand Tutor.

666
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,580
Oh my God! Oh my mother earth!

667
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:54,060
Help me!

668
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:08,980
Grand Tutor.

669
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:18,350
Grand Tutor.

670
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,240
Bread is the staff of life.

671
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,420
One must eat in order to survive.

672
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,860
You haven't eaten anything since last night.

673
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,920
You must be hungry.

674
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,450
How about you open the door?

675
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:31,180
I have made breakfast for you.

676
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,420
Although

677
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,300
my cooking is not great.

678
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,140
But

679
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,640
it shows my sincerity.

680
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,180
Your Highness haven't agreed my request.

681
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,110
So I have decided

682
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,910
to continue the hunger strike.

683
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,830
Let my death honor my beliefs.

684
00:41:46,730 --> 00:41:47,460
Grand Tutor,

685
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,440
I found that you've become so unreasonable.

686
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,820
It's not a day or two since

687
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,420
you have come to the modern world.

688
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,080
You've watched many TV shows.

689
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:57,340
Why wouldn't you accept

690
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,130
a professional actor doing kissing scenes?

691
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,420
Other actors can do that, but Your Highness can not.

692
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,750
Your Highness is noble,

693
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,810
no one is allowed to tarnish her status.

694
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:07,180
Grand Tutor, you are taking it way too seriously.

695
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,980
Nothing is tarnished.

696
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,140
Grand Tutor.

697
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,220
As the Princess, it's an order

698
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,150
to eat right now.

699
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,300
You will disobey my order if you don't eat.
