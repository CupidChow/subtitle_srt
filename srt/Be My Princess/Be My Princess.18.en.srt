No way,

175
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,820
I have to figure it out today.

176
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,780
Sir.

177
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:43,820
Sir,

178
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,700
Miss Ming is here.

179
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,700
It's Miss Ming Qiao.

180
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:18,900
Mr. Mu,

181
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,300
can you please help me to contact Xiao Zhao?

182
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,300
He's not answering my call,

183
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,580
or texting me back.

184
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,180
I thought he would hide here.

185
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,940
You came here for him?

186
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,050
Or?

187
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,020
Mr. Mu thought

188
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,980
I came here for my sister.

189
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:47,140
My sister is surely in a bad mood.

190
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:47,780
But,

191
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,620
I will not save this relationship

192
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,890
on her behalf.

193
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,180
Nothing has changed my feelings for Her Highness.

194
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,510
So why did you let her go?

195
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,340
Since you love each other,

196
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,500
why would you stay at your own homes

197
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,300
and waste your lives in sadness?

198
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,860
Mr. Mu,

199
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,000
I think you have a chance.

200
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,430
Call him using my phone,

201
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,579
he will pick up.

202
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,260
Thank you.

203
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,340
Thanks.

Fifteen, eight, ten, fifteen.

205
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,220
You drink, you drink.

206
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,480
Alright, I will drink.

207
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,150
Don't say no, do it quickly.

208
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,260
Drink it fast!

209
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,540
Come, come!

210
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,150
There is another shot here.

211
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,740
Let me drink.

212
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,780
I am a woman who respects what she has seen

213
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,020
and felt.

214
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,370
Maybe the right one is

215
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,410
next to you.

216
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,740
So, you should seize

217
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,690
the moment,

218
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,140
and not settle for less.

219
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,180
Xiao Zhao,

220
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,500
you are the best in my heart.

221
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,420
I want to be your girlfriend.

I am very busy now.

228
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,300
Could you please stop hiding from me?

229
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,360
Running away won't change anything.

230
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,700
Sorry, Ming Qiao.

231
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,610
I thought I have already made myself clear.

232
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:54,670
What's the reason?

233
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,460
I need a reason.

234
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,260
Why don't you like me?

235
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,300
Because you are not my type.

I like the feeling of freshness.

this ungrateful bastard.

He promised me to

252

treat you well for his whole life.

253
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,140
He was just acting!

He was so good at it!

00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:31,330
No way, I need to find him now

256

and make him pay.

No,

258
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,100
he did not lie.

259

Well...

260
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
he did not do anything wrong either,

521
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,530
Hello.

522
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,820
The number you dial is busy,

523
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,370
please try later.

524
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,340
I am wondering

525
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,280
why are you calling me?

526
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,580
Wei, I don't have anything special to say.

527
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,700
It's just we haven't contacted each other for a while.

528
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,740
I miss you.

529
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,460
I don't know how I am capable

530
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,140
for Mr. Cheng to miss me so much.

531
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,730
Wei.

532
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,300
Do you know?

533
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,300
In my heart,

534
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,400
there is only one person, and that person is you.

535
00:41:59,410 --> 00:42:00,220
I know.

536
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,420
Now Mu Tingzhou doesn't need you.

537
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,700
But I need you.

538
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,740
Come back Wei.

539
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,460
You really make me sick.

540
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,030
Neither stick nor carrot works on you.

541
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,760
Ming Wei, let's just wait and see.

542
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:49,260
I have nothing to tell you.

543
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,920
Don't call me again, will you?

544
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,500
I

545
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,690
just want to say happy new year to Your Highness.
