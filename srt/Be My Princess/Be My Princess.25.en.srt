But she did not allow me to.

while I lost my memory?

I kneeled on the floor and asked for forgiveness.

25

Even if you don't, I know that

53

it's because of the grudge between you elders

I'm afraid you really aren't my type.

Is there something wrong with your brain?

90
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,380
Are you down with an incurable illness,

91
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,180
and you don't want to drag me down

92
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,440
so you are saying this?

93
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,060
Ming Qiao, have you watched too many TV shows?

94
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,790
I don't have any other reasons.

95

These are my honest thoughts.

96
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,430
That's impossible.

97
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:54,050
You went to see my parents with me just a few days ago.

98
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,380
You said you wanted to be with me properly.

99
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,690
If that's not what you want,

100
00:07:58,690 --> 00:07:59,780
why did you do that?

101
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,460
That's because I really wanted

102
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,180
to try to be good to you.

103
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,220
But after I tried, I realized

104
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,780
that I couldn't do it.

105
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,260
So, I don't want to fake it anymore.

106
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,220
Is it because of

107
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,980
the issues between our parents?

108
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,240
Uncle doesn't really like me.

109
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,780
He doesn't approve of us together.

110
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,900
So... so

111
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,669
because of that...

112
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,340
you are...

113
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,179
you said that to me, right?

114
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,059
Stop, stop.

Ming Qiao.

116
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,910
I realize you really don't understand me.

117
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,780
Am I someone who would be controlled by my parents?

118
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,140
If I were so obedient,

119
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,090
I wouldn't have changed my name to become an entertainment agent,

120
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,420
instead of taking over my dad's business,

121
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,580
right?

122
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:09,060

Wei.

132

I broke up.

133

Xiao Zhao broke up with me.

134
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,900
Did this just happen?

135
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,620
What? All of a sudden?

136
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,700
Didn't you guys just meet each other's parents a few days ago?

137
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,600
Did he really say this?

138
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,220
Don't be anxious.

139
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,300
I will call him.

140
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,140
The moment I came in,

141
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,220
I saw him sitting there with a girl.

142
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,860
And then he told me that we should break up right there.

143
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,300
Qiao.

144
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,340
Don't cry.

145
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,220
I will be here with you.

146
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,460
Don't cry.

147
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:08,940
Qiao.

148
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,830
Take a rest, stop cleaning.

149
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,020
I am fine, I am not tired, Wei.

150
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:16,140
I want to clean the room for you as soon as possible

151
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,400
and then clean my room,

152
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,620
so you can rest early.

153
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,860
Qiao, during this period,

154
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,230
you might bump into Xiao Zhao frequently.

155
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,160
Is that alright?

156
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,360
If you feel unhappy, just tell me.

157
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,860
I am totally fine.

158
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,220
There's nothing for me to be unhappy about.

159
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,550
It is his loss to lose me.

160
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:36,540
I am so young and beautiful

161
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,540
and full of positive energy, right?

162
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,400
Why would I lack pursuers?

163
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,370
Try this.

164
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,280
I will look at the other stuff over there.

165
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,740
Tell me.

166
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,840
It's quite simple.

167
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,260
It is just that

168
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,140
I broke up with Ming Qiao.

169
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,850
Turns out it was you

170
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:20,110
who caused me to be hated by the actress in my crew.

171
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,940
Could you please say things based on your conscience?

172
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,670
How can you be so confident that

173
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,340
it was me who caused Ming Wei to ignore you.

174
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,260
Definitely.

175
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,100
I have recovered my relationship with Ming Wei quite a lot earlier.

176
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,180
Now at least she won't treat me like I'm invisible.

177
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,300
Let me ask you.

178
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,060
Why did you break up with her?

179
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,980
We are not suitable so we broke up.

180
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,210
There are not so many reasons.

181
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,340
No other reason?

182
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,180
Rest assured, no other reason.

183
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,540
Wei, let's go.

184
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,560
Why are you hiding?

185
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,340
It is him who said that you should break up,

186
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,580
so it is him who has to feel embarrassed.

187
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,660
Why are you hiding?

188
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,940
I am not hiding, I just

189
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,850
don't want to see him.

190
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,110
I am full, I want to go out for a walk.

191
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,580
Wei, I will leave now.

192
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,020
Qiao.

193
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,600
What's Xiao Zhao's attitude?

194
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,890
He doesn't care about Ming Qiao's feelings at all.

195
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,020
He is way out of line.

196
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,860
Ming Wei,

197
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:26,260
don't you think the break up between Xiao Zhao and Ming Qiao

198
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,390
is a little strange?

199
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,780
According to my understanding of Xiao Zhao,

200
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,980
although he is quite sloppy in his life,

201
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,070
he is definitely not someone irresponsible.

202
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,340
I don't hope he is someone like this either.

203
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,460
But the facts are clear.

204
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,940
Maybe there is something

205
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,220
that we don't know about.

206
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,370
Maybe something happened

207
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,900
which led to misunderstanding between them.

208
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:50,920
You don't want to see Ming Qiao unhappy all the time either, right?

209
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,280
Does Mr. Mu have any insights?

210
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,580
How about

211
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,130
let's sit down and talk about it?

212
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,580
First I want to say the relationship between us

213
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,240
can't be so stiff all the time.

214
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,610
We have to cooperate in the future.

215
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,420
So,

216
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:27,130
we need to be more professional.

217
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,340
You are right.

218
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:33,050
I will adjust my mood.

219
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,590
And won't let my emotions affect my work.

220
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,140
To help us communicate.

221
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,500
So what should we do?

222
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,540
I haven't been in a relationship before,

223
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,000
so I don't know how to bring people together.

224
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,170
You had a relationship with the Grand Tutor, right?

225
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,970
Do you have any

226
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,020
tricks to intensify

227
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,540
their relationship?

228
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:29,410
No comment.

229
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,860
No comment?

230
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,490
[I only want to be with you for the rest of my life.]

231
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:47,270
[Close interaction and the feeling of soul-piercing]

232
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:59,070
[A Record of the Strange World]

233
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,140
What does this "soul-piercing"

234
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,460
mean?

235
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,180
How can I figure out which stage

236
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,060
the Grand Tutor and Ming Wei progressed to?

237
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:18,060
What are you looking at, sad face?

238
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,620
Give it back to me, don't spoil it.

239
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,420
What's this?

240
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,990
It's written on the front page.

241
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,310
This is the dairy you wrote when you lost your memory.

242
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,740
You pay so much attention to Ming Wei recently.

243
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,270
Is it because of this diary?

244
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,540
I have to admit

245
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,820
when I found out Ming Wei was going to be the female lead of The Butterfly Lovers

246
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,420
I insisted on taking the show

247
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,460
with some selfish intentions.

248
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,200
I have too many things waiting to be figured out.

249
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,050
Let me ask you this.

250
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,780
When I was the Grand Tutor and was having a relationship with Ming Wei.

251
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,100
What happened?

252
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,060
Which stage were we in?

253
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,270
Don't you know about them?

254
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,030
You almost get married.

255
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,640
I am not asking about that.

256
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,100
I am asking about other parts.

257
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:14,820
Other parts.

258
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,200
You know something, don't you?

259
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:26,600
How would I know about your private life?

260
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,460
I can tell you,

261
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:31,510
if anything really happened,

262
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,860
I will not ignore it.

263
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
I have to be responsible to Ming Wei.

264
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,420
You...

265
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,360
How can you be so self-righteous?

266
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Ming Wei is an independent girl.

267
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,020
She relies on herself to get out of trouble

268
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,180
and now lives well.

269
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,750
She only needs to be responsible for herself.

270
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,550
If you simply want to

271
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,380
be responsible or compensate her.

272
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,180
Just stop it.

273
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,780
Don't hurt her again.

274
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,940
Why are you supporting Ming Wei?

275
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,420
Whose entertainment agent are you?

276
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,980
It has nothing to do with whose entertainment agent I am.

277
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:02,020
Girls need to be taken care of.

278
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:03,580
Taken care of.

279
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,960
Then what about Ming Qiao?

280
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,870
You wanted to see me?

281
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,430
To be honest,I shouldn't say anything

282
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,060
about your relationship with Ming Qiao.

283
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,140
But your action has

284
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,140
hurt her.

285
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,630
And I can't let it go.

286
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,100
Just tell me the truth.

287
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,660
What happened between you guys?

288
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:58,380
Could Ming Qiao be that child?

289
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,100
No, no.

290
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,250
What is not right?

291
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,730
Ming Qiao has an older sister,

292
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:06,240
whose name is Ming Wei.

293
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,580
Is Ming Wei my father's child?

294
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,780
Does it matter if she is his child or not?

295
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,420
Ming Wei will always be a child of our Ming family.

296
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:22,460
She has no relations with the Xu family.

297
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,660
Is Ming Wei...

298
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:27,060
Is she really my sister?

299
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,220
Xiao Zhao,

300
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,380
as a mother,

301
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,100
I truly don't want my daughter

302
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
to fall into the same old trap again.

303
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,020
I don't approve your relationship with Ming Qiao.

304
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,380
I also hope that our two families

305
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,660
won't get entangled.

306
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,050
So

307
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,700
let's end it here.

308
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,460
I just think

309
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,030
Ming Qiao and I are not a good match.

310
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:08,060
Not a good match?

311
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,830
What were you doing before?

312
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,900
You've been dating for a while.

313
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,610
Now you're saying you two are not a good match.

314
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,410
I'm not planning to settle down.

315
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,930
And I don't want to get married in the future.

316
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,400
I can't keep wasting

317
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,800
Ming Qiao's time.

318
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,290
I didn't approve your relationship with her

319
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,750
for this reason back then.

320
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,000
I thought you have figured it out.

321
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,260
Now you go back on your words all of a sudden.

322
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,120
Have you forgotten your promise?

323
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,460
I'm sorry.

324
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,900
Xu Run.

325
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,820
Dad, what are you doing here?

326
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,230
I'm just passing by.

327
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:49,220
Are you...

328
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,820
Ming Wei?

329
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,780
Hello, Mr. Xu.

330
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,900
Hello.

331
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:09,210
Dad,

332
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,540
Ming Wei has to go back to filming soon.

333
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,800
Let me show you around.

334
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,900
Let's go.

335
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,570
Let's go, dad.

336
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,380
What are you doing exactly, dad?

337
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,980
Why do you suddenly come here?

338
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,420
If I wasn't there,

339
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,090
you would tell Ming Wei about her true identity, right?

340
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,420
I knew that she is here.

341
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,820
How can I not come?

342
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,130
I can't help it, Run.

343
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,140
You don't understand.

344
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,180
I find her so amazing.

345
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,260
But I have never fulfilled

346
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,860
a father's responsibility.

347
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,340
I want to make it up to her.

348
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,010
I... I...

349
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,410
I really don't think

350
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,140
I can hide the truth any longer.

351
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,580
Dad,

352
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:01,120
I can understand how you feel.

353
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,110
But right now

354
00:24:02,170 --> 00:24:03,780
we can't tell Ming Wei about her true identity.

355
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,820
Because the Ming family haven't told her yet.

356
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,420
We have to respect their choice.

357
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,100
I...

358
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,460
Otherwise we will really hurt Ming Wei.

359
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:12,820
For the sake of your daughter,

360
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:14,530
just live with it,

361
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,820
would you?

362
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:36,770
Is Ming Qiao feeling better?

363
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,760
How can she possibly feel better?

364
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,050
I finally see through Xiao Zhao.

365
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,140
He said that he and Ming Qiao weren't suitable for each other.

366
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,620
He couldn't promise to marry her,

367
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,570
so he let her go.

368
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,860
That sounded nice.

369
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,730
But actually he just doesn't want to take the responsibility.

370
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,660
Men are nasty creatures indeed.

371
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,540
Mr. Mu, I will be out for a minute.

372
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,710
Because of the memory loss,

373
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,980
I can't recall

374
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,140
my past relationship clearly.

375
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:16,030
[The Butterfly Lovers]

376
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,980
As a result, you have to bear the burden

377
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,220
of our history all by yourself.

378
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,420
I'm sorry about that.

379
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,680
And I disappointed you, especially.

380
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,740
Mr. Mu,

381
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,020
what I said just now was not about you.

382
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,150
I am not blaming you.

383
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,780
I know that.

384
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,320
But I blame myself.

385
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,490
It's okay.

386
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,550
It's all in the past.

387
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,460
And you didn't behave like that on purpose.

388
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,380
The scene we did this afternoon

389
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,540
was so satisfying.

390
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,660
This is the first time

391
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,900
I shot a scene in one take.

392
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,390
I felt that I was completely immersed in my emotions.

393
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,040
My lines were not recited.

394
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,700
They came out effortlessly.

395
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,820
It means you've really

396
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,540
made progress in acting.

397
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,500
By the way,

398
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:24,780
I've seen it on the schedule that we have two scenes tomorrow.

399
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,980
I have some new ideas.

400
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,210
How about we have a discussion through dinner?

401
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:29,270
Okay. Sounds good.

402
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,020
Tingzhou.

403
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,260
What are you doing here?

404
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,530
My senior is a stylist of this show.

405
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,140
She asks me to come and share

406
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,690
my opinions on the leading man's costumes.

407
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,660
I happen to be thinking of

408
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,780
you and my brother.

409
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,730
Mr. Mu,

410
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,230
I will leave for now.

411
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,020
I came to the hotel to wait for you soon after I got off the plane.

412
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,820
I'm wondering

413
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,240
if you'd like to take me to dinner?

414
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,340
Okay.

415
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,940
Let's go.

416
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:10,580
Dig in.

417
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,350
Didn't you say you were hungry?

418
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,620
Tingzhou,

419
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,140
I need to tell you something.

420
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:19,660
Go ahead.

421
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,030
I've got something to tell you too.

422
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:27,570
You really shouldn't work with Ming Wei again.

423
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,430
She is too calculating.

424
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,860
In my mind, you're always

425
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,050
an excellent judge of character.

426
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,580
But why can't you see clearly

427
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,940
on this issue?

428
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,260
I know my acting partner well

429
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,380
and I don't need you to intervene.

430
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,420
I don't want to hear

431
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,830
any of your opinions on Ming Wei, either.

432
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,500
We grew up together.

433
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,180
You think I'm gonna lie to you?

434
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,300
Why can't you just believe me?

435
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,860
I only believe what I see.

436
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:04,940
Lin,

437
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:07,100
go back to the UK, work hard

438
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,140
and finish your degree.

439
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,140
Don't let these small details affect

440
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,340
your long-time dream

441
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,170
of becoming a fashion designer.

442
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:15,900
Are you getting rid of me?

443
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,230
No. I'm persuading you.

444
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,900
The Xu Lin I'd like to see,

445
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,900
is the innocent, easy-going girl like she was before.

446
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,190
Don't you get it?

447
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,550
I've become this

448
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:27,020
because I like you.

449
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,700
Everything I did is because

450
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,500
I like you.

451
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,780
But you will always be

452
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,500
a sister of mine in my heart.

453
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,980
Here. Take them.

454
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,020
Come on.

455
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,370
Take them.

456
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:10,890
Mr. Xu,

457
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,790
you are too kind.

458
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:15,610
But I really can't take these presents.

459
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,700
You've been working so hard.

460
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,460
These are great nutritional supplements.

461
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,700
A girl should take care of her health.

462
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:24,420
Take them.

463
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:25,570
Take them back, please.

464
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,100
I really can't accept them.

465
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,460
Ming Wei.

466
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,340
Dad.

467
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,620
Why are you here?

468
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,880
What are these for?

469
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,380
What are you doing here?

470
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,060
If I'm not seeing this with my own eyes,

471
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,260
I won't believe this.

472
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,380
My own father is somehow

473
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,180
being seduced by this woman too.

474
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:47,860
Lin,

475
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,290
don't talk nonsense.

476
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,300
Ming Wei,

477
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,540
why do you like relying on men so much?

478
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,260
You failed to seduce Mu Tingzhou,

479
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,620
and then you made a move on my brother.

480
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,460
That didn't work,

481
00:29:56,460 --> 00:29:58,170
so you made my dad your new target?

482
00:29:58,170 --> 00:29:59,700
You can't live without men?

483
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,890
You watch your mouth.

484
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,410
If you keep talking like this,

485
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,810
I'm gonna kick your butt.

486
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:06,700
Lin.

487
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,300
Let go of me!

488
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:07,900
Stop talking.

489
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:08,660
Shut up!

490
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,700
Ming Wei, don't be upset.

491
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,080
You come here. Let me tell you.

492
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,780
It's not what you thought.

493
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:14,860
Come here.

494
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,260
What?

495
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,660
Dad, are you kidding me?

496
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,620
Lin,

497
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
I know this is hard for you to accept.

498
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,460
But it is the truth.

499
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,340
Why?

500
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,740
Why has everything changed

501
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,340
since Ming Wei showed up?

502
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,490
Tingzhou is pushing me away because of her.

503
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:52,100
My brother is protecting her instead of me.

504
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,230
Now you're telling me she is my sister.

505
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:55,790
And you ask me to accept her.

506
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,410
What is this?

507
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,500
This is absurd.

508
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,260
Lin,

509
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,500
take it easy. This...

510
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,990
This is all my fault.

511
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,180
My mistake.

512
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:12,100
I didn't think thoroughly when I was young,

513
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,900
and now there are consequences.

514
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,860
So please don't blame it on Ming Wei.

515
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,610
This is not on her.

516
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,140
She is also innocent.

517
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,300
No.

518
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,390
I don't believe you.

519
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:32,850
I don't want to hear any of your lies.

520
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,500
You just need to get this done

521
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,100
and ignore everything else.

522
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,180
If Ming...

523
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,780
You are here.

524
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,620
The director said he was in the middle of something and would be late for a while.

525
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,020
This scene for tomorrow is very important,

526
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,940
so I think it's necessary

527
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,100
that we meet in advance

528
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,500
and discuss the details.

529
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,100
OK.

530
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,220
Sit.

531
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:05,630
Show me the announcement list.

532
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,430
The latest big plan.

533
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,020
Really?

534
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,560
The schedule is full already.

535
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,220
You need to shoot it sooner or later.

536
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,580
Xu Lin.

537
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,020
Xu Lin, what are you doing?

538
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,220
Xu Lin, are you crazy?

539
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,710
Ming Wei, are you OK?

540
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,300
Stop. Stop. Stop.

541
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:36,740
Stop.

542
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:37,540
Why should I stop?

543
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,930
She just slapped my sister in the face.

544
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,580
You...

545
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,790
Let me go, Xiao Zhao.

546
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,900
Don't do it.

547
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,980
Now you are quite complacent, aren't you?

548
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,340
You think you are a real princess

549
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,460
because you have a rich dad?

550
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,860
I'm telling you, you are dreaming.

551
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,790
You are just a bastard of my father.

552
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,860
Xu Lin,

553
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,510
come with me.

554
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Stop right there.

555
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,790
What did you just say? Say it again.

556
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,730
Ming Wei, don't listen to her nonsense.

557
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:00,370
She is not thinking straight.

558
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:01,620
Shut up.

559
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,700
Fine.

560
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,040
I will say it again.

561
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,780
You are a bastard of my father and your mother,

562
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,660
born before your mother got married.

563
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:13,260
Xu Lin,

564
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,510
shut your mouth.

565
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,310
Come with me.

566
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,300
Let me go.

567
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,100
You... let me go.

568
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
Xu Lin, come here.

569
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,700
Let me go.

570
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,180
Stop struggling.

571
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,740
Let me go. I can walk on my own.

572
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,520
Why did you do that?

573
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,390
Why did you have to make a scene?

574
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,430
You knew it long ago, right?

575
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,840
You all knew it and you kept it from me.

576
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,140
I was like a fool

577
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,740
seeing you protect Ming Wei

578
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,940
without knowing why.

579
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,930
If you didn't make a match of Tingzhou and Ming Wei,

580
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,540
Tingzhou wouldn't refuse me.

581
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,340
Xu Lin, please be rational.

582
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,140
What do you really want

583
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,340
by doing this?

584
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,100
I can't be rational.

585
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,699
I can't be rational

586
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,620
at the thought that

587
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:15,780
you, Tingzhou, and dad love a bastard

588
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:16,980
more than me.

589
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,909
She made it tough for me,

590
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,310
and I will return the favor.

591
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,300
Xu Lin, come back.

592
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,690
I really hate Xu Lin

593
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:40,929
and don't want to believe her at all.

594
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,260
But when I recall mom's facial expression

595
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:49,300
when she saw Xiao Zhao's father,

596
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,179
I think it's really strange.

597
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,960
What's more, Xiao Zhao broke up with me out of no reason.

598
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:00,140
So I don't know if we should believe Xu Lin's words.

599
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,450
Ming Wei.

600
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,860
I won't believe it

601
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,580
unless they tell me personally.

602
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,660
I need to go home.

603
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,670
Ming Wei, Ming Qiao.

604
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,500
When we arrive,

605
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,180
Xiao Zhao and I

606
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,180
won't go inside to see your parents.

607
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,960
I think at this moment,

608
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,790
they are not willing to see us.

609
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:36,620
OK.

610
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:38,270
Thanks, Mr. Mu.

611
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:54,900
Somebody

612
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:56,150
just has to follow

613
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,580
somehow.

614
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,380
I am the entertainment agent of Tingzhou.

615
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,310
I must follow him wherever he goes.

616
00:36:15,860 --> 00:36:16,580
Honey,

617
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,470
did you forget the salt?

618
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,900
It's not salty at all.

619
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,740
I didn't forget the salt.

620
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,100
You should have a light diet

621
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,460
for the sake of your health.

622
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,100
And

623
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,500
no more drinking.

624
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,420
I...

625
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,620
Here, have some.

626
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,130
Dad. Mom.

627
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,370
Why are you home?

628
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:37,980
That's right.

629
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,910
You should inform me earlier so that I can pick you up.

630
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,220
We miss you

631
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:45,210
and decided to come back to check on you.

632
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,140
You haven't

633
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,700
eaten anything, right?

634
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,300
I'll cook something for you.

635
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,020
Come here. Sit.

636
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,570
Come.

637
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,820
Come.

638
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,540
Honey, what happened?

639
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:07,780
Did someone treat you badly?

640
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,460
Tell me.

641
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:10,370
I will make him pay for it.

642
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,100
Tell me.

643
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:14,260
Wei,

644
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,300
what's up?

645
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,480
What happened?

646
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:17,900
Ming Qiao,

647
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,300
what is going on?

648
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,460
Mom.

649
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,660
Dad.

650
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,580
We know about Wei's

651
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,020
true identity.

652
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,580
Thanks.

653
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,330
Are you still that picky Mu Tingzhou

654
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,420
that I knew?

655
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,690
You are still that Xiao Zhao I knew,

656
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:16,220
because you can still joke in this situation.

657
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,360
I have to say, you are really patient.

658
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,220
This thing is of great importance and you never told me about it.

659
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,880
Did you break up with Ming Qiao

660
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,020
because of it?

661
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:28,820
I just can't accept it deep in my heart.

662
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,340
After all, she...

663
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:34,330
she is the biological sister of my biological sister.

664
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,720
Do you have blood ties?

665
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,220
Yes. Of course.

666
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,460
Here is the thing.

667
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,390
Ming Wei and I have the same father.

668
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,740
Ming Qiao and Ming Wei have the same mother.

669
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,300
This...

670
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,380
What blood ties?

671
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,860
This...

672
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:54,650
No?

673
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,180
Of course no.

674
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,700
Anyway, since I knew the truth,

675
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,380
I have felt our relationship is strange

676
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,540
when I saw her.

677
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,220
I think you are just too bored

678
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,900
and you want to find some trouble.

679
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,060
I don't want this.

680
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:11,320
Breaking up with Ming Qiao also makes me sad.

681
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,740
Every time I saw her,

682
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:16,940
I wanted to get closer to her.

683
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,140
But I don't know what to say.

684
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,300
So I have to force myself

685
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,180
to be indifferent.

686
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,420
In my opinion,

687
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,780
the main reason you came to Su City

688
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,820
is Ming Qiao.

689
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,100
You have played in the love field for many years,

690
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,160
and finally you met someone you like.

691
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,540
Don't be too hard on yourself.

692
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,980
I will truly despise you

693
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,270
if you continue to be indifferent.

694
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,380
Dad,

695
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,910
thank you for always giving me so much love

696
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,540
and protecting me.

697
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,340
If it weren't for you,

698
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,020
I would not have a father.

699
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,940
Don't be silly.

700
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,380
In my eyes, you are my biological daughter.

701
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,940
Who else will I love if I don't love you?

702
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,140
Dad.

703
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,340
Thank you for not making me feel lonely

704
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,500
since my birth.

705
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,970
I used to say I will protect Wei,

706
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:32,940
but I feel a strong sense of security

707
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:34,940
because of her.

708
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,060
In this life,

709
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,500
I am satisfied

710
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,020
because I married your mother

711
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,300
and have two baby girls like you.

712
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,410
Wei.

713
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,140
Qiao.

714
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,910
Let bygones be bygones.

715
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,380
Don't let it influence our mood.

716
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,180
Let the four of us

717
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,980
spend the rest of our life together peacefully.

718
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,020
If someday

719
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,180
mom and dad get old

720
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,940
and leave you,

721
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,660
you must take care of each other.

722
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,780
Because you are the closest kinfolks.

723
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,660
Mom, what are you talking about?

724
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:31,660
We will stay together forever.

725
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,100
OK.

726
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,980
I'm so happy

727
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,140
and I just can't help it.

728
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,670
We will always be together.

729
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,740
Mr. Mu,

730
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,020
thank you for

731
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:10,310
taking us home.

732
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,020
Ming Wei,

733
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,670
I need to talk to you.

734
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,220
Tingzhou.

735
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,120
You knew Wei is your biological sister long ago, right?

736
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:53,140
Did you break up with me for that reason?

737
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,460
I just think

738
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,460
you are also my sister.

739
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:00,060
I...

740
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:09,360
So my long-time pursuit of you

741
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,220
brought myself a big brother?
