you are the one he's been in love with all this time.

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,100
thank you for this notebook.

146
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,900
Xiao Zhao gave it to me.

147
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,460
I didn't know you did so much for me.

148
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,980
At that time, we were not very

149
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,440
familiar with each other.

150
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,920
So I was worried that you might think I was meddling.

151
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,190
Why would I think like that?

152
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,260
It's a valuable treasure to me.

153
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm glad that you think it's good.

154
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,060
If there is a chance

155

156
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,640
I can still take notes for you.

157
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,250
Xiao Zhao also told me that

158
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,600
the help you offered me

159
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,980
was more than this notebook.

160
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,500
When Cheng Yao came to look for trouble,

it was you who secretly asked for leave.

It was also you

who rearranged your schedule to dub with me on the same day,

164
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,110
in order to help me immerse into it.

165
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,100
Actually, I hardly worked with novices.

166
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,460
I thought you are a fast learner and have talents,

167
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:08,620
so I figured I should help you as much as I could.

168
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,980
Just because I was a novice who learned things fast?

169
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,790
I've had enough.

170
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,100

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,940
Will you have some more?

176
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,780
I'm full.

177
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,140
If

178
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,640
you have something to tell me,

179
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,450
come to me when you are ready.

180
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:25,060
Your Highness,

181
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,460
I have remembered it all.

182
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,360
Please forgive me for my cowardice just now.

183
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,700
I have remembered

184
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,540
how we met,

185
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,660
how we knew each other, and how we

186
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,980
fell for each other.

187
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,370
If I confessed my feelings to you

188
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,480
when the Grand Chief Cabinet Minister wrapped,

189
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,619
none of those ridiculous things would happen.

190
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,770
No matter in the past,

191
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:16,140
present, or future,

192
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:18,339
whether I'm Grand Tutor

193
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,619
or Mu Tingzhou,

194
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:21,420
I'm sure

195
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,369
you are the one I love.

196
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,849
Only you.

197
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,660
Will you be my princess again?

198
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:13,940
Qiao,

199
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,390
have some coffee.

200
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:15,890
No.

201
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:17,910
How about some crisps?

202
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:18,380
No.

203
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,550
Chocolate?

204
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,240
I'm afraid of gaining weight.

205
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,260
-Ming Qiao. -Well...

206
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,020
When do you plan to

207
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,540
accept Xiao Zhao?

208
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,110
He is trying his best

209
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,930
to make you happy everyday.

210
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,900
He's not even in the mood to work.

211
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,260
I haven't decided yet.

212
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,020
It feels good to have someone pursuing me.

213
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
Let him pursue me.

214
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,260
Honey,

215
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,220
I promise you.

216
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,020
If you accept me,

217
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,280
I will still pursue you

218
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,500
and you can enjoy being pursued for your whole life.

219
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:45,900
OK?

220
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:46,620
Really?

221
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,870
I don't believe you.

222
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,180
Regarding the bet we made, I win.

223
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,680
Prepare to fulfill your commitment.

224
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
What bet?

225
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,740
We made a bet to see

226
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,020
who can win the heart of our loved one first.

227
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,950
The one who loses

228
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,750
must achieve

230
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,980
Good for you.

231
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,730
Did you two make a bet on me and Ming Qiao?

232
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,690
No. I just wanted to...

233
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:21,700
You were going too far.

234
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,660
I just wanted to prove

235
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,820
my abilities.

236
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,630
Who said Xiao Zhao has lost?

237
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,700
We made peace on the day when we let off fireworks.

238
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:28,780
It's you who lost.

239

Really?

240

What are you doing?

Xiao Zhao.

243
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,280
Be careful, Xiao Zhao.

244
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,380
Great.

245
00:19:59,090 --> 00:19:59,800
Jiang Yue,

246
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,730
I apologize to you

247
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:06,370
and Ming Wei.

248
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:15,720
Actually, I hated you so much at that time.

249
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,830
But I met Ming Qiang.

250
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,160
He's been really nice to me.

251
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,190
We are happy,

252
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,550
and I'm satisfied.

253
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,480
Thank you

254
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,050
for educating Ming Wei so well.

255
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,640
Honestly, it's all because of Ming Qiang.

256
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:39,190
He favors Ming Wei than I do.

257
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,550
For years, I had always

258
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,680
felt uneasy,

259
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,190
worrying that

260
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,910
the fact about Ming Wei's true father would be disclosed.

261
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,650
But when that day really came,

262
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:57,440
I felt relieved in my heart.

263
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,590
I know I can't make it up to you

264
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,240
no matter how sorry I am.

265
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,230
Jiang Yue,

266
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:14,640
now I only have one wish.

267
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,630
I wish everything will go well with the kids.

268
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,290
Because I don't think they have the obligation or responsibility

269
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,110
to bear all of this for me.

270
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,590
OK?

271
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,790
Xu Xiu, don't worry.

272
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,990
The kids have the right to make their choices.

273
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,120
I won't stop them from being together.

I won't prevent Wei

from accepting you as her father, either.

276
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:41,600
No.

277
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:45,320
I've never expected it.

278
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,280
Jiang Yue,

279
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,440
I will take Xu Lin to the UK soon

280
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,080
and never come back again.

281
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:58,470
Don't worry.

282
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,600
Take care.

I think

that we can rehearse in advance.

The first question.

295

You must answer it within three seconds.

It's not a silly question.

307
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:39,130
there is a bigger problem to be solved right now.

308
00:24:39,830 --> 00:24:40,840
What is it?

309
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:48,440
It's Ming Wei's parents,

to the police station.

315
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,280
I didn't do that on purpose.

I just worry I may fail to get her parents' approvals.

317
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,430
Then all my previous efforts will be wasted.

No. That won't happen.

Man, you have a thick skin.

331

accept you after we get married.

333

In my opinion,

00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:47,630
Don't look at me.

347
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:49,710
You two brats!

348
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,440
You are the ones who made my daughters cry.

349
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,570
I will never approve

350
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:56,330
your marriage proposals.

351
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,630
I know that

352
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,350
I've let you down.

353
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,830
No matter how I assure you,

354
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,090
you will no longer believe me.

355
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,430
Therefore,

356
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,070
I've decided

357
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,270
I'm going to give all that I have

358
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,160
to Ming Wei.

359
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,470
All that you have?

360
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,810
Are you serious?

361
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,540
Why did you kick me?

362
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,470
No.

363
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,460
Sorry, Sir.

364
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:32,560
Well, yeah.

365
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,690
I'm gonna give all that I have to Ming Qiao.

366
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,240
What you've said won't work for me.

367
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:38,910
I, Ming Qiang,

368
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,560
am not a man who is moved at the sight of money.

369
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,610
So tell us, please.

370
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,400
What must we do to make you accept us?

371
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,310
We will just do it.

372
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,540
What you say doesn't matter now.

373
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,350
I've already chosen several

374
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,310
nice young men from my Martial Arts club.

375
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,640
And I will introduce them to my daughters,

376
00:27:57,870 --> 00:28:01,030
so they can have more choices.

377
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,930
Well. That's what you've said.

378
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,360
Since you're so heartless,

379
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,710
do not mind if we have no loyalty.

380
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,310
Why?

381
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,310
Auntie doesn't want you to drink or eat meat, right?

382
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:10,840
Alright.

383
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:11,900
What are you going to do?

384
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,160
What you've done today

385
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,910
has been recorded by us.

386
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,550
Xiao Zhao,

387
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,040
how can you do this?

388
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,560
Listen.

389
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:21,760
Listen to him!

390
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,480
Do you have any morals? You are...

391
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,390
No, no, no.

392
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,320
You... I...

393
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,310
A situation like this needs video recording.

394
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,390
With images and videos as evidence,

395
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,550
he is unable to escape even if given wings.

396
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,070
You...

397
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,870
Stop filming and put down your phones.

398
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,760
Both of you!

399
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,750
Knock it off, both of you!

400
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,880
I'm telling you now.

401
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,720
If you keep filming,

402
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:41,490
I won't allow you to marry my daughters for real.

403
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:50,760
Are you saying

404
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:53,950
that you approve our proposals?

405
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,030
Yes.

406
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:19,030
I approve.

407
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,470
I can't change the fact that

408
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:28,630
my daughters are in love with you two.

409
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,590
The reason that I approve of your relationships

410
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,270
is not because of your promises,

411
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,200
and definitely not because of your identity or status.

412
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,630
It is because

413
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:49,470
my two girls smile so happily

414
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,990
when they see you.

415
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,270
I see happiness

416
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
in their eyes.

417
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:10,070
Actually, I'm not a very capable man.

418
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,550
As long as my wife

419
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,870
and my daughters

420
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,350
are happy and well,

421
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,310
it means the world to me.

422
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,120
Sir,

423
00:30:55,190 --> 00:30:56,750
I am sorry for everything

424
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,690
that I've done in the past.

425
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,990
Okay.

426
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,670
Apology accepted.

427
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,500
But don't ever do anything

428
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,760
that makes you say sorry to my daughter.

429
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,980
No matter what mistakes you will make in the future,

430
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:40,370
don't ever let me know.

431
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,130
Because even if my daughters forgive you,

432
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,790
I, Ming Qiang, will never do.

433
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
Never.

434
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,750
Thank you, Sir!

435
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:57,470
Dad.

436
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,550
Dad.

437
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,790
Make sure that your auntie

438
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,030
never knows about the audio and the videos.

439
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,340
First, you finish this drink.

440
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,360
And then we will delete them all.

441
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:32,590
Yes.

442
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:36,550
Here.

443
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:37,720
Here. Bottoms up!

444
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:56,990
Ming Qiang. I'm home!

445
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,720
Ming Qiang.

446
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,990
How would you marry my daughters being such poor drinkers!

447
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,310
Come on! Get up! Get up!

448
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,280
Keep drinking.

449
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:09,840
Come on!

450
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:10,630
Come on!

451
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,320
Drink. Drink. Drink.

452
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:17,440
Darling.

453
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,360
You're home.

454
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm fine.

455
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,040
I'm fine.

456
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:45,600
Mu Tingzhou,

457
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,160
This is the second time you've come here to propose a marriage.

458
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,620
Do you think this is a joke?

459
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,550
Is marriage a game to you?

460
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,980
You just come and go whenever you like it?

461
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:57,320
That's totally unacceptable!

462
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,790
I deserve all of your criticism.

463
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,110
I sincerely apologize.

464
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:15,889
And I promise I will make Ming Wei very happy.

465
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,260
Well. I don't think so.

466
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,310
What if someday you suffer from memory loss again

467
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,239
and bring my daughter so much pain?

468
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,080
Dad,

469
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,179
it won't happen again.

470
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,510
See.

471
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:32,790
The father's little padded jacket has already becomes the son-in-law's.

472
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:33,790
That's okay, Dad.

473
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,510
You've got another little padded jacket here.

474
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,440
Enough! Enough!

475
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,719
You're not keeping me warm, either.

476
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,630
Dad, please don't worry.

477
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,580
I will keep an eye on Tingzhou.

478
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,719
If he dares to make Ming Wei upset,

479
00:34:46,909 --> 00:34:48,110
I will kick his butt first

480
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,429
before you do.

481
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,639
Are you out of your mind?

482
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,100
We are supposed to be on the same side, right?

483
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,180
Who told you that?

484
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
I'm on dad's side.

485
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,870
Good.

486
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:07,920
It works for me.

487
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,420
Okay.

488
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,720
I will listen to dad as well.

489
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:13,640
But

490
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,890
I will listen to mom even more.

491
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,110
Mom,

492
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm ordering a photo shoot for you.

493
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,520
You're very elegant. You're gonna look great in every photo.

494
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,030
Yes. Yes. Yes.

495
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:28,210
I'd love to have my pictures taken with your mom.

496
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,120
Can we do the photo shot with costumes?

497
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,850
Your mom will look so beautiful

498
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,190
in a costume photo.

499
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,620
Let's do it by the sea.

500
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,620
Take all the pictures we like.

501
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,550
You can wear anything you like.

502
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:42,390
Yes.

503
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:43,280
Right?

504
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:45,070
We can wear a cheongsam.

505
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,800
We can wear bikinis.

506
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:49,110
Sure. Sure.

507
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,590
[Wanda Reign Hotel]

508
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,840
Isn't this the restaurant where we first met?

509
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,480
You were crying then,

510
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:12,790
weren't you?

511
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,910
You were crying so sadly for a jerk.

512
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,310
Why are you bringing up my embarrassing story?

513
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,940
Why did you take me here out of the sudden?

514
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:26,800
This is where

515
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,000
fate brings us together.

516
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,640
I love you.

517
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,200
I love you too.

518
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,720
I will treat you like my princess

519
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,470
for the rest of my life.

520
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,880
I will adore you, cherish you,

521
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,640
and give you the happiest life.

522
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,910
I promise you.

523
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:54,810
I will make you happy, too.

524
00:36:59,120 --> 00:36:59,960
But

525
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,660
there were some minor grammar mistakes in your speech.

526
00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:05,340
Oh yeah?

527
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,840
An article is needed before every noun.

528
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:11,260
However, there are a few exceptions.

529
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:12,400
For example,

530
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,220
no articles are needed if there are adjectives,

531
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,840
appositives, or certain phrases before the nouns.

532
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,230
No articles are needed before city names

533
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,340
which are not defined by attributes or adjectives.

534
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,300
No articles are needed before regular names.

535
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,230
Is that correct?

536
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:26,680
How do you know?

537
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,280
That's very impressive.

538
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,160
Did you work part-time at Ou Qiao Language School,

539
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:34,550
and know a teacher whose name is Daniel?

540
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:36,610
How do you know that?

541
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,710
I see.

542
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,650
Did you call us

543
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,470
and ask me a grammar question?

544
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,600
It turns out that we've made connections a long time ago.

545
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:56,450
I've decided

546
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:00,520
to continue my Italian learning.

547
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,030
Why?

548
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,130
Your Italian is great already.

549
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,600
Because it represents the beginning of our story.

550
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,930
It's our love language.

551
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,790
I have a question for you.

552
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,130
Who do you like more,

553
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,110
Grand Tutor or me?

554
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,200
Aren't you the same person?

555
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,720
My love is the same.

556
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,200
Who says I'm the same man with that fool?

557
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,000
How can you call yourself a fool?

558
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,060
I don't like your answer.

559
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,120
I must be the best in your heart.

560
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,000
I've never seen a guy who is jealous of himself.

561
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,620
[Property Ownership Certificate of the People's Republic of China]

562
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,320
This is the dowry for you, from dad.

563
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:09,730
He knows that you probably don't want to see him,

564
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:11,630
or regard him as your father.

565
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,400
But he asked me to tell you

566
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:14,680
that if you ever

567
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,020
feel wronged,

568
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,760
you can just let him know.

569
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,960
He will help you out.

570
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,840
He will always stand behind you,

571
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,000
and protect you.

572
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:31,990
Sister,

573
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:33,990
I wish you happy.

574
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:37,520
Wish you and Tingzhou a long life together.

575
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,160
Okay.

576
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,240
I will let you get on with your work.

577
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,430
There are only a couple of days left before the wedding.

578
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,030
You and Tingzhou

579
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:50,160
must be busy preparing so many things.

580
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:08,630
Brother,

581
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,360
I'm so lucky

582
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:22,470
to have you along the way.

Dad. Mom.

[Happiness]

591
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,130
The decoration...

592
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,440
Everything was done exactly according to my memories.

593
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,300
Your Highness,

594
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:24,510
do you like it?

595
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,030
Yes.

596
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,530
I like it very much.

597
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,160
You're so beautiful.

598
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,570
Why do you still keep this?

599
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,160
I'm giving this back to you.

600
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:18,030
I, Mu Tingzhou,

601
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,210
am grateful for Your Highness deigning to marry me.

602
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,680
Do you want me to kowtow?

603
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,240
Absolutely.

604
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:34,950
Absolutely.
