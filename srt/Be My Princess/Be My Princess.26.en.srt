2
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,460
Did you see the diary and letter

3
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,410
I left you?

4
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,020
Did you do what I said?

5
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,020
I did what you wrote in the diary.

6
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,620
I did everything you did for Her Highness

7
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,980
for Ming Wei.

8
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:57,740
I want her to be in deep love with me,

9
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,420
forget you,

10
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,100
and start a new life.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,220
But I found that

12
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:05,200
all my efforts are in vain.

13
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,000
I can make her love me through my efforts,

14
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,320
but I can never make her

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,539
forget you.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,510
I'm your doppelganger.

17
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:19,200
You don't have to be jealous of me.

18
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,340
All I ask of you

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,580
is to stay with Her Highness forever

20
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,289
just like now.

21
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,500
As long as you keep her company,

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,980
I'm by her side as well.

[Episode 26]

25
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,880
You knew Wei is your biological sister long ago, right?

26
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,180
Did you break up with me for that reason?

27
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,380
I just think

28
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,380
you are also my sister.

29
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,980
I...

30
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,400
So my long-time pursuit of you

31
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,140
brought myself a big brother?

32
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Xiao Zhao, who am I in your heart?

33
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,579
Our relationship is between you and me.

34
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:43,860
How come you have the say

35
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,390
and make all the decisions?

36
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,220
Sister?

37
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,380
You like the brother and sister relationship, right?

38
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,579
Good night, brother.

39
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,420
Cry loudly if you want to.

40
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,800
You don't have to repress your feelings.

41
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:21,329
Anyone would feel sad

42
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,460
in this situation.

43
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,620
Thanks.

44
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,580
Let me ask you something.

45
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,900
After you know the truth,

46
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,060
will you no longer accept Mr. Ming as your father?

47
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,900
Of course I won't do that.

48
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,170
Will Mr. Ming refuse to accept you as his daughter?

49
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,170
It's impossible.

50
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,500
So why are you crying?

51
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,340
You don't have to care too much

52
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,340
or think too much.

53
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,330
It won't change anything

54
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,860
in your life.

55
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,730
Right?

56
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,620
You are right.

57
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,900
Stop. Stop.

58
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,000
Let's have a break.

59
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,660
You are not yourself.

60
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,460
Concerning your situation,

61
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,380
you had it coming.

62
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:26,180
Do you think that I

63
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,180
really broke Ming Qiao's heart?

64
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,220
Now I'm even scared to

65
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,440
look her in the eye.

66
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,050
Better late than never.

67
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:41,700
Are you talking about me

68
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,860
or yourself?

69
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,540
Anyway,

70
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,620
Ming Wei is finally emotionally stable

71
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,420
and can work with me peacefully.

72
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Tell me the truth.

73
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,900
In addition to Grand Tutor's diary,

74
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,460
is there any other reason

75
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,020
that makes you so nice to my sister?

76
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,860
No.

77
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,260
Liar.

78
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,180
It's true.

79
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,380
In the first place, I was just

80
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,260
curious about her because of the diary.

81
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,060
I wanted to figure out our relationship

82
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,520
when I became Grand Tutor.

83
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,060
But I don't know why

84
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,060
I just couldn't help comforting her

85
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,660
when I saw her cry.

86
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,320
I don't have a clue.

87
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,059
Fine.

88
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,900
Wish you success.

89
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,950
Mind your own business.

90
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,580
Ming Wei.

91
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,830
This morning, Tingzhou wanted to eat fruit,

92
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,780
so I brought some to you and

93
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,910
Ming Qiao by the way.

94
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,620
Thanks.

95
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:14,810
But I'll pass.

96
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,020
I know

97
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,340
you still need some time to accept the truth.

98
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,340
Actually, dad has been missing you.

99
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,160
He is afraid that you hate him.

100
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,620
I don't hate anyone.

101
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,880
I have lived a happy life since my childhood.

102
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,600
My father has been very nice to me.

103
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,140
I only have one father.

104
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,420
Mr. Mu,

105
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,540
what you said yesterday is really helpful.

106
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,000
I have thought it through.

107
00:09:57,070 --> 00:09:58,400
I will focus on shooting

108
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,900
and won't let you down.

109
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,910
In fact, I'm not the only one who's worried about you.

110
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,910
Xiao Zhao is worried about you, too.

111
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,180
I know.

112
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:10,850
I just

113
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,020
can't let myself accept him now.

114
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,220
Mr. Chen Zhang is here visiting us

115
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,080
and brought us lots of tasty food.

116
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,750
Thank you, Mr. Chen Zhang.

117
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,620
Ming Wei.

118
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,660
Chen Zhang.

119
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,900
Hi, Mr. Mu.

120
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,300
You are here.

121
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,950
I'm here to see Ming Wei.

122
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,540
Why did you come suddenly?

123
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,020
You didn't tell me in advance.

124
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,750
I wanted to give you a surprise.

125
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,100
I will start shooting soon.

126
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,850
If I don't come to see you,

127
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,560
we may not see each other for quite some time.

128
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:54,030
That's very nice of you.

129
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,300
You look great.

130
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,160
Then I will feel relieved.

131
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,710
I was worried that you might

132
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:01,870
be unhappy about working with Mr. Mu.

133
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,820
Actually, Mr. Mu is very nice.

134
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,260
I'm happy to work with him.

135
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:12,590
Don't worry.

136
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,020
Good.

137
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,740
You are happy, and I will be happy.

138
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,840
I will be waiting for you forever.

139
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,720
Why are you bringing this up in the middle of our pleasant chat?

140
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,900
Chen Zhang,

141
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,770
I have made up my mind a long time ago.

142
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,980
I have always cherished you.

143
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,430
I promise you

144
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,880
we will be friends for a lifetime.

145
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,240
It appears that I have to deal with the sadness of being rejected on my own.

146
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,180
That's a deal then.

147
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,390
You must keep your word that

148
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,520
we will be good friends for a lifetime.

149
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,340
You have my word.

150
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,580
Ouch!

151
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,660
It hurts.

152
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:22,700
Let go. Let go.

153
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,230
Why did you use so much strength?

154
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,960
I thought you were meditating.

155
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,320
I plan to pursue Ming Wei.

156
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:33,900
Have you

157
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,740
remembered what you have been through with her?

158
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,460
No.

159
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,360
Are you stimulated by Chen Zhang?

160
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,790
I'm telling you.

161
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,740
It's OK if you want to pursue my sister,

162
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,200
but you can't take actions

163
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,540
until you think it over.

164
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,690
Don't you ever hurt her again.

165
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,220
Or I will make you pay for it.

166
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,740
What's between me and Ming Wei is not your problem.

167
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,070
Mind your own business.

168
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:01,150
Don't make yourself regretful by losing her.

169
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,500
Lin,

170
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,310
where are you going?

171
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,070
It's none of your business.

172
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,100
Lin.

173
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,220
Lin.

let go of the grudges starting from today

477

I was so onto shooting

Miss Ming,

488

I'm also clear that Miss Ming

What do you think

498
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,610
my feelings to him are like?

499
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,680
He is just the result of my wrong memory.

500
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,610
I have lost the memory completely.

501
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,680
That means

502
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,880
Grand Tutor has gone.

503
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,880
Do you want to

504
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,760
wait until I recover the memory

505
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,620
or meet someone new and proper

506
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,290
and have a new relationship?

507
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,280
I respect your relationship with Grand Tutor.

508
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,290
But I do hope you can distinguish

509
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,070
him and me clearly.

510
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,860
I also hope that you will be with me

511
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,000
because you like me,

512
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,330
not due to your feelings

513
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,520

514
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,720
I'm sorry.

515
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,640
I hurt you

516

when I couldn't control the situation.

517
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,470
But I can guarantee that

518
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,480
my feelings for you

519
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,200
will not be less than Grand Tutor's.

520
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,470
I will definitely be as good as him

521
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,170
in treating my girlfriend.

522
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:24,970
Thank you.

523
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,220
But my boyfriend just died,

524
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,610
and I'm not ready for a new relationship yet.

525
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,400
I didn't expect you can accept me today.

526
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:41,970
But I will not give up easily.

527
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,010
I will prove my love

528
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,760
to you as time goes by.

529
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:07,420
Ming Wei.

530
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,770
You are back.

531
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,060
Don't worry.

532
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,140
Dad has left the hospital.

533
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,660
Why do you tell me about it?

534
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,570
It's none of my business.

535
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,660
Ming Wei.

536
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,780
I know the Xu family owes you.

537
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,260
I didn't expect you

538
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,020
can accept me as your brother in a short time.

539
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,690
It's okay.

540
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,540
You can regard me as

541
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,340
a friend like you did before.

542
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,860
Do you think we can still be friends?

543
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,540
If we are friends,

544
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,650
why did you

545
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:52,060
reject Ming Qiao in that way

546
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,220
and hurt her?

547
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,820
Go, sir.

548
00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:29,820
Why are you back?

549
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:30,780
The crew didn't provide you with dinner?

550
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,020
Can't I come back to have dinner with you?

551
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,480
I don't need your company.

552
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:36,880
I plan to invite Ming Qiao for dinner.

553
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,500
What nonsense

554
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:41,310
are you talking about?

555
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:44,340
I have decided to

556
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,820
chase Ming Qiao back.
