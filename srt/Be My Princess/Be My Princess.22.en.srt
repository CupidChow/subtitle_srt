What are these?

00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,260
These are bred by myself.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,220
I want to give them to Your Highness.

6
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,550
But I have realized that

7
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,460
even a more beautiful flower

8
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:37,550
would be cast into the shade of

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,220
the beauty of Your Highness.

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:41,780
Your Highness dresses like this

11
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,840
to attend the dinner party this evening?

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,180
Right.

13
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,940
Do I look good?

14
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:53,350
You look terrific.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,420
Your Highness looks great in the white dress.

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,420
You can wear white color more often.

17
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:00,620
It gives a feeling of pureness.

18
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,500
Really?

19
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,200
I was just thinking

20
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,660
if this is too solid.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,780
No.

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,210
The beauty of Your Highness and elegance of the white dress

23

complement each other.

24
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,860
From now on, you can wear white more.

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,700
No way.

26
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,400
You can only wear it in front of me.

34
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,140
Did you give reporters

35
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,670
some misleading news which

36
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,870
caused the appearance of those online articles?

37
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,290
I didn't do anything.

38
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,700
Tingzhou, you cannot misunderstand me like this.

39
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,740
Lin, we grew up together,

40
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,220
and we went out to some events together sometimes.

41
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,080
Why did those marketing accounts

42
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,180
write you as my girlfriend out of sudden?

43
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,930
How do I know?

44
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,220
You think I set this up?

45
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,260
You should know well

46
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,100
what kind of person I am, Tingzhou.

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,130
Lin, you know about me.

48
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,100
I don't like to be disturbed by the rumors.

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,659
At the same time, it is not necessary to let Ming Wei get involved in

50
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:49,940
our businesses.

51
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,270
Alright, Tingzhou,

52
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,700
you don't need to be angry about this.

53
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,420
Something like this would run out of heat in several days.

I swear that

55
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,510
I have never said I am your girlfriend.

56
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,540
Right.

57
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,490
There was indeed a marketing account who asked me this question

58
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,540
that day.

59
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,340
But I didn't answer to it or respond.

60
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,660
It had never come to my mind that they could have

61
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,180
rehearsed everything like that.

62
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,900
So you did not deny it when they asked you?

63
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,740
I....

64
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,150
Tingzhou, you have to trust me.

65
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,460
I did not mean that to happen.

66
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,860
I didn't know this would affect everybody.

67
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,580
I was just too lazy to

68
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,180
explain.

69
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,860
At least,

70
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,620
I did not do it on purpose.

71
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,490
Stop being mad at me, will you?

72
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,980
Alright.

73
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,140
You can leave now.

74
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,820
Alright, stop crying.

Isn't Mu Tingzhou always

76
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,450
direct like this?

77
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,990
Ming Wei is already suffering,

78
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,820
and you added insult to injury.

79
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,950
It's not Tingzhou's fault to be angry.

80
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,700

81
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,260
do you like Ming Wei too?

82
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,030
Don't be ridiculous.

83
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,340
I think

84
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,159
Ming Wei is your real biological sister.

85
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,940
To me,

86
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,390
Ming Wei has only herself to blame.

87
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,220
Tingzhou lost all of his memories, she didn't.

88
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,220
She should have mentally prepared.

89
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,260
Furthermore,

90
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,420
are you sure

91
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,050
she is not onto anything?

92
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,570
But on this matter,

93
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,180
she only agreed

94
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,860
because me and Tingzhou's parents went to ask her for this favor.

95
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:08,980
I feel it is unfair that

96
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:10,420
she is the only one to take the blame.

97
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,860
It is unfair to Ming Wei?

98
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,940
You are really my biological brother.

99
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,500
All of you are

100
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,540
on Ming Wei's side.

101
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:27,900
Nevertheless,

102
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,700
the media can exaggerate the truth and escalate it to this level

103
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,140
only based on your noncommittal attitude.

104
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,020
I feel there must be

105
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,400
someone who is behind all of these and

106
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,500
this is not simple like that.

107
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,159
Are you done with talking?

108

pay attention to our work itself,

I believe these rumors

127
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:45,140
I believe it would not affect

128

129

I believe what you said,

131
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,540

act this role.

134
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,000
Very unfortunate.

135
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,570
I am not very satisfied with you.

Please say it, and I will rectify.

To be accurate,

139
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,980
I am highly unsatisfied to

Mu Tingzhou and Xu Lin.

141
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:32,420
They are the ones who caused all of these.

The other one is your biological sister.

Until now,

145
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,620
neither of them has come out to apologize.

146
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,480
You don't even say a word about it.

147
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,140
Right.

148
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,490
About this,

149
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,570
I have berated Xu Lin.

150
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,220
She likes Tingzhou as well,

151
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,080
for many years.

152
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,500
She got in over her head this time.

153
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,500
But I am sure that

154
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:52,940
Xu Lin was not doing it on purpose to set Ming Wei up.

155
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:58,440
How about Mu Tingzhou?

156
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,890
About Tingzhou,

157
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,480
he has a strong self-consciousness.

158
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,100
It has not been long since he had recovered his memories.

159
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,900
There are many things

160
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,850
he needs to understand again.

161
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,140
But I know,

162
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,300
Tingzhou

163
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,740
knows what's right and what's wrong.

164
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,140
When he thinks it all out,

165
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,380
he will do whatever he believes are right

166
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,940
based on the rights and wrongs of the case.

167
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,060
I have faith in him.

168
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:23,540
After all,

169
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,950
you are on Mu Tingzhou's side, aren't you?

170
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,590
Two of you are in one family,

171
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,980

Thinking from a long-term perspective,

174
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,140
you are closer to me.

175
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,220
Mu Tingzhou is just a friend.

176
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,950
I really worry about my sister.

177
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,860
I cannot let her be more upset.

178
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:17,450
Wang Yingying speaks out to expose Cheng Yao.

179
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,910
[Actress Wang Yingying revealed Cheng Yao as the manipulator.]

180
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:30,780
You dug up my dirt

181
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,540
and cried out for Ming Wei?

182
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,870
What were you thinking?

183
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,270
Are you out of your mind?

184
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,620
You confused right and wrong

185
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,580
and put the title of mistress

186
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,900
on Ming Wei on purpose.

187
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,210
Did I wrong you?

188
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,360
You can treat Ming Wei like this today.

189
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,700
The next will be me.

190
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,940
I know you now.

191
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,870
It is good that you know.

192
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,220
Can't you think with your brain?

193
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,820
I can trap her in the scandal,

194
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:56,100
I can destroy you as well.

195
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,350
Of course I know you have such ability.

196
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,280
But I'm afraid of nothing now.

197
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,580
Do whatever you want.

198
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,140
Name it.

199
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,790
What do you want?

200
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:14,980
What benefits did Ming Wei give you?

201
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,320
I would like to ask you.

202
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:21,700
For all these years,

203
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,360
what benefits did you give me?

204
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,220
Actually, for all these years,

205
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,060
I always know

206
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,780
you have other girlfriends.

207
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,390
But I have kept on cheating myself.

208
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,940
I really hope I could make you moved.

209
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,690
I hope I can

210
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,480
stand with you openly one day.

211
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,360
But the fact is that

212
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,990
I have thought too much.

213
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:43,530
I have found out about it.

214
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,420
You are about to get engaged to the lady of Xunda Group

215
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,140
soon.

216
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,340
In the past,

217
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,330
no matter how humble I was,

218
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,820
I was your girlfriend.

219
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,460
But if the relationship

220
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,530
continues,

221
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,690
will I become a third wheel, a mistress as well?

222
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,910
It is okay if you look down on me.

223
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,780
But I cannot look down on myself.

224
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,440
Don't regret if you leave.

225
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,870
You actually know in your heart

226
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,650
that you can never marry me,

227
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,340
right?

228
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:50,210
Thank you

229
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,310
for helping me when I'm in difficulty.

230
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,580
Don't thank me.

231
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,940
I also did this for myself.

232
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,940
I have made a decision through this.

233
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,770
It is Chen Zhang who tried to persuade me

234
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,170
to think more for myself.

235
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,220
He also introduced a new play for me.

236
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,180
I don't make unprofitable deals.

237
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:08,140
Chen Zhang?

238
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,470
He told you to post on Weibo?

239
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,650
Yes.

240
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,300
Don't you know it was him

241
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,620
who asked friends

242
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,050
to investigate

243
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:17,590
who was trying to harm you?

244
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,740
And he asked my help

245
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,760
to expose Cheng Yao together.

246
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,300
You are so lucky.

247
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,550
After Mu Tingzhou left,

248
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,880
here comes Chen Zhang.

249
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:31,790
There are always someone protecting you around.

250
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:34,970
Whatever the reason is,

251
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,710
your final decision

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,150
helped me a lot.

253
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,020
I have kept it in mind.

254
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,220
If anything comes to you in the future,

255
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,820
I will try my best to help you.

256
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:47,340
OK. I will also keep that in mind.

257
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,080
Well,

258
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,580
then we are not enemies anymore.

259
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,780
Maybe see you again in the future.

260
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,900
See you.

261
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,380
Wang Yingying did do something good this time.

262
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,340
But netizens are saying that

263
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,780
you became famous thanks to Mu Tingzhou who lost his memories.

264
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,500
If Mu Tingzhou is willing to stand out

265
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,900
and say something for you,

266
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,700
All the problems will be solved.

267
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,450
I don't think

268
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,820
he will speak for me.

269
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,660
Don't be so pessimistic.

270
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,620
If it is not convenient for you, I can talk to him.

271
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,750
He would at least show me some respect.

272
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:32,820
Ms. Shen,

273
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,420
please don't go.

274
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,620
Save some dignity for me.

275
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,000
I don't want to beg him.

276
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:48,710
[Actress Wang Yingying revealed Cheng Yao as the manipulator.]

277
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,060
If you are a man,

278
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,300
say something for Ming Wei quickly.

279
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,700
Her work is influenced because of you.

280
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,980
And she is being criticized on the Internet every day.

281
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,040
Isn't she wronged?

282
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,780
If you don't post anything, I will post for you.

283
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:04,820
I will definitely say something

284
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,860
in all fairness to her.

285
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,720
But I cannot figure out one thing.

286
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,180
Ming Wei knew I lost my memories

287
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,040
and I was at an abnormal situation

288
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,020
at that time.

289
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,310
Why did she promise to marry me,

290
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,650
no,

291
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:18,170
marry Grand Tutor?

292
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,420
Don't you think it is strange?

293
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,300
You are being eloquent now.

294
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,420
You didn't see what you were like when you lost your memories.

295
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:27,210
You were quite sure

296
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,820
you were Grand Tutor.

297
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,860
You almost dragged me out for having my head cut off

298
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,360
for Ming Wei.

299
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:34,020
I regret it so much that I didn't record it for you.

300
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,100
You were relentless to Ming Wei.

301
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,100
When she didn't agree to be your girlfriend,

302
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,380
you knelt down and told her your difficulties.

303
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,260
she tried to break up with you,

304
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,060
you behaved to give up yourself.

305
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,180
In the end,

306
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,620
you just

307
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,400
left the mess to her

308
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,620
after saying "I don't remember anything".

309
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,420
You dare to do it but not admit it?

310
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,460
Mu Tingzhou,

311
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,240
don't make me look down on you.

312
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:01,860
Chen Zhang,

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I really don't know how to thank you.

314
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,250
Thank you for

315
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:06,470
doing so much for me.

316
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:08,930
If Wang Yingying didn't tell me,

317
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,940
do you plan to keep it as a secret?

318
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,140
It is not a big deal.

319
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,700
Why should I tell you?

320
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,420
As long as the problem is solved

321
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,619
and your mood is good,

322
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,980
my wish comes true.

323
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,869
You can just be happy

324
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,829
and I will deal with your problems.

325
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:27,339
OMG. I'm so moved.

326
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,440
How about this?

327
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:31,920
After the meal,

328
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,710
Let's become sworn brothers and sisters.

329
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,450
Then, it's a pity.

330
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,140
I intended to get a beautiful girlfriend.

331
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,800
Who can predict that you would become my sister?

332
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,530
Chen Zhang.

333
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,270
I know about your feelings.

334
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,980
I like you very much, too.

335
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,990
But

336
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,790
it is the like

337
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:58,460
between friends.

338
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,370
To be honest,

339
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
I cannot really

340
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,180
forget Grand Tutor,

341
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,040
nor walk out from the pain of break-up until now.

342
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,500
I still feel sad

343
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:22,290

I think the reason why I lost my memory

493
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:05,980
is that I have great passion

494

00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,500

506

consider it an extra story,

I want to talk to you about something.

515
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,340
What is it?

516
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,980
I asked you before

517
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,200
if you had any request,

518
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,110
but you rejected me.

519
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,360
But I think that

520
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,200
out of moral concerns,

521
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,100
I have to compensate you.

522
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,870
Say it, how much do you want,

523
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,290
or if you have some better idea,

524
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,100
I will make sure to meet your demand.

525
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,800
The sincere relationship

526
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,700
between Grand Tutor and me

527
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,620
was regarded by you as

528
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,860
an extra story gifted to the audience.

529
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,560
What I had with Grand Tutor was sincere and true.

530
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,900
But you just keep

531
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,540
prating on about money.

532
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,740
Now that you have regained your memory,

533
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,140
you could just put an end to everything in the past

534
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,740
at your will.

535
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,100
Maybe for you,

536
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,780
Grand Tutor is just a character.

537
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,620
But for me,

538
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,820
he is a living person

539
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,100
who I will never forget.

540
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,100
From now on,

541
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,620
you have nothing to do

542
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,540
with him,

543
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,260
and I

544
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,230
have nothing to do with you.

545
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,940
You are not even a quarter as good as him.

546
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,140
Are you done?

547
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,960
I can understand the pain you have been through.

548
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,490
But everything

549
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,540
can be negotiated.

550
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,540
Ming Wei.

551
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,500
If you don't want to break Ming Wei's heart again,

552
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,100
don't come near her anymore.

553
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:42,420
[You are my princess.]

554
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:17,780
[You are my princess.]

555
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:30,880
[You are my princess.]

556
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:29,810
[You are my princess.]

557
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,900
Xiao Zhao.

558
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,140
Get Mu Tingzhou on the phone.

559
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,040
What did he say to my sister today?

560
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,740
Why is she still not home?

561
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,180
Don't worry.

562
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:43,610
Ming Wei has always been a steady person.

563
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,180
I don't think anything serious will happen.

564
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,110
Did you call her?

565
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,540
I did.

566
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,860
All she did was cry.

567
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,400
She wouldn't say nothing.

568
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,010
[Xiao Zhao]

569
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,210
What I said to your sister today

570
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,740
was rather inappropriate.

571
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,510
But I had no ill intentions.

572
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,410
Now, think.

573
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,180
Where does she usually go?

574
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:04,140
Let's split up and look for her, alright?

575
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:04,870
You are back.

576
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,420
Hi Auntie, Uncle, I'm Chen Zhang.

577
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,949
I'm Ming Wei's good friend.

578
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,909
I'm hanging up, my sister is back.

579
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,540
Ming Wei is feeling a little unwell.

580
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,940
You don't need to be too worried.

581
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,070
Thank you, Mr. Chen.

582
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,370
Sorry you had to make a special trip down.

583
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,170
It's alright.

584
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,120
Why don't you stay for a while?

585
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,520
Ming Wei needs to rest.

586
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,219
Goodbye.

587
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,699
Thank you.

588
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,219
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

589
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:52,540
Wei.

590
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,780
Wei, what happened?

591
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,980
Tell dad.

592
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,300
Dad is here for you.

593
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:01,500
Wei,

594
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,600
did Mu Tingzhou bully you?

595
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,860
Tell me,

596
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,640
I will go get even with him.

597
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,450
Dad,

598
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,140
Mom,

599
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:19,540
Qiao,

600
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,500
I'm alright.

601
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,630
Sorry to make you worry.

602
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,380
Don't you think

603
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,460
you went a little too far with Ming Wei?

604
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,190
I just don't understand

605
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,510
why she had such a big reaction.

606
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,020
In my opinion,

607
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,540
she was maligned as the other woman before.

608
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,260
Even though there was a manipulator behind the scenes,

609
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,920
Xu Lin also fanned the flames.

610
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,410
Of course, I am also responsible,

611
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,060
so I feel like I owe her

612
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,460
and I want to make up to her through my actions.

613
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,220
I didn't expect it to have the opposite effect.

614
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,100
I'm begging you.

615
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,420
Please stop thinking about others

616
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,060
with your low emotional intelligence, alright?

617
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,300
What she needs from you is not compensation,

618
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,360
but your understanding and respect.

619
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,980
What you said at the press conference

620
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,850
was so hurtful.

621
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,210
That it was an extra story, a free gift?

622
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,340
Only you could think of that.

623
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,030
Even I felt Ming Wei was so wronged.

624
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,100
Mu Tingzhou.

625
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:11,360
Will you please talk less and stop causing problems

626
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:14,060
with the Ming sisters, alright?

627
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,940
Once Ming Wei is upset,

628
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,100
Ming Qiao would definitely fight with me.

629
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,300
I finally settled down and got a girlfriend.

630
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,660
Don't ruin it.

631
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,520
Auntie Zhao, take a break.

632
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:40,650
Come, sit down and eat with us.

633
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:41,290
Alright.

634
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,220
Auntie Zhao,

635
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,910
this dessert is delicious.

636
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:44,900
Right?

637
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,940
If it's good, I will make more for you tomorrow.

638
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,550
Here, Tingzhou.

639
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:02,910
Someone is here. Let me take a look.

640
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,690
It's Mr. Ming.

641
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,410
Mr. Ming.

642
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:32,300
Hello, Mr. Ming.

643
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,630
Why are you here?

644
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,050
I'm here for Mu Tingzhou.

645
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:39,940
This is...

646
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,060
This is Miss Ming's father,

647
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,680
Mr. Ming Qiang.

648
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,260
Oh, it's Mr. Ming.

649
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,420
You are here so early in the morning.

650
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,620
Is there something wrong?

651
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,660
I'm looking for Mu Tingzhou.

652
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,260
It has nothing to do with you.

653
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:52,990
Mu Tingzhou.

654
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,080
What's the matter?

655
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,020
What's wrong?

656
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,940
Mr. Ming,

657
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,980
although I don't know you,

658
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,610
if you have anything you want to say, you can say it straight.

659
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,610
You don't know me?

660
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,460
When you were chasing after Ming Wei,

661
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:08,120
it became the talk of the town.

662
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,460
Now you say you don't know her, and it's all gone?

663
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,120
It's alright if it's all gone,

664
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,540
because my daughter Ming Wei

665
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,610
is able to leave any man without entanglement,

666
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,470
otherwise she's not my daughter.

667
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,860
Yet, you

668
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,060
had to rub salt into her wound

669
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,930
and embarrass her at the press conference.

670
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,880
Did Ming Wei or the Ming family

671
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,300
offend you in any way?

672
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,140
Do you still call yourself a man

673
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,650
having done this?

674
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,060
Mr. Ming,

675
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,300
I think there's a misunderstanding.

676
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,180
It wasn't my intention to lose my memories.

677
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,580
Neither was it my intention to

678
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,710
embarrass Ming Wei.

679
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,870
Not your intention.

680
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,340
So Ming Wei deserves to be unlucky?

681
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,400
Is this your logic?

682
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,460
That's not what I meant.

683
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,660
Then what do you mean?

684
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:48,510
No, Mr. Ming.

685
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,220
You really misunderstood Tingzhou

686
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,100
and us.

687
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,890
We have always been grateful to Ming Wei.

688
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,940
We have never wanted to hurt her.

689
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,340
Never wanted to hurt her?

690
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,240
Are you saying that you didn't

691
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,580
spread the rumors about her being the other woman?

692
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:03,060
The other woman?

693
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:03,970
Mr. Ming.

694
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,740
Can we talk calmly?

695
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:06,860
Calmly?

696
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,540
That's what people like you who haven't been hurt

697
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,300
would say.

698
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,440
I can't do that.

699
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,440
I can't tolerate my daughter being hurt.

700
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,980
Could you be calm?

701
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:18,500
Mr. Ming.

702
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,820
Ming Wei faces these problems today,

703
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:21,950
and you feel sad now.

704
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,420
I have to ask,

705
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,910
why didn't you stop her in the first place?

706
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,620
Why did you tolerate your daughter

707
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,460
letting things get to this stage?

708
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,500
As a parent,

709
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,240
shouldn't you shoulder at least some of the responsibility here?

710
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,940
Sure, it's our fault.

711
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,680
It's our fault as parents,

712
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,100
that we didn't educate our child well.

713
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,160
So we have to be your doormat blindly.

714
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,580
Is there anything wrong?

715
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:51,180
No, no, thank you.

716
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,620
Mr. Ming,

717
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,060
we are both parents.

718
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,110
I understand what you are feeling.

719
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:00,660
Why don't we talk inside?

720
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,660
Come.

721
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,180
What else is there to say?

722
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:04,380
Mom.

723
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,580
Mom, are you OK?

724
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,340
Here.

725
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,260
Why did you get physical?

726
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,980
Are you forcing me to call the police?

727
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,060
Slowly. Careful.

728
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:12,540
-Here. -Mom.

729
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:13,750
Lean on me. Hold me.

730
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:16,340
Hello,

731
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,180
is this 110?

732
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,410
Mom.

733
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,700
Ming Wei,

734
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,750
come and have breakfast

735
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,420
after you wash up.

736
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,210
Mom specially made

737
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:31,870
your favorite fish porridge today.

738
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,900
Alright, got it.

739
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,410
Where's dad?

740
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,340
Dad went for his morning exercise.

741
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,780
It's been more than an hour, why isn't he back yet?

742
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:45,340
Let me give him a call.

743
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,220
OK.

744
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,780
Hello, who is this?

745
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,380
Hello.

746
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,610
Your dad just broke into Mr. Mu Tingzhou's residence.

747
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,060
He is being detained at the street police station.

748
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,860
Come quickly.

749
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,260
What?

750
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:03,920
What happened?

751
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,540
Mu Tingzhou sent dad to the police station.

752
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,940
Luckily the doctor said it's relatively minor.

753
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,700
Otherwise,

754
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:16,060
this would not be easily resolved.

755
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,410
It's alright, OK.

756
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,140
It's just that

757
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,440
my waist hurts.

758
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,160
Let me lean on that.

759
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:22,820
Here.

760
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,220
Alright, lean on this.

761
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,820
Careful, careful. Alright.

762
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:26,850
I'm OK.

763
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,100
OK.

764
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,700
Who's that?

765
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,940
Why did you have to call the police on my dad?

766
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,100
If you have a problem with me,

767
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,430
just bring it up with me.

768
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,220
Why did you have to do that to my dad?

769
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,660
What did my dad do?

770
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,540
Miss Ming.

771
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
Please calm down.

772
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:13,420
My dad has been taken away, how can I be calm?

773
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:15,220
Let me tell you, Mu Tingzhou.

774
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,820
If anything happens to my dad,

775
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,930
this won't be over.
