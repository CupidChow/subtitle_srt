Did she say yes?

92

Since she didn't say yes,

175
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,750
must love me with all his heart.

176
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,110
But what he cares most about

177
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,060
should not be the official identities of an official and the princess.

178
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,740
We are in the era of free love.

179
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,450
I really like Ming Wei.

180
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:42,350
[Jinfeng]

181
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,800
Who do you think you are to stop me?

182
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
At least Chen Zhang isn't being nice to me

183
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,940
out of responsibility.

184
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,300
Mr. Mu.

185
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,300
Your Highness.

186
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,190
Why aren't you calling me Grand Tutor?

187
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,860
Grand Tutor.

188
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,580
Grand Tutor.

189
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,820
Don't worry, Your Highness.

190
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,500
I'm okay.

191
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,220
Chen Zhang,

192
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,820
there's still a lot to do with the crew.

193
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,350
Why don't you go back first?

194
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,020
I think Ming Wei

195
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
will be able to resume filming soon.

196
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:01,460
Yeah, Chen Zhang.

197
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,760
Sorry for the trouble.

198
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,700
We really appreciate your help.

199
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:07,980
Alright then.

200
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,160
Xiao Zhao, Shen Su,

201
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:10,710
I will update the crew.

202
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm gonna go.

203
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,780
Alright, goodbye.

204
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,580
OK, thanks.

205
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,190
We should leave too.

206
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,540
They're all right now,

207
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,780
but there's still a ton of PR matters to be dealt with.

208
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,100
The Princess and Grand Tutor have been trending

209
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,230
for countless times these two months.

210
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:29,340
If there's anything you need, I'm happy to help.

211
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,740
Alright, I'm gonna go. Goodbye.

212
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,220
Bye.

213
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,220
-Goodbye. -Bye.

214
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,020
Xiao Zhao, it's time for dinner.

215
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,820
Why don't we have the meal first?

216
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,300
I'm a little worried about Tingzhou.

217
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,760
Why don't you go ahead?

218
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,150
They have to eat too.

219
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:47,100
Don't you know what Mr. Mu loves to eat?

220
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,020
Let's go together.

221
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:48,820
Alright.

222
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,050
Let's go.

223
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,190
Grand Tutor,

224
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,860
it was too dangerous.

225
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,890
I wanted to stop

226
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,680
but I couldn't control it.

227
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,380
I rolled down the hill.

228
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:07,000
My heart was about to jump out of my chest.

229
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,860
But I know you protected me

230
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,100
against all the injuries.

231
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,630
I'm so glad you're okay,

232
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,500
otherwise, I would blame myself for the rest of my life.

233
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Your Highness, you've got it wrong.

234
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,420
If I couldn't protect you

235
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,110
and let you get injured,

236
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,180
I would regret it for the rest of my life.

237
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,660
Grand Tutor, you're exaggerating.

238
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,230
I have thought about

239
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,670
Your Highness's concerns.

240
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,540
I asked myself,

241
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,420
if I would like to protect you

242
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:49,650
for the rest of my life

243
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,700
notwithstanding my identity as Grand Tutor

244
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,630
and the commitment to His Majesty.

245
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,460
When I saw Your Highness fall off the horse,

246
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,850
I had my answer.

247
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,980
Even if it was not my responsibility,

248
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,500
I, Mu Yun, would be willing to risk my life

249
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,860
to protect you.

250
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,780
I no longer see you only as a student.

251
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,330
I have feelings for you.

252
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,620
No matter whether Your Highness will accept my proposal,

253
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:22,900
I, Mu Yun, swear on my character,

254
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:26,770
to protect Your Highness

255
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,570
for my whole life.

256
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,180
Grand Tutor,

257
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,350
you have been lying for so long.

258
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,600
Let me get you a glass of water.

259
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,360
Your Highness,

260
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:47,500
you did not answer.

261
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,100
Do you accept me?

262
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,650
One day,

263
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,220
if you find out I'm not the Princess,

264
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,920
would you still risk your life

265
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,780
to save me like you did today?

266
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,099
I would.

267
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,300
Mr. Mu is too picky.

268
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,610
He doesn't eat anything that's not fresh,

269
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,870
too oily,

270
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,630
or has onions or garlic.

271
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,370
He doesn't eat the outer leaves,

272
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:41,780
and even the inner leaves have to be cut thinly.

273
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,440
Even an emperor would be easier to be dealt with.

274
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,620
Thanks for your help, Xiao Zhao.

275
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,170
Actually it's okay.

276
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,890
Tingzhou can be kind and cute.

277
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,380
You guys just don't know him yet.

278
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,500
You really are the best entertainment agent,

279
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,220
with both high IQ and EQ.

280
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,860
What would Mr. Mu do without you?

281
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,100
I used to think he couldn't live without me

282
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,870
and I was the only one who knew him best.

283
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,700
But now,

284
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,980
no matter what Ming Wei gives him,

285
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,180
onion or garlic,

286
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,620
even if it was poison, he would take it.

287
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,820
Are you jealous of my sister?

288
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:24,150
Come on, isn't it a special period?

289
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,170
He is the Grand Tutor now, not the Best Actor.

290
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,250
Isn't he supposed to eat whatever

291
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,580
the Princess gives him?

292
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:33,100
I could imagine from the Grand Tutor

293
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,080
how Mu Tingzhou will take dates before mates

294
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,940
when he gets into a relationship.

295
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,500
Don't laugh.

296
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,510
I feel quite terrible,

297
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,900
like I'm the outsider now.

298
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,260
Xiao Zhao,

299
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,630
you're the best in my heart.

300
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,380
Your Highness, you don't have to do this.

301
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,380
I can do it myself.

302
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,900
Grand Tutor,

303
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,630
I will go back to the show tomorrow.

304
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,300
Then I wouldn't be able to be here

305
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,500
even if you want me to.

306
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,060
Seize the opportunity today.

307
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:31,300
Your Highness, you are royalty.

308
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,500
How come you serve me?

309
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,320
I couldn't take it.

310
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,150
Grand Tutor, you asked me to marry you before.

311
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,770
If we got married,

312
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,750
shouldn't I take care of my injured husband?

313
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,380
Your Highness,

314
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,320
did you mean you accept the proposal?

315
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,300
It was just a metaphor.

316
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,620
My hand hurts.

317
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,360
Your Highness,

318
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,180
why don't you help me?

319
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,140
No, I won't.

320
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,280
Your Highness.

321
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,970
Your Highness.

322
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,340
When I was little,

323
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,900
I also thought

324
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,000
I was the closest person to my sister.

325
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,800
Isn't it like that?

326
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,700
When she was in a relationship,

327
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,830
I would get jealous.

328
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,070
I confirmed with her many times

329
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,260
if her boyfriend and I

330
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,260
fell into the water at the same time,

331
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,060
whether she would save me first.

332
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,220
You asked that question?

333
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,850
In the end, I realized

334
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,580
I should never get too picky

335
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,110
about who loves who the most

336
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,700
in a close relationship.

337
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,660
No matter who she loves the most,

338
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,100
I will always be her only sister.

339
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:06,980
So, Xiao Zhao,

340
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,380
[Nurse's Station]

341
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:08,780
same for you.

342
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,400
For the Best Actor,

343
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,100
you are definitely irreplaceable too.

344
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,100
Sister,

345
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:57,990
have you got together with the Best Actor?

346
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,940
I have not decided yet.

347
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:03,420
You have not?

348
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,550
The answer is on your face, sister.

349
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:12,260
I really have not made up my mind.

350
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,890
After all,

351
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:15,730
the one I like is the Grand Tutor.

352
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,780
And you know the situation.

353
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,260
We don't know if Mu Tingzhou and Grand Tutor

354
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,920
are the same person or not.

355
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,000
Is this important?

356
00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:27,810
As long as you like the person standing in front of you

357
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,540
and you want to have him,

358
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,080
isn't that enough?

359
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,590
At least for me, if I liked someone,

360
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,880
I wouldn't care about who he used to be

361
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,420
or what he would become.

362
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,070
As long as my heart beats for him right now,

363
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,730
and I feel like

364
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,300
being with him forever,

365
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,280
I would work hard for that.

366
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,020
Qiao,

367
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,540
have you had a crush on someone?

368
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,620
I suppose so.

369
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,530
Who?

370
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,420
How did you guys meet?

371
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,020
Is he your classmate?

372
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,300
I will tell you when I have confirmed it.

373
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,940
No,

374
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,340
you have to tell me now.

375
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,460
I'm your elder sister.

376
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:12,940
I have to make sure he's a good person for you.

377
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,350
I will tell you next time.

378
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,700
Xiao Zhao.

379
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,230
Miss Mings, shall we leave now?

380
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:20,800
OK.

381
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,650
Let's go.

382
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,500
There you are. Let me help you.

383
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,300
OK, thank you.

384
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,680
I was wondering if Tingzhou knew how to get the food.

385
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,870
He'd better know how to get food

386
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:47,210
without me.

387
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,580
That's right.

388
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,620
Go back to the hospital quickly.

389
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,680
He's a patient now.

390
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,180
He needs more care than I do.

391
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,640
I would not dare to go back.

392
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,460
If I did, I would certainly get criticized.

393
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,480
Don't you know?

394
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Now, in his heart,

395
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,150
your matter is the most important thing in the world.

396
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,780
He even puts himself behind.

397
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,480
Let's just eat.

398
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,140
Arrange for dates.

399
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,740
Create opportunities for interaction.

400
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:29,340
[Arrange dates, create opportunities for interaction.]

401
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,760
Send gifts when appropriate.

402
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,320
Create surprises for her.

403
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:35,300
Choose a suitable time to show her the love.

404
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,880
Didn't I ask you to take care of the Princess?

405
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,140
Why are you back?

406
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,340
Mr. Mu.

407
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,750
Thanks.

408
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,440
Thank you for coming to see me,

409
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,850
but I think that isn't

410
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,300
the only reason of it.

411
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,020
Mr. Mu, you're right.

412
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,980
Besides coming to see you,

413
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,340
I also want to thank you

414
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,300
for saving Ming Wei.

415
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,030
Her Highness and I have feelings for each other.

416
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,430
You don't have to thank me

417
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,810
as an outsider.

418
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,930
Actually,

419
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:37,890
I should have understood

420
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,700
from Ming Wei's reaction that day.

421
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,230
I have said this before that

422
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:45,110
you are not going to make it.

423
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,380
Mr. Mu.

424
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,230
I always see you as an idol,

425
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,910
a goal that I strive for,

426
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,260
and even a god to me.

427
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,650
I never expected that

428
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,360
we would fight for the same woman one day.

429
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,460
But, how can one give up easily

430
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,820
in love?

431
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,820
I'm not Mu Tingzhou,

432
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,980
but I know he is a good actor.

433
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,320
If you see him as your goal,

434
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,680
it means you have your ambitions.

435
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,930
It's true.

436
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,290
No one gives up easily in love.

437
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,180
But if you've already foreseen the result,

438
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,180
you still have to admit the failure.

439
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:24,810
Of course,

440
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:26,940
I respect Ming Wei's decision.

441
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:29,410
But honestly,

442
00:26:29,810 --> 00:26:32,070
I don't have a good feeling about you two.

443
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,670
Before you woke up that day,

444
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,570
Ming Wei was very nervous.

445
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,410
I could tell

446
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,420
besides your injuries,

447
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,100
she was actually also afraid

448
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,380
that you would no longer be the Grand Tutor when you woke up.

449
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:45,710
She was afraid you would not remember her.

450
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,100
So Mr. Mu, have you ever thought about

451
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,860
what would happen to Ming Wei

452
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,880
if the Grand Tutor completely disappeared one day?

453
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:58,530
I would never leave Her Highness alone.

454
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,020
I hope that is enough for her to feel secured.

455
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,260
If there's nothing else, I'll leave you be.

456
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,170
Grand Tutor.

457
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,010
Why don't you stay in the hospital

458
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:49,810
but come here?

459
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,280
I've basically recovered

460
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,660
and am ready to be discharged from the hospital.

461
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,720
Also, I've missed Your Highness a lot

462
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,100
since you were not by my side.

463
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,900
Your Highness must have worked very hard these days.

464
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,540
I've brought your favorite face wash paste

465
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,150
and the snacks you like.

466
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,460
Here.

467
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,020
You need to take good care of yourself

468
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,220
when shooting on set.

469
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,410
Grand Tutor,

470
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:18,260
I'm fine.

471
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,940
Don't worry about me.

472
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,060
It's you that I'm worried about.

473
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,190
You need to take good care of yourself.

474
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,790
Why don't you say anything?

475
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,780
I feel very happy.

476
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,830
I seem to have a lot to say to you,

477
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,280
but don't know where to start.

478
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,840
I've never had any love affairs with anyone before.

479
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,740
This is the first time I'm in love.

480
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,460
I only know by now

481
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,140
the happiness of love described in the poems.

482
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:04,380
It's really fantastic.

483
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,980
Nonsense.

484
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,470
Don't you feel happy, Your Highness?

485
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,140
I've always thought you are a fuddy-duddy,

486
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,180
but you are quite the opposite.

487
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,980
How am I the opposite?

488
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,860
Say it.

489
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,780
Ming Wei, you should change your clothes.

490
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,420
Alright, on my way.

491
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,820
Grand Tutor, I have to go.

492
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,700
Go back, it's freezing here.

493
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,460
No.

494
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:52,060
I'll wait when you shoot.

495
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,740
Please, go back.

496
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,660
Please, go shooting.

497
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,740
OK, I'll go.

498
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,120
I'm going.

499
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,370
OK.

500
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,450
Who do you think I, Yu Wanyin, am?

501
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,340
I...

502
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,140
I...

503
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,540
Your Highness, you've mixed the lines.

504
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:01,150
It's all your fault.

505
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,180
I've done nothing.

506
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:05,860
You are here,

507
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,700
and that's the distraction.

508
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,580
By the way, Your Highness,

509
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,900
when will you finish shooting this show?

510
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,260
Maybe after the New Year.

511
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,660
Why?

512
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,020
I've thought it through.

513
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,550
After you finish shooting,

514
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,180
I'll go ask permission from

515
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,620
your parents in this world for you to marry me.

516
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,380
As long as I get their permission,

517
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,860
I'll set a lucky date for us

518
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,170
to get married.

519
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:38,660
Is it OK?

520
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,260
Grand Tutor,

521
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,190
you may know yourself, too,

522
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,030
that around the nation,

523
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:54,800
only you believe yourself to be the Grand Tutor.

524
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,420
All others,

525
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,980
including myself,

526
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:03,740
believe that you are a patient with a temporary memory loss.

527
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,880
The doctor came up with three possibilities about your state of illness.

528
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,500
First,

529
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,690
you'll have a complete memory loss.

530
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,060
But it's not very likely.

531
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,100
Second,

532
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,300
when you recover,

533
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,360
you'll recall all your memories.

534
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,260
And the last,

535
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:41,910
you'll recover your memory before the car crash.

536
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,860
That means you may forget

537
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,670
what happens during recovery.

538
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,660
That is to say,

539
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,540
when you recover,

540
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,700
you may deny the relationship between us.

541
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,900
In this sense,

542
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:05,060
do you think my parents will agree to our marriage?

543
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,550
Are you scared, Your Highness?

544
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:13,340
When you turn back to the Best Actor,

545
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,040
if you really forget about me,

546
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,340
but I still remember you,

547
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,080
won't it be just like heartbreak?

548
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,420
I'll be pitiful, right?

549
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,020
If that day really comes,

550
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,840
will you go find Mu Tingzhou, Your Highness?

551
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,010
Maybe you don't want to hear this,

552
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,080
but your real identity is the Best Actor.

553
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,510
The gap between me and the Best Actor is too large.

554
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,260
I'm not brave enough to face Mu Tingzhou's arrogance,

555
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,870
nor do I have the courage

556
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,620
to bear the gossip of

557
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,100
a new actress chasing after the Best Actor.

558
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:24,469
Alright, alright.

559
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,340
Let's not think too much.

560
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,639
I'm already on top of the world

561
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,050
to have met you.

562
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,670
Grand Tutor.

563
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,320
This...

564
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:21,540
is peony?

565
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,230
Your Highness is royal,

566
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,020
only the peony can match your identity.

567
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:30,900
Ummm...

568
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,410
Others send blooming flowers when they are in relationship,

569
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,380
but the flowers in your pot haven't bloomed yet.

570
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:37,260
What's to look at, the bare branches?

571
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,500
The flowers picked outside

572
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,980
will wither in a few days.

573
00:35:40,330 --> 00:35:41,590
But this pot of flowers

574
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:43,420
will bloom every March and April

575
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,780
as long as you take good care of it.

576
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,530
But

577
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:52,140
I've never taken care of peonies before.

578
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,940
I'm afraid I can't raise it well.

579
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,450
Please feel assured, Your Highness.

580
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:57,020
I'll take care of it for you.

581
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,860
You only need to come and see it, Your Highness.

582
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,340
Teach me then.

583
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,940
First we need to apply fertilizer, Your Highness.

584
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,260
Like this.

585
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,980
You've had a long day, Your Highness.

586
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,840
What do you want to eat for dinner?

587
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,820
Today is the Winter Solstice.

588
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,140
Dumplings, of course.

589
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:29,180
Grand Tutor.

590
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,340
I thought you can do anything,

591
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,300
all mighty.

592
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:35,700
I've learned from Madam Zhao.

593
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,060
I'm not skilled, that's all.

594
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,060
Grand Tutor,

595
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,070
you've become a calico cat.

596
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:56,570
A calico cat!

597
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,230
Laughing at me, huh?

598
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,280
Don't run, Your Highness.

599
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,800
Don't run, Your Highness.

600
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:36,260
Dumplings are here, Your Highness.

601
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,030
Grand Tutor.

602
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,740
Cheers.

603
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,840
Let me have a taste.

604
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,300
How's it, Your Highness?

605
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,220
Although the making process has been messy,

606
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,740
they turn out to taste quite good.

607
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,260
Just dumplings, so easy.

608
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:23,660
Grand Tutor.

609
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,540
Try one.

610
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,030
Thanks, Your Highness.

611
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,820
How's it?

612
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,780
Delicious.

613
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,230
[Chen Zhang: Ming Wei, the scene of us kissing which was cut before is about to be shot soon.]

614
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,400
[I've been thinking that when we start shooting, we can pretend to make out at first, and then transfer to cheat cut.]

615
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:53,180
[Just act like it's passionate. I've found some videos for your reference.]

616
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:53,920
[Watch them and try to find the feeling. We will rehearse the actions before shooting.]

617
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:13,630
Your Highness.

618
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,890
what's on your mind?

619
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,540
Nothing.

620
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:21,620
It's just

621
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:24,860
I'm going to shoot the kissing scene with Chen Zhang tomorrow.

622
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,620
He just sent me some videos,

623
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,900
talking about how to shoot it.

624
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,980
I know.

625
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Let's eat faster.

626
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,860
And go to sleep early, Your Highness.

627
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:38,190
You have to get up early tomorrow morning.

628
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,420
I'll eat more.

629
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:44,740
What does that mean?

630
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,600
You didn't even appear to be jealous.

631
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,470
I was afraid you wouldn't agree to it and be upset.

632
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:54,420
But you were so quick to consent.

633
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,540
So you don't care about me?
