Your Highness, you are the most precious.

20
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,540
How could you put yourself down

21
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,660
to compare yourself to a vase?

22

It is not a big deal.

29

In modern society,

30
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,940
it's quite normal for men and women to have some body contact by accident.

when it comes to the Grand Tutor?

33
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,659
It must because he's from the past.

34
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,100
He's too disciplined.

35
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:44,700
That's why it becomes so awkward.

36
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,580
It must be because of that.

37
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,740
But why does my heart beat so fast

38
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,300

Sorry

44
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,980
for making it inconvenient for you to live here anymore,

45
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,380

Thank you for taking care of her.

but actually she's quite young.

77
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,220
She's basically a kid.

So?

79
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,500
Ming Qiao is very innocent.

80
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,380
She's never been in a relationship before.

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,140
So what?

83
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,380
Don't be mad at me if I say it straight.

84
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:18,850
Ming Qiao,

85
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,260
she is different from the other girls you know.

86
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,620
So, you...

87
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,890
Ming Wei, how could you think of me

88
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,100
as a womanizer?

89
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,860
Ming Qiao is your sister,

90
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,660
so she is my sister.

91
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,380
Don't worry.

92
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,580

93
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,020
Oh my sister.

94
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,260
I could buy it myself.

95
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,500
Why did she bother you for this?

96
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,980
It's okay.

97
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,410
Now that she helps me take care of Tingzhou,

98
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,140
I could have some free time.

99
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,540
Oh right,

100
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,260
did that thing last time ever happen to you again?

101
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,380
No.

102
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:05,060
I told you it rarely happens.

103
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,500
I just realize

104
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:09,380
a private coach is kind of similar to an entertainment agent.

105

00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,660
As entertainment agent,

109
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,740
they help actors to make performance plans,

110
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,860
and solve problems.

111
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:19,900
Sounds right.

112
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:21,050
It makes sense.

113
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,900
The Best Actor had such a big issue.

114
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,180
It must gives you a big headache, right?

115
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,140
Have you ever thought of working with other actors?

116
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,980
It should be easy for you

117
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:36,100
to work with someone else.

118
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,740
I've never thought about that.

119
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:40,470
Tingzhou only has me as his friend.

120
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:43,060
And he was the reason why I became an entertainment agent.

121
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,060
Xiao Zhao,

122
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,820
can I ask you a question?

123

Go ahead.

124
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,460

Then do you have a girlfriend?

130
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,340
It troubles me enough when I have to deal with Mu Tingzhou.

131

It's none of your business.

Stop it!

174
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,300
I'm gonna call the police.

175
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,730
Call the police.

176
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,820
Dad.

177
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,220
Sir.

178
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,580
Sir.

179
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,940
Why are you here?

180
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,460
Come home with me.

181
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,100
Dad

182
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:32,900
Well, I...

183
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,620
-Sir. -Dad.

184
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,500
I told you not to come here.

185
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,660
Why are you here?

186
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,140
Dad, hold on a little bit.

187
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,780
Wei,

188
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,180
you had better move back to live with Ming Qiao.

189
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:58,900
I will hire some bodyguards for you.

190
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,380
Dad,

191
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,980
I live here to help him cure his illness

192
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,180
and get his memories back.

193
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,460
There is nothing dangerous here.

194
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,020
There is something wrong with him.

195
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,420
If you live here,

196
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,180
what would you do if he has an attack?

197
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,660
Dad.

198
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,860
I am doing good for you.

199
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,180
Mr. Ming.

200
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,100
Uncle.

201
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,620
I did not know you were Ming Wei's father.

202
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,820
Forgive me for anything inappropriate just now.

203
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,620
Hope you can understand.

204
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,660
It does not matter if I understand or not.

205
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,700
I am taking Ming Wei back

206
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,780
today anyways.

207
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,260
Uncle,

208
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,090
I feel there are some misunderstandings between us.

209
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,780
Can you give me some time?

210
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,290
Let's talk in private.

211
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,700
What are you doing?

212
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,500
If you want to talk, we can talk.

213
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,180
Why would I be afraid of you?

214
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,580
Uncle,

215
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,340
please.

216
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,530
Dad.

217
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,220
How long has this been going on?

218
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,700
Why haven't they come down yet?

219
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,740
Take a seat, sister.

220
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:10,740
Stop walking around.

221
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,130
Don't worry, Ming Wei.

222
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,780
Although Tingzhou doesn't have a high EQ,

223
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,820
he has a high IQ.

224
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,020
He would not fight with uncle again.

225
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,090
My dad is hot-tempered, and

226
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,700
I just can't stop worrying.

227
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,300
Uncle, you really likes to make jokes.

228
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:38,940
Tingzhou,

229
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,020
keep it in mind what you just said.

230
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,020
Uncle,

231
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:45,100
don't worry.

232
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,220
I would not eat my words.

233
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,020
A real man never goes back on his words.

234
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,420
Keep your promises.

235
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,780
Alright.

236
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,740
Wei,

237
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:07,819
get along well with Tingzhou.

238
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,740
I'm going back to home.

239
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,170
Dad, you are leaving that soon.

240
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,640
I am only here to check on you.

241
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,579
Now I am relieved.

242
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,530
Your mother is waiting for me at home.

243
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,050
Uncle,

244
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,220
how about staying for lunch?

245
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Auntie Zhao is cooking.

246
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,740
Don't bother.

247
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,579
If I go now,

248
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,740
I can still have dinner with my wife.

249
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:32,980
Tingzhou,

250
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,820
I would leave Wei to you.

251
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:36,020
Contact me anytime.

252
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,940
OK, no problem.

253
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,060
Dad.

254
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,210
Kid,

255
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,220
hurry up

256
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
and make him my son-in-law as soon as possible.

257
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,600
Uncle,

258
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,900
how about I drive you home?

259
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,830
I will drop Ming Qiao off too.

260
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,770
It's okay. Don't bother.

261
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,610
I can go on my own.

262
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,220
Alright, dad.

263
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,290
-I... I can go back. -Alright.

264
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,220
-Let's go. -Sir.

265
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,900
Alright, I...

266
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,450
I'm gonna go, sister.

267
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:09,460
Dad, and...

268
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,300
Watch your steps.

269
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,780
Uncle, safe trip!

270
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:15,260
I'm gonna go, sister.

271
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,460
Alright, let's go.

272
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,940
Grand Tutor, I can do it by myself.

273
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,810
Grand Tutor,

274
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,700
what did you say to my dad?

275
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,180
What changed his mind?

276
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,140
I just told him

277
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,980
I would treat you with all my heart,

278
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,050
and touch you with all my sincerity.

279
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,500
That's all?

280
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,060
That's it.

281
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:05,580
I know

282
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,060
you might not believe me.

283
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:08,540
But I am telling the truth.

284
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,220
To me,

285
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,500
love is more precious than any other things.

286
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:16,740
Only sincerity touches each other.

287
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,300
Alright.

288
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,780
Since you have convinced my dad,

289
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,620
my family would not oppose to it.

290
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,580
I will be able to stay here

291
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
for a while.

292
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,700
I know,

293
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,940
you might not be willing to stay here.

294
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,620
I also know,

295
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,100
it is only me thinking of it this way sometimes.

296
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,900
So I have decided to

297
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,580
respect your decisions.

298
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,210
If you really want to move away,

299
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,740
I would not stop you.

300
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,300
Then,

301
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,140
I will find another way to stay close to you.

302
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,260
But I just want to tell you that

303
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,860
the night you were here was

304
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,700
the most peaceful night

305
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,620
I felt

306
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,220
after waking up.

307
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:09,740
Grand Tutor,

308
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:12,900
I promise you.

309
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,410
I would not leave you alone.

310
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,260
You can set your mind at rest.

311
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:23,980
What do you want?

312
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:26,860
Tell me,

313
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,580
how did you do it?

314
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,220
Do what?

315
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,420
Is there anything I can't do?

316
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,260
You are confident just like Mu Tingzhou.

317
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,580
How did you convince Ming Wei's father?

318
00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:43,900
You looked respectful.

319
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,180
I never expected you would be that deferential to him.

320
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,940
Good for you!

321
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,780
Ming Wei would be happy about it.

322
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,170
It was just for the sake of

323
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,100
sending him off.

324
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,900
How could I possibly believe he is the biological father of the princess?

325
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,290
The biological father of the princess is the king of the Ning Dynasty.

326
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,900
He is only a liar.

327
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:03,300
How could he compare with the late Emperor?

328
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,100
You have been acting

329
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,380
all this time?

330
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:14,540
[Why would someone needs amber as pillow, or his car has to be decorated with pearls?]

331
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:11,090
Listen to me carefully,

332
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,380
no matter you are the Best Actor or the Grand Tutor,

333
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,180
Wei is my daughter.

334
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,700
I, Ming Qiang, have a Martial Arts club.

335
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,570
Although we don't earn a lot of money,

336
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:24,130
it is enough for my daughters to not worry about food and clothing.

337
00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:28,060
Now you are asking Ming Wei for a favor.

338
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,900
But I must warn you first.

339
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,300
If you don't treat Ming Wei properly,

340
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:42,380
I, Ming Qiang, will get back to you by ten times and hundred times.

341
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,500
Try it if you dare.

342
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,500
Uncle,

343
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,450
you might have misunderstood me.

344
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,300
I am actually

345
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,500
pursuing Ming Wei.

346
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,940
I knew your purpose was not that simple.

347
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,860
I like Ming Wei with all my heart.

348
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,020
The scene at the wedding

349
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,700
was caused by me being unbearable

350
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,340
to watch the bride to bully Ming Wei.

351
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,780
I have invited Ming Wei to come over

352
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,500
just to be close to her to

353
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,540
make her understand me better.

354
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,020
Maybe I am too passionate and

355
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,020
chase her too tight,

356
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,380
which ends up bringing all these

357
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,740
questions and troubles.

358
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,460
I felt very sorry.

359
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,380
So, you want to pursue my daughter?

360
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:15,260
It proves that you have good taste.

361
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,980
But, it is not easy

362
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,730
[Why would someone needs amber as pillow, or his car has to be decorated with pearls?]

363
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:24,860
to be my son-in-law.

364
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:27,860
Uncle,

365
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,700
I am thirty years old,

366
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,690
I am hardworking and

367
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,700
dependable.

368
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:37,060
Speaking of the look, I am also not bad.

369
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,450
For health condition,

370
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,020
you should have already known

371
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,540
when we fought.

372
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Most importantly,

373
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,980
I care about Ming Wei with all my heart.

374
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:52,490
She is the most wonderful girl in this world,

375
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,300
and the only one I cherish the most.

376
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:59,540
I will give her the most precious thing I could offer.

377
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,820
I promise you,

378
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,090
there will be no other man who treats her

379
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,180
like I do.

380
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,500
Of course,

381
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,380
except you.

382
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,380
Ming Wei is the apple of your eye,

383
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,380
who is also my princess.

384
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,500
I would give her life-long

385
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,900
care and love

386
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,410
just like you do.

387
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,170
It sounds

388
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,460
you really mean it.

389
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,220
But young people like you who

390
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,450
pursue my daughter, why can't you cut the crap

391
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,220
and be practical?

392
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,980
I have seen all of these.

393
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,260
Uncle, I have the property certificate here.

394
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,860
Uncle, is it practical enough？

395
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,100
I believe that

396
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,740
I would not lose to anyone else

397
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,740
in terms of anything.

398
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,940
I am serious to Ming Wei.

399
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:10,100
These are not important.

400
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:12,660
But,

401
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,260
I have seen your sincerity.

402
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,740
Alright.

403
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,980
From now on,

404
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,100
I would not get involved in your relationship.

405
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,260
But you must remember what you said and

406
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,700
treat Ming Wei properly all the time.

407
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,220
Otherwise...

408
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,490
I promise that

409
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,340
there will be no man who treats her

410
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,820
better than I do.

411
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,500
Crazy cool phrases.

412
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,620
By the way, Grand Tutor,

413
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,020
you are really...

414
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,100
Don't you feel that you are Mu Tingzhou now?

415
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,810
Use your brilliant acting skills

416
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,980
to trick an old man.

417
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,260
A great man knows when to yield and when not.

418
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,940
A lie at a time is for the sake of the whole picture.

419
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,660
Also,

420
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,260
it does not count as lying.

421
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Half of my words

422
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,340
are true.

423
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,820
Although I cannot marry the princess,

424
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,740
I will protect the princess

425
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,690
for her whole life.

426
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,210
Awesome.

427
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:42,980
You are really awesome.

428
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,900
You should go.

429
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,740
It is such a hustle going back and forth.

430
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,220
Guests do not stay after 9pm.

431
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,570
This is the rule.

432
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,340
Never mind,

433
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,500
I don't want to stay with an old fogy like you are.

434
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,660
I can finally go play around by myself.

435
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,090
How about

436
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:09,020
going out with me to gain some insights?

437
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,580
Alright, please leave.

438
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,540
Never mind.

439
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,940
The phone number of the apartment management...

440
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,500
The phone number of the apartment management...

441
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,410
What is the phone number of the apartment management?

442
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,140
It's quite late.

443
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:07,860
The apartment management probably is off duty now.

444
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,980
Definitely off duty now.

445
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,660
It's not polite to disturb them at this time.

446
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,460
So I have no other choice

447
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,560
[Xiao Zhao]

448
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,370
but to bother you.

449
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,180
Back there someone has been looking at you for a long time.

450
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,260
It's quite normal.

451
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,660
You have seen it before.

452
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,260
You are so attractive.

453
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,780
God will also be jealous.

454
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,100
Handsome boy.

455
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,570
Can I have a drink with you?

456
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,320
My pleasure.

457
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,140
Wait a moment.

458
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,630
[Ming Qiao]

459
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,460
Sorry to bother you.

460
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,940
Do you know what to do if there is a sudden power outage?

461
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,300
I am sorry.

462
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,860
I have something to do. Excuse me.

463
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,140
I should go now.

464
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,260
Xiao Zhao.

465
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,380
Why don't you return my messages or answer my call?

466
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,900
Did you call me?

467
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,140
I am sorry, I didn't look at my phone.

468
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,620
It's not safe to light so many candles.

469
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,140
I am here alone.

470
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,740
The power went out, and I am a little afraid of the darkness.

471
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,770
I walked past your downstairs.

472
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,300
Their lights are on.

473
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,130
I suppose something in your home tripped.

474
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,500
What did you do before the power went out?

475
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,220
I didn't do anything special.

476
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,700
I just finished shower and sat there to dry my hair.

477
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,940
And I watched TV.

478
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,660
I suppose it is because of this.

479
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,380
Remember

480
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,930
not to use so many electronic devices at the same time.

481
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,420
Where is the switch in your house?

482
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,620
Switch?

483
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,290
I don't know.

484
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,620
Usually, the switch will be behind the paintings.

485
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,100
Painting...

486
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,940
That one.

487
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,820
Perhaps.

488
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,220
I think it is this one.

489
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,620
This?

490
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,330
Not this one.

491
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,340
Unlikely.

492
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,820
Take a look. Is it here?

493
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,500
No.

494
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,980
Why is it not here?

495
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:46,980
Never mind.

496
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,900
I can find the

497
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,540
apartment management to help me repair it tomorrow.

498
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,740
But you are afraid of the darkness.

499
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,620
By the way, lighting so many candles is not safe.

500
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,100
You are here with me.

501
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,380
If it is not inside the house,

502
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,730
will it be in the corridor?

503
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:26,340
I think it is over here.

504
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,340
I will come and see how you do this

505
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,170
and if this happens again,

506
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,060
I will know what to do.

507
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,980
So, I don't need to bother you.

508
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,700
As a girl, you don't need to flaunt your superiority.

509
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,180
It's right to be cautious when encountering this kind of thing.

510
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:41,820
But every time the situation may be different.

511
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,940
Next time you encounter this kind of thing,

512
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,260
just call me.

513
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,700
I promise your sister to take care of you.

514
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,980
All right.

515
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,220
Well.

516

You should go back.

517

I will not go upstairs.

You... don't you want to have some drinks upstairs?

519
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,100
No need, no need.

520
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,380
I have something to do later.

521

Don't forget to lock your door.

522
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,780
Thank you so much today.

523
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:39,980
Good night, Xiao Zhao.

524
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,940
Good night.

She seems weird today.

526
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,010
Am I thinking too much?

527
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,260
Ms. Shen.

528
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,380
I have thoroughly read through the scripts of The South City for two times.

529
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,770
And I have basically prepared for everything.

531
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,100
Great.

532
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,010
The producers also want to invite Mr. Mu

533
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,980
to do a guest appearance.

534
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,220
But I turned down the invitation.

535
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,140
Thank you, Ms. Shen.

536
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,100
Tingzhou's current situation

537
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,780
is not suitable for acting.

538
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,740
Ming Wei is about to join the crew.

539
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,660
I think you guys need to be cautious.

540
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,140
Do not affect her normal work.

541
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,090
Sure.

00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,540
Although I will not be part of it,

544
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,260
I will not sit here and do nothing.

545
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,780
I will do everything I can to help Your Highness.

546
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:46,260
I decide

547
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,060
to accompany Your Highness to join the crew

548
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,660
as her assistance.

549
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,330
After all, protecting Your Highness

550
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,980
is my only mission.

551
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,930
I have to fulfill my duty as the Grand Tutor.

552
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,020
You really agree to take Mu Tingzhou to the crew?

553
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,100
I didn't expect him to offer this idea.

554
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,940
But I thought for a while.

555
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,020
I think this might be a good way.

556
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,300
I have read many books about psychology.

557
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,380
They all say

558
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:38,180
in order to restore the memory of the amnesia,

559
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,220
the best way

560
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,980
is to put him back to the environment he is familiar with.

561
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,260
The most familiar environment for Mr. Mu is

562
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,780
definitely the acting field.

563
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,100
He has spent so many years acting in the crew.

564
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,660
The crew is even more close to him than his own family.

565
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,820
So

566
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,660
I think this time I will follow his idea

567
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,620
and take him along.

568
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,460
I think you need to be prepared.

569
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,980
You are literally taking a timed bomb into the crew.

570
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,780
You are acting in a love story in The South City.

571
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,420
There will inevitably be scenes where you hug or kiss others.

572
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,660
You need to pay attention to

573
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,260
Mu Tingzhou's feelings.

574
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,380
You should do a good job in his psychological guidance.

575
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,490
Sure. I am confident.

576

If anything happens,

I have Xiao Zhao to help me.

All right.

I shall go now.

Why does no one tell me about it?

Why do you come to The South City?

601
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:28,700
Ms. Shen,

602
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:30,940
I heard there are follow-up investments in The South City.

603
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,060
I suppose they will also

604
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,740
change the actors to a higher standard.

605
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,020
I think based on my current influence and ability,

606
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,380
I am capable of this character.

607
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,100
So I want to have a try.

608
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,900
I thought you just took the

Do you have time for The South City?

611
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:50,220
Or you want to give up that play?

612
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,210
I have given up.

613
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:56,540
Why?

614
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,940
I think compare with that big production,

615
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,740
I am more interested in The South City.

616
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,940
And I like the script and the role.

617
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,740
I think when choosing the script,

618
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,460
actors shouldn't only focus on the market and the influence.

619

We should also follow our heart.

you have already decided.
