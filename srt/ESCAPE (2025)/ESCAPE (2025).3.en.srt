(Yui) Is it kidnapping?

Are you an idiot? It's kidnapping!

That's why I said it.

Don't complain now, it's lame.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Huh? So what should we do?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,500
I'm thinking about this while eating right now.

Go home. Huh?

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
You must have a lot of money.

Go back to normal like nothing happened➡

Take care of the stars.

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Kidnapping is a request for a daughter who has suffered a terrible experience➡

30
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
I hope your father listens too.

31
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,000

Do you hate it that much?

36
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
I don't hate it that much though.

37
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
I once shared location information with my girlfriend.

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,000
My parents and my girlfriend are completely different, aren't they? They're the same.

Even if I can't contact you, I know you're home➡

It's love. Love?

There's nothing else.

43
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
You have to break the GPS➡

44
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,500
It also protected them from kidnappers like me.

(Shiraki) Oh, I knew it.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,500
Is the bounty issue just a grand play by Keishi Yagami?

71
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,000
This is Shiraki from “Weekly Shinryu”.

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The fact that the kidnapping was made public➡

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,500
There is no possibility that the culprit will harm Yui-san➡

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,000
Did you decide...?

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,500
Does Keishi Yagami know who the culprit is?

76
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,500
For example, he may be an acquaintance of Yui-san.

77
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,000
(Ebihara) How did you get in here?

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,500
No, from over there... You didn't get permission.

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Police cannot treat ordinary citizens as criminals without evidence!

80
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
It's so hard!

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Hey, how about karaoke? It's a camera.

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Then a private room at a restaurant. It'll cost money.

There's no reason to come here, right?

120
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,500
If they find out that Yui-san came here relying on you...

121
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
(Fuji) The culprit is called "Linda", right?

122

Yui was threatened by this man named Linda➡

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I visited Mr. Jonouchi's house as a place that could be a hideout➡

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What do you think of the scenario?

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,500
I wonder if Yui had some kind of idea behind that?

130
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,000
that's right.

131
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
If you rely on Mr. Jonouchi, you will get Linda➡

You'll just get caught, right?

Aki-chan will probably give you some information.

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It's a joke~

182
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
(Komiyama) Hello, sorry, mom is at work.

183
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,500
(Tomoko) Did Daisuke do something again?

184
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
(Komiyama) When was the last time you met?

185
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,500
(Tomoko) About two weeks ago.

186
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,000
How has it changed?

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Can you tell me what happened?

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I just want to meet with you and ask if you are involved in a certain incident.

189
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,500
(Tabata) When was the last time we contacted each other?

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,500
I haven't taken it since I met you two weeks ago.

191
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,500
(Tabata) Did you have trouble with money or something like that?

192
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I don't think there was.

193
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you know where he's likely to go?

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Now...

195
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Does that mean he's not going to work right now?

196
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
Well... that's right.

197
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,000
I took the trouble to be introduced to you by Mr. Komiyama➡

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,500
Really... I'm sorry. No...｡

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,500
Please contact me if you remember anything.

200
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,500
(Tomoko) Ah... things haven't changed from before, right?

201
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Just in case.

202
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,500
I want to find him before he commits more crimes.

203
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,000
Well then.

204
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,500
Excuse me.

205
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:22,000
thank you.

206
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,500
I guess I should go back to Aki-chan after all...

207
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,000
To the damn old hag who sold you?

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Because you're right. He's not really a bad person.

209
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm hurt and struggling...

210
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,000
I just made a little mistake.

211
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
That's how children are.

212
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
picture?

213
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,500
I can't hate my parents no matter how bad they do to me.

214
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
(Shopkeeper) If you don't mind...

215
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,500
Ah, thank you. Thank you.

216
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,000
Good for you, star.

217
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
(Shopkeeper) Ah, I'll give you braids.

218
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Thank you. Yes, sorry.

219
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:18,500
Ah, would you like something to drink? Ah, then➡

220
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,000
Do you have coffee? ah.

221
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Two things, please. I'm smart.

222
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I was surprised... Are you a ninja?

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,500
Hey, I was calling out the star's name just now.

224
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It's okay.

yes.

228
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,500
This is Fuji from the Yagami Pharmaceutical president's office.

229
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,500
Ah... yes. Smartphone) Around Saito...

230
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Is there a man called "Linda"?

231
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Is it "Linda"?

232
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Actually... there's a woman who looks like Yui➡

233
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
I was with a man called "Linda"➡

234
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
We have received information that...

235
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Well, let's do some research.

236
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Thank you for providing the information.

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Huh…｡

238
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,500
Linda?

239
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Have you gathered any information about Yui?

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,500
It's called a mixture of cobblestones...

241
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,000
It seems like a large amount of stones have arrived.

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Huh…｡ But➡

243
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,500
It is true that Yui and her friends have found it difficult to move.

244
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Apparently the getaway vehicle was also found.

245
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,000
I think the police will find it soon.

246
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,000
(knock)

247
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,000
(Secretary) I brought the president of Hoover Pharmaceuticals with me.

248
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Hello Carl. (Curl) Kay!

249
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Even though I'm busy...

250
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
(Carl) I'm worried about Yui too.

251
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,500
Isn't it really about work?

252
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
I wish I had changed my plans.

253
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,500
thank you.

254
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,500
please.

255
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,500
The police and my friends are looking for Yui, so it's okay.

256
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,000
I wish she could come back anytime➡

257
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,500
Just protect this place.

258
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:38,000

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I don't want to be treated as an opponent.

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's better than not doing it.

261
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
In times like this, you might cut off a hostage's finger and send him away.

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,500
can't believe it.

263
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Isn't it possible to check the sender of this as well?

264
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,000

266
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Smartphone) Yay! (Male) The sound is huge! Lower it, lower it.

267
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,900
It's too big. Smartphone) (reception sound)

268
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,500
What happened earlier?

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
who? This person called "Gan".

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's not another one of your friends, right?

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,500
That's wrong.

272
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
So how do you know about the kidnapping?

273
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Only the police know about "Saito Motors", right?

274
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Smartphone) (reception sound)

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is this about Linda?

276
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:43,000
If you look up the old man's information, you'll probably hit me first.

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
So how do you know this person?

278
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Are you listening to the police radio?

279
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,500
I don't know if it's hacked or not...

280
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
He is very knowledgeable about investigation information.

281
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
What are you doing?

282
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
I don't know.

283
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:01,000
You're not a police officer, right?

284
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's not true.

285
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Komi-san Komi-san.

286
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,500
When did you become a ``comi-san''?

287
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
Saito Motors customer list➡

288
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
It seems like they're kidnapping us, but we also got our share.

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Confirm your alibi. Let's go. Ha... Hey hey.

290
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:44,000
♬～

291
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,500
Sorry...

292
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,000
Hey, Mr. Gunn, could you please help me?

293
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's why I don't want to get involved.

294
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But you're familiar with the investigation information, right?

295
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,500
Then the police... Discipline them!

296
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
Sorry.

297
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,400
take care.

298
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,500
(Voice whispering)

299
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,500
I used to work part-time in the dark.

300
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,000
That's a lie, right? Why...?

301
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,500
I guess it was decided because they needed money. That's why...

302
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,000
I didn't know it was a dark part-time job, so I...

303
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I thought it was a good part-time job.

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,500
So... when I realized it➡

305
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,000
I have given you a copy of my driver's license➡

306
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,500
Even if I want to get out, they won't let me get out.

307
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,000
How did you finish it?

308
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,500
Arrested. Arrested.

309
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,000
The instructing person at that time is Gan.

310
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,500
Got it. Huh?

311
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,500
If that's the case, you don't have to worry about being sold to the police.

312
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,000
Were you listening to me...! As expected, I didn't hear about the arrest➡

313
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Now is not the time to say such things.

314
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,500
I borrowed it from him and made it➡

315
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I don't know what they're going to do to me this time, right?

316
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,000
So what should I do? I have a prize at stake➡

317
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Is Linda a serial kidnapper?

318
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You're a serial kidnapper... There's nothing you can do about it.

319
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
That's why I need Gan's help.

320
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,500
If you ask him ➡

321
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,000
There's a risk of it being sold overseas.

322
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't know who it will be sold to➡

323
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I was pushed into the octopus room by a guy who couldn't even understand Japanese➡

324
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Being a partner in crime➡

325
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
If you try to run away, you'll get beaten up.

326
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
That's hopeless.

327
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,000
This guy is crazy.

328
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Forget about cancer.

329
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,500
Hmm... I don't really understand.

330
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
With a man in his 20s➡

331
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
I think he was with a boy around 4 years old...

332
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,500
No, the store was quite crowded.

333
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
is that so….

334
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
(Sakagami) Weren't you going to quit?

335
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
(Yamaguchi) If I don't need it, I won't come.

336
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
(Sakagami) No, well, don't say that.

337
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,500
It's not easy to change jobs now, right?

338
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
This is Kenji Yamaguchi.

339
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,500

Understood.

Head to Utsunomiya right away. Huh?

345
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,500
It seems that a man who looks like Daisuke Hayashida has kidnapped a child and is running away.

346
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,000
Huh?

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,000
picture?

358
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
(Misaki) Huh? Have you been kidnapped? (Masaki) Yes.

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,500
Why a child?

360
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Isn't that possible?

361
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Where is it?

362
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:34,500
Shun in Utsunomiya seems to be a coffee shop.

363
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,500
Utsunomiya huh...

364
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
It's a little strange. Hmm...

365
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,500
reserve!

366
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,500
Yes, excuse me.

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
It is said that Daisuke Hayashida's fingerprints were found on the vehicle that was discovered.

368
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,500
Ahhh...

369
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,000
He has now been promoted from a key reference to a suspect.

370
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't call this a promotion.

371
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
(Tabata) Sorry.

372
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,500
president.

373
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:08,000
There is a man named Daisuke Hayashida who is an employee of Saito Motors.

374
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,500
Hayashida?

375
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
My high school classmate Hayashida-kun is➡

376
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,000
He was called Lindaman.

377
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,500
"Linda" who is with Yui is ➡

378
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Isn't it this man?

379
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,500
♬～

380
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,000
Isn't it rising...?

381
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,500
Maybe it was just my imagination.

382
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
Maybe I should contact the police or Yagami Pharmaceutical directly.

383
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Shall we take the train?

384
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,500
If you are noticed, you won't be able to escape until the next station.

385
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,000
But I have to get away from here soon. That's right...

386
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Huh… hah…｡

387
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,500
Huh? A star?

388
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,000
picture…? Star!

389
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,400
star!

390
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:13,000
(Sounds of children playing)

391
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,500
Star, I can't play right now.

392
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry.

393
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,500
Once you calm down, I'll let you play a lot.

394
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,000
Let's go.

395
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,000
please.

396
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,500
Huh…｡ Ah…｡

397
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, please, father and mother.

398
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,500
(Female) Try which one again.

399
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,000
Smartphone) (reception sound)

400
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,000
The police also found out about Hoshi.

401
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Mr. Gan?

402
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
As Hachi said, it seems like I'm a serial kidnapper.

403
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
That's what I thought➡

404
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,000
They're going to take 1 billion from Hachi's father and divide it up, right?

405
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What should we do with the stars?

406
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,500
picture?

407
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Do you want to take care of it by yourself?

408
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
It's weird that it's just the three of us.

409
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
That's impossible.

410
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,000
a? Impossible.

411
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
No... Huh? I can't do it either. Yeah.

412
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
Welcome!

413
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,500
Is it okay to leave them in a nursing home?

414
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,000
Huh? It's blurry, isn't it? I know, but...

415
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Well, let's say I took the letter and left it at the facility➡

416
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
What happens after that?

417
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Can't you raise it in a facility?

418
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,500
I'm sure he'll be sent back to his goddamn parents.

419
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Why? If you investigate your family situation properly...

420
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,500
I don't understand anything.

421
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,500
The world isn't that sweet.

422
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:07,000
Generally speaking, leaving it at a facility means throwing it away.

423
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,500
From the situation where I was almost abandoned by those shitty parents➡

424
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
You'll be picked up by us and thrown away again.

425
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,500
That's too cruel.

426
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,500
So what should I do...I don't know.

427
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Let's think together.

428
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Linda also likes stars, right?

429
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
I like it, but what should I do?

430
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,500
We're being chased by the police.

431
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
(Female) Um...

432
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,500
The child's appearance...

433
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,000
Huh?

434
00:24:41,933 --> 00:24:43,433

435

438
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:01,433
Excuse me, I'm looking for someone.

439
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:02,933
yes.

440
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:05,433
(Tabata) Have you seen this woman?

441
00:25:07,933 --> 00:25:10,933
This guy might have been there too.

442
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:13,933
And a 4 year old boy too.

443
00:25:15,433 --> 00:25:16,933
Did you see it?

444
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,933
yes.

445
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,433

00:25:22,433 --> 00:25:24,433

448
00:25:31,433 --> 00:25:33,433
good….

449
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:35,433
What are you doing here?

450
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,933
Where were you going?

451
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:43,933
Did you want to go home?

452
00:25:48,933 --> 00:25:50,933
Sorry, shake it up.

453
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:58,933
It's tough.

454
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,933
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:03,433
Are you going to throw it away?

457
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:08,933
``Hikaru jams and throws away.''

458
00:26:08,933 --> 00:26:12,433
((Star! If you get in my way, I'll throw you away!))

459
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:21,433
Are you an idiot? There's no way you'll throw me away!

460
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:26,933
That's wrong...

461
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:28,933
We were at fault.

462
00:26:28,933 --> 00:26:30,433
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:39,933 --> 00:26:43,433
Star, let's be together.

465
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:44,933
What?

466
00:26:51,933 --> 00:26:56,433
star! star!

467
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,933
⚟Hachi! ⚞

Ah... that's good...!

470
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:07,433
Sorry, Hoshi.

471
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,933
I thought I wouldn't be able to find you this time.

472
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,433
That's right, lend me your smartphone. Huh?

473
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:22,433
on second thoughts….

474
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,933
That's crazy.

475
00:27:24,933 --> 00:27:27,933
Let's contact Mr. Gan. Huh?

476
00:27:27,933 --> 00:27:31,933
If you have a choice, go home or live a life of despair➡

477
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,933
I'd like to bet on the "maybe" side.

(Boy) Let's ride that!

480
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:56,933
Mr. Gunn and his family don't bring their children together, right?

481
00:27:56,933 --> 00:27:58,933
There's no way.

482
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:00,933
Who is that person?

483
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,433
I don't know. What do you mean, "I don't know"?

484
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,433
I've never met you before. Huh?

485
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:10,433
We've only communicated via chat.

486
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:12,433
Eh...｡

487
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:17,433
Doesn't that person look like Mr. Gan? Looks like it.

488
00:28:20,933 --> 00:28:22,433
Is it wrong? Is it wrong?

489
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:24,433
Are you really coming?

490
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:32,433
It’s cool!

491
00:28:33,433 --> 00:28:36,333
(Gun) It's too late to contact you.

492
00:28:37,933 --> 00:28:42,933
Yui Yagami... Jonouchi: Hoshi?

493
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:46,933
Maybe... Mr. Gan?

494
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,933
Yeah.

495
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:51,933
It's surprisingly small... Oh? Are you making fun of me?

496
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:54,433
No, I haven't! I respect you.

497
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:01,933
I'm Yui Yagami. Thank you.

You don't want to go home, do you?

507
00:29:38,566 --> 00:29:40,566
yes.

508
00:29:40,566 --> 00:29:45,066
Keishi Yagami is such a crazy guy...

509
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:48,566
I mean, it's crazy...

510
00:29:50,566 --> 00:29:52,066

in? what are you doing? picture?

512
00:29:56,566 --> 00:30:00,066
They ran away with the hostages and even kidnapped the children.

513
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:02,566
No, the star is... It's me.

514
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:07,066
picture? Did the kidnapper kidnap you? I liked it though.

515
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:10,566
Sorry... Okay, Hachi, that's interesting.

516
00:30:10,566 --> 00:30:15,566
So... should I call you "Linda"?

517
00:30:15,566 --> 00:30:17,566
Well... yes.

518
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:20,566
Linda failed to collect the ransom and was carrying luggage➡

519
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:22,566
What do you want?

520
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:26,566
No, if there are bees, you can make money, right?

521
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:29,566
But how should I receive 100 million yen?

522
00:30:29,566 --> 00:30:32,066
I can't find a good way.

523
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,566
Hmm.

524
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:37,066
If I get that money, I'll give you a third of it➡

525
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:39,566
Could you please let us escape?

526
00:30:39,566 --> 00:30:41,566
If you say that➡

527
00:30:41,566 --> 00:30:45,066
After subtracting expenses, it's divided into 3 parts, right?

528
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:49,566
That's right... I'm sorry.

529
00:30:49,566 --> 00:30:51,566

No human trafficking.

00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:11,066
Okay... Are you okay?

535
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,066
No, you didn't say you were going to sell it in the first place.

00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:18,566
Yeah, it looks like something interesting.

538
00:31:18,566 --> 00:31:22,566
thank you! (Gun) However, there are conditions.

539
00:31:22,566 --> 00:31:24,566
what?

540
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,566
Leave the kid alone.

541
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:32,066
But…➡

542
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:34,566
I said, "I'm with you."

543
00:31:34,566 --> 00:31:37,066
You know...

544
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:41,566
No matter how much I do, I won't be able to do what I can do with my kids together.

545
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:46,566
(Gun) If you insist on bringing me with you➡

546
00:31:46,566 --> 00:31:48,566
I will not cooperate.

547
00:31:49,566 --> 00:32:09,566
♬～

548
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:19,066
♬～

549
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:21,566
(Gun) What should I do?

550
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,566
It's not just the police.

551
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:26,566
It might be sold to some random person➡

552
00:32:26,566 --> 00:32:29,566
Will the three of us run away aimlessly and get caught?

553
00:32:29,566 --> 00:32:33,066
Or leave the brat behind and borrow my super talented help➡

554
00:32:33,066 --> 00:32:35,066
Shall we both run away?

555
00:32:41,566 --> 00:32:44,066
I won't hurt the star any more.

556
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:48,566
(Gun) Well, I'm fine.

557
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,566
Even if Linda gets arrested➡

558
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:54,566
It doesn't matter if Hachi is taken back to his goddamn father.

559
00:32:56,566 --> 00:32:59,066
I don't really have any trouble with money.

560
00:33:03,566 --> 00:33:06,066
Understood.

561
00:33:06,066 --> 00:33:08,066
Please forget about my previous request.

562
00:33:08,066 --> 00:33:11,566
I can't leave the stars behind after all. Wait!

563
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:13,566
Are you planning to go home?

564
00:33:16,066 --> 00:33:17,566
Yeah.

565
00:33:24,066 --> 00:33:26,066
I will ask Mr. Komiyama for the stars.

566
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,566
Komiyama? You're crazy.

567
00:33:28,566 --> 00:33:31,066
who? A detective in the juvenile division.

568
00:33:31,066 --> 00:33:33,566
This is the guy who copied it. Eh, detective?

569
00:33:33,566 --> 00:33:37,066
Even if a detective is a detective, he won't do anything wrong to that person.

570
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:38,566
Linda is also shaky.

571
00:33:38,566 --> 00:33:40,566
What is it? I took the trouble to make up my mind.

572
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:43,066
It's blurry! But when I looked at the face of the star➡

573
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:45,566
I said, ``Let's be together.''

574
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,566
Hey, that's right.

575
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:50,566
Right now, I'm thinking that I'll be able to do something with my momentum➡

576
00:33:50,566 --> 00:33:52,566
It's impossible to be together forever.

577
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:57,066
I just have to be patient.

578
00:33:57,066 --> 00:34:00,566
Someday, it will become ``Because of the Stars.''

579
00:34:04,566 --> 00:34:06,566
It's impossible...

580
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:10,066
You and I can't save the planet alone.

581
00:34:10,066 --> 00:34:12,066
I don't have that kind of power.

582
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:18,566
I'm sure Mr. Komiyama will do something about it.

583
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:26,066
You can trust that person.

584
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,566
I felt a little better after meeting that person.

585
00:34:33,066 --> 00:34:36,066
I'll just let you know though➡

586
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:38,566
Komiyama was called into this investigation.

587
00:34:38,566 --> 00:34:42,066
picture? Of course it's not your fault.

588
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:44,566
Well, no, if you go and ask for help, you'll get arrested.

589
00:34:44,566 --> 00:34:47,066
You don't have to come, I'll go alone.

590
00:34:47,066 --> 00:34:49,566
So then Linda would be arrested, right?

591
00:34:51,066 --> 00:34:53,566
Okay.

592
00:34:53,566 --> 00:34:55,566
Well, that's it. (Sound of keyboard tapping)

593
00:34:55,566 --> 00:34:58,566
picture? Have you decided anything now?

594
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,066
Smartphone) (vibrating sound)

595
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,566
Huh...

596
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:10,566
Komi-san! There isn't one.

597
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,566
What? this.

598
00:35:12,566 --> 00:35:15,066
I just went to this park. So it's close.

599
00:35:15,066 --> 00:35:17,066
Who is the sender? I don't know.

600
00:35:17,066 --> 00:35:20,066
Does it have something to do with the kidnapping case? I guess so.

601
00:35:20,066 --> 00:35:22,566
The other side can see our movements. Huh?

602
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:26,066
I chose this time because I knew he was nearby.

603
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:36,566
star.

604
00:35:36,566 --> 00:35:38,566
Are you riding that?

605
00:35:43,566 --> 00:35:46,066
(Sound of keyboard hitting)

606
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:49,066
Was it okay to break up like this?

607
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,566
Take me out without permission➡

608
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:57,066
Just let it go.

609
00:35:57,066 --> 00:36:00,066
I don't want to see my face.

610
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:05,066
yeah.

611
00:36:09,566 --> 00:36:11,066
Amazing...

612
00:36:29,066 --> 00:36:30,566
star.

613
00:36:32,566 --> 00:36:36,066
I love you.

614
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:41,066
So➡

615
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,566
I really want to be with you forever.

616
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:48,566
But…➡

617
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:51,066
I can't stay right now.

618
00:36:55,066 --> 00:36:57,566
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

619
00:37:00,566 --> 00:37:02,566
Don't throw it away.

620
00:37:02,566 --> 00:37:04,566
That's definitely different.

621
00:37:06,066 --> 00:37:07,566
If you wait here➡

622
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:11,066
An old man named Komiyama will come and pick me up.

623
00:37:17,066 --> 00:37:18,566
this.

624
00:37:18,566 --> 00:37:20,566
Give it to that old man.

625
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:34,566
That guy's face is a bit scary though➡

626
00:37:34,566 --> 00:37:36,566
But he's such a nice person.

627
00:37:38,066 --> 00:37:42,566
He thinks about the stars properly.

From here on➡

643
00:39:50,066 --> 00:39:55,066
I don't know where you'll live.

644
00:39:58,066 --> 00:40:00,066
Maybe...

645
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:06,066
Something even more difficult may be waiting for you than now.

646

Hold on and survive.

Nice?

651
00:40:42,066 --> 00:40:43,566
Let's promise.

Yakusoku.

653
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:58,566
yes.

654
00:40:58,566 --> 00:41:00,566
It's a promise.

It’s me…➡

658
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:28,066
Even in a life full of worst things➡

659
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:30,066
There were good times.

660
00:41:31,566 --> 00:41:33,566
((Gah~!)) (Saito)((Hehe…))

661
00:41:33,566 --> 00:41:35,566

(Saito)((Okay, good work!))

663
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:46,566
If you think that good things are waiting for you in the future➡

664
00:41:46,566 --> 00:41:48,566
Isn't it better now?

665
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,566
But➡

666
00:41:56,566 --> 00:42:00,066
Hope is slowly wearing away➡

667
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:03,566
I'll definitely come and pick you up before it reaches zero.

668
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:08,566
I might not be able to do anything.

669
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:13,566
It's here.

670
00:42:31,066 --> 00:42:32,566
1 person?

671
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:37,966
What about your father or mother?

672
00:42:49,566 --> 00:42:51,566
(Daisuke's voice) ``To Mr. Komiyama.

673
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:54,066
This child is Hoshi Jonouchi.

674
00:42:54,066 --> 00:42:58,066
Her mother, Akira Jonouchi, doesn't really take care of her.

675
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:00,566
There are few words that can be spoken.

676
00:43:00,566 --> 00:43:03,066
It seems like neglect.

677
00:43:03,066 --> 00:43:06,066
Thank you for your understanding of the stars.

It's a souvenir from Daisuke Hayashida.

Hoshi: Are you hungry?

683
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:32,066
Did you run away from your mother?

684
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:38,066
I see.

685
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:40,566
It was tough.

686
00:43:40,566 --> 00:43:42,066
Many things to come➡

687
00:43:42,066 --> 00:43:44,066
There are so many things I have to do➡

688
00:43:44,066 --> 00:43:47,566
I was able to eat dinner and play with friends➡

689
00:43:47,566 --> 00:43:51,066
I'll make sure you can go to school.

690
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:54,066
I'm sure there will be lots of fun things to come.

691
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:58,066
Komiyama?

692
00:43:58,066 --> 00:44:01,066
Yes, it's Komiyama.

693
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:04,066
What's the matter? Can't you just talk?

694
00:44:04,066 --> 00:44:05,566
Good person.

695
00:44:05,566 --> 00:44:08,066
Hehe...

696
00:44:08,066 --> 00:44:11,566
Did Hayashida inject it? Maybe.

697
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,066
I can hear it~

698
00:44:13,066 --> 00:44:14,566

It was a waste of time.

765
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:54,066
Hey, do you know "Satori"?

The founder who raised Yagami Pharmaceutical to become one of Japan's leading pharmaceutical companies in a single generation➡

Among people close to the Yagami family➡

Because it's said honestly.

Maybe...

779
00:49:53,566 --> 00:49:57,066
