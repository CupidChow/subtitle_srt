He continues to run away with Daisuke Hayashida, one of the criminal group.

Why do you have it?

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Too bad I forgot to reply.

Ah, this is what I was interested in. Is it true?

Do you want to eat now? Ah, no, either way.

Ah... Huh? sorry.

Actually I...

65
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,000
I was being abused by my father.

67
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,000
I wanted to run away from my father➡

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,500
I eloped with this person.

69
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,000
Elope?

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,500
There's one person I've trusted since I was little ➡

71
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,000
I was planning on asking that person to hide me.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
A lot of things happened and I had nowhere to go.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,500
But I don't want to go back to that house ever again.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Does that mean your father is lying?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
My father saw me running away➡

76
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,500
I don't think it's acceptable.

77
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Dai-chan is➡

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,000
They think I'm the enemy who stole my precious daughter from me.

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,500
If I get caught, I might be killed.

80
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
please.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Could you please let me stay here for a little while?

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,500
ask.

83
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,000
I'll come out as soon as I find another move.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,500
I'll return the 200,000 yen to you, and I'll also pay your gratitude.

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,000

86
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Yui-chan.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It was tough.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's small, but I wish I could stay at home...

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is it okay?

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I thought Riri would understand.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
It's not for Dai-chan. Ah...

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,000

(Gun) As expected, I'm not the type of woman who would be able to go out with Linda.

96

Again, we cannot guarantee your daughter's safety!

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
(Fuji) I am fully aware of the risk of upsetting Hayashida.

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll be careful from now on.

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
(Keishi) Is it a crown?

102
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
This is within the expected range.

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,500
That's bad.

104
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,500
I'm busy just doing my normal work. No.

105
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,000
This should increase the number of sightings.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,500
Increase the speed and accuracy of information gathering➡

107
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,500
I'll tell the staff. Please.

108
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,500
(Miyazono) Now that Hayashida's name has appeared➡

109
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,500
There is bound to be a backlash against the press agreement. (Ebihara) I understand.

110
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,000
(Tabata) Manager!

111
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,500
(Tabata) I have checked all the protective cameras near the park where the child was protected➡

112
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,000
All power was out during that time.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is that really the case?

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,500
I think the collaborators may have manipulated it➡

115
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,000
Mr. Komiyama said.

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,500
Did you have other friends? perhaps.

117
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,000
Have you heard from the child you rescued?

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I will start listening tomorrow➡

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It may take some time. Why?

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
There is a possibility that you may have been traumatized➡

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,500
Mr. Komiyama says that there will be problems if we don't proceed carefully.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
(Daisuke's voice) Is what you just said true?

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What? It's abuse.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Ah, that's a lie.

125
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,000
What is that? Elopement is also a lie.

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,400
I know!

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I thought maybe there was something more unpleasant than GPS.

128
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,500
No, no.

129
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Well, it was just as Linda said.

130
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,500
Riri really accepted me.

131
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,000
Well.

132
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have you told Gan-san about Riri-san?

133
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,500
I don't talk, but there are things that people don't know about.

134
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,500
GPS and eavesdropping devices were embedded.

135
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Where is your neck?

136
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey, where, where?! I'm just kidding.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,500
I know~

138
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Well…｡

139
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I can't help it though.

140
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,000
That's a lie, right?

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,500
picture?

142
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,000
``It can't be helped,'' says Linda.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Because I can't help it.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,500
I wonder if Riri-san liked this kind of arrogance?

145
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,500
You used difficult words and said bad things to me again.

146
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,000
It's not a bad word, it just means I don't care about the details.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
But why did you break up?

148
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,000
There's a lot going on. Is it because I borrowed money?

149
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What did you use the 200,000 for? Okay, about the past!

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,500
Is the debt ongoing?

151
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,000
what? Like gambling?

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,500
(Masaki) I wonder how many Daisuke Hayashidas there are in the world?

153
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
(Misaki) Hmm...｡

154
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,000
(Misaki) These four are the most likely for me...

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
(Masaki) 4 choices... Any other ideas?

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hmm, there is so much information➡

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I don't know which is true, so I can't follow it at all.

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,500
Hmm... using something like AI➡

159
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,000
Can't you just snap it in an instant?

160
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
(Misaki) I don't know about that, so I'll have to look for it steadily.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,500
Thank you very much.

162
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,000
It's just a nuisance for Riri...

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
not at all.

164
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
I'm even happy because I'm the type of person who doesn't usually get asked for help.

165
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
He's too nice. That's not true.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Or rather, why don't you stop using honorific language?

167
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,500
Yes, thank you.

168
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is he saying something?

169
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,500
Nothing came.

170
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Aren't you waiting for a call from Riri?

171
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,000
Just say, ``I'm sorry about earlier.''

172
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Yeah.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
What kind of person are you?

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
picture? What do you like about it?

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Ah... I guess I'm an adult.

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's right.

177
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Eh, is that on the other hand more like a teacher?

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ah... maybe so.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Dai-chan is such an amazing child sometimes.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I understand! Even though I'm older, I'm worried.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,500
To put it simply, it's pure.

182
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,500
That's too much to say. Hahaha...

183
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,500
What about Yui-chan? What do you like about Dai-chan?

184
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,500
Eh, what is it...?

185
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,500
((Good luck, second life))

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,500
♬～

187
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,000
pink….

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
picture? What does it mean?

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's weird. Forget it.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Doesn't Dai-chan look pink to Yui-chan?

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,000
Does Riri understand?

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,500
No... no, I don't think so hahaha...｡

193
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Yui-chan maiden is so cute hahahaha...｡

194
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,000
⚟Week show! Shoi! ⚞

195
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,500
Didn't he look like an old man?

196
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,000
Is that cute too?

197
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,500
No, it's impossible! Haha... Ah, good, good.

198
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,000
Hahahaha…｡ Hahahaha…｡

199
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
(Wisteria) Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,500
What do you want to ask?

201
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Mr. Fuji, do you know “Satori”?

202
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,500
Who did you ask? I am a reporter for ``Weekly Shinryu.''

203
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,000
I've only heard about it as a rumor.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
is that so….

205
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,500
But it seems to be taboo in front of the president.

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Why would you let go of such a good person?

207
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Huh... Yui-chan says that?

208
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Because...

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ah, did Riri shake it?

210
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,500
Ah...｡

211
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,000
Eh, Yui-chan➡

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Have you met Dai-chan's mother?

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,500
Hmm. I see...

214
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Ah, no... I heard it from Dai-chan after all.

215
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
I don't think it's for me to talk about it.

216
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,000
Hmm… Got it. (Sound of opening a can)

217
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:59,000
(sound of opening a can)

218
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,500
Sorry, I feel confused. Ugh.

219
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,000
But don't worry, I don't think anything of it right now.

220
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,500
Doesn't it mean you started hating it?

221
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,000
Ah...｡

222
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,500
I feel like I've been out of touch with something for a long time.

223
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:23,000
Ah...we were classmates in high school➡

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,500
I'd say it's a completely different group. Yeah.

225
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,000
After getting a job, we met again by chance➡

226
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I got excited and started dating him, thinking, ``Oh, maybe it's fate.''

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Hmm... About me➡

228
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,500
It seems like you're watching me, but you're not watching me~➡

229
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,500
I've been thinking that...

230
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:45,500
There must be something more important than me.

231
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:50,000
I wasn't like that, so it became more and more difficult for me.

232
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,500
I see...

233
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,000
But when I look at the two of them, they really suit each other➡

234
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,500
Is elopement a thing these days? That's what I thought at first➡

235
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
I want to support you.

236
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Is it true?

237
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,000
thank you.

238
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,000
♪~ Benbebenbebenben aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaao

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
(Tabata's voice) What is Hayashida thinking?

240
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
(Komiyama) Huh? no….

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,500
Leaving Hoshi-kun in the care of Komi-san at great risk➡

242
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,500
As someone who is being chased by the police, it makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?

243
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,000
(Komiyama) Well.

244
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,500
I don't understand why President Yagami is acting out of control.

245
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Huh...well.

246
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,500
What if Hayashida gets mad over this and kills Yui Yagami...

247
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,000
That's not it.

248
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Does that mean that Hayashida doesn't do koroshi?

249
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,500
That's possible, but think about it.

250
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Is this really a kidnapping case?

251
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,000
picture? But there was also a demand for ransom.

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,500
That was when Joji Saito was alive.

253
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,500
You won't make any further demands without receiving that money, right?

254
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
surely.

255
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,500
In the first place, Hayashida joined the kidnapping group➡

256
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,500
I think it's a debt of gratitude to Joji Saito.

257
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Is that so? Yeah.

258
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,500
That guy kidnapping for ransom is a big deal➡

259
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm not the kind of person who would do that.

260
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,500
But when Saito died, the plan fell apart midway...

261
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,000
But I don't know how to demand a ransom again.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,500
Does that mean you're running away with the hostages for now?

263
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,500
That's probably it.

264
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,000
But if that's the case, I think Yui Yagami has a chance to escape.

265
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What if I don't want to run away? picture?

266
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Should I tell you that I have no intention of coming home?

267
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
What? that.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If you think about it that way, it would explain why President Yagami goes out of control.

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Isn't that just a runaway?

270
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
That's right. Huh... us➡

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Are you just caught up in a parent-child fight?

272
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's right.

273
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hayashida is probably like that too. Eh...

274
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
(Salesperson) Sorry to have kept you waiting.

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,500
(Komiyama) Itadakimasu is good.

276
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,000
(shutter sound)

277
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,500
(Sound of film winding) (Riri) Ah, that precious one...

278
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,000
picture? Because that's it➡

279
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
You can only take about 30 photos, right?

280
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I wanted to try something like this, so this is also valuable.

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This guy tells me to get an Uber.

282
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I've never asked for it. The young lady...

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,500
What else? Is there anything else you wanted to do other than Uber?

284
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Oh, there are so many! What what?

285
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,000
It's spinning sushi... and a crane game ➡

286
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I also wanted to get a stuffed animal➡

287
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,500
I wanted to take a picture of Puri too. Hmm.

288
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Also, outdoor festivals. Ah, I've never been to a festival either.

289
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:28,500
Or just lazing around until morning at a family restaurant➡

290
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,000
My friends and I also admired werewolves.

291
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Let's do it all. Huh?

292
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
No, I have to check the schedule for festivals➡

293
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,500
Can't you do everything else tomorrow?

294
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:45,000
Are we idiots? There's a bounty on the line, right?

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ah, I see...

296
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But thank you. Just that feeling makes me happy.

297
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,000
hang on.

298
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
What day will it be tomorrow?

299
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
tomorrow?

300
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,000
tomorrow….

301
00:16:04,566 --> 00:16:08,066
Good morning. Good morning... Ah, a makeover?

302
00:16:08,066 --> 00:16:11,566
Riri-chan lent it to me~ It's cute, isn't it?

303
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:14,066
He's a good guy. That's right.

304
00:16:14,066 --> 00:16:17,066
I have no idea why he was dating Linda.

305
00:16:17,066 --> 00:16:21,066
Good morning. You are irreplaceable.

306
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,566
Why are you suddenly saying something bad?

307
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,566
Well...

308
00:16:25,566 --> 00:16:28,066
Some bad news and some very bad news➡

309
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:30,066
Which one would you like to hear from?

310
00:16:30,066 --> 00:16:33,066
I don't want to hear either.

311
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,566
(Masaki) Hello!

312
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,566
(Masaki: Misaki) Yay! (applause)

313
00:16:37,566 --> 00:16:39,566
What a day...

314
00:16:44,066 --> 00:16:45,566
Yeah.

315
00:16:49,566 --> 00:16:53,066
That's what I meant...

316
00:16:53,066 --> 00:16:56,066
Official photos have been released!

317
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:02,066
What is this? I guess he was sold after graduation.

318
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:05,066
Seriously... What is this processing?

319
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,066
Thanks to the press agreement, the media hasn't done it yet➡

320
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:11,066
It's probably only a matter of time before it's lifted.

321
00:17:11,066 --> 00:17:13,066
What will happen if that happens?

322
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,066
He's super famous.

323
00:17:16,066 --> 00:17:18,566
This is some bad news and some very bad news➡

324
00:17:18,566 --> 00:17:20,566
Which one is it?

325
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:22,566
Are you curious about that?

326
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:27,566
did? You did, right? Well then...

327
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:32,066
Yeah.

328
00:17:32,066 --> 00:17:34,566
Then this...

329
00:17:39,066 --> 00:17:41,066
We work together. Yeah.

330
00:17:41,066 --> 00:17:43,066
Something like, ``We used to date.''

331
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:47,566
If anyone can speak, please tell us secretly.

332
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:51,566
Tsume...!

333
00:17:51,566 --> 00:17:53,066
Fufufu…｡ Fufufu…｡

334
00:17:56,066 --> 00:17:59,566
What was it? Yesterday.

335
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:02,566
Ex-boyfriend and ex-boyfriend's current girlfriend?

336
00:18:02,566 --> 00:18:04,066
picture?

337
00:18:04,066 --> 00:18:07,566
He's in trouble, so I decided to let him stay for a while.

338
00:18:07,566 --> 00:18:10,066
Until when? I don't understand.

339
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:11,566
What is that?

340
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:14,566
Then I can't go to Lily's house.

341
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:18,066
We can meet even if we're not at home, right?

342
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:21,566
Yeah... well, that's true.

343
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:24,566
Hey, there's somewhere I want to go.

344
00:18:24,566 --> 00:18:26,066
where?

345
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:28,066
Ibaraki aquarium.

346
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,066
There are a lot of sharks!

347
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,066
Don't you want to see sharks swimming leisurely?

348
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,066
Ibaraki?...

349
00:18:37,566 --> 00:18:40,066
It's impossible...

350
00:18:42,066 --> 00:18:46,566
If things go well, I'll take you anywhere.

351
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:56,566
(Researcher A) This will definitely look new.

352
00:18:56,566 --> 00:19:00,066
I think this will be the drug that will carry Yagami Pharmaceutical over the next 20 years.

353
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,566
Wow, that's amazing...

354
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:06,066
You've arrived well.

355
00:19:06,066 --> 00:19:08,066
(Researcher A) Thank you.

356
00:19:08,066 --> 00:19:10,066
I'm trying to budget as much as possible➡

357
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:12,566
Could you give me some more time?

358
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:15,566
(Researcher A) Understood. Thank you.

359
00:19:15,566 --> 00:19:17,566
(Knock) Yes.

360
00:19:17,566 --> 00:19:19,066
(Fuji) Excuse me.

361
00:19:34,066 --> 00:19:36,066
President Hayashida had an arrest record.

362
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:40,066
It seems that he was arrested six years ago for acting as a child for a dark part-time job.

363
00:19:40,066 --> 00:19:42,066
When I was a minor.

364
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,066
Yui-san➡

365
00:19:45,066 --> 00:19:48,066
Is it really okay to be with someone like that?

366
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,566
Huh...

367
00:19:51,566 --> 00:19:54,066
(Gun's voice) If the mask is cracked, Mae will be found out too.

368
00:19:54,066 --> 00:19:57,066
You'll soon find out the number of moles on your ass.

369
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:58,566
No, my ass is beautiful!

370
00:19:58,566 --> 00:20:01,566
He's a 100 million man! Congratulations.

371
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,566
Why did you come back to Tokyo?

372
00:20:03,566 --> 00:20:05,566
I can't go out.

373
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:07,066
Stay home for the rest of your life.

374
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,066
Oh... you hate me?

375
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:12,566
But in places with a small population, everyone knows each other.

376
00:20:12,566 --> 00:20:16,066
I thought they chose Shibuya, but that's right.

377
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:18,566
Unlike Linda, Hachi understands things very well.

378
00:20:18,566 --> 00:20:20,066
I know too!

379
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:23,566
How far do you think your father is?

380
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:27,066
I wonder what you think~ Well, there are some real stories➡

381
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,566
There are so many fakes that it's not even funny.

382
00:20:29,566 --> 00:20:31,066
Any sighting information?

383
00:20:31,066 --> 00:20:33,066
Atami seems to be hot right now.

384
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,566
picture? Are we supposed to be in Atami?

385
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:38,066
Hachi's father will put up a bounty ➡

386
00:20:38,066 --> 00:20:40,066
This is what happens.

387
00:20:40,066 --> 00:20:42,066
There are people who post random information for money➡

388
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:45,066
Do you mean...? That's what it is.

389
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:49,066
Well, just because you have money doesn't mean you can do anything.

390
00:20:49,066 --> 00:20:51,066
Can we trade directly?

391
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,566
picture?

392
00:20:52,566 --> 00:20:55,066
Dark part-time job.

393
00:20:55,066 --> 00:20:57,566
It's probably just for the money.

394
00:20:57,566 --> 00:21:01,066
If you say you have no intention of handing it over to the police➡

395
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:05,566
Maybe it can be solved somehow with money?

396
00:21:05,566 --> 00:21:09,066
I'll think of a way to contact you➡

397
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:11,566
Do I have to turn myself in to the police?

398
00:21:11,566 --> 00:21:15,066
Of course you will be punished.

399
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,566
The best thing to do now is to bring Yui back.

400
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:21,566
Please think of some way to contact me.

401
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:23,066
yes.

402
00:21:26,566 --> 00:21:28,066
(violent tapping sound)

403
00:21:29,066 --> 00:21:30,566
Huh…｡

404
00:21:30,566 --> 00:21:34,066
Yes. Earphones) (Wisteria) Which one are you using now?

405
00:21:34,066 --> 00:21:37,066
I'm on my way to Atami.

406
00:21:37,066 --> 00:21:41,066
It's not confirmed, but there are many reports of sightings.

407
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:44,566
Earphones) Excuse me, but before that, can I ask you one thing?

408
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:01,066
(Tomoko) Are you Bandai-san?

409
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:04,066
(Bandai) Yes, Mr. Hayashida?

410
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:06,066
This is Hayashida from Tulip Insurance.

411
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:09,066
Thank you for contacting us.

412
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:11,566
Thank you very much for your help.

413
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:16,066
Who are you introducing this time?

414
00:22:16,066 --> 00:22:17,566
Mr. Hayashida.

415
00:22:17,566 --> 00:22:19,066
yes.

416
00:22:23,566 --> 00:22:26,066
Can I contact my son?

417
00:22:29,566 --> 00:22:32,566
What's another bad story?

418
00:22:32,566 --> 00:22:34,566
your mother➡

419
00:22:34,566 --> 00:22:36,566
I have increased my debt again.

420
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,066
Seriously...?

421
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:43,566
What do you mean “again”? It doesn't matter to me.

422
00:22:43,566 --> 00:22:46,566
Hachi, go outside.

423
00:22:46,566 --> 00:22:49,566
Linda, keep an eye on me. Yes.

424
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:51,066
Stand there.

425
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,566
Are you here? Yeah.

426
00:22:56,066 --> 00:22:59,566
picture? Don't move~

427
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:05,066
Yes, okay.

428
00:23:05,066 --> 00:23:07,066
My son is involved in a kidnapping incident➡

429
00:23:07,066 --> 00:23:09,066
You know, right?

430
00:23:11,566 --> 00:23:14,066
I spoke to the police.

431
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,566
But Yui still hasn't returned.

432
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,566
If you are a parent too➡

433
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,066
You understand how President Yagami feels, right?

434
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,066
As for us➡

435
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:33,066
I think it would be fine as long as Yui-san returns.

436
00:23:33,066 --> 00:23:35,066
what do you mean?

437
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:40,066
I won't tell the police➡

438
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:44,066
Could I meet Daisuke Hayashida?

439
00:23:44,066 --> 00:23:49,066
He was a minor when he was arrested last time, but if he is arrested this time➡

440
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:52,566
It will take a certain number of years.

441
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,566
(Bandai) I will pay the compensation.

442
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,566
Joining insurance➡

443
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:08,066
If you would like to give it to me for 1 million yen in cash➡

444
00:24:08,066 --> 00:24:10,066
Which one do you prefer?

445
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,500
Wow! Amazing!

446
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,000
Happy Halloween!

447
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Ahaha...!

448
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,500
Riri-chan is the best.

449
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,500
Kidnapper with hostage and ex-girlfriend➡

450
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,000
I never thought I would have fun on Halloween.

451
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
(Call audio) No, I'm not having fun.

452
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
(Riri) Yay!

453
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,000
Is it okay? They went to a sushi restaurant.

454
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,500
no problem.

455
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Amazing!

456
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,000
The cake is really flowing!

457
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Eh... that's amazing!

458
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
(3 people) Hmm!

459
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,500
Smartphone) (vibrating sound)

460
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh...! Amazing amazing amazing! came! This is here…!

461
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Wow! Ah~!

462
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh oh…! please!

463
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,500
Ah~! Ah~!

464
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh! Oh...! love…!

465
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,500
(Riri: Yui) Wow! Oh!

466
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,000
Yay! (Riri) I did it, I did it...!

467
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Okay! Let's take a photo! Okay!

468
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,500
Yes cheese! (camera shutter sound)

469
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Oh, that’s amazing! (Riri) Ahaha...!

470
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,500
Eyes are big! Eyes like this are getting bigger!

471
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Jaan melon soda cola mix.

472
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,000
Is it delicious? That's delicious. This is it.

473
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,500
Today was like a dream.

474
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
Thank you very much Riri-chan.

475
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,000
I had fun too.

476
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yui-chan’s reaction is so funny➡

477
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,500
It feels like I'm back to when I was a student, hehe...

478
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Was your boyfriend okay?

479
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,500
I borrowed Riri yesterday and today.

480
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,000
No, it's okay, I've been feeling dissatisfied with it lately.

481
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Eh, what? I'll listen if you don't mind.

482
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,500
There are so many restrictions. Restrictions?

483
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,500
That's right, he's some heir➡

484
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
He must be being closely monitored by his father.

485
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,000
Shut up for a moment.

486
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Hmm~｡

487
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,500
I can't see you on the weekend➡

488
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,500
I can't go to the other house.

489
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,500
Does that mean you have a family?

490
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Is it an affair? So shut up.

491
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,500
Do you despise it?

492
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,000
Uh... no.

493
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
But I thought it would be a waste for Riri-chan.

494
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,500
I wish there was someone who cared more about me.

495
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:48,000
I hear that a lot. Yeah...

496
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,500
Don't you think so?

497
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,500
I don’t think you understand➡

498
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,000
He's the only one who says he needs me.

499
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,500
My smartphone➡

500
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:14,000
It wouldn't ring at all if he wasn't there.

501
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,500
It was really fun today.

502
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:27,500
I thought for a moment that we should break up.

503
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,500
But I can't come between them.

504
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,000
I'll come out someday.

505
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Riri-chan

506
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,500
yeah?

507
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I understand how Lily feels, but...

508
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Will his family be hurt?

509
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
You may be asked to pay compensation.

510
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
That seems stupid.

511
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Yui-chan...

512
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Do you really like Dai-chan?

513
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,500
picture?

514
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,000
Even I don't think things are good the way they are now.

515
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I tried to quit many times and even deleted my contact information.

516
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
but….

517
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
If you receive a call from the other side➡

518
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,900
I'm going back after all.

519
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:40,500
I can't refuse if you ask me to meet you.

520
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:45,000
Even if I think we should break up this time➡

521
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Meet me➡

522
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,500
Say "I love you"➡

523
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
If you ask me...

524
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,000
Why…➡

525
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,500
I guess we have to break up...

526
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
I'm thinking about it.

527
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
he….

528
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Even if it’s a lie➡

529
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,500
You'll tell me that you need me...

530
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Maybe it's like a dream that doesn't make sense.

531
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
That kind of thing➡

532
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,500
Yui-chan doesn't understand.

Smartphone) (vibrating sound)

534
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
⚟This is Bandai⚞

535
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Excuse me.

536
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,500
Sorry for being late.

537
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,500
I was able to contact Daisuke Hayashida's mother.

538
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,000
So?

539
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Hayashida called me right in front of me➡

540
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
There was no way to go out.

541
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I guess so.

542
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,500
I will continue to keep in touch with you.

543
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,000
thank you.

544
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,500
Huh…｡

545
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,000
Um... Huh?

546
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:37,000
Is the president on vacation?

547
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,500
I noticed that your complexion didn't look good...

548
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,000
It's okay, thank you.

549
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Excuse me.

551
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:21,000
♬～

552
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,500
(knock)

553
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
What is it?

554
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,500
I made a mistake... Huh?

555
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:39,500
We shouldn't have come to Lily's place...

556
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,500
You said, ``Riri can do it.''

557
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,000
No, that's not true, but... that guy is dangerous.

558
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
What? You're not going to say you love me yet, are you?

559
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
No, I won't say that.

560
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Not so...

561
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,500
I can't say no if someone asks me ➡

562
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,500
I thought it was because he was a good guy➡

563
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,000
I think it could also be a weakness.

564
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,500
Hmm, what do you mean...?

565
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,000
Want to be seen well or needed➡

566
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,500
I have a strong feeling like that...

567
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Ah...｡

568
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,000
That's why we took advantage of Riri's weakness.

569
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I didn't mean to do that, but...

570
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,500
I see.

571
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,000
Isn't it the same with that adulterous bastard?

572
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,500
((I understand, anything about Riri))

573
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,500
What does it mean?

574
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:39,000
Just like what Riri thinks➡

575
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,500
It's not like you think of Riri as necessary.

576
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,000
It's not something I can say, though.

577
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,000
If I knew it would definitely hurt, I wanted to stop it.

578
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
how?

579
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,500
That's why I would like to borrow Mr. Gan's help.

580
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
I'm not a subscriber though.

581
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,000
No, do something about that!

582
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:08,000
President Yagami! My name is Shiraki from Weekly Shinryu.

583
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,500
(Fuji) What is it? Please this.

584
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,000
Um... that's tough, isn't it?

585
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,500
When the company is in a pinch ➡

586
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
I can't believe my daughter has been kidnapped. Please take her back.

587
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,000
(Shiraki) The souvenirs left by the previous generation are about to run out, right?

588
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
President Keishi's own abilities are being questioned!

589
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,500
(Wisteria) Please pick it up!

590
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,000
I hope things with the Hoover Company come to an end.

591
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,500
Ugh...! I'll close it!

592
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Was that President Carl? (Wisteria) Please let me out!

593
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:34,500
It must be Umisenzansen, who has worked with managers all over the world!? Hey!

594
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,500
Huh… hah… hah…｡

597
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,500
Hmm…｡

598
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,000
a.

599
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
That's fine.

600
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
Omoro...!

601
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,000
(Sound of keyboard hitting)

602
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
<Hey, listen, you can watch all episodes of "ESCAPE" on TVer! ＞

603
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
<Okay, let's watch all 4 episodes that will be distributed after this at once! ＞

604
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,500
<But now is the only time you can watch all episodes for free➡

605
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,000
Never forget! ＞ ＜Meow~⁉＞

606
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,500
<Everyone, please recommend it to me tomorrow! ＞

607
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,000
(chime)

608
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,500
good morning.

609
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,000
Is it Riri?

610
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,000
Hachi~ Linda~ Let's go out~｡

611
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Mr. Gan.

612
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Isn't it noticeable?

613
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
It stands out. Huh?

614
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Riri-chan: If the person who saw us had to explain it to someone➡

615
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,500
What do you say? Eh...｡

616
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
Are you from the kitchen car sunglasses group?

617
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,500
Right? I don't remember anything more than that.

618
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,000
I see!

619
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,500
Actually, didn't you just want to do Halloween together?

620
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,000
Ugh! Let's take a photo.

621
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
I'll take a picture. I want to take a picture with Gan-san.

622
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,500
But... I don't know who it is.

623
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,000
Only we understand.

624
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
The person with the longest arms, please. Yes.

625
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,500
Let's take a picture.

626
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,000
Yes cheese! (camera shutter sound)

627
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,500
(Knock) (Second Secretary) Excuse me.

628
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,000
president.

629
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Have you seen the email from Hoover Pharmaceuticals?

630
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,500
Do you want to pretend that there was no talk of a business partnership?

631
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:05,500
Yes... But President Karl was in a good mood the other day, right?

632
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,000
I'm sorry, but could you please set up another meeting?

633
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,500
Because I have a good story for the other side.

634
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
I got it.

635
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:17,000
(Sound of door opening and closing)

636
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,500
(knock)

637
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,500
(Fuji) Excuse me.

638
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,500
president.

639
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,500
It seems that Yui-san and Hayashida's whereabouts have been found.

640
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,000
Is it true?

641
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,500
I was able to confirm the location information of Hayashida's smartphone➡

642
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,000
There are also reports of sightings in the vicinity.

643
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
It looks like the police are on their way now, what do you think?

644
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Is that information accurate?

645
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,500
This is definitely Yui and Hayashida, right?

646
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
What about Bandai?

647
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes, confirmed information has arrived! (applause)

648
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
It's going to bulge now! Wait, 100 million yen!

649
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
The location is Sendai!

650
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,500
Sendai is really far away. Yeah.

651
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,500
This is delicious. (Riri) Yeah, it's delicious.

652
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,000
(Customer) Do you have hot coffee? (Gun) Sold out.

653
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,000
(Customer) Huh? All sold out.

654
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,500
Ah yes...

655
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
What is the purpose of this?

656
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Well, let's see.

657
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,500
(Girl) Daddy, hurry up!

658
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,500
⚟Yes! ⚞

659
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
(Hatanaka) Let's go.

660
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,500
Ah...!

661
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:53,000
♬～

662
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,500
Riri-chan...!

663
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:07,000
♬～

664
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Can I go and punch you?

665
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,500
Let's talk once.

666
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,500
Because you saw it, right? Is your wife pregnant?

667
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,500
He touched another woman while his wife was pregnant➡

668
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:21,000
But on my cheating partner's birthday, I go camping with my family.

669
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
It's a good life.

670
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Seriously, I'll send you through hell.

671
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
I ended up being too cruel to Riri...

672
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You said it.

673
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,500
Even Mr. Gunn came along for the ride.

674
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,000
I was told by you➡

675
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,500
I just looked into that adulterous bastard's plans.

676
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,500
I'm glad you don't hate me➡

677
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,000
I didn't hurt Riri that much...

678
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,000
Are you going to hit me?

679
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,000
picture?

680
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Understood. We will be arriving soon.

681
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,500
Excuse me.

682
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Apparently the area around the campsite has been sealed off.

683
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,500
Huh...

684
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,000
Ha... I can finally sleep well.

685
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
(Sound of sipping)

686
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,000
It seems stupid.

687
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Yui-chan advised me.

688
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,000
Ugh.

689
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,500
I hadn't made any "friends" at all.

690
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,000
picture?

691
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,500
He says things that sound like things from a textbook...

692
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Riri-chan should have known better than me.

693
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:00,500
I'm glad you thought of me like this.

694
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,000
I'll be careful like that again.

695
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,000
It's all my fault.

696
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,000
It may not be correct, but...

697
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,500
I want to be on Riri's side.

698
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,500
It takes 30 minutes to reach the campsite.

699
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Gan's special whipped super sweet smoothie.

700
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,000
Please come to the camp park.

701
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,500
Camp park...?

702
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,500
It's here, please hurry.

703
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Mr. Hatanaka.

704
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,000
Ugh!

705
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Hit your little finger on the corner of the bed every day, idiot!

706
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,500
Ugh!

707
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,500
Children don't like the smell, you idiot!

708
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,500
Get irritated with the shower head spinning for the rest of your life, idiot!

709
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,500
Riri...?

710
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Ugh! Ugh...!

711
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,500
fool!

712
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:43,400
(4 people) Stupid! fool! fool…!

713
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Did you see that stupid guy?

714
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
It was sticky!

715
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,500
Insects will come to you.

716
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:54,500
(Gun) What? I'm not feeling well.

717
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,000
(Riri) Uh-huh.

718
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
thank you.

719
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Thanks to you, I was really blown away.

720
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:15,000
♬～

721
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,000
(Miyazono) Thank you for your hard work. (Bandai) Are you two here?

722
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
The surrounding area is completely surrounded.

723
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,500
Investigators are currently looking for him.

724
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,000
Could you please wait here?

725
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,500
Understood.

726
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,000
Komi-san, how do you feel about your work now?

727
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,500
a?

728
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,500
It seems like they don't want to catch Hayashida.

729
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,000
Don't talk like that.

730
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
(Tabata) Is that so?

731
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,500
(Komiyama) I'd rather have it copied by someone else.

732
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,500
(knock)

733
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,500
Sorry.

734
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,000
I'd like to talk to you for a moment.

735
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
excuse me.

736
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Oh, amazing! It's a good bite!

737
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:18,000
speaker) (chime)

738
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Speaker) (artificial voice) Mr. Bandai.

739
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,500
Speaker) And the police.

740
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,000
Speaker) Thank you for your hard work traveling all the way to Sendai.

741
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
Speaker) Unfortunately, Yui Yagami and Daisuke Hayashida too➡

742
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm not here.

743
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,500
(Masaki: Misaki) Huh?

744
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,000
What do you mean?! Huh...?

745
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,900
I was beaten...

746
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,500
Excuse me.

747
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,500
Amazing!

748
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
(Gun) You did well, right?

749
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes, it's disgusting. I believe this!

750
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Did the police really go to Sendai? I went.

751
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Mr. Gan is the best!

752
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
The photo is fake➡

753
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,000
What was the location information on Hayashida's smartphone that disappeared near Sendai?

754
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,000
I guess he got framed.

755
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,500
President Yagami: Isn't it going to get more and more out of control?

756
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:28,000
It's such a hassle.

757
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,500
That's why I didn't want to come.

758
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:33,000
I'm going to eat beef tongue and go home. Yes.

759
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,500
Huh! So my smartphone is on a trip to Sendai?

760
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,000
Let the cute child travel.

761
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:55,500
♬～

762
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:58,000
Smartphone) (vibrating sound)

763
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,000
(Male) Hmm...?

764
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
Who is it? this.

765
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I don't feel like bringing him home from his trip.

766
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
That's okay, I'm getting a new one.

767
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,500
The power went out on the way, so I searched for a nearby campsite➡

768
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,000
Play around with the reservation list and look for images of couples who look like you➡

769
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,500
If you change your face, you'll be fine.

770
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,000
Hont Gan-san is so amazing.

771
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Why is it a campsite? Anywhere is fine, right?

772
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,500
If you can go anywhere, a campsite would be more interesting.

773
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,000
Looks like a fugitive is hiding there.

774
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
It's interesting!

775
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Linda~ Don't use your old account.

776
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Huh!? So does that mean I can't contact anyone?

777
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
What did the kidnapper say?

778
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,500
Dad, I wonder what's going on...

779
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,500
Is that so? Thank you for your hard work.

780
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
It seems like it was a blank shot.

781
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,500
Huh…｡ Hayashida is➡

782
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,000
We may be better than we think.

783
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,000
I'm home. I'm home.

784
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
(Riri) Welcome back, were you okay? Yeah.

785
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,500
Thanks to Mr. Gan, I feel like I'll never get caught.

786
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,000
Hehehe... That's right.

787
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,000
What are you doing?

788
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,000
teeth? Are you quitting your job? Huh?

789
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,500
Yeah.

790
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
Isn't this the company you joined because you wanted to?

791
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,500
That's right.

792
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,000
In such an important company➡

793
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,500
I did something unhelpful.

794
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:52,500
No... why did Riri quit?

795
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,000
He's the one at fault.

796
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,500
Because I'm bad too.

797
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,500
Look➡

798
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:05,000
I have a family to support over there... right?

799
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Is it okay? That's it.

800
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,500
It's my own fault.

801
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,500
Well... Good luck getting a new job. Who said that?

802
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,000
I've been smart since high school, so it's okay.

803
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:34,500
Have you known me since high school?

804
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,000
teeth? That's a hit.

805
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,500
I see...

806
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,500
I was popular in high school➡

807
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:46,000
This guy was so plain. Was he really popular?

808
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Well, to be honest…｡ Hmph… Hmph.

809
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,500
What's that face?

810
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Stop that piece too. Why?

811
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,500
Well, I'm weak against pressure, though.

812
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
Huh? Don't be weak.

813
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,000
Hmm.

814
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,500
Ah... now that I think about it, I stopped by the supermarket earlier➡

815
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,500
Tonight is➡

816
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,000
Would you like to have a fried food party? Kya~!

817
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Phew~ That's awesome. Let's call him Gan-san.

818
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,500
Let's call. Let's call. Will you come?

819
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,000
It's coming! I'll definitely come.

820
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:19,000
♬～

821
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
(Riri: Gan: Yui: Daisuke) I'll take it!

822
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Delicious! Huh! Crispy!

823
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,500
Mince cutlet! Hmm!

824
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
Hey Gan-san.

825
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
Would you like to stay the night tonight?

826
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Eh~ Fine, I am. Eh~｡

827
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,500
Today➡

828
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,500
It's my birthday.

829
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,500
Huh? Is that so? Ah…｡

830
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:46,000
It was the worst birthday ever➡

831
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,500
If Gan-san was here➡

832
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:52,000
I hope it ends happily though.

833
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Okay, let's play werewolf until morning.

834
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Gan-san, the werewolf looks really strong.

835
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,500
Yeah. Are you a student?

836
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:03,000
picture? I mean, how do four werewolves do it?

837
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:05,500
I've never done it so I don't know. Neither do I.

838
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,500
Don't you have too many friends? (Riri) Have you ever done it?

839
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,500
There is a game to play before the werewolf. Eh!?

840
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Please close your eyes. What, what...?

841
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,500
Hand, hand here... Huh, scary, scary, scary!

842
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,500
A person labeled as a demon? (Gun) I didn't write it.

843
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:20,500
That's why you can't say that! Ahahaha…!

844
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,000
<I wonder if this is what youth is like>

845
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
<That's what I thought➡

846
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,500
I hope I'm not the only one

Huh? Is it broken?

851
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You've used it all, haven't you?

852
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,500
Ah, I see, it's over...

853
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:01,500
Let's take a picture with my cell phone. Yeah!

854
