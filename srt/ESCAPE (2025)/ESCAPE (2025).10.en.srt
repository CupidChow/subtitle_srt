100
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,974
You must have been observing the other person very closely.

112
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,013

118
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,962

119

Chairman Kyoichi’s path?➡

125
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,490
Is it Kyo's path?

126
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,993

127

Don't look at my color.

180
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,060
Let's share the power.

181
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,995
What is that?

182
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,999
Hmph!

183
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,501
Ugh!

184
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,002
Seriously? Seriously?! Ah...!

185
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,504
That's a lie. You're lying.

186
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,004
Fufufu…｡ Fufufu…｡

187
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,511
But➡

188
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,014
Being able to touch people's hands like this➡

189
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:24,014
I didn't think so.

190
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:28,521
Let's go. Come on.

191
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:38,030
♬～

192
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,534
If you have the power of “Satori”➡

193
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,034
I thought I would line it up for you.

194
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,040
That's ridiculous.

195
00:11:54,547 --> 00:12:00,553
(people talking)

196
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:03,989
This will cause a commotion before I can meet my dad.

197
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,991
I wonder if they should go somewhere.

198
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,991
Even if it's just for a moment.

199
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,998
(Masaki) I'm tired. (Misaki) Yeah.

200
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:14,498
Ah!

201
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:23,008
Huh? That!

202
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:26,512
It's Hachi and Linda! Itaitaitaitai…!

203
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:30,015
⚟ Everyone, don't run because it's dangerous! ⚞

204
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:32,017
It’s Yui Yagami, right?

205
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,019
(Female reporter) Did you come to see your father?

206
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,021
(Male reporter) You are Hayashida-san, right?

207
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:39,024
(Masaki) Sorry, it's the wrong person.

208
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:42,528
(Misaki) We are Hachi and Linda fans.

209
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:45,531
We look so similar!? I'm so happy!

212
00:13:01,046 --> 00:13:03,482

218
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:58,536
I'm sorry for kidnapping you.

219
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,042
Old man's...

220
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:09,049
Listen to Mr. Saito's daughter's story ➡

221
00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:11,049
I thought it was a hideous guy.

222
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:17,053
But there was a misunderstanding, right?

223
00:14:24,064 --> 00:14:26,064
Saito...?

224
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:35,509
The old man➡

225
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:38,012
He believed in me.

226
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:41,012
Even though I didn't believe in me.

227
00:14:44,018 --> 00:14:46,518
You made me think that I can do it too.

228
00:14:48,022 --> 00:14:51,022
(Daisuke's voice) He taught me things like how to live.

229
00:14:57,531 --> 00:15:02,036
To me, the old man is like an older brother and like a father➡

230
00:15:02,036 --> 00:15:05,036
He was a person who gave me many things.

231
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,541
It was bad.

232
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,049
Tell that to the old man.

233
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:28,562
I betrayed Saito...➡

234
00:15:28,562 --> 00:15:30,564
It's true.

235
00:15:30,564 --> 00:15:35,503
Huh? I don't know what you're trying to put on that parenthesis, but it's lame.

236
00:15:35,503 --> 00:15:39,003
Please excuse me! Everything is my weakness.

237
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:46,013
I was still an employee of Yagami Pharmaceutical at the time➡

238
00:15:46,013 --> 00:15:50,017
Desperate for the new drug developed by Saito...➡

239
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:53,020
I was pushing desperately.

240
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,523
Of course, his daughter➡

241
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,525
It was to help Natsuki-chan.

242
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,026
(Saito)((Just hurry to Natsuki➡

243
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:00,528
I wish I could use this medicine))

244
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:02,029
((Oh, leave it to me!))

245
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:06,534
As a result of their efforts, the story reached the president.

246
00:16:06,534 --> 00:16:12,039
And as a top priority project➡

247
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:15,539
We have decided to proceed with commercialization.

248
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:20,047
Saito was extremely happy.

249
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,550
For commercialization➡

250
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,053
Saito gave only one condition.

251
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:29,056
Let Natsuki-chan participate in the clinical trial.

252
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,559
That was it.

253
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,994
However, the company ➡

254
00:16:33,994 --> 00:16:36,997
Aiming for global expansion➡

255
00:16:36,997 --> 00:16:40,000
The trial will be conducted in America.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,004
Natsuki will no longer be able to participate in the clinical trial.

257
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:47,004
No, that's a different story. That's right.

258
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,512
That's why I protested vehemently.

259
00:16:51,512 --> 00:16:56,016
If you don't agree to the conditions, I'll withdraw everything ➡

260
00:16:56,016 --> 00:16:59,520
I went to see the previous president, Kyoichi.

261
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Then...

262
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:05,524
Huh...

263
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,528
My hand was held.

264
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:17,037
"You have great prospects," he said.

265
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,541
And ➡

266
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,045
I was just an employee➡

267
00:17:25,045 --> 00:17:30,050
They started talking about making him the successor to Yagami Pharmaceutical.

268
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:33,053
I didn't know what it was.

269
00:17:33,053 --> 00:17:36,053
But at that time...

270
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,559
I thought I was recognized.

271
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:47,064
Aren't you just blinded by greed?

272
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:51,069
that's right.

273
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:01,081
Huh...

274
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,581
I've done something that can't be undone...

I want you to excuse me too.

285
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:31,105
I don't want Yui to get hurt anymore...

286
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,105
Because I'm okay.

287
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:38,543
It doesn't matter what you know.

288
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,049
I want to hear everything from Dad's mouth.

289
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:55,556
I didn't want you to notice anything.

290
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:02,067
There wasn't, but...

291
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:07,506
Ha ha ha ha...!

292
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:10,006
There is something I would like to confirm.

293
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:15,012
(Kyoichi) Which one?

294
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,018
Don't you understand?

295
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,521
He is the man who has become your son.

296
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:26,525
Ah~ Koichi~!

297
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,528
Thank you very much for coming.

298
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,531
Because it’s only Koichi➡

299
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,531
What you can believe is

300
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,539
As for Yui...

301
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:43,542
That's what the doctor said.

302
00:20:43,542 --> 00:20:46,545
During in vitro fertilization➡

303
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,045
I replaced it with yours!

304
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,552
Yui is my daughter!

305
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:56,555
Yui is my child!! That kid...!

306
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:59,058
How old are you?

307
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:01,558
Are you about to turn 16?

308
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,998
Yagami's blood is➡

309
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:09,501
It was successfully taken over!

310
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,005
The only drawback is that I'm a woman➡

311
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:17,505
Well, it's better than people other than Yagami.

312
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:24,511
That person was obsessed with Yagami's blood anyway.

313
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:28,020
But why?

314
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:30,022
If you want your own child➡

315
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,022
You don't have to do something so complicated...

316
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:39,026
I needed someone to protect my child.

317
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:44,536
I'm glad it's you...!

318
00:21:44,536 --> 00:21:50,542
Even puppets need the talent to be manipulated!

319
00:21:50,542 --> 00:21:52,544
You are➡

320
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:57,549
His talent was outstanding.

321
00:21:57,549 --> 00:22:02,554
Thank you for all you do for Yagami.

322
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,991
Thank you!

323
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,994
Ahahahaha…!

324
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,998
Ahahahaha…! Uuuuuuuuuuu...!!

325
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:18,504
Ha ha ha ha...! (electrocardiograph alarm)

326
00:22:18,504 --> 00:22:20,506
Ugh… uh…! (electrocardiograph alarm)

327
00:22:20,506 --> 00:22:23,509
Aaaaaaaaa!! (electrocardiograph alarm)

328
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:25,009
(electrocardiograph alarm)

329
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,512
It's that night.

330
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,015
That's it.

331
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:38,524
(Keishi's voice) No matter what anyone says➡

332
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:43,028
Yui is my daughter.

333
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,531
When I thought about it and tried to touch it...

334
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,033
((Ahahaha… Ahahahaha!))

335
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,035
((Ahahahaha…!))

336
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,535
((Wow!))

337
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,542
(Keishi's voice) My feelings for that person➡

338
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,042
It may have been passed on to Yui.

339
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,983
It was scary.

340
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:11,990
Something… an unknown power.

341
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,493
It's called "Satori"➡

342
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,493
An invisible power.

343
00:23:18,497 --> 00:23:22,000
It looks like Yui is going somewhere➡

344
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,504
I didn't know what to do.

345
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,007
So…➡

346
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:32,007
Keep Yui within reach...

347
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:37,015
But ➡

348
00:23:37,015 --> 00:23:41,515
I was getting further and further away.

349
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:50,025
Yui is Yui.

350
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:57,035
If only my father wasn't there➡

351
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:01,540
Maybe no one would have been sad...

352
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:05,440
Then we couldn't meet.

353
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,983
Past facts cannot be changed.

354
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:14,987
But what we do from now on➡

355
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:17,487
The meaning of the past can be changed.

356
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:21,491
That's right.

357
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,496
(Komiyama) Tabata, stay here.

358
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,999
Even if he changes his mind, don't let him escape.

359
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:28,499
Understood.

360
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:33,505
That's what my aunt said.

00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:21,892
Once again, what can I do now?

543
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,395
What can I do to make people happy?➡

544
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,897
I want to think about it properly.

545
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:29,900
Everyone who has supported us so far➡

546
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:32,903
Sorry for my lack of power.

547
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:35,906
This channel is ➡

548
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:38,409
I'll finish it today.

549
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:40,911
Until now...

550
00:39:40,911 --> 00:39:42,911
(2 people) Thank you very much.

551
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,917
(Riri) Sorry to have kept you waiting.

552
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:48,919
It's a whipped smoothie.

553
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:51,419
(Riri) Please take your time. ⚟Riri~! ⚞

554
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:55,926
(Gun) I'm going to Oarai tomorrow.

555
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,928
What, a shark aquarium?

556
00:39:57,928 --> 00:40:00,431
No, apparently there's a yoga festival going on.

557
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,934
The weather is nice and this will sell well.

558
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:08,439
Well then, let's do our best to sell it out quickly and once it's over we'll have a date at the aquarium!

559
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,442
A date is you... Hehe, isn't that great!

560
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:15,946
That's how much I'm looking forward to it...!

561
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:19,450
Ah, welcome. Welcome.

562
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,452
(Tabata) Komi-san!

563
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:24,455
Ha... I was here after all. It's been a while.

564
00:40:24,455 --> 00:40:26,457
I was transferred to the juvenile division.

565
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,959
Thank you for your help again!

566
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,459
Maybe again...

567
00:40:33,464 --> 00:40:36,967
I'm so happy. I can't help but be happy.

568
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,970
We are a small company that has just started➡

569
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:42,973
Could you please give me just a little time?

570
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:47,978
There are people all over Japan who need this treatment.

571
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:51,482
No, I'm waiting all over the world.

572
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:54,985
Please lend me your help.

573
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:56,985
(2 people) Thank you.

574
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:00,491
(Ukai) “Wakaba Scholarship”?

575
00:41:00,491 --> 00:41:03,494
(Anna) Can you do this without telling your parents?

576
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,996
(Bandai) Do you not get along well with your parents?

577
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,933
(Anna) Because it's annoying.

578
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,935
If you feel like it➡

579
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:12,937
There is also the option of living in a dormitory.

580
00:41:12,937 --> 00:41:15,439
(Ukai) Does the dormitory mean you live with everyone else?

581
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,943
Dormitories these days almost feel like living alone.

582
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:20,945
Instead➡

583
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:23,948
I have to study really hard➡

584
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,449
What do you think?

585
00:41:25,449 --> 00:41:27,451
(2 people) Eh...｡

586
00:41:27,451 --> 00:41:29,954
It takes courage to change the current situation➡

587
00:41:29,954 --> 00:41:34,454
That means moving forward.

588
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,463
If you want to think carefully and take on a challenge➡

589
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:40,965
Please contact me again.

590
00:41:40,965 --> 00:41:42,967
(Anna) I'll be back.

591
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,467
(Anna: Ukai) Thank you.

592
00:41:49,974 --> 00:41:52,476
(Shiraki) You can still change the title.

593
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:54,979
If you change the title and proper noun ➡

594
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,481
You can even claim it's fiction.

595
00:41:57,481 --> 00:42:01,986
This is a revealing book.

596
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:03,487
That's right.

597
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:07,887
But I dedicated my life to that revealing book.

598
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:12,430
It's fine as is.

599
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,931
Is it okay?

600
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:18,436
The best way to keep the world interested by hiding it half-heartedly is➡

601
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:21,939
I think this is your usual method➡

602
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,441
You won't do that, will you?

603
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:28,446
The fire will be extinguished more quickly if everything is revealed.

604
00:42:28,446 --> 00:42:31,449
As expected of the person who rebuilt Kiryu Sohonpo.

605
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,951
You can see the big picture.

606
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:37,455
This is the last time I'll see you.

607
00:42:37,455 --> 00:42:40,458
Yeah.

608
00:42:40,458 --> 00:42:42,960
This is also the curse placed on me➡

609
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,963
I feel like I've finally solved it.

610
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:47,965
Well then ➡

611
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:49,965
how do you do.

612
00:43:01,979 --> 00:43:03,979
how do you do.

613
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,422
Hey Shinobu-san.

614
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,923
what?

615
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:16,927
I'm talking about investing in Keishi's company➡

616
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,427
I decided.

617
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:22,933
That's right.

618
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,435

Do you know Kiryu Sohonpo? It's my aunt.

626

It's a long-established Japanese sweets shop in Kyoto.

That's right!

628
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,462

Okay.

Who are you? Hey!

643
00:45:56,954 --> 00:45:59,957
Come hug me and say "Linda!" What's going on?

644
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:02,960
The stars did it for me. I'll try again.

645
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,962
Yo. Who is it?

646
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,463
Hachi!

647
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,900
I'm home! Fufufu! Let go!

648
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,402
I'm home! Fufufu…!

649
00:46:11,402 --> 00:46:13,404
Ugh! I'm home!

650
00:46:13,404 --> 00:46:14,905
Isn't it too much to buy?

651
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,408
It's been a while since I went shopping, so I'm having fun.

652
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:20,411
It's my money. Back then, I paid for it all.

653
00:46:20,411 --> 00:46:22,913
Do you think me, who was kidnapped, and Linda, who was released on parole, are the same?

654
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,416
It's so different! It's so different! No difference, it's the same!

655
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:27,418
So different! Please raise it! Same!

656
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:29,918
It's so different! As annoying as ever!

657
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:34,422
Wow, so beautiful! Oh!

658
00:46:37,428 --> 00:46:39,930
Would you like to take a look? Eh, but everyone's meal...

659
00:46:39,930 --> 00:46:42,930
Until it sinks, right away.

660
00:46:53,944 --> 00:46:56,447
It came out sooner than I expected.

661
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,449
Because he's a model prisoner.

662
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,951
it was fun? It can't be fun.

663
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:03,951
Thank you for your hard work. You persevered.

664
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:08,392
What about that?

665
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:10,394
Have you had fun these past two years?

666
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:13,397
Yes, very much.

667
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,897
It was fulfilling.

668
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,401
Hmm...

669
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,905
Hehe...

670
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:30,914
Hoshi, I've heard some stories about adoption➡

671
00:47:30,914 --> 00:47:33,917
I refused everything. Eh, why?

672
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,917
It's Linda's fault, right?

673
00:47:39,423 --> 00:47:41,923
The stars kept their promise.

674
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,929
That's right.

675
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,446
Would you like to try kissing me?

676
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,885
Have you tried it?

677
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,390
Maybe I can see everything in my heart.

678
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:19,394

Nothing. It’s so true!

682
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,421
I can't see anything! Be honest!

683
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,423
You said you couldn't see it. You definitely saw it!

684
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:48,425
I can't see it, I really can't see it.

685
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,927
That's strange!

686
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,429
It's true. Huh?

Well then... I'll put my heart into it and then do it➡

690
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,938
Decide whether you can see properly or not.

691
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,940
Let's go. Hehehe...!

692
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,942

Hey, it's embarrassing, so stop it!

696
