Yui Yagami is➡

After being kidnapped by Daisuke Hayashida➡

5
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:15,515
Decided to run away from his father

6
00:00:15,515 --> 00:00:18,017
(Keishi) Are you running away...? <The two of them are living on the run➡

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,519
Repeated encounters and farewells>

8
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,021
(Riri) She won't disappear, right? (Yui) Yeah.

9
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:24,021
(Gun) Say hello to the bees! (Daisuke) Gan-san!

10
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,528
<Yui stopped because of the guilt of having involved so many people➡

11
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:31,531
To reconfirm the reason why I ran away➡

12
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,031
I summoned my father to a place of memories>

13
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:40,039
Is that the fountain?

14
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:41,541
yes.

15
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:45,044
I was playing while watching my dad and slipped and fell➡

16
00:00:45,044 --> 00:00:47,046
I was shocked and couldn't move ➡

17
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:50,049
Because the water is falling ➡

18
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,552
I cried because I was scared and surprised.

19
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
Huh…｡

20
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,556
What? Are you laughing?

21
00:00:56,556 --> 00:01:00,059
Because... hey, just imagine a bee.

22
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,559
It's the devil. He laughs when you cry.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000

You tried to kill me.

There's no way I would do that.

31
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,493
I came to talk to dad.

I was sleeping on the sofa, so I covered it with a blanket.

You tried to strangle me, didn't you? different.

48

Don't lie.

It's not a lie.

63
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,030

(Ebihara) Huh? In other words…➡

90

Is it okay to assume that I ran away from home?

00:07:35,988 --> 00:07:38,991
Is it true that Daisuke Hayashida kidnapped him?

92
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:40,493
Smartphone) No, but...

93
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,496
As long as there is a low possibility that Yui-san will be in danger ➡

94
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,996
Would you like me to review the investigation process?

What about that?

99
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,949
I was able to witness the reunion of the two.

100
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:05,349
Eh, is it true! So?

101
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,455
About “Satori”➡

102
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,458
Shiraki-san, please tell me everything you know.

103
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:16,458
Is Satori involved in this incident?

104
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:22,969
Yui said, ``You can tell who a person is by touching their hand.''

105
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,470

Is that “Satori”?

00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,985
hello? There is no doubt.

110
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,985
Ordinary people don't have that kind of power.

111
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,992
That's right...

112
00:08:45,992 --> 00:08:48,492
So what's the story?

113
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,499
Yui-san➡

114
00:08:53,499 --> 00:08:57,003
I think I almost got killed by my president once.

115
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,503
picture?

116
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:02,942
Of course, the president denied it.

117
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:06,445
Yeah.

118
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:10,449
``If it's different, I'd like you to hold my hand,'' Yui said.

119
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,952
If you hold my hand, I'll know if you're lying.

120
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,454
But the president didn't hold it.

121
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,456
I see.

122
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,458
The president I know is not like that.

123
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:21,460
Well, mostly after the culprit is caught➡

124
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,462
You say, ``I didn't think you were that kind of person.''

125
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,462
Please don't call me a criminal! Wait a minute...Shhh!

126
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,971
So, does Yui lie?

127
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:35,474
No... I might be mistaken.

128
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,977
If that's the case, I should have grabbed it.

129
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:39,977
Bandai-san thinks so too, right?

130
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,984
(Shiraki) Well, it's scary though.

131
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:48,484
Having my heart completely exposed.

132
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:53,492
I should have grabbed it anyway.

133
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,996
If you want Yui to come back.

134
00:09:56,996 --> 00:10:00,499
Oh, the loyal dog Bandai has bared his fangs, hasn't he?

135
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,502
Shiraki-san is really rude!

136
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:05,504
(Clerk) Excuse me. Ah...

137
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,006
Excuse me. (Salesperson) Yes.

138
00:10:07,006 --> 00:10:09,506
I'd like some rice omelet, please. (Salesperson) Thank you very much.

139
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:19,514
(Sound of smartphone operating)

140
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,543
(Bandai's voice) In the end, we met at the place Yui-san had specified.

141
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,045
(Shiraki) Huh?

142
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,547
Isn't that where the two of you practiced together? (Bandai) Yes.

143
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:53,052
But... there was a handshake issue➡

144
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,555
Yui tried to leave➡

145
00:10:56,555 --> 00:11:00,559
I tried to stop it, but I jumped out without thinking.

146
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,061
Yeah.

147
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:04,497
Then➡

148
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:08,501
The president got furious.

149
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,001
Why?

150
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,004
I guess I didn't have a place to express my feelings...

151
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,513
This is the first time I've seen a president so angry.

152
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,015
Isn't that just a hit?

153
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:25,515
The problem is that you refused to shake hands, right?

154
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,520
Maybe I don't need it anymore.

155
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:37,530
Even if I am told to continue searching for Yui-san➡

156
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,030
I don't know what to do either.

157
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,541
I wonder what happened...

158
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,541
Come on.

159
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:58,045
It's a big deal for a father to try to kill his daughter.

160
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,954
They weren't really parent and child.

161
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,491
No way.

162
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:12,498
(Komiyama) Name: Mirei Iwata.

163
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,501
(Komiyama) Age 28 years old, address unknown, unemployed.

164
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:18,504
Commonly known as "Gun".

165
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:20,005
Are you sure?

166
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,007
What's that last one?

167
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:24,009
Don't give up.

168
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,012
I'll also ask you to tell me about the special fraud that Hayashida was involved in before.

169
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:31,016
I don't really understand what you're saying, but it's okay.

170
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,018
That's why I can't relax ➡

171
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,520
Only for now.

172
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,523
That's crazy, I came voluntarily.

173
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,525
You idiot, you should be arrested red-handed!

174
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,026
Eh, it's scary.

175
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,028
(Tabata) Komi-san.

176
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,028
Tsk...

177
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:51,036
First of all, don't you admit that you helped Daisuke Hayashida escape?

178
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,038
Eh, I didn't. I probably would have.

179
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:56,538
Did a stranger jump down the stairs without permission?

180
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,546
Then I said, ``I planted a bomb.''➡

181
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:02,548
Have you ever threatened us? I don't remember.

182
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,483
Then turn off the security camera ➡

183
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,485
Have you ever disrupted an investigation with a fake image?

184
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,990
Wow, it's amazing that you were able to do that.

185
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,993
I'm just trying to cut it off.

186
00:13:13,993 --> 00:13:16,996
Your computer has been confiscated.

187
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,497
That's right.

188
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,000
I wonder how many extra crimes there will be.

189
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It would be nice to come out.

190
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:34,013
No way…｡

191
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:36,015
((Yes Dokkan!)) ((Click))

193
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:45,524
That's not a bomb...

194
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:47,524
I wonder what it was.

195
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:52,028
(Driver) It's 18,500 yen.

196
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,037
that….

197
00:14:04,476 --> 00:14:08,480
Are you an idol?

198
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,984
Ah... no, no! (Driver) Oh, I'm sorry.

199
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:13,484
thank you.

200
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:23,996
Even idols. Hehehe...

201
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,498
I guess Linda is a frivolous manager. Huh?

202
00:14:26,498 --> 00:14:29,001
Even though I'm the idol. What are you talking about?

203
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:30,502
Ah.

204
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:32,504
I might be thinking about it and looking into it by now.

205
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,004
teeth?

206
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:43,015
It's pitch dark.

207
00:14:43,015 --> 00:14:46,015
There's something about this darkness that makes me feel safe.

208
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:54,026
Okay...｡

209
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:57,029
What are you doing? Sha~!

210
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,031
Ha!

211
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,033
Ah!

212
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,469
So cold! Haha!

213
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,971
Hey! What are you doing? It's the ocean!

214
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:09,475
I'm wearing boots!

215
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,977
Hahaha…｡ Wait… What? What?!

216
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,979
hang on! hang on! Wait! Ura~!

217
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:16,482
Stop it, stop it! Hahaha...! Let's go!

218
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,484
Really...! Ah!

219
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:19,985
Go back!

220
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:22,488
Haha...! Hey, what are you doing!

221
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,989
Huh!

222
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:29,995
(Two people breathing heavily)

223
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:33,499
Um... What?

224
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,501
I'm sorry.

225
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,001
It's called the ``rebellious period of a young lady.''

226
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:45,010
Also, what does "you can tell when you touch it" mean?

227
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:47,510
Is that some kind of technique?

228
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:52,017

231

Seriously!? He's a talented person!

233
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:10,469
Well then, let's go buy a lottery ticket! yes?

234
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,472
If you touch it, you'll know if it's hitting you or not, right?

235
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,474
I don't know. So what about the casino?

236
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,476
Let's go to overseas casinos and make a lot of money!

237
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,978
Then you won't need a ransom.

238
00:16:19,978 --> 00:16:21,980
Because that's not the case.

239
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,983
Is it wrong? So it's not scary?

240
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,985
What?

241
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,989
I have touched Linda's hand several times.

242
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:32,491
Ah!

243
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,494
Eh... that's embarrassing.

244
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,996
Huh... I'm going crazy.

245
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,998
Eh...not really➡

246
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:42,501
Eh... you weren't thinking about anything erotic, were you?

247
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:46,004
Ha! Eh?! Eh...!

248
00:16:46,004 --> 00:16:49,007
That's bullshit~ Huh? Don't be silly, you.

249
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:52,010
I don't know what you're thinking. What...

250
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:54,012
So what do you know?

251
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:57,015
Color. Color?

252
00:16:57,015 --> 00:17:16,969
♬～

253
00:17:16,969 --> 00:17:18,469
copper?

254
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:23,976
Light pink.

255
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,476
What is that?

256
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,984
There is something like a person's color; it's that person's color.

257
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:35,988
I mean, compatibility...

258
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:40,492
I can tell whether you think I'm good or bad.

259
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,495
Hey~｡

260
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,497
Dad➡

261
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:48,497
It was different when I was little...

262
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,504
At that time➡

263
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,504
It's a very unpleasant black color.

264
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:00,012
I mean hatred➡

265
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:02,514
I mean, hostility.

266
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,452
It felt like murderous intent.

267
00:18:06,452 --> 00:18:08,452
That's crazy.

268
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,958
Look at people's colors➡

269
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,958
I've never felt so scared.

270
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,469
I see.

271
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,971
Tsukasa: Is there anything else?

272
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:28,474
It's like you can see color when you touch it.

273
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,477
Hmm, I've never met you.

274
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:33,479
Actually, when I was little, I thought everyone could see.

275
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,981
No, I can't see it, I've never met anyone like that.

276
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,485
Maybe you just don't say it even if you see it? surely.

277
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,985
Aki-chan also told me, ``Don't tell anyone.''

278
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,994
Anyone➡

279
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:52,998
It's like my heart is being read➡

280
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:54,998
I don't like it.

281
00:18:57,002 --> 00:18:59,004
no….

282
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,006
Isn't it just the color?

283
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:03,406
Maybe you're lying?

284
00:19:07,446 --> 00:19:08,947
yeah?

285
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,450
I'll make sure.

286
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,453
picture? How do you know Linda? It's okay!

287
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,455
No... Linda says she doesn't understand.

288
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:19,958
Wait... I don't know, right?

289
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,460
I don't understand anything.

290
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,960
What is it... Hahaha!

291
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:29,968
Don't think too much.

292
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,468
Hachi, I'm not scared at all.

293
00:19:35,974 --> 00:19:37,976
Yeah….

294
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,978
Tsukasa➡

295
00:19:39,978 --> 00:19:43,482
If you can't see the color just by touching it➡

296
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,482
What if I kiss you?

297
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,987
Eh, that's disgusting! teeth⁉

298
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:50,989
T-that’s not right! feel ill!

299
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,492
Creepy! Not gross! Creepy! Not gross!

300
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,993
Lowest~‼

301
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,995
Ah~!!

302
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,995
Ah...!

303
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,999
(screams)

304
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,508
(Masaki) Did Yui-chan and Hayashida come after all?

305
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,510
(Misaki) There is still a "looking for" site➡

306
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,014
I guess he didn't come? Ah, hey.

307
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:17,515
There are reports of sightings in the Shonan area.

308
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:19,017
Eh, Shonan?

309
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:22,020
Is it different because the man has black hair and is wearing a suit?

310
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,523
Huh, that might be Hayashida! Huh?

311
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:27,525
Just look, look! Just a little bit...

312
00:20:27,525 --> 00:20:29,527
Look, I currently have black hair➡

313
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,529
Possibly a black suit!

314
00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:33,532
It's true!

315
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,532
What should I do...

316
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:38,536
Hey. Ah?

317
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:40,536
What about there? a?

318
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,543
Hey.

319
00:20:44,543 --> 00:20:47,043
It's definitely a spider or something.

320
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,551
Ah... it's gone.

321
00:20:57,555 --> 00:20:59,557

Spider! Spider spider…! Spider!

324
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,497
Pep pep…! There is no electricity

325
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:09,501
Maybe it hasn't been used recently. Pepe Pepe...!

326
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:13,004
Hey, why don't you rest here tonight?

327
00:21:13,004 --> 00:21:15,507
Eh?

328
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:18,009

00:24:53,524 --> 00:24:55,024
hang on.

368
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,028
Can you tell me your name?

369
00:25:03,968 --> 00:25:05,369
What?!

370
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,475
Hikaru Saito

371
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,475
Saito-kun.

372
00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:17,979
Thank you for your cooperation.

373
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,491
(coughing)

374
00:25:33,498 --> 00:25:36,501
(coughing)

375
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,504
Are you okay?

376
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,505
cold….

377
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:42,505
Is it cold?

378
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:51,014
(sound of car door closing)

379
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,527
this.

380
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,462
I bought it, so drink it.

381
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:06,465
If you get close, you'll get infected.

382
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:09,467
It's okay, just drink it.

383
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,467
Yeah….

384
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:20,978
I'll wake you up.

385
00:26:20,978 --> 00:26:38,478
♬～

386
00:26:39,497 --> 00:26:44,503
♬～

387
00:26:44,503 --> 00:26:47,503
(In a whisper) U-n-me-i!

388
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:02,021
What about this one?

389
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:05,524
This is Shiraki from “Weekly Shinryu”. Weekly magazine?

390
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:08,527
Mr. Jonouchi is at a child guidance center in Tokyo today➡

391
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:12,531
I heard that, so I thought I could talk to you for a little while.

392
00:27:12,531 --> 00:27:16,035
Did you meet Hoshi-kun?

393
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,037
no.

394
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:21,540
I saw you playing happily.

395
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,543
What are you going to do next?

396
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:28,047
I won't see you again.

397
00:27:28,047 --> 00:27:32,051
A loveless birth parent➡

398
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:34,987
Just forget about...➡

399
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,491
Parents who shower you with love➡

400
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,493
You should look for it.

401
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,496
(Applause) Well, that's admirable.

402
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,498
It's not easy to say.

403
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,501
The world is desperate for support money➡

404
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,003
There are some parents who kill their children.

405
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,005
Can you please not mix it up with that?

406
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,007
It's just better.

407
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,009
Bandai-san.

408
00:27:57,009 --> 00:28:00,513
That's the kind of person he was.

409
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,515
rude.

410
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,515
Please ask for anything you like.

411
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:13,025
(thermometer alarm)

412
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:15,525
It's still quite like that.

413
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,532
I'm sweating so I want to change clothes.

414
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,032
I understand.

415
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:27,540
This is a change of clothes.

416
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,540
towel.

417
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,045
I went out to eat➡

418
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:34,980
If you can eat bees too, eat them.

419
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,380
Yes, thank you.

420
00:28:39,985 --> 00:28:41,485
a little bit…!

421
00:28:51,497 --> 00:28:52,998
(whispering) It's dangerous, I found out.

422
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:55,000
(Masaki) Huh...? (Misaki) This is dangerous, what should I do...!

423
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,002
Hey! What are you doing! (Misaki) I have no choice but to go...

424
00:28:57,002 --> 00:28:59,004
(Masaki) Daisuke Hayashida, right? Don't take pictures!

425
00:28:59,004 --> 00:29:01,006
(Masaki) It's Linda, right? Lend it to me!

426
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:04,506
The person inside is Yui Yagami, right?

427
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:12,015
Do you call me "Hachi"?

428
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,019
Are you perhaps unwell?

429
00:29:19,525 --> 00:29:21,025
ah.

430
00:29:22,528 --> 00:29:24,530
So➡

431
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,030
Can I leave you alone?

432
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:33,038
Maa-chan, go home.

433
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:34,974
picture? take care.

434
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,975
You know...

435
00:29:44,984 --> 00:29:48,988
I have one request.

436
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:50,488
what?

437
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:56,996
Hachi, I'm really tired right now➡

438
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,998
Just for today➡

439
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,498
Is it okay if I don't upload the video?

440
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,505
please.

441
00:30:15,514 --> 00:30:17,016
Hey, why?

442
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:19,518
Do you really want to wait until tomorrow?

443
00:30:19,518 --> 00:30:22,021
Even though there are so many delicious ingredients?

444
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:25,524
Are you aware of being an influencer?

445
00:30:25,524 --> 00:30:28,527
Hmm, I understand!

446
00:30:28,527 --> 00:30:30,529
Then report it and get 100 million.

447
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,031
No! (Masaki) Why?

448
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:34,967
If I wait until tomorrow, I'll probably go somewhere else.

449
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,970
I won't upload videos and I won't get 100 million yen➡

450
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:40,473
I don't understand it anymore!

451
00:30:40,473 --> 00:30:42,475
Maa-chan

452
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:45,978
I've fallen in love with it.

453
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,981
teeth? Isn't Linda a nice person?

454
00:30:48,981 --> 00:30:51,984
Because I might get arrested by the police, but please help the pregnant woman➡

455
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:54,487
So you're also taking care of Yui-chan, who's sick, right?

456
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:57,987
Yui seemed to be open to Linda as well.

457
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:01,494
Does that mean it wasn't really a kidnapping?

458
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:02,994
Doesn't it look like it?

459
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:06,499
So what about Joji Saito?

460
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,501
I don't know about that though.

461
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:11,504
But don't they look like the current two criminals and hostages?

462
00:31:11,504 --> 00:31:13,504
So what?

463
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:19,011
Isn't that what eloping is all about?

464
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,013
What is that...!

465
00:31:21,013 --> 00:31:24,517
Emo! Kuuu...!

466
00:31:24,517 --> 00:31:27,017
Emo!!

467
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,961
Information about Hayashida and his accomplices.

468
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,471
(Bandai) Mr. Jonouchi➡

469
00:31:45,471 --> 00:31:47,971
You know “Satori”, right?

470
00:31:50,976 --> 00:31:55,481
Could you tell me about Yui-san's "Satori"?

471
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,982
I can't speak.

472
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,982
Why?

473
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:02,988
Because I was silenced.

474
00:32:02,988 --> 00:32:04,990
To President Keishi?

475
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:07,493
That's right.

476
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,496
Something about that.

477
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,996
I won't say it.

478
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,004
So... how about something like this?

479
00:32:19,004 --> 00:32:23,509
Kyoichi Yagami has "Satori", right?

480
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:27,509
Is this also part of your promise with President Keishi?

481
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,515
That's how you do it, journalists.

482
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,954
I got the money.

483
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,960
Jonouchi-san. No.

484
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,470
I won't cause you any inconvenience.

485
00:32:56,976 --> 00:33:01,476
Boyfriend: You need money, right?

486
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:09,488
Mr. Komiyama, is it okay for you to be in a place like this?

487
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,490
Do I have to go find those two?

488
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,492
To me, more than those guys➡

489
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,995
It's more important to mention you.

490
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,497
I'm so happy.

491
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:20,499
Well, I'll tell you something good.

492
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,001
What?

493
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:24,503
I'm a detective in the first division➡

494
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:27,003
There's a guy who used to play online casinos.

495
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:31,510
You, no way...What?

496
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,513
Did you get inside information from that person?

497
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,949
Instead of erasing evidence of online casinos...

498
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:38,951
Eh!? Well, what do you think?

499
00:33:38,951 --> 00:33:40,953
What's your name? Handa Taisei.

500
00:33:40,953 --> 00:33:42,955
Mr. Handa!? You say it so easily.

501
00:33:42,955 --> 00:33:46,458
Komiyama-san, it's the 5th anniversary of your divorce, right?

502
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:48,961
There's no such thing as a 5th anniversary for divorce.

503
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:51,463
A commemorative present. Thank you, idiot!

504
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,465
Hehe... How do you know that?

505
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,969
I'm glad you liked it.

506
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:00,469
If you look into Handa, you'll find evidence that he passed information on to you...

507
00:34:02,975 --> 00:34:04,977
It's not coming out.

508
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:08,480
(applause)

509
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,482
You're so insightful➡

510
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13,982
I wonder why he didn't notice his wife's dissatisfaction.

511
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,992
Did you admit that you had inside information about the police?

512
00:34:19,992 --> 00:34:21,493
That's a lie.

513
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:24,493
Everything I said earlier was a lie.

514
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:33,505
It's a return gift.

515
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:35,905
Are you still going to make it clear?

516
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:54,458
Are you okay?

517
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:17,483

518
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,983
Hachi.

519
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,490
Can you ride on my back?

520
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:31,490

521
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,002
<The latest episode of “ESCAPE” is being distributed for free on TVer! ＞

526
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:49,013
(Izumi) I'm sorry, I forced myself. (Male) No.

527
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:52,016
Is it okay to have it tomorrow afternoon? (Izumi) That's enough. Thank you for your help.

528
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:53,517
Well, I'll come again tomorrow.

529
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:55,517
Thank you for your hard work. Thank you for your hard work.

530
00:35:57,521 --> 00:35:59,023
sorry!

531
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,524
It's so hot.

532
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:03,027
I'm sorry, but I've already finished my medical examination today.

533
00:36:03,027 --> 00:36:05,029
But I'm not giving up at all.

534
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,464
Taking medicine doesn't help, and drinking water seems like a pain.

535
00:36:07,464 --> 00:36:09,466
There is an emergency hospital about 1 km away➡

536
00:36:09,466 --> 00:36:10,968
Could you please go there?

537
00:36:10,968 --> 00:36:12,970
Are you this weak? (sound of door opening)

538
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,472
(Iwase) What happened? Director, I'm sorry.

539
00:36:15,472 --> 00:36:17,474
It seems like you came with a fever...

540
00:36:17,474 --> 00:36:20,978
Please help! please!

541
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:22,980
Okay, come in.

542
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,980
thank you!

543
00:36:26,483 --> 00:36:28,485
(Gun) What is this photo?

544
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:30,988
No matter how you look at it, it's you.

545
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,990
Are your eyes covered?

546
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:35,993
All other characteristics are the same.

547
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:39,496
I don't take pictures with people.

548
00:36:39,496 --> 00:36:41,999
That's right.

549
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,501
That's what cancer is like.

550
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:48,005
Could you think about it with your smart mind?

551
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,007
It's okay.

552
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:53,510
A few years ago, his name was always mentioned as the instructor of a special fraud➡

553
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,013
There was a person named Gin.

554
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,015
Gin...

555
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:02,019
(Komiyama) But no matter how much I searched, I couldn't find any trace of Gin.

556
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:04,021
Such Gin recently➡

557
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,957
There is a suspicion that he is cooperating with the perpetrator of the kidnapping incident.

558
00:37:06,957 --> 00:37:08,959
I see.

559
00:37:08,959 --> 00:37:12,963
The character of Gin, who was involved in special fraud, is that of a solitary genius.

560
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:14,965
law.

561
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:16,967
Why is Gin like that➡

562
00:37:16,967 --> 00:37:21,472
The hostage, the kidnapper, and his ex-girlfriend are all seen together in a photo.

563
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,974
What kind of change of state of mind would it be?

564
00:37:23,974 --> 00:37:25,976
Hmm…｡

565
00:37:25,976 --> 00:37:28,979
What's more, I became a decoy for them.

566
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,479
I wonder why?

567
00:37:37,988 --> 00:37:41,492
Ginhasa…➡

568
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:44,995
I guess I didn't have that kind of experience.

569
00:37:44,995 --> 00:37:47,495
Is that an experience?

570
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,005
I made a mistake when I was young because I used my abilities incorrectly.

571
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:59,510
That failure will never be forgiven➡

572
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,010
So I had no choice but to live alone.

573
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:07,951
Because that's how my life was➡

574
00:38:07,951 --> 00:38:12,451
I guess I was blinded by something like youth.

575
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:21,461
I think it's just a temporary confusion.

576
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,978
(Iwase) It doesn't seem to be an infectious disease➡

577
00:38:34,978 --> 00:38:38,482
I think you'll feel better if you get some rest.

578
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:42,486
I see, that's good...

579
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,486
I wish I had come to see you sooner.

580
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,992
Sorry.

581
00:38:48,992 --> 00:38:52,996
Ah, uh... I don't have an insurance card or anything.

582
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:57,000
That would cost you 10%, right?

583
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,503
If you want to go home to get it, I'll wait for you.

584
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:04,007
No... I lost it.

585
00:39:04,007 --> 00:39:05,509
Ah...｡

586
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,946
That can't be helped.

587
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,449
Apply later and get a refund.

588
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,451
Understood.

589
00:39:14,451 --> 00:39:17,955
Should I wait until the drip is finished?

590
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,455
yes.

591
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:33,470
gentlemen.

592
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:35,973
Sorry, Izumi-san, I had to work overtime.

593
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,976
No... Rather, please look at this, teacher.

594
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,476
(Iwase) Yeah?

595
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:43,981
(Izumi) Isn't it those two?

596
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:46,984
Hmm... they look very similar.

597
00:39:46,984 --> 00:39:49,486
Do you want to contact me?

598
00:39:49,486 --> 00:39:53,991
So you don't have insurance?

599
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:56,994
Let's take a break today.

600
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:58,996
yes.

601
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,999
Izumi-san, thank you for your hard work. I'll do the rest.

602
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:05,002
Is it okay? Yeah, see you tomorrow.

603
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:07,938
Well then, please excuse me.

604
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:23,938

605
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,461
(Akira) That's fine here. Thank you.

606
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:31,963
I'll go to Utsunomiya next time.

607
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:36,968
I'll be waiting. (Shiraki) Oh... haha...｡

608
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,470
Huh...

609
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,972
Just to confirm...

610
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:42,974
The president's deceased wife➡

611
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:44,976
You don't have Yagami blood, right?

612
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,478
That's right.

613
00:40:46,478 --> 00:40:48,480
Also, I was adopted into the Yagami family➡

614
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,982
President Keishi too.

615
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:52,984
However, Yui-san➡

616
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,487
It has the power of "Satori".

617
00:40:55,487 --> 00:40:57,987
That's strange, isn't it?

618
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:04,996
Are you sure you're not joking?

619
00:41:04,996 --> 00:41:06,498
What is it?

620
00:41:06,498 --> 00:41:12,003
Yui and the president are not biological parents.

621
00:41:12,003 --> 00:41:18,510
Then who are Yui Yagami's biological parents?

622
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:22,510
Does Yui know about this?

623
00:41:27,018 --> 00:41:29,018
(footsteps)

624
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:36,528
(knock)

625
00:41:36,528 --> 00:41:38,463
Is it okay?

626
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:40,463
Ah... yes.

627
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:45,971
Don't you want to eat?

628
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:47,973
picture?

629
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:51,476
I tend to make too many pots.

630
00:41:51,476 --> 00:41:53,476
a….

631
00:41:59,985 --> 00:42:01,485
I'll enjoy having this.

632
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:12,995
Where are you now?

633
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,000
Are you eating and sleeping properly?

634
00:42:23,008 --> 00:42:26,508
This is a question for me as a doctor.

635
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,515
(sound of putting chopsticks down)

636
00:42:36,021 --> 00:42:38,421
There's no futon.

637
00:42:40,459 --> 00:42:41,959
yes.

638
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:49,463
You can't continue living like that forever, can you?

639
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:58,972
I know that you care about her.

640
00:43:02,481 --> 00:43:05,981
It's not because they're hostages, right?

641
00:43:13,992 --> 00:43:16,495
yes.

642
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:20,999
So maybe it's time to seriously think about it.

643
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,499
What should I do now?

644
00:43:25,504 --> 00:43:29,007
It wasn't a big deal this time though ➡

645
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:32,511
It could be a more serious illness.

646
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:35,514
If you value the other person➡

647
00:43:35,514 --> 00:43:38,414
It's okay not to put yourself in danger.

648
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:45,957
So do you.

649
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,960
I tend to forget when I'm feeling well➡

650
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,460
Illness doesn't choose people.

651
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,968
