00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:10,009
(Daisuke) Get away! (Shiraki) <In the wake of the kidnapping incident➡

2
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,011
He was living a strange life on the run➡

3
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:14,013
With Yui Yagami, also known as “Hachi”➡

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,015
Daisuke Hayashida, also known as “Linda”>

5
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,518
<Two people who have no way of knowing that President Yagami has collapsed➡

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,020
We decided to leave for each other's sake.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,022
I'll turn myself in.

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,024
<Wait a moment>

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,026
(Shiraki) Um...

10
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:30,026
It's Yui Yagami, right?

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:35,531
Don't you want to know who you are?

12
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,036
(Yui) What is it?

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,041
Would you like to shake hands?

14
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,548
Yui-san➡

15
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:52,548
You can tell about me when I shake your hand.

16
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:58,558
Do you know about this kind of thing?

17
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,560
It's "Satori", right?

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
"Satori"?

19
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:08,497
That power is called "Satori".

20
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,009
Poor guy.

21
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,009
It's all been kept secret.

22
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,531
(Keishi) Take care of Yui until now➡

23
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:40,533
thanks so much.

24
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:43,036
Please do your best in Utsunomiya.

25
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,036
(Akira) Thank you.

26
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:50,542
that….

27
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,053
Chairman Kyoichi is now➡

28
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:02,555
You've been hospitalized, right?

29
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,492
Yes, that's right.

30
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:08,995
Actually…➡

31
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:11,495
I was kept quiet, but...

32
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:22,004
Yui-chan is the owner of "Satori".

33
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:26,513
Yui...?

34
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:29,516
Sorry for being silent for so long.

35
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,019
Ah... no... no, that's impossible.

36
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,021
picture? What... What do you mean?

37
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:39,526
I first noticed this when Yui was in kindergarten.

38
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:44,030
The chairman said, ``I'll never let anyone know.''

39
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:46,533
Huh...

40
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,035
Is Yui talking about this...?

41
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:53,039
Only me and the president know.

42
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,041
Yui-chan herself➡

43
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:59,045
You probably don't know the details.

44
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:02,048
Wait... what's that? It's called "Satori".

45
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,484
a! I'm sorry, maybe he didn't know yet?

46
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,487
You know, you can see color when you touch it, right?

47
00:03:07,487 --> 00:03:08,987
Huh? Color?

48
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:13,993
It's the color.

49
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:16,496
That's interesting.

50
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,999
It's the voice of my heart flowing into Yui along with the colors➡

51
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,001
...Is that what it feels like?

52
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:24,504
Don't you know?

53
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,006
No, actually, about “Satori”➡

54
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:30,009
I have talked to many people➡

55
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:32,011
With people who actually have power➡

56
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:36,015
This is the first time I've had a proper conversation like this.

57
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:38,518
Who did you hear that from?

58
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,020
These are people close to the Yagami family.

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,023
Those close to the previous president, Kyoichi➡

60
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,026
Ah, of course I was acting as Yui's mother➡

61
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,530
Also from Akira Jonouchi.

62
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:55,535
The power of Satori is inherited by the Yagami family.

63
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:58,037
Meet your grandfather➡

64
00:03:58,037 --> 00:04:01,037
Like Chairman Kyoichi Yagami.

65
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,978
picture?

66
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:08,478
So does that mean Hachi's father also has one?

67
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:12,485
Dad is an adopted child.

68
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,487
Ah... then what about mom?

69
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:16,990
Mom is not a Yagami person.

70
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,990
teeth?

71
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,997
Mr. Shiraki.

72
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,000
That's what I hear, but is it wrong?

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,002
I also recognize that.

74
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:32,505
picture? What do you mean?

75
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,508
Yui’s biological parents are➡

76
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,508
It means there are others.

77
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,020
Who is that person➡

78
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,020
Does Shiraki-san know?

79
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,528
yes.

80
00:04:55,528 --> 00:05:16,482
♬～

81
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:18,484
Huh…｡

82
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:37,003
♬～

83
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:53,503
(cry)

84
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,525
What does that mean?

85
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,528
I told you that artificial insemination was successful!

86
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:05,465
Answer! Answer!!

87
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:06,966
(Hasunuma) It was a success!

88
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,968
With your wife➡

89
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,968
It belongs to Chairman Kyoichi!

90
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:16,976
It was good.

91
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:20,976
Yui seems to be doing well and growing up.

92
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,984
Are you still a doctor?

93
00:06:24,984 --> 00:06:27,487
Ha, do you want to sue?

94
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:32,492
The secret of Yui's birth will be made public.

95
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:34,994
Please don't hate me.

96
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:40,494
There is no one in this industry who can go against Chairman Kyoichi.

97
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:45,505
No way…➡

98
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,007
Yuka died... Haha...｡

99
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:52,011
That was an unfortunate accident.

100
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,514
But➡

101
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,517
He died without knowing the truth➡

102
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:02,955
Maybe I was happy in a way.

103
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,957
(Shiraki) When I questioned my doctor at the time➡

104
00:07:04,957 --> 00:07:06,959
I readily admitted it.

105
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,462
It's like a cuckoo's egg.

106
00:07:09,462 --> 00:07:12,465
President Keishi was used to preserve Yagami's blood➡

107
00:07:12,465 --> 00:07:14,467
I raised you without even knowing it.

108
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:16,969
(breathing heavily) What do you think?

109
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,472
Is there anything that comes to mind when you hear what I just said?

110
00:07:19,472 --> 00:07:21,474
Wait! You must be confused!

111
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:24,477
Hachi: Don't trust this guy.

112
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:26,479
I'm just saying the right things and having fun.

113
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,981
But don't you think Hachi makes sense?

114
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:30,483
4 years ago President Keishi was ➡

115
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:32,985
I learned that you are the son of the hated Chairman Kyoichi➡

116
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,488
His attitude suddenly changed!

117
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,990
So much so that I want to make you a dead person!

118
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:39,992
(breathing heavily)

119
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:42,495
Stop it!

120
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:45,998
Mothers die during childbirth, right?

121
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:47,500
From the perspective of President Keishi➡

122
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,002
I feel like I am my beloved wife who risked her life to give birth to me➡

123
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,505
I must have cherished you for 16 years➡

124
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:56,509
Did you know that all this was done to connect Yagami's blood!

125
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:59,512
Don't worry! What did you come here for?

126
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:01,514
If you want money, go to Hachi's father!

127
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:05,451
By the way, did you know that the prize money has been raised to 300 million yen?

128
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:07,453
teeth? Yagami Pharmaceutical is➡

129
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,957
A hostile TOB is being launched by the American Hoover Company!

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:13,459
President Keishi must be under a lot of pressure.

131
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,962
Yui has the power of “Satori” that I don’t have➡

132
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:17,964
I want to get it back no matter what!

133
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:19,465
Hey! (breathing heavily)

134
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,967
Are you okay? (breathing heavily)

135
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:28,975
(breathing heavily)

136
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:30,476
Please come back.

137
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:31,978
If I go back, I'll never see you again!

138
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,980
I've never seen a bee like this before!

139
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,982
(breathing heavily)

140
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,982
Please give me a break.

141
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,493
Well then…➡

142
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,997

Don't trust such a questionable reporter.

I…➡

150
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,465
I wasn't my father's child...!

151

Don't trust me!

152
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:33,472

It's okay, it's just a bad joke!

So… it has nothing to do with bees!

156
00:09:39,478 --> 00:09:43,983
The blood of such a person flows through my body!

Ha ha ha ha...

191
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:48,025
I wonder what you're doing.

192

I can't contact Daisuke either.

(Yamaguchi) Do you have any other smartphones?

there is no.

We're the same.

Fuck... Fuck...!

Anyway, I'm glad you're safe.

227
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,017
Weren't you anxious for days?

228
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,457
Don't worry.

229
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:08,457
I haven't told Keishi-san that Yui-chan is here.

230
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,965
Um...what?

231
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,467
Linda...

232
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:17,969
What about the person you were with?

233
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:19,971
Who kidnapped Yui?

234
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:22,974
Ah... that's true, but it's not.

235
00:17:22,974 --> 00:17:24,474
picture?

236
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:32,480
Ha...! Are you a genius?

237
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,495
(Shinobi) Take a bath.

239
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:46,498
Sorry for the late reply.

240
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:49,501
(Tsboi) So, Hachi-chan is safe?

241
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:51,003
yes.

242
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:54,506
I'm coming to a relative's house for various reasons...

243
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:57,008
I'll explain properly when I get back.

244
00:17:57,008 --> 00:17:59,010
It's fine as long as it's okay.

245
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:01,010
Because it's your life.

246
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,514
I'll contact you again.

247
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:10,022
thank you very much.

248
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:13,024
Looks like you don't need my help.

249
00:18:13,024 --> 00:18:16,524
I was just trying to live on my own.

250
00:18:18,029 --> 00:18:21,033
But➡

251
00:18:21,033 --> 00:18:25,036
There are many things I want to talk about with my aunt.

252
00:18:25,036 --> 00:18:27,036
Yeah.

253
00:18:29,542 --> 00:18:31,043
(Tabata) It looks like this.

254
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:33,044
The place that was shown on "Mami Channel".

255
00:18:33,044 --> 00:18:35,046
(Miyazono) That's right.

256
00:18:35,046 --> 00:18:37,549
(Tabata) This smell... (Miyazono) It's gasoline.

257
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:39,051
(Tabata) Wow...｡

258
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,551
Oh, Miyazono-san, this is it.

259
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:58,568
(All) Itadakimasu.

260
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,073
Yeah! It's delicious!

261
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:04,009
Good! Delicious!

262
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,011
It's my first time eating something so delicious!

263
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:08,011
yes? yes.

264
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,516
Is this an inn?

265
00:19:11,516 --> 00:19:14,019
It's my villa, right?

266
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,022
I agree.

267
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:18,024
Have a professional chef come ➡

268
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,525
I also ask for housekeeping➡

269
00:19:20,525 --> 00:19:23,028
Well, it might be something like an inn.

270
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:25,530
Wow...

271
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:28,533
He's an honest person. He's like a child.

272
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:31,036
It's much better than trying to be cool and acting like you know something.

273
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,537
yeah?

274
00:19:32,537 --> 00:19:35,040
Haha…｡ Hehehe…｡

275
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:40,545
Well, I had to apologize first.

276
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:43,048
I'm sorry for acting so poorly.

277
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,051
I thought he was a violent kidnapper.

278
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,053
It’s true!

279
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:50,055
But the old man is quite strong.

280
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:52,057
Hahahaha…｡ Hehehehe…｡

281
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,559
But why us?

282
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,562
I was worried because Yui-chan was kidnapped➡

283
00:19:57,562 --> 00:19:59,564
Keishi won't tell me anything➡

284
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:03,568
I wonder what's going on when you suddenly appear on TV.

285
00:20:03,568 --> 00:20:06,504
Hey. That's right.

286
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:10,008
Kyo and I are Yui-chan's allies.

287
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,510
I want you to believe that.

288
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:26,524
♬～

289
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:32,030
I also have something to apologize to Yui-chan.

290
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,530
What my father did.

291
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:40,036
Don't you want to hear it?

292
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,540
I want to know.

293
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:49,047
(Kyoto) I have an older brother➡

294
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,051
My father is raising my older brother as his successor➡

295
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:55,053
I was treated like I didn't exist.

296
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,055
I was born➡

297
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,058
As a spare in case something happens to my brother.

298
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:04,496
When he found out it was a woman, he was extremely disappointed.

299
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,999
After that, my younger brother was never born➡

300
00:21:07,999 --> 00:21:12,504
My father was increasingly interested in my brother.

301
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:18,009
So all I was thinking about was leaving Yagami's house.

302
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,511
But➡

303
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:24,011
My older brother was diagnosed with an incurable disease and passed away at the age of 15.

304
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:30,523
My father suddenly started paying attention to me➡

305
00:21:30,523 --> 00:21:33,024
I continued to ignore it.

306
00:21:33,024 --> 00:21:36,528
Look for a job by yourself➡

307
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:40,028
I chose my marriage partner myself.

308
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:46,538
That's when I thought we had broken ties➡

309
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:49,538
My father told me one day.

310
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,043
"Do you have children yet?"

311
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,048
but….

312
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,054
We had decided.

313
00:22:03,054 --> 00:22:05,455
I don't have children.

314
00:22:06,991 --> 00:22:10,995
I thought Yagami's blood would just die out.

315
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:15,495
Me too, if that's what Kyo wanted, that would be fine.

316
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:22,507
(Kyo) That's why I lied when my father asked me.

317
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:26,507
``I'm not in a position to have children,'' she said.

318
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,015
My father was confused.

319
00:22:31,015 --> 00:22:34,018
I really thought this was the end.

320
00:22:34,018 --> 00:22:39,524
But my father's obsession didn't end there.

321
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:44,024
I never expected something like that...

322
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:54,539
I am the one who upset the fate of your family.

323
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:59,039
I'm really sorry.

324
00:23:03,047 --> 00:23:05,484
That's different.

325
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,985
picture?

326
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:10,488
After all, isn't your aunt a victim too?

327
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,991
The only one at fault is old man.

328
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:21,499
♬～

329
00:23:21,499 --> 00:23:25,504
I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.

330
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,507
But if my aunt hadn't lied➡

331
00:23:29,507 --> 00:23:33,511
Hachi might not even exist in this world, right?

332
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:37,515
Then that is...➡

333
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:41,015
Isn't it wrong to apologize?

334
00:23:45,024 --> 00:23:48,026
Maybe so.

335
00:23:48,026 --> 00:23:50,528
You're not stupid.

336
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,530
Haha...

337
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,035
Is that so? That’s awesome. Haha…｡

338
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:00,538
Yui-chan.

339
00:24:00,538 --> 00:24:03,542
Thank you for being born.

340
00:24:03,542 --> 00:24:08,479

345

No, because...

346
00:24:48,454 --> 00:24:50,454
a little bit….

347
00:25:12,478 --> 00:25:13,980
here you are.

348
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,980
thank you.

349
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:20,484
Aunt. What?

350
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:24,490
There are so many things I want to ask you.

351

Ask me anything, it's safe here.

Ah...!

353
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,502
Replacement. Hahahaha…｡

354
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:41,007
This villa is amazing! There's even a bar!

355
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,009
That's right.

356
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:46,512
Your uncle is the president of some company or something, right?

357
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:48,014
No, no...

358
00:25:48,014 --> 00:25:50,516
I'm just the third son of a Japanese sweets shop.

359
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,518
Huh? Again!

360
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,021
Kyo is amazing.

361
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:58,524
Well... it sure looks amazing.

362
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:01,527
The store where everyone in the Kiryu family threw spoons➡

363
00:26:01,527 --> 00:26:04,530
Kyo was able to rebuild it all by himself. Hey.

364
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,032
(Bartender) Please excuse me.

365
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,535

Eat it. Itadakimasu.

Hmm!

Hey, I'm so drunk I can't taste it.

369
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:25,051
Hahahahaha…! What is this? yeah?

370
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:29,055
Recently, I bought a tatami shop that was about to go bankrupt.

371
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:31,557
We also do business to preserve culture.

372
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,060
Isn't it amazing?

373
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:37,496
I love my uncle Kyo.

374
00:26:37,496 --> 00:26:38,998
I agree.

375
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:40,499
Wow.

376
00:26:40,499 --> 00:26:43,502
Fufufufu…｡ Fufufufu…｡

377
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:46,005
What about your family?

378
00:26:46,005 --> 00:26:49,005
Ah... I only have one mother.

379
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:54,011
You must be worried.

380
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:03,522
Nothing happened just now.

381
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:07,526
When my aunt touched my hand.

382
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:12,031
That's right, so were my father and brother.

383
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:16,031
Nothing happens between people who have ``Satori''.

384
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,538
“Satori”….

385
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:24,043
What happens when Yui-chan touches someone's hand?

386
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,545
I can see the color.

387
00:27:26,545 --> 00:27:31,050
Colors that look kind and colors that look unpleasant.

388
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,552
It's the color.

389
00:27:33,552 --> 00:27:35,988
I can hear the sound.

390
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,990
Is it a sound? yes.

391
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,993
Soft sounds or sharp sounds➡

392
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:44,997
I can hear things like compatibility with me in the form of sounds.

393
00:27:44,997 --> 00:27:49,001
Hmm, that's right...!

394
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:53,005
We're lonely.

395
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,509
Because this color means this➡

396
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,511
No one will tell you, right?

397
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:02,014
So, as I accumulate experiences within myself➡

398
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:05,518
``Oh, if it's this color, I'm on my side.''➡

399
00:28:05,518 --> 00:28:08,020
That's the only way to make predictions.

400
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,522
That's right.

401
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:11,524
I can't talk to anyone➡

402
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:15,528
Even if I'm smiling, I don't want to see scary colors➡

403
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,531
I've gradually become less close to people.

404
00:28:18,531 --> 00:28:22,034
But I pretended to fit in so that I didn't stand out from the people around me➡

405
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,036
I didn't really show it to anyone.

406
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:26,038
That's right! That's right!

407
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:31,544
If they found out about my powers, I'm sure they'd be scared.

408
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:34,547
People won't believe me when I say it's just the color.

409
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,947
It makes you think that you can hear all the voices in your heart.

410
00:28:40,986 --> 00:28:44,986
Keishi-san must be scared too.

411
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:01,006
With my father when I loved him➡

412
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:03,509
Linda's color was the same.

413
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,010
(Kyoto) Is that so?

414
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:08,514
And Linda, even though she knows my power, she's not afraid.

415
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,016
Instead, he said, ``Let's go to the casino.''

416
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:13,519
Hehe... You seem like an idiot.

417
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,021
I don't understand that.

418
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,023
Yui-chan.

419
00:29:18,023 --> 00:29:20,023
Don't let him go.

420
00:29:22,027 --> 00:29:23,529
Shinobu-san➡

421
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:26,532
He told me, ``It's been tough up until now.''

422
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:29,535
When I talked about power.

423
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:31,537
When I was at Yagami's house➡

424
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:35,474
The maid and my father's secretary were all scared of me.

425
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,476
But Shinobu-san➡

426
00:29:37,476 --> 00:29:40,479
For realizing that I was lonely➡

427
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,982
He said, ``I'll be by your side.''

428
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:44,483
"You can touch me as much as you like," he said.

429
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,485
Eh! Hehe...

430
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:48,988
It seems like the complete opposite of Linda-kun➡

431
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:53,993
Isn't it the same thing in the sense that you don't care?

432
00:29:53,993 --> 00:29:56,495
I agree.

433
00:29:56,495 --> 00:29:59,995
I don't think I'll ever come across one.

434
00:30:06,505 --> 00:30:08,007
(sneeze)

435
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:11,010
Ah... Shhh... Shhh...

436
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,510
Replacement.

437
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:16,015
I'll give you back what I kept.

438
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:18,517
Oh, that's it!

439
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,520
Smartphone. Smartphone.

440
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,523
Sunglasses. Sunglasses.

441
00:30:24,523 --> 00:30:28,027
88 yen. 88 yen.

442
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:30,027
Acorn.

443
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,967
Acorn...

444
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:39,469
Do I need these handcuffs and knife?

445
00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:45,975
No need, I'm going to the police tomorrow.

446
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,482
a….

447
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:51,482
I will turn myself in.

448
00:30:54,487 --> 00:30:55,987
yes.

449
00:30:59,492 --> 00:31:04,497
Ah... I guess these acorns will be confiscated?

450
00:31:04,497 --> 00:31:06,999
Well, what do you think?

451
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:10,002
No, I won't be kept.

452
00:31:10,002 --> 00:31:12,002
I can't keep it.

453
00:31:13,005 --> 00:31:15,005
(Shinobu) I can't keep it.

454
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,519
(Cancer)((Your mother has increased her debt again))

455
00:31:32,525 --> 00:31:35,461

<“ESCAPE” is…>

463
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:31,516
What kind of sound does your uncle make?

464
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:35,520
(Kyoto) Hmm... I guess it sounds like the earth.

465
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,524
Earth? It doesn't look like that, does it?

466
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:42,027
But it's thick and warm➡

467
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:46,031
It sounds like it can handle anything.

468
00:32:46,031 --> 00:32:49,034
I feel like I understand it somehow.

469
00:32:49,034 --> 00:32:54,038
I thought you were unconsciously looking for something like a father➡

470
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,038
I'm horrified though.

471
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,042
I think it's different.

472
00:33:01,547 --> 00:33:06,551
I saw that my father and Linda had the same color➡

473
00:33:06,551 --> 00:33:10,556
I thought maybe he wasn't a bad person➡

474
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:13,558
To be honest, they don't look alike at all.

475
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:18,063
Honestly, I can't think of anything similar.

476
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,567
Fufufu…! Fufufu…｡

477
00:33:21,567 --> 00:33:26,071
Did you hear everything you wanted to hear?

478
00:33:26,071 --> 00:33:29,074
What I can think of now is

479
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:31,074
good.

480
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,080
a….

481
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:38,083
((If you can't see the color just by touching it➡

482
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,083
What if I kiss you? ))

483
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:46,592
Was it still there?

484
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:49,594
No! No, no.

485
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,094
Yeah.

486
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,600

491
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,067
Were you able to speak slowly?

492
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,067
Yeah.

493
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,578
Something was good.

494
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,078
yeah?

495
00:34:41,078 --> 00:34:43,578
Please take me to a nice place like this.

496
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,585
I agree.

497
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:50,585
At first I thought it was over for real.

498
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,594
Linda, weren't you scared?

499
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,596
That's scary!

500
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,598
I was suddenly beaten up and locked in such a strange place.

501
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,598
No, before that. Ah?

502
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,503
gasoline.

503
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,042
Ah...｡

504
00:35:11,042 --> 00:35:14,046
If I had started the fire, they would both have died.

505
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:17,049
Haha... that's right.

506
00:35:17,049 --> 00:35:20,051
Take better care of yourself.

507
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:21,553
You say it?

508
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:25,053
Because... I had a reason.

509
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:30,058
There's no reason why I should die.

510
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:39,067
I really don't want to cause alarm.

511
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,075
sorry.

512
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:46,078
I was trying to turn myself in.

513
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:49,078
It won't change today or tomorrow.

514
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:55,585
I see.

515
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,089
(Salesperson) Thank you.

516
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,534
(Shiraki) Why do you go to the trouble of sitting next to me even though there are other seats available➡

517
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,534
Did you think...?

518
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:16,038
This is Shiraki from “Weekly Shinryu”.

519
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:22,547
Excuse me, please give me the same one.

520
00:36:22,547 --> 00:36:24,547
(Salesperson) I'm very smart.

521
00:36:26,551 --> 00:36:31,551
Mr. Komiyama, you know Daisuke Hayashida well, right?

522
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:36,558
Who is he?

523
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:41,066
Maybe you're a prince? (Komiyama) But…｡

524
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:43,567
(Shiraki) It's... it's so bad.

525
00:36:43,567 --> 00:36:46,071
(Komiyama) Because you say strange things!

526
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:49,574
No, did you say something strange like that?

527
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:52,077
That guy is just a thug.

528
00:36:52,077 --> 00:36:54,077
Oh really?

529
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,583
Have you met Daisuke? Yeah, well.

530
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,585
Where?

531
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:02,585
That's a bit.

532
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:08,026
But it seems like he's willing to turn himself in.

533
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:10,529
Now online➡

534
00:37:10,529 --> 00:37:14,533
Things like Hachirin are popular among young people➡

535
00:37:14,533 --> 00:37:18,533
Well, I don't think it's out of the ordinary.

536
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:24,542
But Mae was there, and she also took part in the kidnapping.

537
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:29,548
There's something wrong with her...or maybe she's just clumsy.

538
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:33,051
I was removed from the kidnapping case. Huh?

539
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,554
Mr. Gochisousu. Thank you very much!

540
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:38,056
(Shiraki) Is that so?

541
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:41,560
(Sound of door opening and closing)

542
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,063
Is the bee coming back? yeah?

543
00:37:45,063 --> 00:37:47,566
No...it would be fine if I were adopted by two people.

544
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:49,566
That's not what I was told.

545
00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:55,574
I think I can lead a good life.

546
00:37:55,574 --> 00:38:00,078
Come to think of it, my aunt told me she would protect me.

547
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:01,580
Isn't that so?

548
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,017
Hmm...but I guess it's different.

Train with Mickey ➡

550
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:16,027
I can now stand on my own feet➡

551
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,027
I want to be a person who can protect someone.

552
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:24,534
Hmm.

553
00:38:26,037 --> 00:38:28,540
Should I sleep there after all? teeth?

554
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,542
No, look, size-wise. It's weird, isn't it?

555
00:38:30,542 --> 00:38:33,044
Hachi lives with a relative, but I'm just an outsider.

556
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,046
After all, Linda hasn't been sleeping in a proper place lately, right?

557
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,048
It's okay! Even if I catch a cold, I won't be in trouble.

558
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,049
Good, good, good...! Okay, let's play rock, paper, scissors.

559
00:38:39,049 --> 00:38:40,551
Good! If you don't show it, you'll lose➡

560
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,053
Rock, paper, scissors poi!

561
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,055
It's Aiko! Oh!

562
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,057
It's Aiko! Eh...｡

563
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,058
It's Aiko! Oh...!

00:38:48,058 --> 00:38:50,060
It's Aiko! Oh! It's Aiko! Oh!

565

It's Aiko! Ah! It's Aiko! Oh no!

After all, it's me... It's okay.

568
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:01,071
I'm good at sleeping.

569
00:39:01,071 --> 00:39:15,971

570
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,031
Dad…➡

571
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,531
Do you think it was hard?

572
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:34,036
There's nothing to feel sorry for.

573
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,976
Even if it’s hard➡

574
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:41,480
There's no reason to make bees feel bad.

575
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,480
Yes, but... it's not that easy.

576
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,491
In front of the fountain➡

577
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:55,994
Even if I asked you, you wouldn't answer properly, right?

578
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:58,497
(Yui's voice) I just kept saying, "It's not a lie."

579
00:39:58,497 --> 00:40:01,500
((Trust me))

580
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:06,505
((It's all for Yui))

581
00:40:06,505 --> 00:40:08,507
(Yui's voice) That makes me even stronger➡

582
00:40:08,507 --> 00:40:12,010
I can't trust my dad anymore...

583
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,014
Now that I think about it➡

584
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:20,519
I wonder if he really thought of me and didn't say that.

585
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:23,522
yeah? What does it mean?

586
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:26,525
When I try to explain ➡

587
00:40:26,525 --> 00:40:28,527
I'm not my father's child➡

588
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:32,030
You'll have to say that, right?

589
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:34,533
Ah...｡

590
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,535
But➡

591
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:41,535
If only I had decided not to say that...

592
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:51,550
Maybe it was my misunderstanding.

593
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,052
But it was such an unpleasant color, wasn't it?

594
00:40:54,052 --> 00:40:57,055
Hmm…｡

595
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:00,058
But that may also be a misunderstanding.

596
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,060
what kind?

597
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,563
What is Mickey's color?

598
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:09,568
Did I mention that there were both soft and dark colors?

599
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:12,571
Mickey's➡

600
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:19,077
The dark and painful color is ➡

601
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:23,077
I thought the color was blaming myself.

602
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:29,087
So maybe➡

603
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:33,091
That color of daddy too➡

604
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:36,595
Maybe it meant something different than I thought.

That's someone who was part of the kidnapping party, right?

It has nothing to do with bees. It has nothing to do with it.

Huh... I forgot about his existence.

679

He was the one who suggested we kidnap Hachi in the first place.

00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:01,019
Is that so?

681
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:04,019
It seems that he has a grudge against Yagami Pharmaceuticals.

682
00:47:06,525 --> 00:47:09,027
Well, don't worry about it. I will.

683

I don't care what happens to that damn old hag.

It's your mother, right?

686
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:21,039

688
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:29,548
It's because of him that I started working part-time jobs.

689
00:47:29,548 --> 00:47:31,550
Why?

690
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:34,553
You lose money gambling.

691

No matter how much you earn, you end up in debt like an idiot➡

692

I'll borrow money from some crazy place➡

693
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:42,491

699
00:47:56,508 --> 00:48:01,012
So what about Riri's 200,000 yen? ah.

700
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:05,016
He went to borrow it without permission.

701
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:08,016
Is that why you broke up?

702
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:13,021
It looked like I wouldn't be able to get away with 200,000 yen.

703
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:20,028
That's why you should leave that guy alone.

704
00:48:21,533 --> 00:48:25,537
Is it really good? It's okay!

705
00:48:25,537 --> 00:48:29,040
Getting beaten up is the worst, I don't care if I die.

706
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,540
Rather, I feel like I'm thanking the plague god for disappearing.

707
00:48:38,483 --> 00:48:40,983
Don't make that face.

708
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:45,991
I can go. Huh?

709
00:48:45,991 --> 00:48:47,993
Yamaguchi-san's real purpose is me, right?

710
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:50,996
Are you an idiot? No matter who you are➡

711
00:48:50,996 --> 00:48:53,996
I don't want you to go through hardships on my behalf.

712
00:48:57,002 --> 00:49:00,505
That's how you say it, Hachi.

713
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:03,008
That's why I didn't want to say it.

714
00:49:03,008 --> 00:49:05,510
So how should I contact Mr. Komiyama?

715
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:08,513
Why is that so? If the other person is Mr. Yamaguchi➡

716
00:49:08,513 --> 00:49:12,017
With the help of the police, it may be possible to resolve the matter without paying a ransom.

717
00:49:12,017 --> 00:49:14,019
That's no good.
