Yui Yagami feels distrustful of her father➡

3

He continued to live on the run with Daisuke Hayashida.

4
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,517
(Shiraki) Who are you➡

5
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,018
Don't you want to know?

6
00:00:19,018 --> 00:00:21,020
(Keishi) I told you that the artificial insemination was successful!

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,024
(Hasunuma) It belongs to your wife and Chairman Kyoichi!

12
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,539
(Yamaguchi) Your mother was taken care of.

13
00:00:39,539 --> 00:00:42,542
If you want me to help you, bring Yui Yagami with me.

14
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:46,045
<The decision between the two, mother or Yui...>

15
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,047
(Yui) Aunt and uncle.

00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:50,550
Please lend me your car.

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,051
(Kyoto) Where are you going?

18
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,555
There's a place I really need to go to.

19
00:00:55,555 --> 00:01:00,059
Please, I'll definitely turn myself in when this is over.

Yui-chan Linda-kun

21
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,961
If we don't understand the situation, we can't cooperate.

00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,505
Linda's mother➡

23
00:01:12,505 --> 00:01:15,008

(Shinobi) Who is your opponent?

25
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,513
He's the one who originally proposed the kidnapping.

26
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,015
What's your name?

27
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:24,517
Kenji Yamaguchi.

28
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:29,022
Apparently he works at a pub in Sakanomachi.

29
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,525
Please, let me go.

30
00:01:32,525 --> 00:01:34,027
Yui-chan.

31
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:37,030
I said I'd protect you, right?

32
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,032
Yes. (Kyoto) If I let you go like this➡

33
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,034
It will put you in danger.

34
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,534
But because of me, Linda's mother is in danger.

35
00:01:46,539 --> 00:01:51,544
If I don't go, I can't change this situation.

36
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:55,048
I will absolutely protect Yui-san.

37
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,548
I can protect it myself. I know, okay for now.

38
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,492
Understood.

39
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:09,496
Instead, make sure you come back unscathed.

The first thing to do is to release the old woman. Ah?

46

Are you going to talk back?

(Tabata) I do.

00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:01,034
I came today to talk about work.

76
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:03,970
(Komiyama) What is it? I'm Hayashida's mother➡

77
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,474
My workplace has notified me that they haven't been able to contact me for three days.

78
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,977
Does it have something to do with the Hachirin incident?

79
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,477
Don't even call me "Hachirin". Is that okay?

80
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,987
But don't worry about it. Right?

81
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,489
There was a jump in Kichijoji recently, right?

You look similar to her mother.

What do you mean?

86
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,501
Debts incurred through gambling are dangerous.

87
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:38,004
It didn't look like that at all.

88
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,507
Well, please let me know if there is any progress. Understood.

Ah... That's right, Comic-san, this is it.

This is the garage where the two were hiding.

Who are you?

106
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,500
One of the kidnappers' group.

107

I thought it was going to be a love story➡

108
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:45,004
I'm back to suspense.

109
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:47,006
It might be a personal thing for you...

110
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:51,006
Of course, you can expect rewards, right?

111
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:57,016
I've said it after all.

Was it really that good?

113
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,521
It's for Yui-chan and the others.

114
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,956
That's a different story!

That's because he'll turn against you!

Yagami Pharmaceutical is about to be taken over by someone other than Yagami.

00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:14,013
It would be difficult for one person to hand over the ransom money.

(Komiyama's voice) Did Yamaguchi provoke you...?

189
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,551
I think so.

190
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:04,490
A normal person would never think of kidnapping.

191

What about Yamaguchi on the day of the incident?

192
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:09,495
Ah, you said something the day before that you were quitting.

193
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,998
You said that Yamaguchi is not an ordinary person, right?

194
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,000
Everything is the fault of the person.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,504
It's my parents' fault, my woman's fault, that I'm not doing well➡

Yamaguchi is on the witness stand as the woman's lover.

What was the result?

00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,545
No loss of vision➡

The suit was dismissed.

It's a mess, isn't it?

284
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:36,555
Just to confirm, everything Yamaguchi said was a lie➡

285
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,557
Is this a correct interpretation?

286
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,058
no thanks.

(Hosaka) I guess there are times.

From the outside, there is no legitimacy➡

I believe that the person who said it is right.

00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,496
You came to Yagami Pharmaceutical earlier, right?

359
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:10,997
I've been wearing it ever since then➡

360
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,499
Didn't you notice?

361
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:15,001
Do not follow detectives.

362
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,504
I feel confident.

363
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:19,506
(Tabata) Why did Mr. Shiraki choose Yamaguchi?

364
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,508
Did you know that you were part of the kidnapper group?

365
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:24,511
I heard from someone that you might want to hurry.

366
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,511
You must have entered this store.

367
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,017
I guess the kidnapping case isn't over yet.

368
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,520
If I talk to you, can you give me information about Yamaguchi?

369
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,523
Why would the police do something like that...Tabata.

370
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:40,023
You, go smoke a cigarette. I don't want a cigarette...

371
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,528
yes.

372
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:47,531
Hurry up and don't be impatient!

373
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,540
Ugh…｡

374
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,540
Ah...｡

375
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,549
thank you.

376
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:04,984
Let's go...

377
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:07,987
Hey….

378
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,487
Ugh...!

379
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:13,493
(Sound of stun gun) Argh...!

380
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:21,000

381
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Oh no.

382
00:23:28,007 --> 00:23:30,510
Oh, would you like one last thing?

383
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,012
Why are you listening?

384
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:35,014
Mr. Komiyama is Daisuke Hayashida➡

385
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:37,514
Do you want to be arrested? Don't you want to?

386
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,519
I want him to be rehabilitated properly.

387
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:49,028
(Komiyama) Daisuke probably had that intention as well.

388
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,528
But he also became involved in crime.

389
00:23:53,032 --> 00:23:55,535
If you really want to rehabilitate ➡

390
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:58,037
Unless Daisuke himself wants to do that➡

391
00:23:58,037 --> 00:24:00,039
It's probably meaningless.

392
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:04,043
For example, for someone important?

393
00:24:04,043 --> 00:24:06,980
I agree.

394
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:10,480
There are limits to what you can do for yourself.

395
00:24:11,985 --> 00:24:14,988
Screen) (curl) We finally secured the majority of the shares.

396
00:24:14,988 --> 00:24:17,490
Screen) This is our victory.

397
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,994

398
00:24:20,994 --> 00:24:22,495
Ha...!

399
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:23,997
(Fuji) I will contact you later.

400
00:24:23,997 --> 00:24:25,999
Why aren't you answering the phone?

401
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:28,001
Is your body okay?

402
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:30,003
Anyway, I found the answer.

403
00:24:30,003 --> 00:24:33,003
Please prepare the 300 million reward money immediately.

404
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:38,511
I'm sorry, but I don't have that authority. What?

405
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:42,515
Please use your own money. Authority? What do you mean?

406
00:24:42,515 --> 00:24:45,018
Hoover Pharmaceuticals just said➡

407
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:48,018
Acquired a majority stake in Yagami Pharmaceutical.

408
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,022
Hoover?

409
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:59,032
Does that mean Kyo-san sold his shares?

410
00:24:59,032 --> 00:25:01,032
yes.

411
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,037
That's a lie...

412
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:06,039
I can't help it. It's a lie!

413
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:07,540
This is the reality.

414
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:10,043
Shit...! Damn...!

415
00:25:10,043 --> 00:25:14,047
Ahhh!!

416
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:16,547
Ah...!

417
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:25,058
Why so much?

418
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:27,558
I can stay calm.

419
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:34,063
Thank you for your help so far.

420
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,572
Fufufu…｡

421
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:42,075
(cough cough)

422
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:44,077
There are procedures for management transition➡

423
00:25:44,077 --> 00:25:47,077
It would be helpful if you could clean it up early.

424
00:25:49,082 --> 00:25:52,585
No way…➡

425
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,087
With Hoover?

426
00:25:54,087 --> 00:25:55,588
yes.

It's already here➡

00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,535
It's not your room... Get out!

438
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,066
There are also growing concerns on the ground.

(Screen) President Yagami has not yet appeared.

440
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,568
I wonder if it's finished.

441
00:26:49,575 --> 00:26:51,077
It's fine here.

442
00:26:51,077 --> 00:26:53,079
Wait a minute, don't drop me off here.

443
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,081
There's a station right there. It's dangerous, isn't it?

444
00:26:55,081 --> 00:26:58,084
What will you do if that person finds you again?

445
00:26:58,084 --> 00:27:00,586
Could you please come to my aunt's villa?

446
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:02,588
Eh, no, but...｡ It's my fault➡

447
00:27:02,588 --> 00:27:05,525
I'm really sorry for making you feel so bad.

448

There is also a nice bath➡

449

Please take it easy if you like.

450
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:12,031
Is it okay? Of course.

451
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:14,031
thank you.

452
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:17,036

00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:31,050
Did you find out? (Shiraki) Yeah.

456
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:35,054
Yamaguchi seems like a very dangerous person.

457
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:37,056
What about Yui and the others?

458
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:40,059
It seems like I was able to escape for the time being.

459
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,063
That's good... that's what I want to say➡

460
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:47,563
It doesn't seem like he has the balls to give up.

461
00:27:53,072 --> 00:27:55,572
(Yamaguchi) Uh... ah...｡

462
00:27:57,076 --> 00:28:00,580

I'm back. Welcome back!

467
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,026
This is Linda's mother.

468
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:18,029
My name is Tomoko Hayashida, and I am sorry for the inconvenience caused to you and my son...

469

No, I'm glad you're safe.

470

I've just returned.

471
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,039
What's wrong with that face? Isn't something getting worse and worse?

472
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,541
It can't be helped.

473
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,544
I'm sorry, it's unsightly... (Kyoto) That's outrageous!

474
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,547
He protected the two of us, right?

475
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,447
Well.

476
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:40,984
Ite…｡

477
00:28:43,988 --> 00:28:45,990
Well, I used to have a lighter with me.

478
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,990
Ah, give it back.

479
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:54,999
This time, he saved me.

480
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,001
Yes, Mickey gave it to me.

481
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,504
A hamburger shop? Yeah.

482
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,006
Is it something like this?

483
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:05,009
Have you become handsome? Why don't you look in the mirror?

484
00:29:05,009 --> 00:29:07,512
picture?

485
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,515
Mom wasn't a shitty old woman at all.

486
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:14,018
teeth? He took care of Yamaguchi.

487
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:17,522
Anyone would do that in that situation.

488
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:19,522
I guess so...

489
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,025
Don't be fooled.

490
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:27,031

00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:29,033

492
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,033
Even I had to make money))

496
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,483

00:29:57,996 --> 00:30:00,498
thank you very much.

502
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,998
What are you going to do now?

503
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:09,007
My father thought I would come back➡

504
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,010
I've got the money ready and waiting.

505
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,010
What does Yui-chan want to do?

506
00:30:17,015 --> 00:30:21,519
I talked to my aunt yesterday➡

507
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:24,522
What I felt about my father➡

508
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,526
I thought it might have been a misunderstanding.

509
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:34,032
Yes. But maybe not.

510
00:30:34,032 --> 00:30:38,469
So still...➡

511
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:41,973
I'm scared to meet you.

512
00:30:41,973 --> 00:30:45,977
I guess that's fine then?

513
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,479
Yui-chan did it herself➡

514
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:53,479
I want to meet you. You can go see me whenever you want to talk.

515
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:57,989
yes.

516
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,492
Besides, it must be difficult for the company right now.

517
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:02,994
Is that so?

518
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:06,497
Yagami Pharmaceutical stocks that I owned➡

519
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,500
I sold it to Hoover.

520
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,503
If you sell it to Keishi, Keishi will be safe.

521
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:17,008
If Keishi sells to Hoover, he will be forced out of Yagami Pharmaceutical.

522
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:21,008
At such a fork in the road, I chose the latter.

523
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:29,520
I also talked to Yui yesterday and thought about a lot of things.

524
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,025
So I decided.

529
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:01,986
Ah...but if I can borrow it, even 100,000 or 200,000 would be helpful.

530
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:03,988
I'll definitely return it.

531
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:06,991
Sorry, I don't have any money right now.

532
00:32:06,991 --> 00:32:11,496
Ah...then, uh...could I ask your aunt for something?

533
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,999
I think you will be surprised if I suddenly ask you something like this➡

534
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:19,504
But I would really appreciate it if you could borrow even a little bit.

535
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,504
please.

536
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:25,510
What are you doing?

537
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,510
It's nothing.

538
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,016
You were trying to borrow money, right?

539
00:32:32,016 --> 00:32:34,519
My mom is really having a hard time right now...

540
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,521
Don't be silly.

541
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,021
You must be gambling!

542
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:44,028
I'm really sorry...but I have to return the money➡

543
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:47,031
I might get fired from the company... That's abnormal.

544
00:32:47,031 --> 00:32:50,031
I'm about to borrow money from the bee I just met!

545
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:56,038
Please be careful.

546
00:32:58,042 --> 00:33:00,542
Why is it always your fault...?

547
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:06,050
What do you think my life is?

548
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,050
Please give me a break...

549
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:15,558
What is it? It's okay.

550
00:33:17,562 --> 00:33:21,566
I won't lend it to you. Don't ask me to lend it to you.

551
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:23,566
Didn't you think so?

552
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,076
Mother➡

553
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:35,580
Maybe I have a gambling addiction.

554
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,015
Addiction? Yeah.

555
00:33:38,015 --> 00:33:41,519
That's what happened to Mickey's younger brother.

556
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,022
So I heard a lot of things...

557
00:33:45,022 --> 00:33:49,527
Huh... do you mean sick?

558
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,530
He's not sick, that guy.

559
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,032
When you become addicted➡

560
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:58,035
I can't stop even if I want to.

561
00:33:58,035 --> 00:34:04,041
Contrary to my thoughts, I also hurt someone important to me➡

562
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:06,541
It's really painful.

563
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,549
So what should I do? First of all➡

564
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:16,554
The person himself/herself thinks, “I want to change this life” ➡

565
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,557
It seems to be the first step towards treatment.

566
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,059
For that ➡

567
00:34:22,059 --> 00:34:26,063
It's no good to help halfway.

568
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:28,065
Do you mean abandon me?

569
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:30,067
That's different.

570
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:42,013
♬～

571
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:48,019
He gave birth to me when he was 20 years old➡

572
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:52,023
I don't have a father, so please don't make me suffer ➡

573
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:55,023
I know you worked hard.

574
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:03,529
It's like having your parents participate in a sports day.

575
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:11,542
That's why he ran the relay.

576
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,542
Everyone else is my dad.

577
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:23,054
But it's the fastest among them➡

578
00:35:23,054 --> 00:35:26,054
It was the coolest.

579
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,560
But things have changed.

580
00:35:37,501 --> 00:35:40,001
Is Hachi's father the same?

581
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:45,009
Even though it has changed ➡

582
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,509
There's probably a reason.

583
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,017
Is it my fault?

584
00:35:53,017 --> 00:35:55,017
Eh, why?

585
00:35:58,522 --> 00:36:02,026
It must have been difficult, right? Don't you raise it?

586
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,028
But that's...

587
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:08,532
Please don't make me feel pathetic.

588
00:36:08,532 --> 00:36:12,036
I suddenly felt a lot of pressure and got tired➡

589
00:36:12,036 --> 00:36:16,036
Like... addicted to gambling?

590
00:36:18,542 --> 00:36:21,045
It's not Linda's fault➡

591
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:24,545
I don't think my mother became a bad person.

592
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,552
Don't abandon me➡

593
00:36:28,552 --> 00:36:32,556
In order to change this situation even a little bit➡

594
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:35,559
I think there are still things I can do➡

595
00:36:35,559 --> 00:36:36,959
What do you think?

596
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
Is there someone you would like to meet?

597
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:54,012
<“ESCAPE” is currently streaming the latest episodes and past digests for free on TVer>

598
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,514
<With Hulu, all episodes are available anytime and anywhere! ＞

599
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,014
<And...>

600
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,962
(Tabata) No, Yamaguchi.

601
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,965
I'm going to wash the camera footage around here. I'm requesting your support.

602
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:17,969
(Ebihara) One of the remaining members of the Yui Yagami kidnapping group ➡

603
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,973
There have been reports that Kenji Yamaguchi has once again kidnapped and confined people.

604
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:25,977
Daisuke Hayashida, who has been wanted for some time, has not yet been secured.

605
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:28,479
Secure two people as soon as possible.

606
00:37:28,479 --> 00:37:30,982
Let's finish it! (All) Yes!

607
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,484
Here it is.

608
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:34,984
yes.

609
00:37:39,991 --> 00:37:41,993
(knock)

610
00:37:41,993 --> 00:37:43,493
(Kyoto) ⚟Please⚞

611
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,503
Thank you for your help.

612
00:37:52,503 --> 00:37:54,003
home.

613
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:59,510
In the end, it looks like he was able to escape safely on his own.

614
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,012
That's right.

615
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:04,515
But a promise is a promise.

616
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,017
please.

617
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,917
yes.

618
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,458
Nice to meet you again➡

619
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:16,961
My name is Shiraki from Weekly Shinryu.

620
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:31,961
♬～

621
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:42,979
I can hear the sound of white wood

622
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,492
What color am I?

623
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,994
I can't see the color.

624
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:53,994
But I don't regret meeting you.

625
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
That would be great.

626
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,909
Is the Yagami family really that interesting?

627
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,951
Yeah.

628
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:17,955
My life was changed by Chairman Kyoichi.

629
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,957
what do you mean?

630
00:39:19,957 --> 00:39:23,461
I used to work as a reporter for a economic newspaper.

631
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:26,464
When I interviewed Chairman Kyoichi there➡

632
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,964
I was shocked and wondered, ``Who is this person?''

633
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,472
Would you say I was fascinated?

634
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,475
Was my father that strong?

635
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:39,977
Yeah, there's no one else like him.

636
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:42,980
What about me?

637
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,983
Honestly…➡

638
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,986
I felt something similar➡

639
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,990
There was nothing strange or scary about it.

640
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,993
Yes, that's good.

641
00:39:55,993 --> 00:39:57,995
When Chairman Kyoichi held my hand➡

642
00:39:57,995 --> 00:40:00,998
I thought my soul had been sucked out.

643
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:05,503
(Kyoto) It didn't look like a monster. Yes, it was a monster.

644
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,005
Ahhh.

645
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:13,010
Mr. Shiraki was also chosen in a sense.

646
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:15,012
Is it me?

647
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,014
The side that was touched is ➡

648
00:40:17,014 --> 00:40:20,017
It seems like most of the time I don't feel anything.

649
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,519
picture?

650
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,019
I don't know which one is better though.

651
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,023
I...

652
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,031
I think it was good.

653
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,534
Even though my father ruined my life?

654
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:38,536
Yeah.

655
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:40,536
Is that so...

656
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,041
(Shiraki) It seems like there are other people who were selected just now➡

657
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,041
You said it that way, right?

658
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,046
Are you President Keishi?

659
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:55,050
You have good intuition.

660
00:40:56,554 --> 00:40:58,556
(Tomoko) Your younger brother?

661
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:00,057
(Tsboi) Yeah.

662
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:05,057
(Tsboi) I didn't know it was that painful.

663
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,502
I would also like to request it.

664
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,502
Please start treatment.

665
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:20,011
But what should I do...

666
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:23,014
Gambling addicts gather ➡

667
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:25,516
There are self-help groups.

668
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,518
Self-help group...

669
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:32,018
(Tsboi) First of all, please try to participate there.

670
00:41:33,524 --> 00:41:38,024
Um... could that be a cure?

671
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:43,034
At first ➡

672
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:47,538
You may think, ``I'm different from other people.''

673
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:51,542
But while I was passing through➡

674
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:55,546
You might start to think of them as friends.

675
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:58,049
When I was talking with my friends➡

676
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:02,553
What makes you gamble?

677
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,556
Sometimes you can find it.

678
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:08,993
When you can talk to people about your worries➡

679
00:42:08,993 --> 00:42:13,498
There's no need to cover up your hard feelings with gambling.

680
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:16,000
Do it like that➡

681
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,006
``I didn't have to do it today.'' ``I didn't do it today either.''

682
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,510
Build up days like that.

683
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,513
Does that mean it won't heal that quickly?

684
00:42:28,513 --> 00:42:31,015
(Tsboi) Yes.

685
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:35,520
1 day 1 week 1 month ➡

686
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,022
Half a year to 1 year.

687
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:42,527
Make friends and work together➡

688
00:42:42,527 --> 00:42:44,527
I'm going to stop.

689
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:52,033
You don't have to fight alone anymore.

690
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:07,985
(cry)

691
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:13,491
Can I... change?

692
00:43:13,491 --> 00:43:15,493
(cry)

693
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:17,995
You can change.

694
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:28,506
(cry)

695
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:31,008
You too➡

696
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,511
It was tough.

697
00:43:33,511 --> 00:43:44,522
♬～

698
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:47,525
(Tomoko's voice) You met a nice person.

699
00:43:47,525 --> 00:43:52,025
Yui-chan has what Daisuke needs.

700
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:58,035
When I’m with Hachi➡

701
00:43:58,035 --> 00:44:01,035
I feel like I shouldn't have thrown it away either.

702
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:08,980
He's smart, but he's always acting like a nuisance➡

703
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:11,983
Although it may be blurry ➡

704
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,986
It's strong.

705
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:18,486
I don't think it's bad anyway.

706
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,493
Even if you feel stuck➡

707
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,493
Are you trying to take even one step forward?

708
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:31,502
When I see something like that➡

709
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,502
I wonder if I can't do it yet.

710
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:41,512
If I give up, things will never change ➡

711
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,012
Maybe if I try, things will change.

712
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:50,021
The chances of it changing are very low, though.

713
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,523
But➡

714
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,523
I thought I'd take a chance on that.

715
00:44:57,528 --> 00:45:03,028
I think I should try to believe that I too have a future.

716
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,937
that's why….

717
00:45:10,975 --> 00:45:12,975
I'll turn myself in.

718
00:45:15,479 --> 00:45:17,479
I'll start my life over again.

719
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:23,986
You should try again too.

720
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,991
Yeah.

721
00:45:37,501 --> 00:45:40,001
It's from here.

722
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:44,508
Mom too.

723
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:56,020
♬～

724
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:59,023
I was saved by a bee again.

725
00:45:59,023 --> 00:46:02,526
It's not like I helped you.

726
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:04,528
I just did it because I wanted to.

727
00:46:04,528 --> 00:46:06,528
Don't try to be cool.

728
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,968
But it was good.

729
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:14,968
I still don't trust that damn old hag though.

730
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:19,974
I don't even believe you, Dad.

731
00:46:21,979 --> 00:46:23,979
But I'll meet you.

732
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:27,985
I see.

733
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:30,985
I don't like feeling anxious all by myself.

734
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:35,993
Tsukasa: Are you okay by yourself? Huh?

735
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:40,498
I'm already going to turn myself in. It's okay, Dad, I'm weak right now.

736
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:44,502
Scary, that's the reason. It's got to be a joke, right?

737
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:46,502
What is it?

738
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:52,510
As expected... I'll go with you.

739
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:54,011
Why?

740
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:56,514
"I'm sorry for having to drag you around until now."

741
00:46:56,514 --> 00:47:00,017
Are you there? That's it. That's it.

742
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:03,020
I'm looking at the future.

743
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,522
What is that?

744
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:07,458
It's okay if you don't understand.

745
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,960
So should I apologize to Linda's mother too?

746
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:12,463
No need, bees don't apologize.

747
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:14,465
I'm sorry for having to carry your son around until now.

748
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,967
Wait, wait, wait, wait, what is this pointless conversation?

749
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:18,469
It's the last one.

750
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:21,469
Hachi is my second life, I'm a pig box.

751
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:26,474
The last one... Ah.

752
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,982
this.

753
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,485
Will you keep it for me?

754
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:35,986
I understand.

755
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,488
What about Hachi?

756
00:47:37,488 --> 00:47:40,491
I put it in my bag before it disappeared.

757
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:41,991
I see.

758
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,996
But it won't be the last.

759
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:47,498
picture?

760
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:49,998
Are you going to come get this someday?

761
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,504
That's right.

762
00:47:53,504 --> 00:48:07,952
♬～

763
00:48:07,952 --> 00:48:09,954
Even a kiss is fine.

764
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:20,464
♬～

765
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:22,464
I'll stop.

766
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,968
Because it seems like it's the last time.

767
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:30,473
That's right.

768
00:48:31,976 --> 00:48:33,477
Huh...

769
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:35,479
(knock)

770
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:37,979
(sound of door opening)

771
00:48:41,986 --> 00:48:43,988
What did you come for?

772
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:45,988
Yui-san won't come back.

773
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:48,993
picture?

774
00:48:48,993 --> 00:48:51,993
Do you still need Yui's help?

775
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,500
Even the company was taken away.

776
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,004
Please don't make such a scary face.

777
00:49:00,004 --> 00:49:04,008
I wanted to break the curse that was placed on you.

778
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:21,959
♬～

779
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,963
I will never forgive you...!

780
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:32,963
♬～

781
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,984
The release of Blu-ray & DVD-BOX has been decided.

782
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,986
