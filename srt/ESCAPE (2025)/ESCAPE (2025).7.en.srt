(Bandai) <Yui Yagami, the hostage in the kidnapping incident➡

3
00:00:13,513 --> 00:00:16,516
The person who was running away with the culprit, Daisuke Hayashida, was➡

4
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:18,518
Almost killed by my father, President Yagami➡

5
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:21,020
It was because I had a memory.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:24,524
<A girl who has the ability to understand others by touching them>

7
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:26,526
(Yui) I can hold this hand!?

8
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:28,528
If you hold me, I'll believe you.

00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:32,031
＜My father cannot take your hand back＞

<What is the secret that my father keeps secret...>

11
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,036
(Shiraki) He looks like he's going to kill you.

12
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:44,041
Are you afraid of knowing the truth?

13
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,045
(Bandai) That's scary.

14
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,050
I like President Keishi.

15
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,057
Because I am a benefactor.

16
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,460
No...no, no, let's start over.

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
(Bandai) Huh?

18
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,007
What are you doing?

19
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,509
(Daisuke) I used this car to escape.

20
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:18,511
Stop it. Why?

21
00:01:18,511 --> 00:01:20,513
Don't be a thief.

22
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:23,513
They're watching me here, so I have to go far.

23
00:01:25,518 --> 00:01:27,520
Let's leave us.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,022
teeth?

25
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:32,025
Let's go to the police now. Huh!? What are you talking about?

26
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,527
Turn yourself in, pay for your crimes, and start over. Why?

27
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:36,529
He might get a suspended sentence now.

28
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:38,531
Why do I have to do that?

29
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:41,034
Linda, if you stay with me, you'll commit more sins.

30
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,536
It's okay, no one is using this car.

31
00:01:43,536 --> 00:01:46,039
That's not what I'm talking about! What's going on now?

32
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,039
Are you running away by yourself?

33
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:52,043
You don't need me anymore?

34
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,548
That's right, I don't need it.

35
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:02,055
Linda was arrested once, right?

36
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,991
Then I met Komiyama-san➡

37
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,994
I asked Mr. Saito to introduce me so I wouldn't repeat the crime➡

38
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,497
So I took the mechanic exam and got the qualification➡

39
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,499
You did it seriously!

40
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,000
You kidnapped me➡

41
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,002
It's like you're already caught up in that, right?

42
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:19,506
No, I just wanted to play and live with the money I received.

43
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:21,508
Okay, that's it. What!?

44
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,508
Because I know you're lying.

45
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:30,016
Linda can do it if she tries, right?

46
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,519
Become a full-fledged car dealer➡

47
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,022
You'll get Saito-san's approval, right?

48
00:02:36,022 --> 00:02:39,025
He's gone.

49
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,027
I thought it wasn't there, but it wasn't.

50
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,029
I think there is. I see...

51
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,531
I don't understand what you're saying.

52
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:46,533
It's lame though. Oh?

53
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:48,535
If you can do it, don't do it! Just talking about it is lame!

54
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,037
It's not just your mouth! Then do it!

55
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,540
I'll do it! Yes, goodbye.

56
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,540

57
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,045

He is a rare character that is hard to meet in Tokyo.

It seems like I had some business to do here today.

67

Is it okay for me to join you too?

Please be grateful.

69
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:58,033
But what is it about President Keishi that makes him so good?

70
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,477
Me➡

71
00:04:04,477 --> 00:04:07,477
Before, I was in the research field.

72
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:11,985
It's the same pattern as President Keishi. Yes.

73
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,488
I don't know if it's the same reason why I quit.

74
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,991
Why did Bandai-san quit?

75
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:19,993
It wasn't for me.

76
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,995
Ahahaha…｡

77
00:04:21,995 --> 00:04:23,997
Even though I knew that➡

78
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,999
I can't make a decision.

79
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:31,004
(Shiraki) President Keishi was the one who allowed us to take that step.

80
00:04:31,004 --> 00:04:34,507
One year's New Year's greeting➡

81
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:37,510
In the context of drug research and development ➡

82
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:41,514
You talked about a ``courageous retreat.''

83
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,516
Hmm.

84
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:47,520
``That's progress from the perspective of the future.''➡

85
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,020
...He said...

86
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:57,030
Those words really struck a chord with Bandai at that time.

87
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,033
It may sound exaggerated, but ➡

88
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:02,969
It was a relief.

89
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,973
So I asked for a transfer to the department➡

90
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,977
By chance, I ended up working next to the president.

91
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,981
But if you were around him, you would have seen the bad side of him.

92
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,983
no.

93
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,485
Really?

94
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:22,985
Isn't that why you're confused?

It's Bandai.

Isn't Yui back yet?

111
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:13,966
yes.

112
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,968
That's worrying.

113
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:17,470
Yeah.

Isn't Kyo with you today?

115
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,977
I thought your wife said she had nothing to say to you.

116
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,980
Has there been any change in your feelings?

117
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,480
No matter how many times you ask, it's a waste.

118
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,485
I would like to ask you about "Satori".

119
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,994
What are you going to do now that you know?

120
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,494
I guess you know.

121
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:51,003
Kyo-san is the owner of "Satori", right?

122
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:56,509
My wife is someone who left Yagami's house 30 years ago.

123
00:07:56,509 --> 00:08:00,012
It's natural that I'm interested in Yagami Pharmaceuticals➡

124
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:02,515
I want you to leave my wife alone.

125
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,915
Are there any other owners of "Satori"?

126
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,957
(Shiraki) Between the two of you➡

127
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,457
There's no such thing as a hidden child, right?

128

I'm sorry. It's okay.

00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,502
(Bandai) If it looks like that➡

137
00:08:56,502 --> 00:08:59,502
I guess Kyo has "Satori".

138
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,508
There is no doubt about it➡

139
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,945
The previous president, Kyoichi,➡

140
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,949
If you have "Satori".

141
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:12,451
My eldest son Koichi is➡

142
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,454
Because he died young➡

143
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:20,459
Now, the blood of Chairman Kyoichi is ➡

144
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,462
Only Kyo.

145
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,465
There are no other relatives.

146
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:28,968
The president was adopted by Chairman Kyoichi➡

147
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,970
What is the Yagami family?

148
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,972
You're not related, right?

149
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:37,977
But for some reason, it's supposed to be two daughters➡

150
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:42,477
Yui is said to have "Satori".

151
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:49,989
In that case, Yui's biological parents are...

152
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:51,991
Kyo-san?➡

153
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,493
Chairman Kyoichi.

154
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:58,497
If Kyo-san were her mother, would she let Yui-san go?

155
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:00,499
I can't say there isn't, though.

156
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:05,504
It's hard to imagine this considering his attitude towards the president and Yui-san.

157
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,504
In that case...

158
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:15,014
It's scary just thinking about it...

159
00:10:15,014 --> 00:10:17,016

00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,533
After all, Yui-chan has "Satori".

164
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,533
I'll find you as soon as possible and bring you home.

(Tabata) Comi-san, juvenile division, are you going home?

168
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,053
I think we need a comic.

169

It was decided by the top.

170
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:59,058
Then, if I catch Hayashida➡

171
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,560
Mr. Komi, please be present at the hearing.

172

(Female) I'm sorry. Not at all.

184
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,538
Don't worry about it, it's okay if you lean on it.

185
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,040
Can I hold mom's hand? (Boy) Yeah.

186
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,542
Did you understand?

187
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,544
The one who is helping the mother who looks unwell➡

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,546
Daisuke Hayashida I'm Linda!

189
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,048
Even though there is a risk that the police will come and find out ➡

190
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,050
You were helping people, right? Yes, that's right.

191
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,553
Safe...

192
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,053
Linda is...

193
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,496

(Misaki) Yeah, that's right.

195
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,000
These two...

196
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,005
Yeah, something...

197
00:12:20,005 --> 00:12:22,508
Yes, that's right!

198
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,008
In other words….

199
00:12:27,012 --> 00:12:29,515
Smartphone) Yes, Yui-chan is called "Hachi."

200
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:33,018
Smartphone) That's why Reiwa's Romiduri is Hachirin!

201
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:35,020
This is it... Smartphone) (Masaki) "Mami Channel" is ➡

202
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,023
I will do my best to promote Hachirin. It's a shame.

Please. Thank you.

Sorry for making you wait. (Teshima) No, it's very popular!

210
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:30,009
Did something happen? Part-time worker isn't coming!

211
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:33,012
I can't even get in touch with you. (Teshima) Is it back?

212
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,514
Hmmm~ At least say you're quitting!

213
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,517
If I see someone who can work part-time, I'll introduce them to them and I won't give them any luxury.

214

(Teshima) Good luck Mickey! thank you.

Delicious. So delicious. What? Did you make it today too?

Yes, I made it. Eh, it looks delicious.

220
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:59,038
Do you want to eat something? Huh? Is that okay?

221
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:02,041
Yeah. Eh, what should I do?

222
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:03,976

The pizza is ready! yes!

230
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:42,514
Keishi doesn't answer the phone at all➡

231
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:45,017
Kyo was crying.

232
00:14:45,017 --> 00:14:48,020
(Keishi) I apologize for that.

233
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:53,025
Looks like Yui-chan hasn't returned yet.

234
00:14:53,025 --> 00:14:57,029
The person who put up the bounty instead of leaving it to the police was➡

235
00:14:57,029 --> 00:14:59,531
Wasn't it a mistake in judgment?

236
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,968
Thank you for your concern, we are doing everything we can.

237
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,971

238
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:10,476
Is that why you're here today?

239
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:12,978
There is that too➡

240
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:16,482
I also wanted to ask about the Hoover Company.

241
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:19,485
Huh…｡ They are steadily➡

242
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:22,985
It looks like they are buying up shares in Yagami Pharmaceutical.

243
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:30,996
Kyo-san was also contacted by Hoover?

244
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,999
If you combine Keishi and Kyo's holdings➡

245
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:37,002
It's over 50%, right?

246
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,504
Yeah.

247
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:42,007
Well then...if Kyo doesn't sell➡

248
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:47,012
No matter how hard Hoover tries, he cannot win a majority.

249
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,512
Well, that's right.

250
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,021
I am speaking on behalf of a shareholder➡

251
00:15:56,021 --> 00:16:00,021
Does Yagami Pharmaceutical have the strength to survive?

252
00:16:02,961 --> 00:16:07,466
We are focusing on developing new drugs.

253
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,966
If this is completed... Will you keep it until it is completed?

254
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:15,974
For those who have sold the recipe for a new drug➡

255
00:16:15,974 --> 00:16:18,477
Isn't that fine?

256
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,479
(Saito)((Anyway, go to Natsuki soon➡

00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,481

259
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,988
That is➡

260
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:31,988
Absolutely not.

261
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:37,496
is that so.

262
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,496
Understood.

263
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,001
Are you planning to sell to Hoover?

264
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:52,507
That is for Kyo to decide.

265
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:57,013
(Sound of door opening and closing)

266
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,457
(Shiraki) Hmm.

267
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:09,957
It's a light in front of the wind.

268
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,966
Ha... I'm sorry.

269
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,468
In the end, I was asked to work until the end.

270
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,971
No. It was more of a hindrance, wasn't it?

271
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,473
not at all! Thank you for your help.

272
00:17:21,473 --> 00:17:23,475
Thank you. Ah, no...

273
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:26,478
Hehe, let's have dinner too.

274
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:28,478
You want to eat it, right?

It's cold...

279
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,507

Let's have it. Let's eat it.

281
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,951
Are you looking for a part-time job?

282
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,451
Ah... yes.

283
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,456
Is there some kind of reason?

284
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,964

I've heard too much of it.

288
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:37,483
But if you give me a part-time job➡

289
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,983
I can help, but what do you think?

290
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,990

292
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:51,497

Ah, but you don't want to be with me all the time!

300
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:19,458
Ah, no... am I okay with it at all?

301
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,462
Does that mean you'll be working for a long time?

302
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:26,965
It seems like he'll do his best.

303

Yes, I will work hard. Good!

Ah, what's your name? What should I call you?

305
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,477

We are responding by holding another press conference.

Smartphone) The father was abusing his daughter Yui.

440

Is it really abuse?

441
00:27:02,888 --> 00:27:05,891
But this type of person is the one who talks about delusions as if they were real➡

I don't want you to say that.

447
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:20,404
That's right.

448
00:27:21,907 --> 00:27:24,409
Maybe this is our fault.

449
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:25,911
That's different.

00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:46,891
Congratulations~ Hehehe...!

538
00:33:46,891 --> 00:33:49,394
Thank you for everything.

539
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,397
Well, I'm going out all day today.

540
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,400
Ah, if you want to practice, you can use the ingredients.

541
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,903
Well, come on.

542
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,903
(Gun's voice) Hey, where's Hachi?

543
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,409
Where did he go? Huh?

544
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:08,346
I don't think he was taken back. What is it?

545
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:12,350
The police showed me a photo of me and Riri.

546
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:16,354
I dropped it and Hachi's father took it.

547
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,356
The two of us ran away from there.

548
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,356
Then why did you go somewhere?

549
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,362
Break up after a fight➡

550
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,865
Were you told goodbye unilaterally?

551
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,865
Why?

552
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,374
Apparently you don't need me.

553
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,376
He suddenly says things like, ``Turn yourself in!''

554
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:41,876
He said things like, ``When you come out, become a full-fledged mechanic.''

555
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:46,384
What are you laughing about?

556
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,387
Hachi is nice, it's not cloudy.

557
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:50,888
Where?

558
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:54,392
You're an irredeemable idiot. What's wrong with you?

559
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:59,397
Is there anyone else in this world who cares about your life that much?

560
00:34:59,397 --> 00:35:01,399
It's not for me.

561
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,401
Just use me as much as you want➡

562
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,837
I just threw it away because I didn't need it anymore.

563
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:08,339
You can only see what's in front of you.

564
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,843
I don't think it will work out even if I think about the future.

565
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,843
Because... that's what life was like.

566
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:20,348
That's why people like me take advantage of them.

567
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,858
But Hachi doesn't want you to do that.

568
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,358
Why can't you understand that?

569
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:34,365
Idiots should think like idiots.

570
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:36,868
It's not about the alcohol tonight➡

571
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,868
1 year later 3 years later 5 years later.

572
00:35:43,374 --> 00:35:44,876
See you then.

573
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,878
Eh...!

574
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:49,881
Mr. Gan! Ugh...! Wow! Hey hey...! what!

575
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:51,382
a?

576
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,885
Won't you help me?

577
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:58,389
I also started thinking about my own life.

578
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:00,391
Let's think about it together.

579
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:04,395
When it comes to finding yourself, is it traveling alone?

580
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,330
Say hello to Hachi.

But why at that time?

604
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:41,781
Didn't you take Yui's hand back?

605
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,789
The president is really➡

606
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:48,792
Were you planning to take advantage of Yui?

607
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,792
Did you come here to say that?

608
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:56,300
Get out.

Could you please give me just a little bit of your time?

Ah...!

618
00:39:36,773 --> 00:39:39,776
What's the point? That's it.

619
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,780
You haven't been here forever, have you?

620
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,783
Yes, I started working.

621
00:39:46,783 --> 00:39:49,786
Ha!? I live-in at a Western food restaurant.

622
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:51,788
Live-in? Yeah.

623
00:39:51,788 --> 00:39:54,791
A woman named Mickey is doing it all by herself➡

624
00:39:54,791 --> 00:39:56,793
Probably an ally.

625
00:39:56,793 --> 00:40:00,297
No. What color? Why don't you touch it?

626
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,300
Hmm, it felt like something I'd never seen before.

627
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:07,804
Among the gentle greens, there are also dark greens.

628
00:40:07,804 --> 00:40:10,807
Can't you trust me?

629
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:13,810
He's a very kind person.

630
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,813
But something difficult happened➡

631
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:19,816
I blame myself so much.

632
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:24,321
I thought there might be a pattern where it becomes darker.

633
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,324
Maybe he's lying.

634
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:29,326
Yeah….

635
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:32,326
Well, maybe that's the time.

636
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:41,833
At that time, Yui came to meet the president on her own.

637
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Because I wanted to believe in the president.

638
00:40:48,345 --> 00:40:51,348
But...

639
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,348
Were you scared?

640
00:40:57,854 --> 00:41:01,358
Is it because they are not related by blood?

641
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:03,360
Ha...

642
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,862
Who would do something like that?

643
00:41:05,862 --> 00:41:09,862
The president doesn't have the power of "Satori", does he?

644
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:14,368
But Yui has one.

645
00:41:16,873 --> 00:41:19,876
Yui's biological father is ➡

646
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:22,876
Isn't it Kyoichi Yagami? Enough!!

647
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:29,383
you don't understand anything

648
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,388
I don't understand.

649
00:41:35,892 --> 00:41:39,292
Even if I want to understand... I don't understand.

650
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:44,832
President, do you understand?

651
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:49,339
Yui is now➡

652
00:41:49,339 --> 00:41:51,839
How do you feel about running away?

653
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:01,347
I couldn't thank Linda.

654
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:06,356
If I had run away by myself➡

655
00:42:06,356 --> 00:42:09,356
My dad would have caught me long ago.

656
00:42:11,361 --> 00:42:15,365
I was also able to meet Gan-san and Riri-chan➡

657
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:17,365
It's all thanks to Linda.

658
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,371
After talking to dad...

659
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,876
I felt glad that I wasn't alone.

660
00:42:32,382 --> 00:42:34,384
If you don't see a doctor➡

661
00:42:34,384 --> 00:42:36,820
I don't know what happened by now.

662
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:45,329

I'm lucky to meet you.

666
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:12,856
I believed in the president.

667
00:43:12,856 --> 00:43:16,856
No... I still want to believe!

668
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:20,364
I attached GPS to Yui➡

669
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:24,368
The one who made me watch him 24/7➡

670
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:26,868
It's out of love, right?

671
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,872
Because she's my precious only daughter.

My beloved wife➡

673
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,816
Because it's a forgotten keepsake.

674
00:43:39,816 --> 00:43:42,819
And ➡

675
00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:45,322
The power of “Satori”➡

676
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:48,322
To avoid being misused by someone else.

677
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:53,830

678
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:55,832
Yui's power for the company➡

679
00:43:55,832 --> 00:43:58,832
It just looks like they're trying to take advantage of it.

680

What we need is a president➡

681
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,843
Are you Yui?

682
00:44:06,843 --> 00:44:09,843
Or is it the power of “Satori”?

683
00:44:12,849 --> 00:44:15,852
Even the president is a victim, right?

684
00:44:15,852 --> 00:44:17,854
If you tell the truth and clear up misunderstandings➡

685
00:44:17,854 --> 00:44:19,856
Even Yui-san...! You're saying that's enough!

686

Huh...

687
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,862
Even Yui has the right to know!!

688
00:44:25,862 --> 00:44:27,862
Don't interfere in my affairs!

It's a little bit of a sermon, though.

704
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,328
I am aware of it.

708

00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,834
I guess I won't be able to eat this for a while.

724
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,836
Are you a genius?

I was wondering if you could give me some advice.

739
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:36,346
