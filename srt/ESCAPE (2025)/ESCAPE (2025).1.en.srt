Hurry up. Wait a moment.

372
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
How many units do you have? The same car will do.

Are you trying to contact a friend? ah.

378

Haven't you heard from us? Something might have happened.

379

You mean your friend did it?

380
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Since he's a kidnapper, it wouldn't be surprising if he was caught.

381
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,000
In any case, if someone sees you riding it, you'll get suspicious.

If you pick it up with a drone and put it on the back of this guy➡

386
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,000
Your chances of being tracked will be much lower.

387

I was thinking about it quite a bit...

388
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'm going to pick up the money. What if that person was caught?

389
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,500
The plan may have gone awry.

390

I'm not hiding it! Don't lie!

406
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Just imagine it.

407

That GPS➡

408

Don't get carried away, it's 300 million.

Hey, what are you going to do after this?

416

418
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,500
I'm leaving Tokyo for now. For now?

Eh, where were you planning to go after taking the money?

420

I was contacted, but... Oh, I'm sorry.

So... what is Saito's condition?

441
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Apparently it didn't help.

442
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The cause of death appears to be myocardial infarction.

443
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
is that so….

444
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,500
What kind of relationship do you have with Saito?

We were classmates at university and we did research together a long time ago.

Is that a capa over face? Huh? Don't mess with me.

542
00:36:35,566 --> 00:36:38,066
Well then, I'll call you "Hachi".

543
00:36:38,066 --> 00:36:41,066
picture? Yagami's "eight" means Hachi.

544
00:36:41,066 --> 00:36:44,566
Something... it's not a dog from Shibuya.

545
00:36:44,566 --> 00:36:48,566
You look better than Yagami. Hey, Hachi.

546
00:36:48,566 --> 00:36:50,066
Something makes me angry.

547
00:36:50,066 --> 00:36:52,066
No, I guess I was just deciding what to call her.

548
00:36:52,066 --> 00:36:54,066
That's true, but... Hey.

549
00:36:54,066 --> 00:36:56,066
(Sound of clapping hands) Hachi.

550
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:58,066
Hachi-chan, your hands.

551
00:36:58,066 --> 00:37:00,566
Hachiko. ``Hachiko'' is different, right?

552
00:37:02,066 --> 00:37:05,066
(loudly) Dai Hayashida...! Ah! Hey!

553
00:37:05,066 --> 00:37:06,566
Stop it!

554
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:09,066
Because right now we have a shared destiny.

555
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,066
yes.

(Masaki) Hey...I wonder why this video isn't growing.

565
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:52,566
I'm sorry Maa-chan.

566
00:37:52,566 --> 00:37:54,566

569
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:01,066
(Anna) Because Komiyama is so noisy.

570
00:38:01,066 --> 00:38:02,566
Have you eaten?

571

(Akira) You look great. (Male) Thank you.

577
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:30,066
I'm happy to have met Aki-chan.

578
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,066

(Shiraki) Mr. Bandai.

00:38:48,066 --> 00:38:50,566
Which one are you? a….

582
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,566
(Shiraki) This is the kind of person I am.

583
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:03,566
What can you do?

584
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:07,566
Did something happen to Yui Yagami?

585
00:39:09,566 --> 00:39:14,066
I passed by Yagami Pharmaceutical today, but it was just a coincidence.

586
00:39:14,066 --> 00:39:16,066
Well, if I'm not mistaken➡

587
00:39:16,066 --> 00:39:18,066
The head of the criminal department came in.

588
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:22,566
After a while, he sneaked out with the president.

589
00:39:22,566 --> 00:39:25,066
I think something very special must have happened.

590
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:29,066
Yui-san, who you should always be clinging to, isn't there either.

591
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:33,066
Maybe he was kidnapped?

592
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,566
Is it different?

593
00:39:37,066 --> 00:39:39,066
Where is Yui now?

594
00:39:39,066 --> 00:39:42,066
Please be quiet!

595
00:39:42,066 --> 00:39:45,066
If you were kidnapped, there should be a media agreement in place.

596
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:49,066
If that were the case, there would be no way for a reporter like you to appear.

597
00:39:49,066 --> 00:39:53,066
Of course, I'm not planning on writing an article right away.

598
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:56,566
It seems like nothing has been resolved yet.

599
00:39:56,566 --> 00:40:02,066
Bandai-san seems to be in trouble, so I thought I'd help her out.

600
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:05,566
Well, if you think you can't leave it to the police alone➡

601
00:40:05,566 --> 00:40:07,566
Please contact us.

602
00:40:14,566 --> 00:40:18,066
Why are you here?

603
00:40:18,066 --> 00:40:20,066
Me…➡

604
00:40:20,066 --> 00:40:25,066

606
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,566
I drive a little rough though.

607
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:38,566
That's okay.

608
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:41,566
Well, that doesn't really make any sense. What does it mean?

609
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:45,066
I guess he just wanted to dye his hair as a disguise.

610
00:40:45,066 --> 00:40:47,566
bad? It's not bad though.

611
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,566
If you want to change it flashy, you have to bleach it➡

612
00:40:49,566 --> 00:40:52,066
It won't change much. Is that so?

613
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:54,066
Well, I wish you'd bought that!

614
00:40:54,066 --> 00:40:56,566
Huh? It's my fault!

615
00:40:56,566 --> 00:40:59,566
I said it was the brightest.

616
00:41:02,566 --> 00:41:05,066
Isn't it going to change a bit? That's right!

617
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:10,066
Leave this on for 30 minutes and then rinse it off, so take me somewhere where I can wash my hair.

618
00:41:10,066 --> 00:41:13,066
Huh? Do you understand the current situation?

619
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:15,066
I know. It looks like too much fun.

620
00:41:15,066 --> 00:41:17,066
Does it look like fun? A lot!

621
00:41:17,066 --> 00:41:18,566
Huh?

00:41:18,566 --> 00:41:20,566

623
00:41:20,566 --> 00:41:23,066
Even so, I cannot despair of my father.

624
