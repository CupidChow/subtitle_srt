00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,000
(End with) Who?

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,500
(Daisuke) Shh!

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
<The daughter of the president of Yagami Pharmaceutical, one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the industry, has been kidnapped>

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,500
Is this... kidnapping?

6
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,000
Hey, it's 300 million.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,500
(Saito) I just want to make your father suffer, not money.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,000
<The main culprit is...>

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
<Ransom transaction...>

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
That GPS was kept on me like a criminal all the time, right?

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Who put it on? father.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
<Police and family are desperately searching for the young lady's whereabouts>

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not like I completely believed it. We're currently sharing a shared fate.

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,000
<No, you guys are being chased>

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Hey, has this changed color?

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Hasn't it changed?

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Also... because someone got stuck in a traffic jam➡

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I couldn't finish it for even 2 hours.

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What are you doing?

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Punk. Punk?

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,500
Did you try to take the ransom money and run away with that car?

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,000
Eh, ignore it?

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That's annoying. Well, let's try it. It seems impossible, right?

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Then shut up.

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
How can Linda?

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,000
Because it's a car shop.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Car shop... Hey.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Tsukasa: Who is the person you can trust in Utsunomiya?

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
mother.

30
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't you have a mother?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
picture? Have you looked into it?

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
That's what the old man said.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,500
My real mom died when she gave birth to me.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Ah...｡

35
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Aki-chan is...

36
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, that person was my maid➡

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Because he took care of everything for me ➡

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
When I was little, I really thought you were my mother.

39
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Ah, that's what it is. Yeah.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,500
I got married 4 years ago and went to Utsunomiya➡

41
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,000
But we've always kept in touch.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,500
He is still the person who worries about me the most.

43
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,000
number one? Yeah.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I think it's the best in the world.

45
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Much more so than my dad or aunt.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,500
When Aki-chan was there, there was no GPS.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I should have done this sooner.

49
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
picture?

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
That's right, let's go.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I want to meet Aki-chan soon.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,500
Let's go!

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Because Linda is lazy.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,500
It's because Hachi dyed his hair. It's because of the punk.

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
It's because of the traffic jam. What should we do?

56
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,000
What about home? i don't know.

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Tsk... ah!

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Where are you going? There's no choice but to wait.

59
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,500
Wait until morning? That's right.

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,000
Where? Is there any hotel where I can stay now?

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,500
So do you understand our position?

62
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,500
So what should we do?

63
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,500
I guess I decided to sleep in the car.

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,000
In the car... Wait, do you mean you sleep in the car? That's a big hit!

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Eh...! If you don't like it, sleep there!

66
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,000
No way!

67
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,000
It's night, so please be quiet!

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Because you're so noisy...!

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,500
(Investigator) We have not yet received any strong witness information.

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,500
Please wait until the next request from the criminal...

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,500
(Ebihara) Can you say such leisurely things?

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Find it as soon as possible! (All) Yes!

73
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,500
a! It hurts...!

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,500
He ran away.

75
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
Whoa...｡ (Rust...)

76
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Breakfast.

77
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You've only had coffee since yesterday.

78
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What about money?

79
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,500
Hey.

80
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,000
It's mine! Fufufu…｡

81
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sunglasses too!

82
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,000
Why didn't you run away?

83
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,500
Certainly. Huh? Are you an idiot?

84
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,000
I mean, isn't a ransom of 300 million yen cheap? It's me?

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're so confident. No, it's not about confidence.➡

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,500
Because it's the price of life. So how much should it be?

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Hmm...｡

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,500
At least 1 billion.

89
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Huh? It's too expensive.

90
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Why is the bee on this side too? Huh?

91
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,500
If you take the ransom money, Hachi will be sent home.

92
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:20,500
yeah? Wouldn't it be better if I just pretended to go home and split the money up?

93
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Are you a genius?

94
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:37,000
♬～

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Miss Hachi doesn't want to shake hands with me.

96
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,500
Ah spoon.

97
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey? Yes, I'll get it.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm going too.

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You won't run away, will you?

100
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,500
Wow.

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
Smartphone) (vibrating sound)

102
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,500
It's here...Smartphone) (vibration sound)

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
yes.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
This is Fuji from the Yagami Pharmaceutical president's office.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
What do you think after that? I still don't know where you are?

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The person you're with now is Joji Saito's friend, right?

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,500
We are actively investigating.

108
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,500
(Smartphone) Yui-san will definitely protect it.

109
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,000
thank you.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Sha... President.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Is this it? Takeharu Saito.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
president.

113
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:49,500
(Keishi) This address may not be what you expect...

114
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
ask.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,500
I will send it to Bandai.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,500
(Sound of door opening and closing)

117
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,000
Sigh~ So, Aki-chan and her husband run a coffee shop.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,500
Yes, it was a dream for both of us.

119
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:06,500
Is it elegant? Elegant?

120
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Ah, it's open!

121
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,000
Please excuse me. (Female) Yes.

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,500
My name is Yui Yagami.

123
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:17,000
Akira Jonouchi works here...

124
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,500
Look up "Papillon d'Orange." What is it?

125
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
Hey... hey! Saito Motors?

126
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
A different “Papillon d’Orange”! Hey….

127
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
What is that? What is that?

128
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,500
Aki-chan, don't you like it? It's this way.

129
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Hey, are you listening?

130
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,000
Divorced and now “Papillon d’Orange”➡

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
He must be working at a patisserie called.

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Dad...speak in Japanese.

133
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,500
(chime)

134
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,000
Hello, this is Shiraki from Weekly Shinryu.

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,500
(Bandai) Why?

136
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,500
Huh... who lives here?

137
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,000
Were you following me?

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Ah, it's open!

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,500
Is Akira Jonouchi here? picture?

140
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,000
Ah, sorry, I was looking for someone.

141
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,500
Ah. Ah, I apologize.

142
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
My name is Yui Yagami.

143
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
If Akira Jonouchi is here➡

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Could you please let me know that I'm here?

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
Ah... please wait a moment.

146
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,500
Looks like a hit. Right?

147
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,500
Otherwise, it would just be "not there".

148
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
That's right.

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
(Akira) Yui-chan! Aki-chan!

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,500
She has completely become a big sister. Hehehe...

151
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,500
You changed your hair color. I see!

152
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,000
I thought Aki-chan would understand.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What happened suddenly? I understand this place well.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Ah, you see, I'm currently traveling with this person without making any decisions.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,500
I really want to meet Aki-chan.

156
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Keishi-san forgave me well. I'm already twenty years old.

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Ah, I see, you're 20 years old. Hehehe...

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
She should be a big sister.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,500
Ah...!

160
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,000
Ah, sorry, I have to go back to work.

161
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,500
Ah, I see. Until what time do you work?

162
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
It's 6 o'clock...

163
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Can I go home later? Ah...｡

164
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Ah, welcome.

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll come back later. Ah...

166
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,500
It's a waste of time to follow me.

167
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,500
Did you know that there are apparently two accomplices?

168
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,500
Saito used a highly confidential app called “EE-CHAT”➡

169
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,500
It seems like he was in contact with both of them.

170
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Does anyone know? Who lives here?

171
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,000
Did you give this information?

172
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,500
This is Saito. That lie is cheating.

173
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,000
Saito lives on the second floor of Saito Motors.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Are you in contact with your family?

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
family?

176
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm just teaching you.

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,500
This is the apartment where Saito lived 20 years ago.

178
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,000
Did you come here to check just in case?

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
So who lives there now?

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm not here so I don't know. You haven't tweeted.

181
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So...

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What about your accomplice and your family?

183
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The identity of the accomplice is not yet known.

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,500
It's you...! “I don’t know yet” ➡

185
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,500
It's important information.

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Also, Saito is single.

187
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,500
I'm sure they got divorced.

188
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,500
That incident was the trigger. That incident?

189
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Oh, I see, my ex-wife lives there➡

190
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Is there a possibility that...? What about that matter?

191
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
What do you do now? Will you wait here?

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,900
My ex-wife's... That's why...

193
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
that!

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm sorry for suddenly being rude.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
She was married to Joji Saito➡

196
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you Etsuko?

197
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,500
(Etsuko) Which one?

198
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm not tweeting.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Telephone) (Ring tone)

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,500
Oh old man...

201
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Phone) (Response message: Saito's voice) Thank you for calling.

202
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,000
(Telephone) If you have any problems with your car, leave it to us at Saito Motors.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,500
Telephone) During business hours…｡

204
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,500
What will you do for the next 8 hours?

205
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,000
Are bees smart?

206
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
what? Suddenly. No...

207
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,900
I was wondering how I could receive 1 billion.

208
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Hmm...｡

209
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Hmm, as expected➡

210
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,000
Isn't physics tough? Buzz?

211
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,500
It's so heavy that you can't even hold it in your hands, right?

212
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,000
Carry it so that no one can find it...

213
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
When it comes to electronic money and crypto assets, weight and volume don't matter.

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Hmm... No, but that kind of money➡

215
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Does it leave any information about who it passed from to whom?

216
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,500
An overseas server? Isn't there something you'd like to go through?

217
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't understand. What, you don't understand!

218
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're the type who studies seriously, aren't you?

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
Schools don't teach people how to commit crimes.

220
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
So, was there anything useful?

221
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,000
Hmm... I can't think of anything right away, though➡

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,500
I think so. I don't think so.

223
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Hmmm~ Why don't you work hard? Huh?

224
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Your body looks healthy➡

225
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Isn't that better than crossing a dangerous bridge?

226
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,000
I was working diligently until the day before yesterday. Why don't I go back?

227
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I'll make it in time now.

228
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
I was working with my old man.

229
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,500
A car shop?

230
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Ah, Saito Motors?

231
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,000
That kind of thing...

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
(Etsuko) I heard that Saito and his friends committed a kidnapping incident.

233
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,500
Ha... that's true.

234
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I can't believe he died.

235
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm sorry... Saito did something outrageous.

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,500
Have you been in touch with Mr. Saito?

237
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,000
No, it's been many years.

238
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,500
sorry.

239
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,000
Are you alone in that apartment?

240
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
yes.

241
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,500
Excuse me, but what about your daughter?

242
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
A girl called Natsuki-san...

243
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,000
Bandai-san.

244
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,000
Natsuki passed away over 20 years ago.

245
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,000
Sorry, I don't remember...

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Do you recognize Mr. Saito's friends?

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,500
sorry….

248
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
What's the motive?

249
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Apparently it's related to that incident from 27 years ago.

250
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,500
Saito was said to have suffered from heart problems.

251
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,500
The last thing I want to do when I know I have a long way to go➡

252
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Was it revenge against Yagami Pharmaceutical?

253
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,400
revenge?

254
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,000
(Shiraki) You're glad I'm here, aren't you?

255
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,500
What was that thing 27 years ago?

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Thank you for waiting. Thank you for your hard work.

257
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,500
Let's all eat this later. Oh, we did it!

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,000
Let me make dinner that we also bought.

259
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
All my assets... Yui-chan, will you make it for me?

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Aki-chan prepares the food.

261
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Hey, I’m looking forward to it. Hehehe…｡

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,500
Over there, over there.

263
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,500
Wait a moment, I'll clean it up right away.

264
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Ah, I'm sorry for rushing in so suddenly.

265
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,000
Ugh.

266
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
It feels so close.

267
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,000
picture? no….

268
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I think he lives in a more stylish apartment.

269
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What's that? I don't know anything about Aki-chan.

270
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Sorry. Yes.

271
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,000
Phew~｡

272
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,000
Aki-chan, do you have children?

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Ah, now that I think about it… Huh? forget? that.

274
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No, the topic of children hasn't come up at all lately.

275
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,000
Hey this...

276
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,000
nostalgic!

277
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,500
Don't stop. What if I break it? it's okay!

278
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay...｡

279
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Wow, that's annoying!

280
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,500
Ah, I see.

281
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
My long legs are a nuisance.

282
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Hey.

283
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Good evening～｡ Good evening...｡

284
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm a friend of the family here.

285
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you for waiting. Still...

286
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Ah. (Female) I'm sorry.

287
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,500
Sorry, sorry. No, not at all.

288
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,000
Sorry for the mess. No, sorry for bothering you.

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,500
Come in, come in. I'll bother you.

290
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
I'll put it here. Yes, please.

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
(crystal) star.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,500
Please say hello to your sister and brother.

293
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Oops... osu.

294
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
I'm...

295
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Ah, Linda, this is Hachi.

296
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,000
Good evening.

297
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Hoshi Do you like cars?

298
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,500
This is a car.

299
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,500
(Yui: Akira: Daisuke) Good luck.

300
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,500
Hey, Kanpai.

301
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,000
yes.

302
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,500
(Akira) What do you think? delicious!

303
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,000
I hope the day will come when I can have a drink with Yui-chan.

304
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,500
This is about to happen...

305
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Ah. Ah.

306
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:59,500
This is all I have. Can I go? I can go.

307
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,000
Shall we do it together like this?

308
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,500
yes.

309
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
(Yui: Daisuke) Oh! (Akira) Oh, you're so good at it.

310
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Yay!

311
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What's the matter? You're in a bad mood.

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Hehe.

313
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:27,000
Ah, I have to make the sauce. Sauce? Isn't it just sauce and mayo?

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,500
yeah? Do you think I'm making okonomiyaki?

315
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,000
teeth? Is it wrong? It's chijimi.

316
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What's that? I thought it was extremely thin.

317
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I haven't bought okonomiyaki powder.

318
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,500
Don't even buy pancake powder. If you don't know, will you please shut up?

319
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,000
Don't make a fool of yourself. I haven't.

320
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,500
You're doing it...! Look, look!

321
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Are you going to make the sauce? it was.

322
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Do you have roasted sesame seeds? (Akira) I think so.

323
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Is this it?

324
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I think it's about time to ask. Huh?

325
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Linda, are you dating?

326
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Ah... yeah. Hehehe...｡

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,500
picture? Did you meet at university? Yeah.

328
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,000
What do you like about it?

329
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,500
No, don't ask me that anymore.

330
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah, that's my type of guy who looks a bit evil.

331
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,500
That's enough~. (Akira) Hehehe.

332
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Do you know Hoshihasa Chijimi?

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I don't understand.

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
What is your favorite food?

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
(Star) Yogut.

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I see. Do you like yogurt?

337
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Huh...

338
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Haven't you found it yet?

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
It would probably be a lot different if there was a public investigation...

340
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
(knock)

341
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's Bandai.

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,500
Please come in.

343
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Excuse me.

344
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,000
What do you think? Did you find out anything?

345
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
president.

346
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,500
I have something I would like to ask you.

347
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,000
What?

348
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,000
Do you know Natsuki Saito?

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:30,000
♬～

350
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
(Sound of door opening and closing)

351
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,400
Huh…｡

352
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,500
A long time ago, I went to a festival without telling my dad.

353
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:46,000
Did you remember? Hehe... I remember.

354
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,500
The yakisoba I ate at the food stall that time was so delicious➡

355
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,000
I asked Aki-chan to make it the next day too.

356
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,500
Hehe... I couldn't do it the same way ➡

357
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,000
He was really happy.

358
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,500
Hey, it's dangerous if you get too close to this.

359
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,000
yes.

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Oh! Looks delicious.

361
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,500
Yeah.

362
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,000
I'll enjoy having this.

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Itadakimasu. Itadakimasu.

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,500
Masu.

365
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,500
Hoshi Fu~fu~ Let's do it.

366
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,000
(sound of breathing)

367
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,500
(Sound of breathing) Yeah, yeah...

368
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,000
Hmm!

369

370

371
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,000
Huh? what up?

372
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
picture? Ah... Huh?

373
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I wonder why... Ehehehe...｡

374
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Hmm... What is this? Hehe...｡

375
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,500
Aha...

376
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,000
I'll have it.

377
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,500
Yeah!

378
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Yeah.

379
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
(Akira) Hehe...｡ Hehehe.

380
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,000
To save Natsuki who was suffering from an incurable disease➡

381
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,500
Saito, who was a researcher at the time,➡

382
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:39,000
He seems to be working hard to develop new drugs.

383
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,000
Ou! Saito!

384
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Are you going out? It's okay, it's okay.

385
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Eh, you... Hehe...!

386
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,500
Did you really make it? ah…!

387
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
That's great! Good! Hahahaha…!

388
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Now I can finally proceed with the clinical trial! Oh!

389
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,000
Natsuki-chan, that's so helpful. Ah!

390
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,500
How about that?

391
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,500
I talked to the president and he seems quite enthusiastic about it.

392
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,500
President Yagami? So, if you don't mind➡

393
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,000
Would you like to team up with us from now on?

394
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,500
I can't even hope!

395
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:21,000
Anyway, I want Natsuki to be able to use this medicine as soon as possible.

396
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
ask! Oh, leave it to me!

397
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,500
Hahahaha…! Hahahaha…!

398
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:29,000
(Bandai) However, Natsuki passed away a year later.

399
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,500
Saito got divorced and returned to his parents' home.

400
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:37,500
The medicine that was supposed to save Natsuki is➡

401
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,500
For the benefit of Yagami Pharmaceutical➡

402
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,000
Overseas approval is given priority➡

403
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It seems that domestic drug approval has been delayed for several years.

404
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,500
After that ➡

405
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,000
The president achieved an unusual career advancement➡

406
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
He became the successor of Yagami Pharmaceutical.

407
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Did the president know?

408
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:14,000
♬～

409
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,000
(Secretary) President Yagami was here.

410
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,500
(Kyoichi) Are you Keishi Tachibana?

411
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,000
Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule.

412
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,500
I would like to thank you very much for your special arrangements regarding the new drug.

413
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,500
wonderful.

414
00:24:48,500 --> 00:25:07,000

415
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,500
president.

416
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,000
Is there anyone who has suffered the same way as Saito?

417
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Also at Yagami Pharmaceutical ➡

418
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,500
Is there a dark side to it?

419
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
darkness?

420
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,500
There's no such thing.

421
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
It's been over 30 hours already.

422
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
It seems like I've only heard old stories, but what I want to know is information about Yui.

423
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,500
I'll leave it up to you to decide how you want to spend your money and cars however you like.

424
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Bring Yui back as soon as possible.

425
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
yes.

426
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:58,000
(Akira) Does Keishi know? About Linda.

427
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Ah...｡

428
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
Ah, you can't say that, it's your father.

429
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Are you a scary person?

430
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,500
(Akira) Hmm, I'm not usually scared, but➡

431
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,500
What if Yui-chan brought her boyfriend with her?

432
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,000
I guess I can't do it. (Akira) If I'm not good at it➡

433
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Dad might say it's no good unless it's someone he found.

434
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,500
Are you serious... Yabba, young lady.

435
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Aki-chan. Huh?

436
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,000
Actually, I ran away.

437
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
picture?

438
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,500
Aki-chan disappeared and someone named Bandai came in her place➡

439
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
I started being watched all the time.

440
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,500
Surveillance? Yeah.

441
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,500
It follows me wherever I go.

442
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,000
I couldn't go out with my friends, so I tried spraying it a few times.➡

443
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,500
Found and brought back.

444
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,000
GPS can now be attached.

445
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,500
ＧＰＳ？

446
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,500
Like a criminal.

447
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,000
It's to protect me.

448
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:17,500
But, if you listen to what your dad says, you can do a lot of things, right?

449
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,000
I can do work that helps people.

450
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Every day is unreliable and there is nothing I can do about it➡

451
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
There are so many people who are having a hard time➡

452
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,500
This is what my life is like this time I can live freely in the next life➡

453
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,000
That's what I was thinking...

454
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Yeah... I didn't like it after all, so I broke my GPS.

455
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
But I think I'll find it soon.

456
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,500
If they are found, they will definitely be brought back.

457
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,000
This person isn't even a boyfriend or anything.

458
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Hey! Oh... What should I say...

459
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,500
He's like a driver hired for money, right?

460
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,000
Ah... yes.

461
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Aki-chan

462
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Please help me.

463
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,500
Aki-chan is the only one I have.

464
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:29,500
♬～

465
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,500
I understand.

466
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:37,500
I can't let you live like before, but ➡

467
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,000
Do you want to live together here?

468
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Is it okay?

469
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,500
Yeah, of course.

470
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,500
First, let's go to the beauty salon together.

471
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:55,500
I think I'll dye my hair the same color as Yui-chan.

472
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Hehe…｡ (Akira) Hehe…｡

473
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,000
Yeah.

474
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,500
That's fine hehehe...

475
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Smartphone) (reception sound) Ah.

476
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,000
Ah... I'm sorry.

477
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I wonder if I can come out for a little while. Oh yeah, of course.

478
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,500
Wow, that's a different story. What?

479
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,000
Shouldn't they have taken the ransom money and split it up?

480
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
What do you mean, living here? Give up and break up here.

481
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Don't worry, you're really a driver, aren't you?

482
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Understood, I'll pay for your part-time job.

483
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Huh!? Did you have that intention from the beginning...?

484
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
You fooled me. Police: You can go.

485
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Aki-chan is looking at my face➡

486
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Wouldn't it be better to stay quiet and withdraw?

487
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,500
Then I'll go see your father too.

488
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
yes? It tickles me that you're here.

489
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,000
It's the worst. You're the worst.

490
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Think carefully, even if we broke up with each other➡

491
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Which do you think causes more damage?

492
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Linda is going to be arrested, is that okay?

493
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
That's no good.

494
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,500
Sorry, I'll be right back.

495
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,000
Yes, come on. (Akira) I'll go.

496
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
He's a man. Don't call him a boyfriend.

497
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
No, you're the host. Stop it.

498
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Okay, so how about this?

499
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
a? Part-time job fee.

500
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
10,000⁉ Don't give up. Hehehe...｡

501
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Okay, 50,000 then.

502
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,500
Well, I guess it would be a good idea to pay for two days' worth of part-time work.

503
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,000
no! I was supposed to get 500 million.

504
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
That world line no longer exists. But...!

505
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,500
It wasn't for the money, was it? That's the old man...

506
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,500
You can't contact that old man, can you?

507
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,000
It has nothing to do with Hachi... For Linda ➡

508
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,500
You're like your father, aren't you?

509
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
What time will Aki-chan come back?

510
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You're not coming back. Don't say things like that.

511
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Hey Hoshi, don't sleep.

512
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,500
Let's go take a bath.

513
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,000
Let's make it beautiful.

514
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Please come. I'll come.

515
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,500
Let's go... push...

516
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Brrrrrr…! Drurururu...! Ahahaha…!

517
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:04,500
Boom boom! Ahaha! Ahaha...!

518
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
Dishcloth...

519
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,500
Wow!

520
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,500
(Voice of Daisuke and Hoshi playing together)

521
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:43,000
(star laughter)

522
00:31:52,433 --> 00:31:54,433
<The “ESCAPE” you are watching is all the episodes so far➡

523
00:31:54,433 --> 00:31:55,933
Now streaming on TVer Hulu>

524
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:58,433
＜Wow, then you can still catch up on all the episodes with the free TVer➡

525
00:31:58,433 --> 00:32:00,933
You can even say...> <Thank you in advance>

526
00:32:00,933 --> 00:32:03,933
<Convenient "favorite registration" too! ＞ <Moo~ Isn't that cheating? ＞

527
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:14,933
If you live here, you'll be like my younger brother.

528
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,433
Be sure to protect the bees.

529
00:32:18,433 --> 00:32:20,433
protect?

530
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,433
When we came➡

531
00:32:26,433 --> 00:32:28,933
It's strange that he was the only one here.

532
00:32:31,433 --> 00:32:33,933
Think carefully.

533
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:36,933
If your single mother is working➡

534
00:32:36,933 --> 00:32:38,933
Leave it at a nursery school or somewhere ➡

535
00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,433
Isn't it something you pick up after work?

536
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:47,433
Does that mean you've been here all alone?

537
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:50,433
I probably haven't taken a bath for a few days.

538
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:52,433
My nails are growing too.

539
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:55,933
Do you suspect that Aki-chan is abusing you or something?

540
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:59,433
I didn't have any bruises or injuries on my body, but that's not the case, right?

541
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:01,933
Should I raise my hand?

542
00:33:03,433 --> 00:33:07,933
Do you think he would be here now if we weren't there?

543
00:33:09,433 --> 00:33:13,933
Refuse the man's invitation and go to the stars.

544
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,433
I'm going to sleep.

545
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,433
I'm grateful for the simplicity of not being able to lie down.

I'll get paid for my part-time job and disappear. That's right...

Ah. Ah?

563
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:24,433
I don't have anything, neither my smartphone nor my cash card.

564
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:30,433
teeth? What should I do? I forgot about that.

565
00:35:30,433 --> 00:35:31,933
Ah.

566
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:34,433
Can't you withdraw money using a smartphone app?

567
00:35:36,433 --> 00:35:38,933
Maybe I can go.

568
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:42,933
I'm a genius after all.

569
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,933
Hmm... it hurts.

570
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:49,433
You won't regret it, right? regret?

571
00:35:49,433 --> 00:35:52,933
I don't trust that person though.

572
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:56,433
I know Aki-chan better than me.

573
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:58,433
I was refused a hug though.

574
00:35:58,433 --> 00:35:59,933
((Ah...!))

00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:01,433

I haven't been rejected at all. Is that so?

577
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:05,433
You just didn't notice.

578
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:07,433
Do you know how I felt when my handshake was rejected?

579
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:10,933
That's why I haven't been rejected.

580
00:36:10,933 --> 00:36:12,933

590
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:53,433
They say things like, ``50,000 yen is enough for two days' part-time work.''

Don't be silly. It hurts...

Yui-chan! Where have you been? I said goodbye to the driver.

601
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,933
Eh, with Linda? Yeah.

602
00:37:51,933 --> 00:37:54,933
Yeah... I'm back.

603
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:58,933
Why are you sad? It's just a part-time job.

604
00:38:07,066 --> 00:38:09,066
Huh? What about the stars?

605
00:38:09,066 --> 00:38:13,066
Ah... I'm playing outside now. Ah, that's right.

606
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:15,066
Hey Aki-chan, are you working today?

607
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:17,066
Today is a day off. Oh really?

608
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:19,566
Well then, why don't you go out somewhere? Star and the three of us.

609
00:38:19,566 --> 00:38:21,066
Ah...｡

610
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:24,566
Hoshi: I don't really like going out.

00:38:24,566 --> 00:38:26,566
Hey, that's right...

612
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:36,066
Hey, Yui-chan, why don't you think about your future?

613
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:38,066
Ah, that's right.

614
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:40,066
Ah, can you go buy a smartphone with me?

615
00:38:40,066 --> 00:38:42,566
Okay but...

616
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:45,066
Didn't you need an ID or something?

617
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:47,566
Ah, certainly.

618
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:51,066
Will they reissue my license?

619
00:38:51,066 --> 00:38:52,566
What do you think?

620
00:38:52,566 --> 00:38:57,066
Before that, what should I do with the money? You left everything behind, right?

621
00:38:57,066 --> 00:38:59,566
Ah... I'm sorry.

622
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:02,066
That's not what I meant.

623
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:04,566
Hey, it's been a long time since I met you➡

624
00:39:04,566 --> 00:39:08,566
Would you like to relax at home today? There are stories that will accumulate, right?

625
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:16,566
Huh... Why is the lower road so crowded?

626
00:39:16,566 --> 00:39:19,566
Looks like they're doing an interrogation ahead.

627
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,066

Eh, where?

631
00:39:38,566 --> 00:39:41,066
I mean, I don't want to go out...

632
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:44,066
It's like they're trying not to let me go out.

633
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:46,566
There's nothing like that.

634
00:39:46,566 --> 00:39:48,566
Oh... Would you like something to drink?

635
00:39:48,566 --> 00:39:50,066
Hey.

Hey, what is this?

646
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,566
Aren't you raising your stars properly?

647
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:40,566
That's... Why did it change?

648
00:40:40,566 --> 00:40:43,066

Huh...

650
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:54,566
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

651
00:40:56,066 --> 00:41:00,066
I didn't know that he wasn't interested in children.

652
00:41:01,566 --> 00:41:05,066
The more desperate I become to keep the stars from dying➡

653
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:08,566
I never thought that that person's feelings would leave me.

654
00:41:11,066 --> 00:41:13,066
I took the money and ran away.

655
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:15,566
Leave me and the stars.

656
00:41:17,566 --> 00:41:21,066
It's tough living with two children.

657
00:41:21,066 --> 00:41:23,066
Don't use the stars as an excuse.

658
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:26,066
Who did you go to see yesterday?

659
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,566
Isn't it okay for mothers to like other people?

660
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:33,066
Did you sell me for that person?

661
00:41:33,066 --> 00:41:35,066
different.

662
00:41:35,066 --> 00:41:41,066
Star and... the three of us need money to survive.

663
00:41:41,066 --> 00:41:45,066
It was fun...I had fun too.

664
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:48,066
I seriously thought we could live together.

665
00:41:48,066 --> 00:41:50,566
But... But?

666
00:41:56,066 --> 00:41:59,066
It's not necessary... That's right.

667
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:06,066
I want to do it again this time.

668
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:10,566
