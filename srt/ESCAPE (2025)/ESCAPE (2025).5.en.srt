1
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:07,507
(Keishi) My daughter Yui Yagami➡

2
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,510
In the afternoon of October 28th➡

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,512
I was kidnapped.

4
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:16,516
(Camera shutter sound) Today is the fourth day.

5
00:00:16,516 --> 00:00:20,019
Screen) I hope there is even the slightest clue➡

6
00:00:20,019 --> 00:00:23,022
We have launched a special website➡

7
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:27,026
We received a lot of information.

8
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,028
(Screen) But still...

9
00:00:29,028 --> 00:00:31,030
(Daisuke) Is this possible?

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,533
(Gun) Hachipapa is too funny.

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,035
screen) Right now, while I'm doing this➡

12
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:40,540
I wonder how scared you feel...

13
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,043
(camera shutter sound) screen) (coughs)

14
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,045
Screen) Sorry.

15
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,548
screen) (camera shutter sound)

16
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,050
Screen) Yui.

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:55,054
Screen) Are you having a hard time?

18
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:58,057
Screen) How are you feeling?

19
00:00:58,057 --> 00:01:01,060
Screen) Did you eat dinner?

20
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,997
Screen) Dad is➡

21
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:06,997
I'll be waiting for your return.

22
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,502
screen) Then...

23
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:16,509
Screen) Daisuke Hayashida.

24
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:20,013
Wow. Screen) Are you watching?

25
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:23,016
Screen) Please return my daughter.

26
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,018
Screen) This is it.

27
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:27,020
screen) (camera shutter sound) (sound of tapping on the shoulder)

28
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,023
Celebrity.

29
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,026
Screen) Hayashida-kun.

30
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,026
(Screen) Should I say "Linda-kun"?

31
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:42,535
(Screen) Can we meet together with Yui?

32
00:01:42,535 --> 00:01:45,538
Did you come like that?

33
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:51,044
Screen) 4pm on the 3rd day after tomorrow ➡

34
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:53,546
When Yui was little➡

35
00:01:53,546 --> 00:01:57,550
In the place where we often practiced together➡

36
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:00,553
I'm waiting.

37
00:02:00,553 --> 00:02:03,490
(Screen) I already know the location.

38
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,494
(Screen) I won't tell the police, and of course I won't tell the media either.

39
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,497
What are you saying, old man?

40
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:13,500
(Screen) We will also pay you a fee.

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,002
Screen) Therefore➡

42
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:20,006
Please bring Yui.

43
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:23,009
Screen) Tomorrow all day➡

44
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,509
Please think carefully.

45
00:02:28,515 --> 00:02:30,517
Screen) I'm waiting.

46
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:38,024
♬～

47
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:41,528
Screen) I'll be waiting for you at 4pm on the 3rd tomorrow.

48
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:44,531
(Anna) I wish I was born here.

49
00:02:44,531 --> 00:02:48,031
(Ukai) I understand! Yui-chan I’m jealous!

50
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:54,040
(Customer) Hey, hey, it's a kidnapping. (Yamaguchi) Sorry to have kept you waiting.

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,544
(Sakagami) This is the first time I've ever seen the father directly address the criminal.

52
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,044
That's amazing!

53
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,992
(Ebihara) Let me tell you, Yagami and his son➡

54
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:15,495
I don't know what will happen to this place of memories!

55
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,497
(Miyazono) Huh? Haven't you been taught?

56
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,499
Yes, I haven't been told that. What is that?

57
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:21,501
Do you think it can be resolved without the police?

58
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,001
Ah, just let me do what I want! Yeah.

59
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:29,506
Hachi, do you know where it is?

60
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,514
(Yui) I think it's about Kinuta's dojo.

61
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,518
It was the only place where I practiced Aikido with my father.

62
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:41,018
Is it a place of memories?

63
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,528
Linda, what should we do? If you take me➡

64
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:51,531
You won't get caught and you'll get money. Oh?

65
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,533
If I get caught somewhere in the future➡

66
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,535
Linda will go to jail.

67
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,539
I can't rely on Mr. Gunn to help me for the rest of my life.

68
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:03,977
In that case, I think the best thing to do now is to do as my father says.

69
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,480
Even if the police were there, I would rather keep running away and get caught➡

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Wouldn't the punishment be lighter?

71
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,984
I guess that's why you didn't want to go home.

72
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,992
It's just a period of rebellion, isn't it?

73
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,994
Just pretend you're home once.

74
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:24,497
Once you've calmed down, I'll take a chance and run away by myself next time.

75
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,001
Do you seriously think you can do this?

76
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,503
Don't you get homesick looking at your father's face?

77
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:32,005
It hasn't happened! That's what happened!

78
00:04:32,005 --> 00:04:34,007
If it hasn't happened, what do you think...! (Riri) Wait, everyone➡

79
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:36,009
What are you talking about? What?

80
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,009
Wasn't it an elopement?

81
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:54,027
bad.

82
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,027
I was lying.

83
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:02,535
Actually, I kidnapped Hachi.

84
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,435
Kidnapping...?

85
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:08,975
At first, I was supposed to get 300 million in exchange for this guy.

86
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,477
picture…? Sorry for lying.

87
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,479
I wanted to escape, so I used Linda.

88
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:15,982
So I asked Riri-chan... (Riri) Wait, I don't understand.

89
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,985
You say you don't understand... Huh?

90
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,487
Does that mean the two of you weren't dating?

91
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,989
Yeah.

92
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,991
Is it kidnapping?

93
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,491
At first.

94
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,999
Tell me everything from the beginning.

95
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,003
My ex-boyfriend was a kidnapper and I hid him there without knowing it➡

96
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:42,008
I had such a fun time and now I'm panicking, Riri-chan.

97
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,008
Huh...

98
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,517
Do you remember Mr. Saito?

99
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,020
president? Big-chan's.

100
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah.

101
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,525
I heard it.

102
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,027
(Saito) What is the escape route?

103
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,962
(Yamaguchi) The cart will become heavier after the kidnapping...

104
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,465
(Saito) When security is weak... What is kidnapping?

105
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,972
(Saito) Were you there? Why did you do that?

106
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,974
I can help you if you tell me the reason.

107
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:16,976
(Yamaguchi) Don't come in without permission. I don't have any money to give you.

108
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:19,979
Money is fine, just a little bit. Don't get involved!

109
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,981
Forget everything you just heard.

110
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:24,484
Well then, before I forget, I'll go to the police. Daisuke!

111
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,986
There must be a very good reason why the old man was kidnapped.

112
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:29,989
That's why I'm helping you.

113
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:31,991
(Yamaguchi) Isn't that good? Yamaguchi-kun!

114
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:35,991
(Yamaguchi) I don't think I'll be able to move even if the police pick on me.

115
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:41,000
This is it➡

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,002
It's revenge.

117
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:49,008
We had something important stolen from us by Keishi Yagami.

118
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,511
revenge? Did you say that?

119
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,012
ah.

120
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,512
What did my father do?

121
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,020
Old man's daughter➡

122
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,458
Apparently, he died at the age of 4 because of Hachi's father.

123
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:07,460
picture….

124
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,963
Eh... why?

125
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:16,969
My father was originally working on drug development with your father➡

126
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,473
At that time, there was still no medicine to cure my daughter's illness.

127
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:25,978
That's why when you research hard and it's almost ready➡

128
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:29,478
Your father betrayed you and you're no good.

129
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:32,985
Why?

130
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:35,488
I don't know. When was that?

131
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,990
I don't know.

132
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,994
Ah... if I were alive now➡

133
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:44,494
He said it would be 30 this year.

134
00:07:45,998 --> 00:07:51,003
So before I was born...

135
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,003
Why now? It's been twenty years.

136
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:57,009
surely.

137
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,011
Don't you know? I helped you with that.

138
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,014
Because the old man was in bad shape➡

139
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:05,414
If that makes you feel better, just say it.

140
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,455
Isn't that it?

141
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:12,959
Let's do what we can do now?

142
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,962
In the end, I didn't get any money➡

143
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:19,966
For some reason, he continues to run away with hostages until now.

144
00:08:19,966 --> 00:08:22,969
It's true...

145
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:25,972
What is Saito-san doing now?

146
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:27,473
I don't understand.

147
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:33,479
On the way, I was found by someone from Hachi's family and I couldn't contact them from there.

148
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,981
Yui-chan.

149
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,984
I didn't ask, but what about your mother?

150
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:41,487
She died when she gave birth to me.

151
00:08:41,487 --> 00:08:43,487
I see...

152
00:08:44,991 --> 00:08:47,493
Who is your father➡

153
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:49,993
You had some good memories, right?

154
00:08:57,503 --> 00:09:00,006
Things have changed...

155
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:05,444
♬～

156
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:08,948
That's what I thought➡

157
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,451
I wonder if he was originally like that...

158
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:22,461
♬～

159
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,463
(Bandai) I don't have time.

160
00:09:24,463 --> 00:09:26,463
(Shiraki) But he met me.

161
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,471
(Shiraki) Are you in a hurry?

162
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,974
(Bandai) I just want to get Yui back as soon as possible.

163
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:37,977
Do you know where we practiced together?

164
00:09:37,977 --> 00:09:40,479
i don't know.

165
00:09:40,479 --> 00:09:42,982
President, didn't you tell me?

166
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,482
Even if you knew, you wouldn't say it.

167
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,986
Wait... what is it?

168
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,492
Huh…｡

169
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:56,996
I really haven't been taught anything.

170
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:58,998
I was away for a while.

171
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,498
Sendai.

172
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:08,504
Maybe they didn't even know they were going to hold a press conference?

173
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:14,013
Hehe... that makes you impatient.

174
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:16,515
After being sent to Sendai, I was out of bed.

175
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:18,517
Therefore...! I have no choice but to follow you.

176
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,019
Please stop! Then I'll stop!

177
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:22,019
You can't say that...

178
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:27,023
(Komiyama) I'll take it.

179
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:32,528
(Komiyama) In the end, it's a parent-child fight.

180
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,539
Shiraki-san, do you think Hayashida will bring Yui-san?

181
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:42,039
I don't understand.

182
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:52,051
Well, but if President Keishi and Yui meet again➡

183
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,054
I want to know what the two of you will say at that time.

184
00:10:55,054 --> 00:10:59,058
It's such a private thing. That's why it's so interesting, isn't it?

185
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,995
Ah, but if Yui-san came back like that➡

186
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,997
Will Bandai not be rewarded?

187
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,497
I've been looking all over the place until now.

188
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:12,004
It doesn't matter.

189
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,506
I'm in trouble.

190
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,506
I need Mr. Bandai to gain the trust of the president.

191
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:20,513
Yeah.

192
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,515
Well...

193
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,519
It's a match until 4 o'clock the next day.

194
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,519
Ah, the date has changed, so it's tomorrow.

195
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,528
Why are you so obsessed with this matter?

196
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:50,543
Bandai-san, have you ever met your predecessor, Kyoichi Yagami?

197
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,045
home.

198
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,545
That's a monster.

199
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,051
Just by looking at your face➡

200
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,554
Everything can be seen through➡

201
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,454
It's like being eaten up.

202
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,995
Hehe...

203
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,501
Me ➡

204
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:19,001
He is possessed by the ghost of Kyoichi Yagami.

205
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:28,013
(Sakagami) That's amazing, Daisuke Hayashida.

206
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:29,515
How much can I get?

207
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,517
(Yamaguchi) You won't get it, it's a trap.

208
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:36,522
(Sakagami) No, but what if the deal was actually completed without the police➡

209
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,025
Shouldn't it be a billion? (In a whisper) Please contact me...

210
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:43,028
picture? What? Don't play with it, clean it up!

211
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,030
I'm scared.

212
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,534
What? Are you going to fire me?

213
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,034
Lie, lie, lie…｡

214
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:54,039
Isn't it morning...

215
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:57,042
Oh...I don't even play a werewolf.

216
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,045
I can't help but laugh. Shall we do it now?

217
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:02,982
I'm hungry... let's eat breakfast.

218
00:13:02,982 --> 00:13:05,484
Don't borrow eggs. (Riri) Yeah.

219
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:08,988
(refrigerator opening/closing sound)

220
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,488
picture?

221
00:13:11,991 --> 00:13:13,991
what happened?

222
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:22,001
(Riri) Saito-san➡

223
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:25,004
He died.

224
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,506
teeth?

225
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:32,011
(Riri) ``The suspect, Takeharu Saito, who is believed to be one of the kidnapping group, is➡

226
00:13:32,011 --> 00:13:34,511
He died on the day of the incident."

227
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,532
Mr. Gan.

228
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:57,536
I want to contact the old man. (Gun) What did you say?

229
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:00,039
Do you know my contact information? Linda...

230
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,976
I don't have a cell phone, and my account was stolen.

231
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:06,476
Linda calm down... You're calm!

232
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:10,983
Saito is dead.

233
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:13,986
You heard that you have a heart problem, right?

234
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:15,986
I was listening but...

235
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,990
Huh?

236
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Did Gan know?

237
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,503
I knew.

238
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,510
I see.

239
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,524
(Sound of picking up chopsticks)

240
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,024
(sound of mixing eggs)

241
00:14:59,533 --> 00:15:02,035
(Masaki) I'm ready.

242
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,537
(Misaki) Huh?

243
00:15:03,537 --> 00:15:09,476
(Masaki) Challenge yourself to make the perfect 1000 kcal with Sendai souvenirs!

244
00:15:09,476 --> 00:15:12,479
I see... Misa➡

245
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:15,482
I know you're tired, but... No, that's not it.

246
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:17,985
come here for a second.

247
00:15:17,985 --> 00:15:20,988
I feel like this person resembles someone➡

248
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:23,488
I'm really confused.

249
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:28,495
Ah! Isn't that? “That”?

250
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,995
Ah!

251
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:34,001
((Cancelled today for now?))

252
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36,001
(2 people) A haunted spot!

253
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:41,008
Well then, I'll go.

254
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,508
Yes, please come.

255
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,516
There are, right?

256
00:15:49,516 --> 00:15:51,518
yeah?

257
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:56,018
You won't disappear while I'm out, right?

258
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:01,024
Yeah, I'll tell you exactly when I leave.

259
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,429
I'm coming.

260
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:11,971
(sound of door closing)

261
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,980
I might even use a vacuum cleaner...

262
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,980
How many times do you call?

263
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,503
Hey.

264
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,005
Why don't you go to Mr. Saito's funeral?

265
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:48,008
Huh? You really want to go, right?

266
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:50,010
There's no reason.

267
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,514
Who wants to look at a dead old man's face?

268
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:57,017
I don't even know when or where the funeral will be held.

269
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,520
If you do that, you'll be found and arrested right away.

270
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,522
I had Gan-san's help with that...

271
00:17:01,522 --> 00:17:03,522
That's fine.

272
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:08,459
The old man is alive inside me.

273
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:15,469
I'm bored.

274
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,970
Even Shiritori is fine.

275
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,973
Now, let's talk about Mr. Saito. Huh? Why?

276
00:17:19,973 --> 00:17:21,473
You have free time, right?

277
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,981
(Shhh…)

278
00:17:32,486 --> 00:17:33,986
please.

279
00:17:38,992 --> 00:17:41,495
correct answer! Seriously!?

280
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:46,500
I told you, you can do it.

281
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,003
Good luck on your exam tomorrow!

282
00:17:50,003 --> 00:17:52,005
Usu! Hahahaha…｡

283
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:55,008
test? Mechanic exam.

284
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:58,512
I was reluctant because I had to study ➡

285
00:17:58,512 --> 00:18:02,516
You're making a lot of noise, telling me to get a job.

286
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:05,018
It was noisy though➡

287
00:18:05,018 --> 00:18:09,022
I was happy. Don't tell me.

288
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:11,525
So? Did you pass the test?

289
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:14,027
That's a hit.

290
00:18:14,027 --> 00:18:16,027
I see.

291
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,533
Mr. Saito➡

292
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:23,533
I guess he was thinking about Linda's future.

293
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:31,044
What else?

294
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,044
Did you go somewhere together or eat something delicious?

295
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,552
Ah...｡

296
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,555
If it was really bad, I would eat it.

297
00:18:41,555 --> 00:18:46,059
My dad told me he couldn't make lunch, so I made this for the first time.

298
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,061
Peperoncino.

299
00:18:48,061 --> 00:18:54,568
Well...the noodles were hard and tasteless, so it was really bad.

300
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:59,072
But the old man was so kind that he forced himself to eat it all➡

301
00:18:59,072 --> 00:19:02,075
After that, I felt really unwell.

302
00:19:02,075 --> 00:19:05,012
Hehe... I feel sorry for him. No...

303
00:19:05,012 --> 00:19:08,512
I'm really sorry about that.

304
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,022
a….

305
00:19:15,022 --> 00:19:17,524
I'm going to have peperoncino for dinner today. I don't like it.

306
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,027
Revenge! I don't like it, please stop.

307
00:19:20,027 --> 00:19:22,029
Let me make it.

308
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:24,029
already….

309
00:19:29,036 --> 00:19:30,537
(knock)

310
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:33,040
Yes.

311
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,043
Mr. Gan.

312
00:19:36,043 --> 00:19:40,043
Do you know when Mr. Saito's funeral will be held?

313
00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:45,049
I would like to meet you for a moment.

314
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:49,556
Isn't it okay to visit a grave when the weather has cooled down?

315
00:19:49,556 --> 00:19:52,556
If you can see my face, isn't it better as long as I can see it?

316
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,569
Mr. Gan➡

317
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:06,006
You know Mr. Saito, right?

318
00:20:06,006 --> 00:20:08,508
Somehow.

319
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,011
Mr. Gan➡

320
00:20:11,011 --> 00:20:14,011
Don't you think it's better to say goodbye properly?

321
00:20:16,016 --> 00:20:20,520
If you weigh the risk of being caught, there's no room for consideration.

322
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,025
And even if Linda regrets it in the future➡

323
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:27,025
It has nothing to do with Hachi.

324
00:20:35,535 --> 00:20:39,035
400g is fine, right? Yeah... Oh, did you add salt?

325
00:20:51,051 --> 00:20:53,053
I'm home. (Yui: Daisuke) Welcome back.

326
00:20:53,053 --> 00:20:55,055
Good thing they were having fun fighting.

327
00:20:55,055 --> 00:20:58,058
Oh, is it Peperoncino tonight?

328
00:20:58,058 --> 00:21:00,058
Great answer~

329
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:03,997
(Gun) Thank you for the meal. (Riri) It was delicious.

330
00:21:03,997 --> 00:21:06,500
That's great. I could do it.

331
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:10,003
Ah, I'll do the washing. Is that okay?

332
00:21:10,003 --> 00:21:13,507
I would appreciate it if you could do that because I have something to talk to you two about.

333
00:21:13,507 --> 00:21:15,507
Please take your time.

334
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,014
What? Talk to me.

335
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:23,014
It's about Saito's funeral.

336
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,020
Tomorrow 1pm ➡

337
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,523
He will be buried directly. Chokso?

338
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:33,026
There will be no gathering of people, just cremation.

339
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:35,529
Well, he's a kidnapper.

340
00:21:35,529 --> 00:21:38,031
Why is that...?

341
00:21:38,031 --> 00:21:41,031
Just in case Hachi asked me to.

342
00:21:43,537 --> 00:21:46,039
If you want to see my face, that's the last time.

343
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,041
No, I'm not going.

344
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,544
Please, go. I don't understand.

345
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:53,547
Why do you go out of your way to rush into such a dangerous place?

346
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:56,049
If something were to happen, I would be arrested as well.

347
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,051
To the police, it's not kidnapping➡

348
00:21:58,051 --> 00:22:00,554
He says I asked him to run away with me.

349
00:22:00,554 --> 00:22:03,056
Are you an idiot? It has nothing to do with you.

350
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,991
It's relevant, because it's about Linda.

351
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:08,491
Huh? Are you in love with me? We're talking seriously.

352
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,501
Me and Linda➡

353
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:18,004
Because the environments we grew up in were so different➡

354
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:22,504
I think we feel and think differently, but...

355
00:22:24,511 --> 00:22:26,511
I imagined it.

356
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,517
For Linda➡

357
00:22:30,517 --> 00:22:34,020
What kind of person is Mr. Saito?

358
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,523
Look.

359
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:38,525
When fixing a puncture➡

360
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:41,027
When I asked, “What can you do?”➡

361
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:44,531
You said, "Because it's a car dealership."

362
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:48,535
I feel like there's something wrong with me.

363
00:22:48,535 --> 00:22:51,035
I didn't know it at that time, but...

364
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,041
It's because I take pride in my work.

365
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,047
That's...

366
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:06,984
It's really nice.

367
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:12,993
Do something that will make the police take care of you➡

368
00:23:12,993 --> 00:23:15,996
But when I met Saito-san➡

369
00:23:15,996 --> 00:23:18,999
I was told about my work➡

370
00:23:18,999 --> 00:23:21,999
I also received support to obtain qualifications.

371
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:27,504
It's like you taught me how to live.

372
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:39,515
Am I saying something like a textbook again?

373
00:23:43,023 --> 00:23:47,527
I have a big feeling of envy, but...

374
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:51,527
There's something... I can't convey it well.

375
00:24:03,977 --> 00:24:05,877
no.

376
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,985
It was still on the way.

377
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:23,993
Standing on his own as a fine mechanic...

378
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,500
I wanted the old man to see it.

379
00:24:40,013 --> 00:24:43,016
I wanted someone to praise me and say, ``You did a good job.''

381
00:24:58,531 --> 00:25:02,035
Is this the kind of thing where we would hug each other if we weren't here?

382
00:25:02,035 --> 00:25:04,471
But this is me.

383
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:05,972
That's right.

384
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,974
If it's just the two of us, we can forgive something.

385
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:10,474
Riri too? "too"?

386
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:17,984
It's almost like you forget that you're in the middle of a crime that will shake the world.

387
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:19,986
Really.

388
00:25:19,986 --> 00:25:22,986
Well, I'm also carrying the burden on one side.

389
00:25:24,491 --> 00:25:28,995
Cancer-san can do so many things➡

390
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:31,995
Is it okay to use it for crimes?

391
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,004
A job where you can be properly evaluated in the sunlight ➡

392
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:41,007
I feel like I want you to do that➡

393
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:43,507
Is that wrong?

394
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,011
It's impossible.

395
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:53,019
Once you commit a crime, you can't go back.

396
00:25:53,019 --> 00:25:56,019
There's no place to go back to.

Maybe I shouldn't ask this, but...

406
00:26:51,511 --> 00:26:54,013
Please ask me anything.

407

Will the day come when I can see my grandchild's face?

I go to treatment, but it's not easy...

409
00:27:03,523 --> 00:27:05,959
Ah... I see.

Hachi is also... bad.

00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:32,482
Please say goodbye properly.

416
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:37,886
That's why I don't ask Riri to answer the call.

417
00:27:40,426 --> 00:27:42,428
Everyone, do well.

418

Saito's cremation is today, right? Is that it? what up?

423
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:58,944
I want to go there, Hayashida might come.

424
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:01,447
There's no way they knew that the cremation was today.

425
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:03,949
There's a possibility. Even if we know ➡

426
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:06,952
Do you think he'll come when he's getting so much attention?

427
00:28:06,952 --> 00:28:08,954
Saito is Hayashida's benefactor.

428
00:28:08,954 --> 00:28:10,956
Ha...

429
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:15,961
Is he the kind of person who would risk his life to attend the cremation of his benefactor?

Ah...!

536
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,361
Are you a genius?

537
00:35:29,361 --> 00:35:30,863
Mr. Gan!

538
00:35:30,863 --> 00:35:34,366
Say hello to Hachi! Huh?

539
00:35:34,366 --> 00:35:37,369
Mr. Gun!? Mr. Gun!

540
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:39,371
(Investigator) Hey! There it was! (Investigators) Yes!

541
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,871
Oh my...!

Who do you think it is?

546
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:58,889
Don't move. I've planted a bomb.

547
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:03,395
Where? Front planting.

548
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:06,832
I guess it's the area where everyone evacuated.

549
00:36:06,832 --> 00:36:10,836
Are you a cooperator who is going around deleting the security camera footage?

550
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,336
How are the stars doing?

551
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
Did you enjoy your business trip to Sendai?

552
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:21,844
Maybe you're a cancer?

553

Shit!

566
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:27,846
Don't neglect adults too much.

567
00:37:27,846 --> 00:37:30,849
I'm quite an adult, too.

568
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,849
Yes, thank you for your hard work.

569
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:41,860
Mr. Gan, what should we do?

570
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:44,363
I said, "I'm fine," but...

571
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:48,367
Are you going to throw away your car? A detective saw it.

572
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,869
Gan-san told me to do that too.

577

It's Linda's fault, right? I said 30 seconds.

578
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,343
30 seconds is a short time for a final farewell.

579
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,845
Think about the situation.

580
00:38:33,845 --> 00:38:35,847
It can't be helped.

581
00:38:35,847 --> 00:38:39,351
The old man has a surprisingly calm face...

My car is here. Huh?

I'm the one who got you involved.

610
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:13,875
Because someone sold me...

I'm sure he was raised by me.

619

I understand.

We...

621
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:13,435
(Masaki) A man was just taken away by an ambulance...

622

(Misaki) As for why we were able to take this video...

623

This is...

624
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,457

625
00:41:38,897 --> 00:41:40,899

(Misaki) No, anyway...

Will it move soon?

632
00:42:07,425 --> 00:42:10,929
It's pointless if Hachi gets caught, so what are you going to explain to Mr. Gan?

633
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:14,933
Because Gan-san and Riri-chan are causing trouble➡

634
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,935
It's all my fault for throwing the stars around, right?

635
00:42:16,935 --> 00:42:20,935
You knew that from the beginning. I thought you knew, but...

636
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,945
I don't understand anymore.

637
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,948
So, is it blurring again?

At that time…➡

721
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,384
Come out with a knife.

Mr. Jonouchi also mentioned this park, right?

729
00:48:45,857 --> 00:48:47,859
Is it the president too? yes.

730
00:48:47,859 --> 00:48:51,362
Ah, good for now.
