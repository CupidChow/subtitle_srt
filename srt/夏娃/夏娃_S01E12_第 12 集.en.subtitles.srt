1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,797
I've been dreaming the same nightmare
for so many years.

4
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,302
After I'm faced with unimaginable horrors,

5
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,348
the dream always ends horribly.

6
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:03,706
I called her because I don't want you
to cut ties with your family.

7
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,084
I wasn't sure that she'd come,

8
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,545
but thankfully, she did.

9
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,339
Are you okay?

10
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,261
I'll get you something to drink.

11
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,862
I saw you falling, La-el.

12
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,906
I, Kang Yoon-gyeom, swear

13
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,742
that I'll only love you
for the rest of my life.

14
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,036
If there is a single lie in my words,

15
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,039
then I won't be afraid to die.

16
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,377
Can you, Kim Sun-bin,
swear in the name of God

17
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:54,841
that you love this man
standing in front of you?

18
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,387
Yes.

19
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,685
Sun-bin!

20
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,610
I must have been nervous.

21
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,995
You weren't nervous.

22
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,956
It was just unbearably hard for you.

23
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,461
I guess I wasn't looking
at the full picture.

24
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:35,840
I was angry at you for falling in love,

25
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,634
but I didn't realize

26
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,804
that you were trying so hard

27
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,434
not to love him.

28
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,812
If you'd like to follow your heart,

29
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,815
just let one person blame you for it.

30
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,319
Me.

31
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,285
What do you mean by that?

32
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,703
What do you think?

33
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,290
You're the one who should
make decisions about your own life.

34
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,480
Dam-ri?

35
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,523
It's So-ra.

36
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,527
I'm fine.

37
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,988
You really believed that
when your family is in the news industry?

38
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,157
The countersuits are just for show.

39
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,951
We're not getting a divorce.

40
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,996
I'm sure you've guessed this already,

41
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,914
but that woman is Sun-bin.

42
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,417
So it is Sun-bin.

43
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,419
How long have those two been doing it?

44
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:57,755
I was doubting it.

45
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,132
But people don't know

46
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,968
that Sun-bin is married, do they?

47
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,388
I'll give your family permission
to do an exclusive coverage.

48
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,224
I'll tell you all about
how she danced and played around with men,

49
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,685
as well as her lifestyle choices.

50
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,020
So release it exclusively.

51
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,480
People love provocative things,
don't they?

52
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,653
Send the materials
to Dam-ri's news company.

53
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,904
Yes, ma'am.

54
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,826
I'm sure she'll crawl out of her lair

55
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:31,289
once the world starts attacking her.

56
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:45,887
The family of LY Group's chairman
is undergoing a large disturbance.

57
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,931
Mr. Kang was criticized
for his improper conduct as a chairman

58
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,142
and his moral character

59
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,479
after he filed a divorce suit
against Ms. Han So-ra,

60
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,939
who stated that she only wants
to protect her family.

61
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,399
As proof of this--

62
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,235
So-ra.

63
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,282
My goodness, look at your skin.

64
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:17,001
What happened to you and your husband?

65
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,253
Are you okay?

66
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,297
Auntie.

67
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,675
This is so hard for me.

68
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,844
Of course it would be.

69
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,098
But don't think about
getting a divorce, okay?

70
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,058
Think about your kids.

71
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,601
Auntie.

72
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,145
Can you meet with Yoon-gyeom?

73
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:38,940
He won't be able to refuse

74
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,775
if you and Mr. President convince him.

75
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,236
All right, I'll do that.

76
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,239
I'll give Yoon-gyeom a good scolding.

77
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,912
Oh, my poor So-ra.

78
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,288
Auntieâ€¦

79
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,221
DR. JUNG

80
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:12,765
I found out where
Sun-bin and Chairman Kang are.

81
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,566
You found them?

82
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,650
Where are they?

83
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,319
They're at Chairman Kang's vacation house.

84
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,904
Grab her when he's not there.

85
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,824
I don't care
if you kill her while taking her.

86
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,742
Just bring her to me.

87
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,370
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,675
When did you start learning the tango?

89
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,222
It was after I quit ballet. I was
trying out a variety of dance styles.

90
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,266
If I'm being honest,

91
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,644
I started loving the tango
the moment I saw it.

92
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,878
Here are the pictures, Ms. Jang.

93
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:26,464
Welcome to our bar.

94
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:28,424
This world is full of suffering,

95
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,010
but all wounds can be healed.

96
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:35,681
I want you to feel that you can
communicate through the tango

97
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,183
without having to say a word.

98
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:41,687
The tango is a dance
where you heal one another

99
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:44,065
as you communicate with
and understand others.

100
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,363
Do you want to go
somewhere even further away?

101
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,994
I have a bad feeling

102
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,706
about going back to Seoul.

103
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:48,004
You've never been to Argentina, have you?

104
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:48,921
Since you like the tango,

105
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,549
I'm sure you'll fall in love
with Buenos Aires.

106
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,509
As long as I'm with you,

107
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,722
I can leave everything behind.

108
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,318
No, there's no way you can.

109
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,618
What's the secret
that you're hiding from me?

110
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,790
I don't care about your past.

111
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,336
But I feel like you're suffering
from something in the present.

112
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:30,630
I'm not.

113
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,674
Then why did you collapse
at the cathedral?

114
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,968
What are you afraid of?

115
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:38,554
Nothing.

116
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,240
You did this recently, didn't you?

117
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,534
Just tell me why you did it.

118
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,119
I just told my husband

119
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,538
that I'm getting a divorce.

120
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,166
Everything is happening so quickly.
It's a huge burden.

121
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,295
We can only become happy

122
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,299
if you tell me what you're hiding.

123
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,852
So-ra is starting to attack
La-el in earnest.

124
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,687
They're talking about
how La-el is married, and her behavior.

125
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,191
If this goes on,
La-el's identity will be revealed

126
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,984
before LY can be destroyed.

127
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:37,321
What if she gets caught
when she's with Mr. Kang?

128
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,906
That's a horrifying thought.

129
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,825
BLUE HOUSE CHIEF SECRETARY
SEO EUN-PYEONG

130
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,749
This is Seo Eun-pyeong.

131
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,750
Hello.

132
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,836
This is Jang Moon-hee.

133
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,006
I know that you're helping La-el.

134
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,649
So sheâ€¦

135
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,193
tried to kill herself.

136
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,865
She suffered from a severe panic disorder
after what happened to her parents.

137
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,785
She had some serious mental issues.

138
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:29,540
And I don't think she is
free from all of them yet.

139
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,087
I saw her with Mr. Kang,

140
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,632
and she looked unstable.

141
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:43,471
She has also started

142
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,306
to hurt herself again.

143
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,601
She loves him, but she can't admit it.

144
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,690
And she has to drag him down to hell.
She must feel horrible.

145
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,653
It's true that I need to use La-el,

146
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,451
but I don't want to see somebody dieâ€¦

147
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,288
ever again.

148
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,919
She can choose to be with Mr. Kangâ€¦

149
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,339
if she wants to.

150
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,759
But I can never agree with it.

151
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,845
She'll either have to disappear,

152
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,475
or never come back to Seoul.

153
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,245
Can you come outside?

154
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,622
I'm near the vacation house.

155
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,264
Ms. Jang came to talk to me.

156
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,642
If she also saw

157
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,062
what I can see,

158
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,231
then it really is true.

159
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,108
You love Chairman Kang.

160
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,612
So what?

161
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,198
Where am I supposed to go?

162
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,368
Will the two of you really accept it

163
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,704
if I leave with Chairman Kang?
No, you won't.

164
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,790
Would you want to go if we did accept it?

165
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:40,212
Why are we having
this useless conversation--

166
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,755
I heard you tried to kill yourself.

167
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:50,097
If you don't want me to worry about you,

168
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,891
then stop loving Chairman Kang.

169
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,769
I can't just let you be,
but I can't separate you either.

170
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,314
And I can't tell you to leave
like Ms. Jang can.

171
00:14:58,397 --> 00:14:59,982
It's driving me crazy.

172
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:15,664
Go back inside.

173
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,235
I told you that we don't
need to respond to the press.

174
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,321
Just ignore whatever they say.

175
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,281
Let them be.

176
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,076
I'll give separate directions
to the TF team,

177
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,036
so I only want the leader to contact me.

178
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:10,052
Let go!

179
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,638
Let go of me!

180
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,144
Who are you?

181
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,063
Get off!

182
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,149
Are you okay?

183
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,863
Just bring her to me.

184
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,865
I don't care
if you kill her while taking her.

185
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,473
You'reâ€¦

186
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
more precious to meâ€¦

187
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,145
than myself.

188
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,148
I just want you to be safe,

189
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:07,151
and I'd do anything for you.

190
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,194
That's all that I wish for.

191
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,410
Lawyer Seo, are you okay?

192
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,330
Mr. Seo.

193
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,167
I heard you're well acquainted
with the woman who ruined So-ra's life.

194
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,669
But Sun-bin is like family to me.

195
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,507
Run!

196
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,428
Mr. Seo!

197
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:42,936
Mr. Seo.

198
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,778
-You haven't found her yet?
-No, sir.

199
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:52,696
Search everywhere.

200
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,864
Yes, sir.

201
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,299
SECRETARY CHA

202
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,053
What did Sun-bin's mother say?

203
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,055
What about the security team
and the police?

204
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,858
Where are you right now?

205
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,163
You stabbed Seo Eun-pyeong?

206
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,710
Did he see your face?

207
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,756
I don't think he did.

208
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:55,050
There weren't any street lights.

209
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,677
What the hell were you doing?

210
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,179
Youâ€¦

211
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,598
stabbed the chief secretary
to the Blue House.

212
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,726
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-This drives me nuts.

213
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,984
Find out how hurt he is,

214
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,487
and if he saw your face.

215
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,656
-Now!
-Yes, ma'am.

216
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,469
Are you sure that you're okay?

217
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,890
Whose blood is this?

218
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,184
The man who came to help me got hurt.

219
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,602
Do you remember your attacker's face?

220
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,897
Is that really important?

221
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,358
It'll be easy for Ms. Han
to send that man again

222
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,235
or somebody else.

223
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,699
This is an all-out war for me.

224
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,702
I'm not going to hide
and let the world think

225
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,954
that I'm your mistress.

226
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,795
Allow me to present
the strategy for our future

227
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:58,173
with the future leaders of LY.

228
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,927
Since we need a strong leadership
and the ability to act quickly

229
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:04,888
in order to get through
these difficult times,

230
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,349
we'll be launching
a Strategic Planning Office

231
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,850
to oversee each department.

232
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,270
This will be collectively referred to
as the Future Strategic Planning Office,

233
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:15,274
and Ms. Kim Sun-bin,
who was in charge when LY Pay was listed,

234
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,525
will be leading this office.

235
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,997
Hello. I'm Kim Sun-bin.

236
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,624
They say that a crisis is an opportunity.

237
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,127
I'm planning on using
this crisis that has befallen LY

238
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:37,504
as an opportunity
to turn the tide completely.

239
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,216
I'm talking about
the semiconductor silicon wafer.

240
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,844
Most semiconductor companies,
including LY,

241
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,471
are using 12-inch wafers.

242
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:51,393
But I would like to propose the return
of the eight-inch wafer foundry process.

243
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,647
LY possesses the eight-inch
semiconductor technology

244
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,733
from Mr. Lee Tae-joon,
a genius businessman

245
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,403
whose company was acquired
by LY 13 years ago.

246
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,280
La-el.

247
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,617
This is the semiconductor disk
that I make.

248
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,535
Wow.

249
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,204
GEDIKS's technology

250
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,457
quickly dominated the global market
at the time,

251
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,043
and opened a new age of smartphones.

252
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,087
This technology is still the very best one

253
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,630
in the eight-inch semiconductor industry.

254
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,509
This is an exclusive contract for LY,

255
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:27,888
signed by the top five semiconductor
manufacturing plants in South Korea.

256
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,223
VICE PRESIDENT KIM YI-SAK

257
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,934
In order to respond
to the current situation,

258
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,979
the legal, development, finance,
and security teams

259
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:39,399
will be temporarily under the direction
of the Future Strategic Planning Office.

260
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,861
We ask for your cooperation
for the future of LY.

261
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,555
He gave her the Strategic Planning Office?

262
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,433
That's the most important part
of the company!

263
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,811
She'll know about everything,
including the slush fund!

264
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,271
But Mr. Han, that woman

265
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,191
got a contract
with the top five semiconductor factories

266
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,401
that have refused to work with LY so far.

267
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,946
How can an ordinary woman
do something like that?

268
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,615
Oh my goodness.

269
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,659
My blood pressure
is going through the roof.

270
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,327
-Mr. Han.
-Oh dear.

271
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,412
Please calm down.

272
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,497
Are you okay?

273
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:38,834
Prime Minister Han.

274
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:42,045
The divorce lawsuit could be
worth hundreds of billions of won.

275
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,381
We can win this. Don't worry, sir.

276
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,757
Hundreds of billions?

277
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,759
That's peanuts!

278
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,262
Mr. Han, please calm down.

279
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,429
Calm yourself.

280
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,515
-To the right.
-Right here?

281
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,808
-Yes.
-Over here.

282
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:57,561
We are the legal counsel of Ms. Han So-ra,

283
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,772
who is the lady of LY

284
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,150
and currently a director for LY.

285
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:05,527
Chairman Kang Yoon-gyeom
caused issues in his company's management

286
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,072
because of his private life,
and caused the stock prices to drop.

287
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,908
Since this is clearly an illegal act,

288
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,244
we're demanding compensation
for the damages.

289
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:17,706
Furthermore, Ms. Han
is filing a counterclaim

290
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,541
against the lawsuit
for property division and divorce.

291
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,294
The size of the lawsuit
is ten trillion won.

292
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,004
-Ten trillion?
-Ten trillion?

293
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,715
-Take pictures.
-Take pictures.

294
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,468
THE SIZE OF THE LAWSUIT IS 10 TRILLION WON

295
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:31,386
When did I say that?

296
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,389
How dare they start my lawsuit
without my permission?

297
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,189
Get the car ready.

298
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:45,066
I'm not getting a divorce.

299
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,694
I'm not doing it,
so why are you doing this?

300
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,362
Cancel the countersuit!

301
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,280
So-ra.

302
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,617
Your father just fell asleep
after his meeting.

303
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,035
Lower your voice, okay?

304
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,786
I'm not breaking up with Yoon-gyeom.

305
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,206
I'm never getting a divorce!

306
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,166
Then what do you want to do?

307
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,170
So what if you don't get a divorce?

308
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,464
How are you planning
on getting him back? He left you!

309
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,507
I just need that bitch to disappear.

310
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:13,178
I'm going to erase her existence
from this world!

311
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,930
Snap out of it, you brat!

312
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,062
She's different from
those women from before.

313
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:25,607
The entire country
is talking about you and her.

314
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,401
If you mess with her right now,

315
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,737
they'll uncover what you've
done before too. Understand?

316
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,493
Of course, Mr. Han. You're right.

317
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,078
So-ra knows that too.

318
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,162
Please calm yourself.

319
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,253
She's different from
those women from before.

320
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:49,089
The entire country
is talking about you and her.

321
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:51,091
If you mess with her right now,

322
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,802
they'll uncover what you've
done before too. Understand?

323
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,143
PATIENT NAME: SEO EUN-PYEONG

324
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,281
So Han Pan-ro was involved too.

325
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,241
They killed my mother

326
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,118
and covered it up as a group.

327
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,204
That's why nobody ever found out.

328
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,457
I need to heal quickly
so I can protect you.

329
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,217
I've always thought
that the worst crime in the world

330
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,303
is murder.

331
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,180
But it looks like

332
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:42,559
there's something that's just as bad.

333
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:45,687
Love.

334
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:51,484
What?

335
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:53,111
Why would you say that?

336
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,654
Just look at yourself.

337
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,824
-You're suffering so much.
-And you're not?

338
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:04,706
They say that life is full of suffering.

339
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,875
It wasn't that way before you met me.

340
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,211
I prefer this over not knowing you.

341
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,760
I need to lie down.

342
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,488
She has also started
to hurt herself again.

343
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,282
She loves him, but she can't admit it.

344
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,119
And she has to drag him down to hell.
She must feel horrible.

345
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,625
La-el.

346
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,838
If you really love Chairman Kang,

347
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:56,674
you should go for it.

348
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:58,343
It's okay.

349
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:01,971
But when I think about the things
you'll go through,

350
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,434
I just want you to run away from all this

351
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,187
and be at peace.

352
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,236
Now I know why people say

353
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,322
that you can't own love.

354
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,583
It's so pretty.

355
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,169
Dam-ri, this one looks so good too.

356
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,671
Ms. Eun.

357
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,424
-Ms. Yeo.
-Who are you?

358
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:41,553
Ms. Kim Sun-bin, the head of the
Strategic Planning Office at LY, sent me.

359
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,470
Who?

360
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,311
I want you to sleep
with Eun Dam-ri and Yeo Ji-hee.

361
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:51,479
Seduce them,

362
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,857
or use some other method.

363
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,610
Whoever does it first
with either one of them wins this.

364
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,363
What the hell?

365
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,949
This was ordered by Ms. Han.

366
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,326
The deposit was
100 and 300 million won each,

367
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,828
and she promised 900 million
if they succeeded.

368
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:09,622
They have the video.

369
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,167
Oh dear!

370
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,464
Who is it?

371
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:24,596
Who is it?

372
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:26,890
Who are you?

373
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,268
Hold on.

374
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,603
What?

375
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,814
-What is it?
-Where's the video?

376
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,483
What video?

377
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,818
Where's Ms. Eun's video?

378
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:40,904
Answer me.

379
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,699
We're here to report
LY Group's Ms. Han So-ra

380
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,620
for abetting a sex offense.

381
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,413
She paid us and told us

382
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,583
to do some terrible things.

383
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,668
LY's Han So-ra?

384
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:56,586
Yes.

385
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,380
She gave each of us
a deposit of 100 million won.

386
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,716
We were blinded

387
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:04,052
by the money.

388
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,262
I'm so sorry.

389
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:11,768
In order to bring down Ms. A's image,
the wife of another businessman

390
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:15,480
and a member of her gathering
who was competing with her,

391
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,107
Ms. Han told a male dancer that
she would pay him hundreds of millions

392
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,985
if he slept with Ms. A
and brought her the evidenceâ€¦

393
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,779
It's a call from the First Lady, ma'am.

394
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:25,281
â€¦this shocking news was revealed.

395
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,075
Oh my goodness, So-ra.

396
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:28,827
That's a crime.

397
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,161
How could you do that?

398
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,622
No, Auntie. This is a misunderstanding.

399
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,249
I'm sure you have your reasons,

400
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,793
but I can't get involved
in something like this.

401
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:40,630
For the time being, don't contact me,
and deal with this by yourself.

402
00:30:58,857 --> 00:30:59,816
Who is that?

403
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,568
Is that Yoon-gyeom?

404
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:10,660
Where is he?

405
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,278
This can't be real.

406
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,699
No. This isn't real.

407
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,463
What are you doing? Get her out of here!

408
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,257
Let go of me!

409
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,134
Mrs. Han!

410
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,181
-Take her outside.
-This is my house.

411
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,266
How dare you tell me to leave?

412
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,146
Thenâ€¦

413
00:32:21,856 --> 00:32:23,107
drag her out.

414
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,987
Are you insane? Let go!

415
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:29,739
Don't you know who I am?

416
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,949
Let go of me!

417
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,992
Do you all have a death wish?

418
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,410
Let go of me!

419
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,788
This is my house! Iâ€™m not leaving!

420
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,957
Let go of me right now! I can't do this!

421
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,292
Let go!

422
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,235
I've talked with So-ra.

423
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,654
I sent all of her stuff
to her father's house.

424
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:23,835
Honey.

425
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:37,932
Honey.

426
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,644
Our time togetherâ€¦

427
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,733
wasn't completely horrible, was it?

428
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,444
We were happy after we got our children,

429
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,071
and we were happy watching them grow.

430
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:57,160
When you're married to somebody,
you're going to have ups and downs.

431
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,042
I didn't file the countersuit.

432
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,253
I'll stop talking to my dad,
and I'll just dedicate myself to you.

433
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,761
Please give me another chance.

434
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,974
It's too late.

435
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,980
Do you think it'll be different
if you live with her?

436
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,523
Is it the physical aspect?

437
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,859
That wonâ€™t last long.

438
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:32,403
You'll get sick of her too.

439
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,323
Our marriage was arranged,

440
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,994
but for the first time in my life,

441
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,122
I'm in love with someone
because of who she is.

442
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,626
This decision is nothing
like the one I had to make with you.

443
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:47,919
It's completely different.

444
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,254
If you agree to reach a settlement,

445
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:54,258
I'll give you a good amount of my money.

446
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,136
I don't need any money, honey.

447
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,556
I just need you.

448
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,561
You're the only man I want in my life.

449
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,900
I can't replace you with anybody else.

450
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,047
Secretary Cha, escort her out.

451
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,426
No way.

452
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,185
There's no way.

453
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,318
Darling, don't go!

454
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,654
Don't go!

455
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,156
Babe!

456
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,832
A psychopath?

457
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:55,963
You were right.

458
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,757
Then I guess I am a psychopath.

459
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,426
But that means I could do
something completely crazy, doesn't it?

460
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,220
I'm going to do my very best
to ruin your life.

461
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:03,763
You'll try to stop me
while I try to break through.

462
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:05,932
Who do you imagine will win?

463
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:55,314
Bo-ram, do you want to see our house?

464
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:56,232
Sure.

465
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,408
If I stay here,

466
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,076
Da-bi will feel confused.

467
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,704
I'll go back home in a little bit.

468
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,915
This is why I asked you
that we move to an entirely new house.

469
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,459
Look at Da-bi.
She's enjoying being back at home.

470
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,945
Chief Secretary Seo
has not returned to work twice.

471
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:46,615
If what happened with him gets out too, Iâ€¦

472
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,499
Make sure that nobody finds out.

473
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,376
I'll make sure to do that, ma'am.

474
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,462
Please feel better.

475
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:11,891
Go away.

476
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,869
What's up with Mr. Seo and that bitch?

477
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,915
Why did he follow her all the way there?

478
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,333
Do you have any guesses?

479
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,127
There was something strange about it.

480
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,424
She called him something strange.

481
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,053
Lawyer Seo, are you okay?

482
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,181
Why did she call him a lawyer?

483
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,517
He hasn't been a lawyer in a long time.

484
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:04,193
Find out when and where they first met.

485
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,278
Yes, ma'am.

486
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,705
I hid the pointe shoes in the secret box.

487
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,167
I know the password too.

488
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:28,759
I'm going to stay here
with the girls tomorrow

489
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,678
instead of sending them to kindergarten.

490
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:32,596
I want Da-bi to adjust to

491
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,974
not having her mother at home.

492
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,392
Okay then.

493
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,813
Sun-bin lived abroad

494
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,190
until she started living together
with Jang Moon-hee seven years ago.

495
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,071
It looks like Mr. Seo
came from an orphanage.

496
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,451
He's from an orphanage,
but their parents were friends?

497
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,035
I'll look into it more, ma'am.

498
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,914
Wait, who?

499
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,625
What's her mother's name again?

500
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,918
It's Jang Moon-hee, ma'am.

501
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,425
JANG MOON-HEE

502
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,801
Jang Moon-heeâ€¦

503
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,306
There's no way I could've
heard her name before,

504
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,602
but why does it feel so familiar?

505
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,607
Jang Moon-heeâ€¦

506
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,862
Jang Moon-heeâ€¦

507
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,467
Jang Moon-hee.

508
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,888
I remember now.

509
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:09,485
Right.

510
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:12,571
Didn't you say
there's a TF team meeting about you?

511
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,537
I can just push it back to tomorrow.

512
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,580
The company needs you.

513
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,582
The kids have each other. They'll be okay.

514
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,042
Just for today.

515
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,378
I'm worried about Da-bi.

516
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:33,717
All right then. I'll see you later.

517
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:56,198
Want to play hide-and-seek?

518
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,449
-Yes!
-Me too!

519
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,451
I'll be it.

520
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,162
-Let's go.
-One, two,

521
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,582
three, four, five.

522
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,009
Bo-ram is great at playing hide-and-seek.

523
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,013
There's only one place
where she won't find us.

524
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,347
Okay.

525
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:17,696
Excuse me.

526
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,867
Did you call for me, ma'am?

527
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,619
They want to play in the playground.

528
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,413
I'll be out later. I need to make a call.

529
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,415
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

530
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:30,125
Let's go.

531
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,251
Let's go.

532
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,081
LY has kept hard copies of records

533
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:11,667
ever since the former chairman
was in charge.

534
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:14,169
I heard there's a safe
where they've stored

535
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,171
handwritten account books.

536
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,464
If you can find the safe,

537
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:20,509
I'm certain you'll find
the account book for GEDIKS inside.

538
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,371
GEDIKS SEMICONDUCTOR MERGER
AND RELATED DOCUMENTS

539
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:19,568
MERGER AGREEMENT

540
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,746
CEO LEE TAE-JOON

541
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,003
Dad!

542
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,299
CEO LEE TAE-JOON

543
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,801
Dadâ€¦

544
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:46,637
It looks great.

545
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,432
I'm so happy right now.

546
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,644
Honey!

547
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,853
Dad.

548
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,656
What are you doing?

549
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,953
I asked you what you're doing.

550
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,857
When did you get back?

551
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,776
How did you get in here?

552
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,995
How did you know about the safe,

553
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,331
and how did you get in here?

554
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:01,712
We were playing hide-and-seek,

555
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,256
and Da-bi came in here.

556
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,799
The papers fell,

557
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,636
so I was trying to organize them.
I didn't want you to get angry.

558
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:21,440
Let's play together.

559
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,400
Ms. Kim, let's play.

560
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,282
Dad.

561
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,117
I'm sorry.

562
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,828
I opened the safe.

563
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,417
Da-bi.

564
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,502
It's okay, Da-bi. Don't cry.

565
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:44,504
Are you okay?

566
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:27,881
Are you here, La-el?

567
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:01,206
Mr. Kang caught me in his safe.

568
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,584
I didn't even get to grab
the GEDIKS contracts.

569
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,211
Did he find out?

570
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,714
Is he suspecting you?

571
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,090
Not yet.

572
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:34,990
Ms. Jang.

573
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:38,243
I'm sending you the pictures
I got from the secret safe.

574
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,961
LY SEMICONDUCTORS

575
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:06,229
Do you recognize this place?

576
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,650
I've never been here before,

577
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,402
but you probably have
because of your daughter.

578
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,239
Your daughter is
the dead LY researcher, isn't she?

579
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:24,456
Wow, my memory is pretty great.

580
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,499
Right, Do-wan?

581
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,090
Let's try to solve this mystery.

582
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,598
You were complaining
about your dead daughter,

583
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,017
so why do you suddenly have another one?

584
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,854
Kim Sun-bin.

585
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:51,858
Did you adopt a grown woman?

586
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,782
What's going on with you and Sun-bin?

587
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:02,244
You're not her mother,
so why are you two acting like you are?

588
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,203
Tell me.

589
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:12,087
Did you twoâ€¦

590
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,506
approach us on purpose?

591
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,760
Are you here to get revenge

592
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,305
on some pathetic researcher dying?

593
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,926
I love it when people do stuff like that.

594
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:03,388
It's so exciting.

595
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,212
Do you want toâ€¦

596
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,591
have a drink with me?

597
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:59,194
Did you meet with your mother?

598
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:03,823
Yes.

599
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:10,121
Can you tell me
what this strange feeling is?

600
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,751
A strange feeling about what?

601
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:15,835
You.

602
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,717
I told you the truth.

603
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,428
We just played hide-and-seek.

604
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:29,641
Wellâ€¦

605
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:32,394
why do you feel so distant then?

606
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,815
We're living together.

607
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,442
I shouldn't feel distant.

608
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:42,153
That's why it's ironic.

609
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,909
It's true that I'm crazy about you,

610
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,912
but I'm not an idiot.

611
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,124
Don't make me look forâ€¦

612
00:54:55,291 --> 00:54:56,918
the answer to this on my own.

613
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:12,934
Mrs. Han.

614
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,645
I haven't seen you
act so lively in a long time, ma'am.

615
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:18,231
-Secretary Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

616
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,483
You can figure out

617
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,902
Yoon-gyeom's schedule, can't you?

618
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,782
I want to meet with him
and that bitch at the same time.

619
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,285
-Can you make it work?
-I'll look into it, ma'am.

620
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:47,802
Wow, you look like a proper CEO now.

621
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,145
I guess you've really
climbed up the social ladder.

622
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,982
You've fallen far, So-ra.

623
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,526
Are you stalking me now?

624
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,534
You're screwed now,

625
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,830
Lee La-el.

626
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,421
Lee La-el.

627
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:29,469
Lee La-el.

628
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,268
Look at your face.

629
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:48,488
It's like a weight
has been lifted off my shoulders.

630
00:56:57,330 --> 00:56:58,498
Hey, Secretary Kim.

631
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,668
Yoon-gyeom's here?

632
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,797
All right.

633
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,886
My husband's here.

634
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:33,241
Take the kids somewhere else.

635
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,159
Yes, sir.

636
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,662
You're not even going to
let me see my own daughter?

637
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:41,791
That's pretty harsh.

638
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,085
Do you really have to cause a scene?

639
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:58,391
Get out before you embarrass yourself.

640
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,189
You'll want to thank me later.

641
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:11,237
What are you doing? Come sit.

642
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,090
Honey.

643
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,887
You don't know who she is, do you?

644
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:43,853
Let me tell you.

645
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,524
Don't try anything useless.

646
00:58:47,607 --> 00:58:48,775
Just stop.

647
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,582
This was Sun-bin
when she started high school.

648
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,503
But she had a different name.

649
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,674
"Leeâ€¦

650
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,761
La-el."

651
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,558
KIM SUN-BIN

652
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,644
LEE LA-EL

653
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,490
I've dropped a little bit
of suspicion in here.

654
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,701
Just like that, your relationship
will be stained black.

655
01:00:21,784 --> 01:00:24,787
I can say with confidence
that you're no competition for me

656
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,707
because you suspect and stalk her,
yet you call it love.

657
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,167
Follow her.

658
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,668
Do-wan, why won't you pick up?

659
01:00:30,752 --> 01:00:32,045
We need to let Moon-hee go.

660
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,547
She's a tenacious one.

661
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,215
Let Ms. Jang go.

662
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,467
LY Victims Group?

663
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:40,136
I could hand over evidence
of LY's embezzlement to the prosecutors.

664
01:00:40,803 --> 01:00:41,679
We've been bugged.

665
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,766
I got the original GEDIKS contract.

666
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:46,225
I'm going to leave Mr. Kang.
