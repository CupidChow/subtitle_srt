1
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,074
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,827
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,046
Darling.

4
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,007
Honey.

5
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:53,928
You don't know who she is, do you?

6
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,601
Let me tell you.

7
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,938
Don't try anything useless. Just stop.

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,954
This was Sun-bin
when she started high school.

9
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:23,792
But she had a different name.

10
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,170
KIM SUN-BIN

11
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,047
LEE LA-EL

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,340
"Lee…

13
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,842
La-el."

14
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,531
LEE LA-EL

15
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,243
Do you really want to be dragged out?

16
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:04,082
You must be so happy.

17
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,209
For now, that is.

18
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,550
We're having Bo-ram's
birthday party today.

19
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:17,428
Can we talk about this at a later time?

20
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,140
Oh, Bo-ram.

21
00:02:20,723 --> 00:02:22,934
Whose daughter is she, really?

22
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,812
I'll have you removed forcefully
as you wish.

23
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:26,729
Secretary Cha.

24
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:29,858
It's fine, Secretary Cha.

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,193
I'm leaving soon.

26
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,989
I mean, I saw this coming.

27
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:41,077
I know you too well, Yoon-gyeom.

28
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,706
Sharing your life with someone
for decades,

29
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,792
you know everything
that's going on with them.

30
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,969
Once you start to suspect,

31
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,346
that feeling will never go away.

32
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:03,641
I've dropped a little bit
of suspicion in here.

33
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:10,106
That one drop
will start to contaminate the water,

34
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,651
and it'll stain the entire cup soon.

35
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,489
Just like that, your relationship
will be stained black.

36
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,793
If you want your questions answered,
talk to me privately, honey.

37
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,090
Real terror doesn't come
right when something bad happens.

38
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,720
What's really scary…

39
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,182
is feeling it creeping up on you.

40
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,980
Get up. Let's go somewhere else.

41
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,193
I said I'm leaving.

42
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,405
I'm busy cleaning up her mess.

43
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,537
I'll get going then, honey.

44
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,665
-It's me, Mr. Kang.
-What do you want?

45
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,750
How dare she call you?

46
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,544
She filed a lawsuit
to steal money from us!

47
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,670
Is this a joke or what?

48
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,298
She really has no shame.

49
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,758
What are you and Yoon-gyeom trying to do?

50
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,427
A suit for divorce

51
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,387
and a countersuit for ten trillion won?

52
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,514
Where are your damn manners?

53
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,433
You've got the entire country
in an uproar.

54
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:10,685
You have no right to call!

55
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:13,646
I understand how you feel, Mr. Kang.

56
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:15,356
I'm so sorry.

57
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,817
I'll just get to the point.

58
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,694
We're not getting a divorce.

59
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,821
I'll tell you about it in person.

60
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,992
Yoon-gyeom will also tell you
that we're not getting a divorce.

61
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,662
Thank you for the food.

62
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:31,539
We're going to go play in the playroom.

63
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,499
-Let's go.
-Have fun, you two.

64
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,270
I changed my name

65
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:58,316
when my mother remarried
after my father passed away.

66
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,984
Is that so?

67
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,738
And Jin-wook is the one who remarried.

68
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:07,867
I thought it'd hurt Bo-ram's feelings
if I told her I wasn't her real mother.

69
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,287
That was a good decision. I understand.

70
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,172
But…

71
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,217
there's nothing for me
to worry about, is there?

72
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,935
There are times when terror grips me.

73
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,145
It feels…

74
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,401
like I can't breathe,
as if I'm underwater.

75
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,782
It's as if I'm going to suffocate

76
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:50,993
while trapped in an ocean of chaos.

77
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,454
If I don't fight back fast,

78
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:56,541
I'll lose.

79
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,211
Are you suspicious of me?

80
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:04,924
Is our relationship going to be stained
just like Ms. Han said?

81
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,158
Like I said on the beach,

82
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,244
you'll only be at ease once you've told me

83
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,955
what it is that you're hiding.

84
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,208
It's okay.

85
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,294
Our relationship is just starting out.

86
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,964
You can tell me about your past
when you feel comfortable.

87
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,161
There should be
some torn papers on the table.

88
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,621
Bring them to me quietly.

89
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,068
So-ra found out your real name?

90
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,987
She also found out
that Ms. Jang approached her on purpose.

91
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,448
I don't think she knows
about GEDIKS though.

92
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,824
How did Mr. Kang react?

93
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,284
He didn’t say much about it,

94
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,079
but we need to assume
that the countdown has started.

95
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,123
The real problem is Ms. Jang.
I can't reach her.

96
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,708
I'll go check on her.

97
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:04,544
No, you're in the hospital.

98
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,836
I'll go.

99
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,923
I'll get the original GEDIKS contract
as soon as possible too.

100
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,301
I'll ask the law firm about Ms. Jang then.

101
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,500
LY EMPLOYEE AUDIT LIST

102
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,127
Pass this list on to the audit department.

103
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,088
It has the embezzlement
and illegal trade done by LY employees,

104
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:52,883
including Kim Yi-sak
and the resigned Jang Jin-wook.

105
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,596
I could hand this over to the prosecutors
to make an example out of them.

106
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,389
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,642
LY, THE WORLD'S LEADING COMPANY

108
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,894
-Vice President Kim.
-Yes?

109
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,479
I'm Jung Myeong-ho
from the audit department.

110
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,648
We've received a report
from the Strategic Planning Office.

111
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,401
The Strategic Planning Office?

112
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,030
What on earth are you…

113
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,327
Ms. Kim?

114
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:22,121
Ms. Kim.

115
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,667
I'm not sure what this is about.

116
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:29,170
This contract says
that you're giving up your stock shares.

117
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,338
Put your fingerprint on this.

118
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,506
We're desperate too.

119
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:33,591
Please…

120
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,221
My father trusted you so much.

121
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,308
We have families who depend on us.

122
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,601
Get it from the inside.

123
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,561
-It's okay. Just a bit more.
-It's okay.

124
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,396
-It's okay.
-From the inside. It's good now.

125
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,441
Could we talk for a moment?

126
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:51,400
Like I said,

127
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,235
turn him over to the prosecutors
after the investigation.

128
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:54,945
Let's go.

129
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:58,491
Ms. Kim.

130
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,410
What does LY's audit department
want from me?

131
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,329
I'm in the US after retiring.

132
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,165
A Retiree Summons Investigation?

133
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:09,043
You were found to have committed
illegal and corrupt acts

134
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,878
by Ms. Kim Sun-bin
of the Future Strategic Planning Office.

135
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,464
If you don't cooperate, we'll send
the documents to the prosecution.

136
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,382
But--

137
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,593
We'll be launching
a Strategic Planning Office

138
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,053
to oversee each department.

139
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,472
This will be collectively referred to
as the Future Strategic Planning Office,

140
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:24,308
and Ms. Kim Sun-bin
will be leading this office.

141
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,477
So she actually reported me?

142
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,230
Damn it.

143
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,401
Ms. Kim canceled today's meeting too?

144
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,528
She rescheduled it in a hurry
and left, sir.

145
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,614
The driver works for us,

146
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,699
so I can discreetly check
where she's headed, sir.

147
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,287
Ms. Jang.

148
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,472
What would you like me to do, sir?

149
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,933
-Follow her.
-Yes, sir.

150
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:09,955
UNSEO GENERAL HOSPITAL

151
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,248
What about her phone?

152
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,042
Was Ms. Jang's phone missing?

153
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,793
Her phone was the only thing missing

154
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,879
and it was turned off.

155
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,340
Maybe we should
report her missing to the police.

156
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,969
I'll meet with So-ra first.

157
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:26,222
I'm the one she hates.

158
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,266
She has no reason to hurt Ms. Jang.

159
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:31,268
La-el.

160
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,354
Even if you can't get
the original contract,

161
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:37,191
I'll help you with your lawsuit
as much as I can.

162
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,235
So don't do anything dangerous.

163
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:41,820
Let's go.

164
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,781
Oh goodness.

165
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,660
Are you sure about being discharged?

166
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,578
I need to take action

167
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,040
before something like this
happens to you again.

168
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,600
Follow her.

169
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,906
Isn't that Mr. Kang?

170
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,099
CHIEF SECRETARY SEO EUN-PYEONG

171
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,019
It's been a while, Mr. Seo.

172
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,230
I see.

173
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,776
All right.

174
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,739
Stop the car.

175
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,198
Yes, sir.

176
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:13,787
Who on earth attacked
the president's chief secretary?

177
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,499
And why does nobody know
about such an incident?

178
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,209
I didn't tell anyone on purpose.

179
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:21,295
I was waiting for the right moment.

180
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,963
What do you mean by that?

181
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:28,552
I was thinking that I would
tell one of the perpetrators first,

182
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,971
then threaten them with it.

183
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,139
And who is that?

184
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,143
I'm looking at him right now.

185
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,355
You think I was behind it?

186
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,984
That's ridiculous.

187
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,656
How could you be so rude?

188
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,992
Han So-ra, Han Pan-ro, Kim Jeong-chul,
and Kang Yoon-gyeom.

189
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,412
From an outsider's perspective,
you all are the same.

190
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,832
If you don't wish to be regarded the same,

191
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,794
then make them stop what they're planning.

192
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,838
I hope you won't be on their side

193
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,841
when they get their punishment.

194
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,223
I'll be going then.

195
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:15,766
Mr. Seo.

196
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,523
I don't understand

197
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:25,275
why you dislike me so much,

198
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,569
why you're meeting with Sun-bin so often,

199
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,780
or why you didn't tell anyone
about the attack.

200
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,700
But one thing might explain everything.

201
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,787
Do you love Sun-bin?

202
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,626
Are you trying to do something
for her right now?

203
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,627
What if I am?

204
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,504
She already chose me.

205
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,880
How can you be so confident?

206
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,592
How would you define your love, Mr. Kang?

207
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,513
I would define my love

208
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:56,223
as a sacrifice.

209
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,602
I'm only concerned
about what I can do for her.

210
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:04,148
I can say with confidence
that you're no competition for me

211
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:07,818
because you suspect and stalk her,
yet you call it love.

212
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,487
Loving somebody
while being suspicious of them.

213
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,656
I don't know about that.

214
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,785
I must say, I have a strong feeling

215
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,205
that you won't be by Sun-bin's side
for too long.

216
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,251
I'll be going now.

217
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,603
I'll get that shirt for Mr. Kang.

218
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,985
That can be a gift for Chi-gyeom.

219
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,862
Get me some cuff links for them too,

220
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,447
and bring me a bracelet for Soo-jung.

221
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,865
Yes, ma'am.

222
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,286
I used to be sick and tired
of Yoon-gyeom's family,

223
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,164
but now that my mother-in-law is gone,
I might start liking them again.

224
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:40,661
Please leave so they can talk.

225
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,846
Did Yoon-gyeom kick you out already?

226
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:00,305
What did you do with Ms. Jang?

227
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,975
Why are you asking me about your mom?

228
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,605
Maybe you don't know much about her
because she's your fake mom.

229
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,690
Tell me where she is.

230
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,860
Do you feel a sense of companionship
because you're both after money?

231
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,696
Who do you think you are?

232
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,994
You'll be nothing
once Yoon-gyeom loses interest in you.

233
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,538
You shouldn't be so confident.

234
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,123
I could tell you the same thing.

235
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,374
What will you do

236
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,419
if you can't win his heart back
even after I leave?

237
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,547
It hasn't crossed your mind, has it?

238
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:38,552
Why would I think about
something like that?

239
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,723
The perfect wife comforting her husband
who was hurt by a money chaser,

240
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:43,724
that's my role.

241
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,394
The entire country will respect me
after I put my family back together.

242
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,607
That's how this lawsuit will end.

243
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,744
Even after he finds out

244
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,079
about Dr. Jung, your lover?

245
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,416
Doctor.

246
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,667
Where are you?

247
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:12,920
I need a session today.

248
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:15,005
I'll be right there.

249
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,007
Where are you?

250
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,676
I need to see you right now.

251
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,436
DR. JUNG

252
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,781
People don't know yet
that the chief secretary was assaulted.

253
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,866
If people find out
that you were behind it,

254
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,577
not only will you lose your husband,

255
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,205
but how would you possibly live
with your head high?

256
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,136
You're getting anxious
because you got exposed.

257
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,724
I'll give you one day.

258
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,729
Let Ms. Jang go by midnight tomorrow.

259
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,898
If she comes back unharmed,

260
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,566
I'll leave Mr. Kang's side.

261
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:21,280
I'll help you preserve
your happy little life.

262
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,574
Remember.

263
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,576
I want her unharmed

264
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,748
and not a single hair touched.

265
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,532
How's Moon-hee?

266
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,992
Nobody knows we have her, right?

267
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,827
We're keeping an eye on her, ma'am.

268
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,663
Give her some food
and make her look presentable.

269
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,249
We might have to send her back.

270
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,093
Open it, Chi-gyeom.

271
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,386
You too, Soo-jung.

272
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,513
What's all this?
You're making us uncomfortable.

273
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:30,390
What are all these for?

274
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,559
You're in the middle of a divorce lawsuit.

275
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,271
I told you, we're not getting a divorce.

276
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,732
That woman is a vamp.

277
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,028
Mr. Kang.

278
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:45,072
It's Ms. Seol's memorial gathering
soon, isn't it?

279
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:46,782
I'll be there.

280
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,453
I want to let people know
that our family remains firm and bonded.

281
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,497
Father, I'll give Yoon-gyeom a call.

282
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,922
Hey, Chi-gyeom.

283
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,841
I'm set on getting a divorce.

284
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,676
Tell So-ra to go back.

285
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:07,969
Oh, really?

286
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:13,016
I guess you've lost
all the love that you had for her.

287
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,479
What if you lose all of that money?

288
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:19,940
Will you still get a divorce?

289
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:22,025
All right, Yoon-gyeom.

290
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,741
Yoon-gyeom says
he's set on getting a divorce

291
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,326
and that we shouldn't take these.

292
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:34,329
You can take them back,
Yoon-gyeom's ex-wife.

293
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,625
What are you doing?

294
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,085
I think you're a bit delusional.

295
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,586
Did Yoon-gyeom…

296
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,090
really say that?

297
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,218
-Even now?
-You heard me calling him.

298
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,637
You're even worse than Yoon-gyeom.

299
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,640
He cheated, but you filed a lawsuit
for ten trillion won!

300
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,935
Are we some personal wallet
to you and your father?

301
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,155
You're early, ma'am.

302
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,575
We thought you'd be back for dinner
and didn't get to prepare you a meal.

303
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,493
That's all right.

304
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,830
Bo-ram's grandmother is ill,
so I'm going to move back today.

305
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:18,373
Right.

306
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,834
The fence around the garden
looked a little unstable.

307
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,669
The kids might get hurt.

308
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,588
-Could you fix it right now?
-Yes, ma'am.

309
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,027
This was Sun-bin
when she started high school.

310
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,071
But she had a different name.

311
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,989
"Lee…

312
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:35,617
La-el."

313
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,910
I changed my name

314
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,621
when my mother remarried
after my father passed away.

315
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,289
Once you start to suspect,

316
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,000
that feeling will never go away.

317
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,587
How would you define your love, Mr. Kang?

318
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,172
I would define my love

319
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,882
as a sacrifice.

320
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,469
I can say with confidence
that you're no competition for me

321
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:57,430
because you suspect and stalk her,
yet you call it love.

322
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,766
Loving somebody
while being suspicious of them.

323
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,434
I don't know about that.

324
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,705
Can you do me a favor?

325
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,749
There's a box with a ribbon
inside the safe.

326
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,168
Could you get it for me?

327
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,050
Is it okay

328
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,304
if I open the safe?

329
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,722
Of course.

330
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,767
I changed the passcode because
it'd be dangerous for Da-bi to open it.

331
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,895
I'll tell you what it is.

332
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,559
SLUSH FUND BREAKDOWN
SLUSH FUND ACCOUNT DEPOSITS

333
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,671
Mr. Seo.

334
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,759
I got the original GEDIKS contract.

335
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,968
Tonight,

336
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,721
I'm going to leave Mr. Kang.

337
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:08,895
Ms. Han.

338
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:11,981
We were scolded last time
for not stopping you.

339
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:13,983
How stupid can you be?

340
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,360
Are you trying to get fired?

341
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,028
Move.

342
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,244
Ms--

343
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,081
What happened to the Yoon-gyeom I knew?

344
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,999
Why are you being like this?

345
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,752
This is my workplace. Lower your voice.

346
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,588
She approached you on purpose
with her mother.

347
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,216
Her mother wants to get revenge on us.

348
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,345
They're trying to screw us over!

349
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,599
So-ra.

350
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,145
You've never fallen in love, have you?

351
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,356
What?

352
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,944
What is this?

353
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:01,114
Don't be ridiculous.

354
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,950
The reason I'm doing this
is because I love you.

355
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,247
There were

356
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:14,252
thousands of reasons
why I shouldn't love Sun-bin.

357
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,298
But I overcame them all.

358
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,176
If she needs something,

359
00:29:21,718 --> 00:29:22,927
I'll just give it to her.

360
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,682
That's how I feel.

361
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,101
You're insane.

362
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:40,069
You should stop doing this
for your own sake.

363
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:44,491
Overcome what now?

364
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,911
You don't sound like yourself.
Cut the nonsense!

365
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,373
Sir.

366
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,333
Your car is ready.

367
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,381
You're going to regret this.

368
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:05,637
I swear you're going to regret this!

369
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,264
Honey!

370
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,568
I can't believe the redevelopment
was approved so quickly.

371
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:25,323
Thank goodness you're working with us.

372
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,741
THE ZEUS PROJECT PARTICIPANTS

373
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:30,203
I'm not a congressman anymore,
so I need to be more careful.

374
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,621
Let's make this quick.

375
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:32,789
Of course.

376
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,751
By the way, are you feeling sick?

377
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,586
You don't look too well, Mr. Seo.

378
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,091
It's a long story. I'll tell you soon.

379
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,218
Okay, then.

380
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,429
Here, have some tea.

381
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:49,806
Thank you.

382
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,199
"LY Victims Group"?

383
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,784
Who the hell are they?

384
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,788
Chief Prosecutor Ahn told me about it,
and it sounds pretty serious.

385
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,582
There are 31 plaintiffs,

386
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,167
and they've been gathering data
for decades.

387
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,548
Apparently, they've got
a lot of incriminating evidence.

388
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,258
That's why we have our legal team.

389
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,473
They have evidence
that the GEDIKS merger was illegal.

390
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,434
GEDIKS?

391
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:41,524
Mr. Seo, do you know who these people are?

392
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,151
I have no idea, sir.

393
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,990
Find out who these plaintiffs are.

394
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,617
Yes, sir.

395
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:10,511
MS. HAN

396
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:16,851
So-ra.

397
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,438
I'm leaving tonight.

398
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,775
But Ms. Jang must be unharmed.
Make sure that she is.

399
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,735
You're the one who's in a hurry, not me.

400
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,278
If I don't leave soon,

401
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,947
your husband won't be able to move on.

402
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,157
And he'll find out about
your little boyfriend.

403
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,659
Are you sure you're not in a hurry?

404
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,330
You have nothing to gain
from provoking me.

405
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:39,457
I'm leaving him on my own will.

406
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,543
Working with me right now

407
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:46,673
is the best way for you
to get Yoon-gyeom back.

408
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:51,678
What the hell?

409
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,846
How do they know so much
about the GEDIKS merger?

410
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,349
If this gets out,

411
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,101
we'll lose the divorce lawsuit too.

412
00:32:58,184 --> 00:32:59,894
If the merger is found to be illegal,

413
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,938
you can forget about the ten trillion won.

414
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,439
Jang Moon-hee?

415
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,150
Who the hell is she?

416
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,361
Do-wan.

417
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,322
This is her address.

418
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,491
Go and find out

419
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,410
who the hell she is.

420
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,664
Hey.

421
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,378
What's wrong with you?

422
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:30,967
It's nothing, sir.

423
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,720
Do-wan, why won't you pick up?

424
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,471
We need to let Moon-hee go.

425
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,113
La-el.

426
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:55,158
Pan-ro and Jeong-chul have learned
about the LY Victims Group's lawsuit.

427
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,452
They'll find out
about you and Ms. Jang in no time.

428
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,620
I see.

429
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:01,748
I'll call you back.

430
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,464
Is Bo-ram's grandmother really sick?

431
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:12,300
Can't you guys stay a little longer?

432
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,472
You can play with her at Liyan.

433
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,824
Here's the box Mr. Kang asked for.

434
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,453
I'm leaving with Bo-ram,

435
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,330
so you can give it to him instead.

436
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,498
I'm sorry, ma'am,

437
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:46,042
but he wishes to see you.

438
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,502
He asked to see you in person.

439
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:15,822
This way, please.

440
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,075
We can explain to the kids

441
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,452
that I'm getting a divorce.

442
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,288
Let's all live here together.

443
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,250
Let's start over in a new place.

444
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,254
AUTHORIZATION LETTER
OF STOCK SHARE TRANSFER

445
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,839
Stock share transfer?

446
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:17,675
Being a businessman to the bone,
this was the only thing…

447
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,970
that I could think of.

448
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,681
Chief Secretary Seo asked me

449
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,933
how I would define my love.

450
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,353
That hit me with a realization.

451
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,317
I don’t care if you have a secret

452
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,820
you could never open up to me about.

453
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,780
Do you understand?

454
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,936
Don't cry.

455
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,230
We'll be happy together from here on.

456
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,107
We'll go to Buenos Aires

457
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,402
and dance the tango together.

458
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,781
Okay?

459
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,793
GEDIKS SEMICONDUCTOR MERGER
AND RELATED DOCUMENTS

460
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,341
MERGER AGREEMENT

461
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,429
CEO LEE TAE-JOON

462
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,931
Mr. Lee's

463
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:48,933
forced signature.

464
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,779
And the industrial espionage
acknowledgment.

465
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:10,913
With this evidence,

466
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,917
there's no doubt we'll win, La-el.

467
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:17,336
Mr. Kang

468
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,340
willingly let me into the safe.

469
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:29,974
If you're hesitant,

470
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,062
we don't have to
reveal the GEDIKS contract.

471
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,148
I'm not hesitant.

472
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,859
I won't do anything
my parents would be ashamed of.

473
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:41,694
But…

474
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,531
I want to reveal everything myself.

475
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,998
I heard you asked Mr. Kang…

476
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:58,252
how he would define his love.

477
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,179
I, for one…

478
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,267
don't have the right to discuss love.

479
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,479
But I want to be
completely honest for once

480
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,442
out of respect for my own feelings.

481
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,503
MR. KANG

482
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,558
I need to tell you something.

483
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:58,312
But let's meet somewhere else
other than home.

484
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:00,731
This is new. You're making me nervous.

485
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,443
Okay, I'll be right there.

486
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,243
It's a call from Prosecutor Kim.

487
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,083
It's been a while, Mr. Kim.

488
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,668
Have you been well?

489
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,964
"LY Victims Group"?

490
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,383
I'll take a look.

491
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,471
SUMMARY OF LY VICTIMS GROUP'S LAWSUIT

492
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,306
We fed her sleeping pills,
so she'll be out.

493
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,809
She's completely out of her mind.

494
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:24,023
Let’s give her a good beating
once she's awake.

495
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:24,940
Yes, sir.

496
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,775
She's a tenacious one.

497
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,915
Lock the door up there
and watch her closely.

498
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,961
If this goes wrong, we're all screwed.

499
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:46,879
Yes, sir.

500
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:56,031
Sir, your father has also found out
about the LY Victims Group's lawsuit.

501
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:03,497
Yes, Father.

502
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,291
I've heard about the lawsuit as well.

503
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,375
Yoon-gyeom.

504
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:09,128
If the process
of the GEDIKS M&A is revealed,

505
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,130
then it'll be the end for LY.

506
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,840
The representative for the lawsuit,
Jang Moon-hee,

507
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,800
is working with the daughter
of GEDIKS's CEO.

508
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:18,095
If she really is his daughter,
then that's bad news for us.

509
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,680
Who did you just say?

510
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:22,433
Jang Moon-hee?

511
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,684
Chairman Kang.

512
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,478
Jin-wook found out about you two.

513
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:28,856
Don't cause any more problems.

514
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,150
If you don't heed my warning now,

515
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,027
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

516
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,988
I called her because I don't want you
to cut ties with your family.

517
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,114
I came because I was worried,

518
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,617
but I can't give you my blessing.

519
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:42,161
And you must know…

520
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,207
exactly why I can't do that.

521
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,175
So-ra.

522
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:59,219
This isn't the time for you
to get mad at me.

523
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,764
How many times have I told you
that I need that woman?

524
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:02,890
Bring her right now!

525
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,224
I told you, I can't do that!

526
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,435
She'll be the death of all of us!

527
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:08,604
Damn it.

528
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:11,398
She's really something else.

529
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,234
She's a tough one.

530
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:16,904
I don't think
she'll cooperate that easily.

531
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:21,325
Mr. Han.

532
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,828
These are the prosecutors
who want to be a part of the Zeus Project.

533
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:26,038
Please take a look.

534
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,040
Chief Prosecutor Kwon?

535
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:31,085
No. He was almost indicted
on a lobbying charge.

536
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,547
What?

537
00:44:38,884 --> 00:44:39,885
We've been bugged.

538
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:53,273
Over there.

539
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,154
Look under the couch.

540
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:06,745
Move.

541
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,340
Look, I found--

542
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:29,726
Another one?

543
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:13,979
So-ra.

544
00:46:14,771 --> 00:46:16,315
You've never fallen in love, have you?

545
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:17,608
What will you do

546
00:46:17,691 --> 00:46:20,402
if you can't win his heart back
even after I leave?

547
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,322
You should stop doing this
for your own sake.

548
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:32,331
Why the hell would you hand over Moon-hee?

549
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:34,625
Mr. Han and Mr. Kim

550
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,044
were both enraged.

551
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,254
They said to bring her no matter what--

552
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,756
I need to get my husband back.

553
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,926
I'll kill whoever gets in the way of it.

554
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,511
Do you understand?

555
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,980
Let Ms. Jang go by midnight tomorrow.

556
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:01,944
He thinks I've never fallen in love?

557
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,201
None of that matters.
If you lose your love, it's over.

558
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,370
You need to take it first.

559
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,998
The only thing that matters
is the final victor.

560
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,583
He's mine.

561
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:18,835
Understand?

562
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,129
Yes, ma'am.

563
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,178
Follow me.

564
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,590
The GEDIKS contract.

565
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:06,717
What are you doing?

566
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,597
How did you get in here?

567
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,224
How did you know about the safe,

568
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,767
and how did you get in here?

569
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:19,062
I would like to propose the return
of the eight-inch wafer foundry process.

570
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,481
LY possesses the eight-inch
semiconductor technology

571
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,900
from Mr. Lee Tae-joon,
a genius businessman

572
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,571
whose company was acquired
by LY 13 years ago.

573
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,502
Nobody's at home, sir.

574
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,004
What?

575
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:58,810
Ms. Jang.

576
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,039
Have you located Ms. Jang?

577
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:22,250
She's near Pan-ro's house,
but I'm not too sure.

578
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,503
I got her location,
but the signal was weak.

579
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,587
Okay.

580
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,143
MS. KIM

581
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,315
I need to go to Pan-ro's house.

582
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,193
File a missing person report for Ms. Jang,
and bring the police.

583
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,557
NO SIGNAL

584
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,226
Ms. Jang.

585
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:27,315
MOM

586
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,444
Ms. Jang…

587
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,154
The person you are
trying to reach is not available.

588
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:34,406
Please leave a message after the…

589
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,790
Understood, sir.

590
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,355
KANG YOON-GYEOM
CHAIRMAN OF LY

591
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:55,310
I guess it really is a small world.

592
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,480
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

593
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,990
I thought I lost it.

594
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:11,159
It's very dear to me.
It's from my father who passed away.

595
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:12,077
When I danced the tango with you,

596
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,745
I felt an inexplicable connection.

597
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:16,039
The game will never end
unless you risk everything that you have.

598
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:18,249
I imagined that was what meeting
my twin flame would feel like.

599
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,709
I'll stay with you.

600
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:21,961
I'll be with you.

601
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,213
I'm not running away.

602
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,548
I just want you.

603
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,097
I, Kang Yoon-gyeom, swear

604
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:35,934
that I'll only love you
for the rest of my life.

605
00:56:36,017 --> 00:56:37,852
If there is a single lie in my words,

606
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,355
then I won't be afraid

607
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:43,399
to die.

608
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:49,280
Can you, Kim Sun-bin,
swear in the name of God

609
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,909
that you love this man…

610
00:56:55,286 --> 00:56:57,580
standing in front of you?

611
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,293
Do you love me?

612
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:05,922
Yes.

613
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,297
What is all this?

614
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:49,299
What have you done?

615
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:52,177
How could you do this to me?

616
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,517
Did you hack into my phone?

617
00:58:01,728 --> 00:58:03,313
KANG YOON-GYEOM

618
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,067
Did you do it that night?

619
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,361
Our first night together?

620
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:13,490
Answer me!

621
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:17,035
How meticulous…

622
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,747
and how cruel.

623
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:23,041
How long have you been preparing…

624
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,420
to approach me like this?

625
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,925
I thought you just needed some money,
but I was wrong.

626
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,594
This is too terrible.

627
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,472
If only you had wished for something else.

628
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:41,351
I would have given you
everything that I have.

629
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,561
I would have done

630
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,065
anything for you.

631
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,318
Why…

632
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,196
Why did you do this to me?

633
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,749
Did you want to ruin my life so badly?

634
00:59:04,832 --> 00:59:07,669
What did I ever do to you, Sun-bin?

635
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,838
You should have taken my money
and my company instead!

636
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:13,800
But you completely ruined my life!

637
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:17,303
-Let go!
-You've stabbed me straight in my heart!

638
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,221
Let go of me!

639
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:32,485
Don't come any closer.

640
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,861
Don't come near me!

641
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:34,779
Why?

642
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:38,116
Are you scared now after doing all that?

643
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,368
Did you not expect this to happen?

644
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,135
What…

645
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,262
have I done?

646
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:00,346
Are you okay?

647
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:01,931
Are you all right?

648
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:03,516
I'm sorry.

649
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,476
-I'm sorry…
-Get away from me!

650
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,962
2011, BUENOS AIRES

651
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:36,924
SECOND SON, KANG YOON-GYEOM
CHAIRMAN OF LY

652
01:01:26,933 --> 01:01:28,851
All of you are responsible.

653
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,146
Confess your crimes, and pay the price.

654
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,691
Nobody has left this place alive.

655
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:35,983
That's your punishment!

656
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,113
I'm going to kill her.

657
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,531
I'm going to kill them all!

658
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:45,451
I'm so sorry.

659
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,328
Let's end this, please.

660
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,330
Kill them all with your own hands

661
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:52,291
and kill yourself at the end of it all.
