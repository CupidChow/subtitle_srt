00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,007
It's Lee La-el.

4
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,343
This is ten times
what I got from you, as promised.

5
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:53,803
Lee La-el.

6
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,765
Lee La-el.

7
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,323
Hello.

8
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,367
Do you remember Lee La-el?

9
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,828
She was tied to GEDIKS 13 years ago.

10
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,459
-Mr. Seo.
-You little brat.

11
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,963
What do you think you're doing?

12
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,924
Who the hell are you?

13
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,594
Are you okay?

14
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,804
Excuse me, are you okay?

15
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:36,805
Wake up.

16
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,015
Mr. Seo! Oh my goodness!

17
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,267
Are you okay?

18
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:42,477
Mr. Lee!

19
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,730
-Mr. Lee!
-Grab him!

20
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,106
Have you all gone insane?

21
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,319
-Mr. Seo!
-No!

22
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:52,237
-Oh dear!
-Let go!

23
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,738
-Mr. Seo!
-Mr. Lee!

24
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,616
Who the heck are they?
How did they get in here?

25
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,410
We don't know anything

26
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,788
about the money
that was deposited from China.

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,415
We only found out
after my husband was taken.

28
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,254
He started acting paranoid
about two months ago.

29
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:10,880
Honey.

30
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,758
You want to transfer
your stock ownership to La-el?

31
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,426
She's just a kid.

32
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:19,681
If anything happens to me,
they'll take yours too.

33
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:23,268
But they'll never guess
that I gave them to a minor.

34
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,980
That'll keep Han Pan-ro's party
confused for a while.

35
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,565
Use that chance to buy some time.

36
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,694
Then Yi-sak will protect you.

37
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,865
Has he ever received external pressure?

38
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:37,949
Well…

39
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,578
Prime Minister Han's party

40
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:43,663
visited him several times.

41
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,666
He kept suggesting an M&A deal

42
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,710
with LY Group.

43
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:49,794
Han Pan-ro.

44
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:53,172
So the scariest man in this country
has his eyes on him.

45
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,426
I heard he has connections in the NIS too.

46
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:58,261
Well,

47
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,182
my husband was prepared for the worst.

48
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:08,563
Mr. Lee Tae-joon, the leader
of the semiconductor industry, has died.

49
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,398
-On social media, people are wishing him
-After its establishment,

50
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,524
-peace in death.
-GEDIKS advanced

51
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,525
its semiconductor technology
in a very short time.

52
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:16,362
But Mr. Lee died after being suspected
of acting as a corporate spy.

53
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:20,116
Although he left a great impact
on the global semiconductor industry,

54
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,410
his reputation is stained
by his history of corporate espionage.

55
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,747
An interim chairman
has been appointed for GEDIKS

56
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,583
after Mr. Lee's arrest and death,

57
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,835
and GEDIKS is currently close
to disintegrating.

58
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,753
GEDIKS CEO LEE TAE-JOON DIES

59
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,298
GEDIKS executives held a temporary
general meeting of shareholders,

60
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,843
but the shareholders expressed
their distrust of the interim CEO

61
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,513
and are urging for the management rights
to be put up for sale.

62
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:47,185
Many are paying close attention
to the future of GEDIKS.

63
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,520
To end this broadcast,
let me just repeat the news

64
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,814
that the leader of South Korea's
semiconductor industry has died.

65
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,403
FUNERAL PARLOR

66
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,733
Where's your mother?

67
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,152
She's in the hospital.

68
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,406
Why…

69
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,702
How come you're doing
all of this by yourself?

70
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,539
Do you have anybody who can help?
Maybe your relatives?

71
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:01,592
The Brighter Tomorrow Party
has recruited Congressman Seo Eun-pyeong.

72
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,928
Mr. Seo is continuing
to communicate with the public

73
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,555
through the publication events
for his book,

74
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,432
The Man Who Opened
a New Political Hotspot,

75
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:10,852
which discusses his experiences
in politics.

76
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,020
Especially among the millennials…

77
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:12,937
Look at you.

78
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,814
Good job, Bo-ram!

79
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,942
Mom, I can do an elevé now. Look.

80
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,698
Well, you're still holding
onto your grandmother, sweetie.

81
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,950
Considering that Mr. Seo was
highly desired by both major parties,

82
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,577
the Brighter Tomorrow Party's
future is looking bright.

83
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,580
Daddy's home, Bo-ram.

84
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,582
-Dad!
-My pumpkin.

85
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,833
It's good to see you.

86
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,126
It's good to see you too.

87
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,920
This is what I was talking about
last time.

88
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,547
It's great for your knees.

89
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,966
Thank you. I really appreciate it.

90
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,259
No problem at all.

91
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,303
Hey, honey.

92
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:46,846
You're right on time.

93
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,140
I made some shabu-shabu, your favorite.

94
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,975
Really? Let me get changed real quick.

95
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,811
Here you go, sir.

96
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,729
Thanks.

97
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,581
So the conclusion is

98
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:17,001
that listing LY Distribution
on the New York Stock Exchange is risky.

99
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:19,545
If it fails, we can
get a subsidiary company to--

100
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,590
Listing it on the New York Stock Exchange
isn't up for debate.

101
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,176
It's a necessity.
That's why we need to push it forward.

102
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:27,345
So from now on,

103
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,765
don't even talk about
the possibility of failure.

104
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,600
Use that time to find a solution.

105
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,936
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

106
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,772
I want to meet
with the president of LY Distribution

107
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,398
before the presidents' meeting.

108
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:41,651
Yes, sir.

109
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,199
CHAIRMAN KANG YOON-GYEOM

110
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,756
I love you, honey.

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,472
It's your wife, sir.

112
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,485
My father wants to have lunch
at the horseback riding center tomorrow.

113
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,820
I have an important
presidents' meeting tomorrow.

114
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,865
You know how important it is
if he wants to see you there, right?

115
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,868
We need to set out early
to go to Gwacheon.

116
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,412
I'll get everything ready
for Da-bi to go horseback riding.

117
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,228
The sender's name and address
are both fake.

118
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,146
I checked it several times to make sure.

119
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,940
Did you check on La-el's mother?

120
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,692
Her resident registration is gone,

121
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:29,026
and there's no record
of La-el entering Korea.

122
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,196
There's no way to check
if they're still alive.

123
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
The letter was written ten years ago,

124
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,533
and it was sent very recently.

125
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,202
Doesn't that mean that she's alive?

126
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,707
Do you think La-el
is still in the United States?

127
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,668
Maybe.

128
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,420
I wonder how that child

129
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,548
survived by herself in another country.

130
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,010
I wonder what she looks like now.

131
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,389
How's the food today?

132
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,600
Try it, Mom. I followed your recipe.

133
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,060
Sure.

134
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,940
Let's eat.

135
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,901
-Please, eat.
-You too.

136
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,037
You boiled it down too much. It's salty.

137
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,830
I told you to boil it over low heat.

138
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,833
I forgot to reduce the heat.

139
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:27,877
That's not good.

140
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,756
I personally think it's really good.

141
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,841
Me too.

142
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,762
Come on, you two.
This is why her cooking doesn't improve.

143
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,809
Honestly, maybe I'll
just be bad at cooking forever.

144
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,479
That way, you can always feed me.

145
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,981
What?

146
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,611
You need to learn how to train an animal

147
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,238
to know how to train people.

148
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,366
You should learn this when you're young.

149
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,246
Do it.

150
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:07,500
What are you doing? Swing it.

151
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,046
Giddyup!

152
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,132
Come on.

153
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,843
Your mother was a lot better
when she was your age.

154
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:18,928
Try it again.

155
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,972
Come on, do it like you mean it.

156
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,859
What is it?

157
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,278
I think she's thirsty.

158
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,030
I'll go get her a drink.

159
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,615
Let's go.

160
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh, there he is.

161
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,541
I'm sorry, sir.
I was caught up in a meeting.

162
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:49,750
I see.

163
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,135
Stop crying.

164
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,847
I don't want to hit the horse. It'll hurt.

165
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,099
Don't be so timid.

166
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,103
Do you want your grandfather
to be mad at you?

167
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,731
I hate it when he scolds you.
You know that, right?

168
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,157
Stop crying.

169
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,589
We're not expecting anybody else.

170
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,174
Kim Jeong-chul will be here.

171
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,307
Sorry, I'm late.

172
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,433
Take a seat.

173
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:50,769
-Hello, Mr. Han.
-Hey.

174
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:53,647
Mr. Kang.

175
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,655
-It's been a while.
-It sure has.

176
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,282
It's good to see you.

177
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:07,411
You get prettier
every time I see you, So-ra.

178
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,921
As you know,
Jeong-chul stopped working for the NIS

179
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:18,422
while helping us out.

180
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,551
Since he's going to work for LY anyway,

181
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,220
I figured that he might as well start now.

182
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,431
He'll be your COO.
I'm sure that he'll be helpful.

183
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,601
You can start right away.
Quit your job at the bank.

184
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,645
Yes, Mr. Han.

185
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,482
Do you mean the COO of LY Group, sir?

186
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,692
Of course. What else?

187
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,829
Excuse me, Mr. Kang.

188
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,333
As you know, I worked for the NIS,

189
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,336
as well as a construction company,
the bank, and Liyan.

190
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,631
I have a lot of experience
and connections.

191
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,928
Still, I'm aware
that I still have a long way to go

192
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:07,846
to be in the steps of a good COO.

193
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,350
To make up for that,
I hope to learn a lot from you.

194
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:18,732
I look forward to working with you, sir.

195
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,192
All right, then.

196
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,027
You two will make a great team.

197
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,495
-I'll be going now, Mr. Han.
-All right.

198
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,258
I'll be going as well, sir.

199
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,760
I'll see you at home, Dad.

200
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,095
I'll see you later, Da-bi.

201
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,901
He thinks that the company belongs to him.

202
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,612
If he hadn't married you,

203
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,698
LY would still be in 30th place.

204
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,786
I need one of my own men in there
so that he can't steal it from me.

205
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,665
Steal it? That's kind of harsh, Dad.

206
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,417
You're siding with him instead of me?

207
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,129
No.

208
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,882
Sorry. I didn't mean that.

209
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,300
You should go too.

210
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,385
Okay.

211
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,434
You knew about this, didn't you?

212
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,312
My dad doesn't talk to me
about these things.

213
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,106
The position of the COO isn't a joke.

214
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,566
Well, he's not exactly a joke.

215
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,487
You've got to admit,
Mr. Kim is pretty skilled.

216
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,530
That's what you and your father think.

217
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,701
But you're going to
accept him, aren't you?

218
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,370
Just let it go then.

219
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,794
Some statistics are missing
from the survey data,

220
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,420
but the advisor isn't picking up.

221
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,673
She went to grab some food.
She must have left her phone.

222
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,260
When she comes back,
I'd like to speak with her in my room.

223
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,178
Yes, sir.

224
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,432
LA-EL'S MOTHER'S HOSPITAL

225
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,401
Hello.

226
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,361
This is the nursing home.

227
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,198
A little while ago,
you asked about Ms. Kim Jin-sook, right?

228
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,538
I must say, I'm surprised
that you took the time to visit us.

229
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,624
If I may ask,
are you one of Ms. Kim's relatives?

230
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,835
I'm not.

231
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,504
I knew her back when I was a lawyer.

232
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:49,299
Back then,
I tried several times to check on her,

233
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:51,927
but I couldn't get any information.

234
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,265
Have you heard from her by any chance?

235
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,934
No, we haven't heard anything either.

236
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,395
Even her resident registration
has expired.

237
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,312
I see.

238
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,151
Then what brought you to call us?

239
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,572
A few years ago, somebody paid
Ms. Kim's additional hospital fees.

240
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,033
But the medical laws have changed,
and we need to give the money back.

241
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,451
That's why I called you.

242
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,369
Someone paid her hospital fees?

243
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,957
Who?

244
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,213
They didn't leave a number,

245
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:30,340
so we don't have a way of reaching them.

246
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,928
But there is somebody who drops by
once every few months

247
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,723
to check if there's
any news about Ms. Kim.

248
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,349
They never leave a number, either.

249
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:42,519
Was that person a woman?

250
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,860
Yes, I believe she was a young woman.

251
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:55,282
Excuse me, did you hear anything
about Ms. Kim Jin-sook?

252
00:17:56,408 --> 00:18:00,245
We haven't heard anything about Ms. Kim.

253
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,624
Could I have some other
contact information then?

254
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,929
Isn't your mother at the hospital?

255
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,305
I thought you'd be with her.

256
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,432
-What do you think you're doing?
-Find Mr. Lee's seal first.

257
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:21,558
We can get the daughter's statement…

258
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,227
Director.

259
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:24,686
Hold on.

260
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,021
I just need a moment.

261
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,523
Hey! I just need…

262
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,527
This contract says
that you're giving up your stock shares.

263
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,444
Put your fingerprint on this.

264
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,404
WAIVER OF INHERITANCE RIGHTS

265
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,367
We're desperate too.

266
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:22,286
We have families who depend on us.

267
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,039
Please…

268
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,670
My father trusted you so much.

269
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:35,174
How can you do this?

270
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,264
Here.

271
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,850
Put your fingerprint on it.

272
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:46,476
-Come on.
-Closer.

273
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,395
It's okay.

274
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,522
Get it from the inside.

275
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,649
-It's okay. Just a bit more.
-It's okay.

276
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,151
From the inside. It's good now.

277
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,903
-Hurry up!
-We got it, we're done.

278
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,154
La-el!

279
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,742
La-el, wake up!

280
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,202
La-el, are you okay?

281
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,371
Oh my goodness!

282
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,873
-What shall we do?
-Call an ambulance. Quick!

283
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,416
-Okay.
-La-el!

284
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,211
Come on, wake up, La-el!

285
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:14,796
La-el!

286
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,265
Hey.

287
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,395
You want to investigate
Han Pan-ro and Kang Yoon-gyeom?

288
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,688
Let's just take three days

289
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,524
to find out who Han Pan-ro
and Mr. Kang know.

290
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,529
Mr. Seo, that's illegal.
We could get in trouble.

291
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,740
La-el is just a person from the past.

292
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:42,866
Yes, she is.

293
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,160
But sometimes, the past is
more important than the present.

294
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,830
If this really is La-el,

295
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,124
I can't turn a blind eye.

296
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,793
If anything happens,

297
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,629
I'll take full responsibility.

298
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,925
We'll be choosing
the parent representative

299
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,426
to lead our future events.

300
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,471
Our past representatives
have all been very impressive,

301
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,808
so the press and the
CNM Documentary team really want to know

302
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,477
who the representative will be this year.

303
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,231
You can apply for the position
or recommend somebody else.

304
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,525
If you want something,

305
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,236
then make other people help you get it.

306
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,781
As the homeroom teacher,

307
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,617
I recommend Da-bi's mother.

308
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:28,537
Really?

309
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,122
It's because of her donations
for that building.

310
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,999
I bet they've planned it all out.

311
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,667
Come on. We donated money too.

312
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,751
I know, right?

313
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:37,963
Mom, I want a snack.

314
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,006
A snack?

315
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,050
Here.

316
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:43,593
What is this?

317
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,679
A diaper?

318
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,765
It's a diaper.

319
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:50,976
Let me see.

320
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,061
It is!

321
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,397
Whose is it?

322
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,524
KANG DA-BI

323
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:59,651
Kang Da-bi?

324
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,446
Oh, is it yours, Da-bi?

325
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,865
Oh my.

326
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,577
I would have kept it a secret
if I had known.

327
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,874
-Look at her!
-Look at Da-bi!

328
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,382
-Look at Da-bi!
-Look at Da-bi!

329
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,092
-Look at her.
-Da-bi wears a diaper.

330
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,888
-She's a baby.
-You're such a baby.

331
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,432
-You're a baby.
-You're a baby!

332
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:36,271
-You're a baby.
-Da-bi's a baby.

333
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,689
-Did you cry, little baby?
-Look at you.

334
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,779
Oh my! Let me see, No-eul.

335
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,949
It's really deep.
I think it's going to scar!

336
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:48,909
Oh no!

337
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,244
Come here! How dare you?

338
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,829
Who said it's okay to do that?

339
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:56,625
Come here, Da-bi. It's okay.

340
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,001
Ms. Da-bi.

341
00:22:59,044 --> 00:22:59,878
Oh, dear.

342
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,464
Ma'am. Is Ms. Da-bi all right?

343
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,637
Why did you yell at Ms. Da-bi?

344
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,062
-And who are you?
-Please apologize

345
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,563
to Mrs. Han and Ms. Da-bi.

346
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,023
Look at my kid. He's hurt.

347
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,400
He's the one who's injured.
Why should I apologize?

348
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,444
Well, I'm sure he deserved it.

349
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,364
He deserved it? My gosh.

350
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,241
He saw a diaper, so he called it a diaper.

351
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,575
What's wrong with that?

352
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,660
Whatever.

353
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,705
Get out. This is none of your business.

354
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,207
Excuse me.

355
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,625
Please calm down, everyone.

356
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,794
I think we should
take a look at No-eul first.

357
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:44,756
We'll choose the representative next time
and end our meeting here.

358
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:58,061
Ms. Eun.

359
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,397
I think we have a lot to talk about.

360
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,234
But I'm a bit busy today,

361
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,321
so I'll see you next time.

362
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,575
Get the car ready and bring Da-bi outside.

363
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:12,951
Yes, ma'am.

364
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:20,792
A woman who has to be the best,

365
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,171
and another who wants to be the best.

366
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:28,925
That desire that can never be fulfilled

367
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,303
will lead you all to hell.

368
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,906
Take a look at No-eul first?

369
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,365
Whose side are you on?

370
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:54,618
Whose side?

371
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,953
I don't take sides, ma'am.

372
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,332
Whose side are you on? Huh?

373
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,836
I'm…

374
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,714
I'm…

375
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:11,509
on your side.

376
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,264
Please forgive her, ma'am.

377
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,808
Let me apologize on her behalf.

378
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,019
Fire her.

379
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,647
And kick Eun Dam-ri out of Liyan.

380
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,443
Got it?

381
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:33,698
-Yes, ma'am.
-I want Ms. Han to apologize to me.

382
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,824
Formally.

383
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,745
Why are you silent?

384
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,250
I think she's on Han So-ra's side.

385
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,254
A student attacked another student.

386
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,839
And you're going to
take the perpetrator's side?

387
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,259
Do you want me to file a dispute
with the Office of Education?

388
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,677
Yeah.

389
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,346
You want me to tell the press?

390
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,685
I understand why you're angry.

391
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,397
But let's just take it slow.

392
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,483
I think we can all talk this out.

393
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,278
If you keep taking Ms. Han's side,

394
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,946
I'll have to take action too.

395
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,198
Don't piss me off.

396
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,201
Okay?

397
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:29,254
Do your job right.

398
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,297
Yes. I'm sorry.

399
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,590
She's really scary when she gets mad.

400
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:34,217
I'm sorry.

401
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,803
Take care.

402
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,472
I'm sorry.

403
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,403
I bet this is a tough situation for you.

404
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,364
It is.

405
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:01,619
The parents haven't even got to
know each other yet, and this happened.

406
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,248
This is quite a headache.

407
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:09,919
I think I know how to
help those two make up.

408
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,130
Will you let me try it?

409
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,015
Stop it.

410
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,142
Stop crying!

411
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,562
Why are you so weak?

412
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,486
This is driving me nuts.

413
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,994
DR. JUNG

414
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,001
Where are you?

415
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:52,921
I need to talk to you today.

416
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:54,881
Come in.

417
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,851
A parent from Da-bi's kindergarten
wants to talk to you, sir.

418
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:16,903
Put your foot here.

419
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:18,530
Good.

420
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:22,534
That's it. Good.

421
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,702
A bit wider. That's good.

422
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,586
Mr. Kang is here to see you.

423
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,992
So that's why So-ra left
to stay at her parents' house

424
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,493
for a few days.

425
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,330
Da-bi's still having some trouble
with her bodily functions.

426
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,958
You must be worried about her.

427
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,422
You see, I'm the temporary
parent representative.

428
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,592
Would you mind helping me with something?

429
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,593
With what?

430
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,764
The mothers are very upset right now,

431
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,142
which I completely understand.

432
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,395
I'd like for them to make up,

433
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,984
and I'd like the kids
to attend Liyan together.

434
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,366
I'll apologize to the parent
of the student who got hurt.

435
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,287
Will you do that for me?

436
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,955
Of course. It's my responsibility.

437
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,255
I'll help the children make up
during their ballet lessons.

438
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,759
I actually minored in education
because I love kids so much.

439
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,969
I'm not going to go too far though.

440
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,723
No-eul may have gotten hurt,

441
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,017
but…

442
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,479
Da-bi's feelings got hurt as well.

443
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:48,596
Honey.

444
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,182
I'm so mad.

445
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,644
Can you take care of Dam-ri for me?

446
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,981
You're on my side, right?

447
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,399
Of course I am.

448
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,360
I need your love.

449
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:03,903
You're my only love.

450
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,822
Babe.

451
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:06,781
I love you.

452
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:09,868
I love you, darling.

453
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,563
I feel much better now.

454
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,444
Then…

455
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:47,280
may I go take a shower now, ma'am?

456
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,460
You just ruined my mood!

457
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,211
I'm sorry, ma'am.

458
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,255
Get lost.

459
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,765
Dam-ri, that bitch.

460
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:17,936
Who does she think she is,
talking to me like that?

461
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,939
She thinks she's a chaebol,
owning a tiny department store?

462
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,109
She's so full of herself
because of the construction in Dubai.

463
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,946
And now she wants to
pretend that she's on my level?

464
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:31,115
I wish I could strangle her.

465
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,787
How are things between Dad
and the chairman of Samyul?

466
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,622
Did you see anything?

467
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,999
They played golf together
last week, ma'am.

468
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,086
Did they say anything about Dam-ri?

469
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,420
Anything I could use against her?

470
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:47,548
They only talked about business.
Nothing about Ms. Eun.

471
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,343
Damn it.

472
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,931
How do I kick that crazy bitch
out of the kindergarten?

473
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,183
You think Dad will do it for me?

474
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,853
No.

475
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,856
He'll just yell at me if he finds out
Da-bi still pees her pants.

476
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,070
It's better I use
Kim Jeong-chul instead, right?

477
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:12,365
Well…

478
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:14,033
I don't think

479
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:15,910
that's a very good idea.

480
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,746
Ms. Da-bi did hurt a classmate…

481
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,831
Hey.

482
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,811
I didn't ask for your opinion.

483
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,732
You're just my sex toy.

484
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,067
Understand?

485
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,779
I'm sorry, ma'am.

486
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,578
I'm supposed to be at my vacation house,
so come up with a good alibi.

487
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,121
Yes, ma'am.

488
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,501
I'm going swimming. Get my swimsuit.

489
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,671
Yes, ma'am.

490
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,642
Mrs. Han is at the vacation house
in Pyeongchang, sir.

491
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:26,898
Come here, Da-bi.

492
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,948
Today was a long day, wasn't it?

493
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,161
You want me to let you learn ballet

494
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,580
with Bo-ram?

495
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,290
Really?

496
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:45,625
Yes! I want to do it.

497
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,504
That badly?

498
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,696
'THE POWER OF LY GROUP'

00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,121
LIYAN KINDERGARTEN

501
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,664
Han So-ra's not showing up.

502
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,916
Maybe she's protesting or something.

503
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,295
How ridiculous. Does she think
she can scare me or something?

504
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:36,300
If she doesn't apologize,
I'm telling everyone what Da-bi did.

505
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,886
Hey.

506
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,556
Do you agree with me?

507
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,226
Of course.

508
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,520
She scratched his face
and didn’t even apologize.

509
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,564
I'm on your side.

510
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,239
-En avant.
-En avant.

511
00:35:58,322 --> 00:35:59,866
-En haut.
-En haut.

512
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,455
Great work. I'll see you tomorrow.

513
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,916
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

514
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,545
Let's play at my house, Da-bi.

515
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,547
Wow! That sounds fun.

516
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:19,468
My dad is picking me up,
so let me ask him.

517
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,386
Okay.

518
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:25,016
We have so many toys at home.

519
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,559
-Really?
-Yeah.

520
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,982
Sir, it's Bo-ram's mother.

521
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,031
Hello.

522
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,034
I'm on my way to pick up Da-bi.

523
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,664
Could you tell me your address then?

524
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,434
Shall we dance?

525
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,813
Da-bi.

526
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,774
Your father's here. Time to go.

527
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:16,776
Okay.

528
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:19,195
Let's play together next time, Bo-ram.

529
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,112
Okay.

530
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,160
Did you have fun, Da-bi?

531
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,579
-Miss, can I come back next time?
-Yes?

532
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,040
Of course you can.

533
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,336
Dad!

534
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,007
Dad, I had so much fun today.

535
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,884
I want to play with Bo-ram tomorrow too.

536
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,010
Did you?

537
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,929
It's cold, Da-bi. Get in the car.

538
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,020
Da-bi looks happier.

539
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:56,649
Yes. I'm glad we don't have
any neighbors below us.

540
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,025
Those two were running around everywhere.

541
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,318
Thank you.

542
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:05,992
This…

543
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,790
I found it at the party.

544
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,586
Oh my.

545
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,256
I thought I lost it.

546
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,218
It's very dear to me.
It's from my father who passed away.

547
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,554
Thank you.

548
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:44,280
If you don't mind,

549
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:48,534
may I help you with that?

550
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:50,262
Well, good night then.

551
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:52,973
Take care.

552
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,170
I ran into Chairman Kang today at work,

553
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,880
and he actually talked to me.

554
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,466
Mr. Park was so shocked.

555
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,302
That must have felt nice.

556
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:15,222
When I was working in Buenos Aires,

557
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,892
I ate with Chairman Kang pretty often.

558
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,853
Well, he wasn't the chairman back then.

559
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,898
Still.

560
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,903
Okay, you're awesome.

561
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:29,820
I know.

562
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,991
I'm going to bed.

563
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,513
Dam-ri, that bitch.

564
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,766
Who does she think she is?
How dare she treat me like that?

565
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,144
She thinks she's rich, huh?

566
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,815
How should I screw her over?

567
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,862
She doesn't know her place.
I'll just get rid of her.

568
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,200
I'm Han So-ra.

569
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,245
Han So-ra.

570
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:25,834
Ouch, that's hot!

571
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:30,130
Are you all right, ma'am?

572
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,637
Here you go.

573
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,013
Gosh!

574
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,975
Damn it!

575
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,646
What are you looking at?

576
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,731
I'm sorry, ma'am.

577
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,609
I'm going back home tomorrow.

578
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:52,611
Make sure both sides of my family know.

579
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:54,738
Yes, ma'am.

580
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,289
Secretary Kim can pick up Ms. Da-bi, sir.

581
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,290
No, I'm going.

582
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:07,960
Yes, sir.

583
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,527
You look so pretty, Da-bi.

584
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,409
-Da-bi.
-Dad!

585
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,369
-Did you have fun?
-Yes.

586
00:43:43,662 --> 00:43:44,872
Hello.

587
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,499
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

588
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,003
I had so much fun with Da-bi
that I lost track of time.

589
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,173
What did you do today, Da-bi?

590
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,217
I learned how to jump.

591
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,762
-Did you?
-Like this!

592
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:02,598
Dad, I need to pee.

593
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,016
Da-bi.

594
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,313
I need to go to the bathroom too.
Shall we go together?

595
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,731
It's all right.

596
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,665
Did you major in dance?

597
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,211
I only did ballet in high school.

598
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,046
But I hurt my ankle,

599
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:36,632
so I had to stop.

600
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,218
I'm sorry.

601
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:40,803
Instead,

602
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,472
I got to study something very interesting.

603
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,933
I'm sure you know it very well too.

604
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,810
I do?

605
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,311
Business administration.

606
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:54,983
I'm being sarcastic.

607
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,278
Well, that sounds interesting.

608
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,620
The bandoneon.

609
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,498
It's pretty rare in Korea.

610
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,502
Do you know how to play it?

611
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,921
Do you know any bandoneon songs?

612
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,756
I know some songs by Piazzolla.

613
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,468
I'm surprised you know
about the bandoneon.

614
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,732
Do you know this song by any chance?

615
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,572
It sounds like a song
from a very old movie.

616
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,885
Once, a man went to the carnival
dressed as the emperor

617
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,429
and accidentally hurt his head.

618
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,058
He lived the rest of his life
thinking that he was the emperor.

619
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,520
This is a song about that man

620
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,689
who forgot who he was.

621
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:02,444
How about you, Mr. Kang?

622
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,656
Do you know who you are

623
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:07,866
and…

624
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,494
what kind of person you are?

625
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,002
If you've ever been drawn
to Piazzolla and the tango,

626
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,965
that means you want to
snap out of an illusion.

627
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:28,095
You wish to find yourself.

628
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,765
When you tango,

629
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:34,643
your heart becomes one
with your partner's.

630
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:39,773
You're supposed to listen
to your partner's heart

631
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,321
and become one with them

632
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,699
when you dance to a tango.

633
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,078
With all of your attention
only on yourself and your partner.

634
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:43,962
Where's Yoon-gyeom?

635
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:47,049
He went to pick up Ms. Da-bi.

636
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:48,967
He went to get her?

637
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,136
That's strange.

638
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:54,640
He found out about
what happened at the kindergarten.

639
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,644
I'm tired. Get my massage ready.

640
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,604
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

641
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,694
Honey.

642
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,615
Why did you pick up Da-bi?
Secretary Kim could have done that.

643
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,700
Why were you away for so long?

644
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,620
I told you, Da-bi needs you,
especially in times like this.

645
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,665
Don't worry about
the kindergarten issue. I got it.

646
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,416
Come here, Da-bi.

647
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,544
Did you miss me?

648
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,338
My baby.

649
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:23,812
If you don't mind,

650
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,189
may I help you with that?

651
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,159
The mothers are very upset right now.

652
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,243
I'd like for them to make up,

653
00:50:38,326 --> 00:50:40,537
and I'd like the kids
to attend Liyan together.

654
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:43,081
If you've ever been drawn
to Piazzolla and the tango,

655
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,542
that means you want to
snap out of an illusion.

656
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:48,420
You wish to find yourself.

657
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,966
Honey, you know Samyul, don't you?
The one Dam-ri's--

658
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,134
Oh my. Honey?

659
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,179
Honey.

660
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,479
Honey.

661
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,266
Sweetheart.

662
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:27,936
I'm so happy right now.

663
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:33,483
Do you have any idea
how long I've been waiting for you?

664
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,838
These are some pictures of Mr. Kang.

665
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,224
This…

666
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,476
This is La-el.

667
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:33,103
Yes.

668
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,980
I wasn't too sure,
but she does look like her.

669
00:54:35,814 --> 00:54:37,315
Her face didn’t change much.

670
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:40,735
I wonder what she's trying to do.

671
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,538
How can I help you?

672
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:43,631
Do you recognize me?

673
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,428
Because I recognize you,

674
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:50,847
Lee La-el.

675
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,392
It's been a while,

676
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:56,686
but I'm sure it's you.

677
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,568
-What do you…
-I'm Seo Eun-pyeong.

678
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,613
You know, from the NIS 13 years ago?

679
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,617
When did you come back to Korea?

680
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:12,702
I mean…

681
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,330
How was living in the US?

682
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:18,792
I was so worried
when you stopped talking to me.

683
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,294
But…

684
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,422
But I'm so glad that you're okay.

685
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:28,968
Well…

686
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,846
I'm not sure what you mean.

687
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:35,642
You're Lee La-el, aren't you?

688
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,937
My name is Kim Sun-bin.

689
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,067
You're not La-el?

690
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,528
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

691
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:47,946
I'm Kim Sun-bin.

692
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:50,657
But…

693
00:57:02,669 --> 00:57:03,628
Kim Sun-bin…

694
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,384
Ms. Kim Sun-bin…

695
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:14,347
Mom, Grandma's here.

696
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:18,726
Wow, you're going to see the pandas
with your grandma. It'll be so fun.

697
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,229
Take lots of pictures of the baby pandas.

698
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,147
Okay.

699
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,776
I'm here, Bo-ram.

700
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,069
-Grandma!
-My sweetie!

701
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:30,572
Hi, Mom.

702
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:32,574
You have a guest?

703
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,915
Who is he?

704
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,043
The person he's looking for
looks a lot like me, apparently.

705
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:49,424
Excuse me, but we have to get going.

706
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:53,970
Sure.

707
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,556
Sorry about all that.

708
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:58,808
I'm sorry.

709
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,603
It's okay.

710
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,553
Why did Mr. Seo

711
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,306
come here all of a sudden?

712
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,975
He took me by surprise too.

713
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,022
La-el.

714
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:49,984
We've been preparing for this
over the last ten years.

715
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,863
We can't let anybody distract us.

716
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,908
Mr. Seo is a potential
presidential candidate.

717
00:58:56,991 --> 00:59:00,328
I don't think he'll waste his time
on a random person from his past.

718
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,792
I wonder how he found you,
and why he came here.

719
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,546
Maybe he just happened
to see me somewhere.

720
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:11,631
Maybe curiosity?

721
00:59:13,049 --> 00:59:14,551
But nothing more than that.

722
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:19,889
Don’t worry.

723
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:22,517
I won't let this become an issue.

724
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,788
She looks so much like her.

725
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:42,115
When people start talking
about their misfortunes,

726
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,449
take a moment to think of me.

727
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,078
Because I'm going to pay them back…

728
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,294
tenfold.

729
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:02,218
No, she's La-el.

730
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:06,723
She's definitely La-el.

731
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,315
2020, AT FAMILY HOUSE

732
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,692
2011, BUENOS AIRES

733
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:20,987
2011, BUENOS AIRES

734
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,071
2008, AS PRIME MINISTER

735
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,156
KIM JEONG-CHUL

736
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,408
CHILDREN
KANG DA-BI, KANG EUN-BI

737
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,624
FAMILY MEAL, 2021

738
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:35,960
LUXURY HOTEL CAFÉ, 2018

739
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,300
Babe.

740
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,223
Do you remember the last time
we cuddled like this?

741
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,185
It was over five years ago.

742
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,940
You have no idea how much I've cried

743
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,944
because you wouldn't
pay any attention to me.

744
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,074
KANG YOON-GYEOM

745
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:02,213
HAN SO-RA

746
01:04:04,549 --> 01:04:06,259
Can we just be like this from now on?

747
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,346
Ever since I first met you,

748
01:04:12,807 --> 01:04:14,517
you've been the love of my life.

749
01:04:16,769 --> 01:04:17,812
You're the only man…

750
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,274
I'll ever truly love.

751
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,663
Will you take charge of
the Parent Association?

752
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:18,789
DIRECTOR KIM SUN-BIN

753
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,459
I'll find a way to get into their house.

754
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:22,668
I'll use Han So-ra.

755
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:23,794
That's a perfect comparison.

756
01:05:23,878 --> 01:05:24,754
I like it.

757
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:28,257
Will I see you at the vacation house?

758
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,843
This has got to be
related to Mr. Kang, right?

759
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:34,722
The game will never end
unless you risk everything that you have.

760
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,142
Am I perhaps seeing things?

761
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,894
You're definitely hiding something.

762
01:05:39,977 --> 01:05:41,687
Let's not think about anything else,

763
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,397
and just follow our desires.
