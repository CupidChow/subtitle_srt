1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,880
Do you notice anything different

4
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,758
about my skin this session?

5
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,718
I do, ma'am.

6
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:55,180
I've noticed your skin is a lot bouncier.

7
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:57,432
You must be
taking good care of it at home.

8
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,060
I mean, doesn't it look
even better than usual?

9
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:02,020
Of course it does, ma'am.

10
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:04,397
Your skin looks incredibly smooth.

11
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,857
Would you like to take a look?

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,738
-Here you go.
-I'm not talking about the massage.

13
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,742
Didn't you notice the natural collagen?

14
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,536
The natural collagen, ma'am?

15
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,333
The natural collagen
from my husband's love.

16
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,919
Of course I've noticed it.

17
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,962
You always look beautiful to me.

18
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,714
Not always, but recently.

19
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,260
Yes. I noticed it, ma'am.

20
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,805
You're so annoying.

21
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,139
Get out.

22
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,518
Ms. Kim.

23
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,110
Book an appointment with Dr. Oh,
the plastic surgeon.

24
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,737
And I want a list
of the top cosmetic gynecologists.

25
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,323
So would you like

26
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:58,076
a list of cosmetic surgeons
instead of Dr. Oh, Mrs. Han?

27
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,288
No, I want a list of gynecologists,
not cosmetic surgeons.

28
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,376
I've never heard of
a cosmetic gynecologist, that's all.

29
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,545
Have you never heard of vaginoplasty?

30
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,923
I'm sorry, Mrs. Han.
I'll look into it right away.

31
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,216
Gosh, you're so slow.

32
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,760
Why are you all so slow?

33
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,262
Get out!

34
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,259
We can't let anything slip past us.

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,012
The market cap for LY is 500 trillion won.

36
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,181
Even if they tossed away
that money one by one,

37
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,225
it would take longer than 500 years.

38
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,062
He has all that money,
yet he's only paying you as a director?

39
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,397
It’s not even close to being enough.

40
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:56,027
Do keep an eye over Yoon-gyeom.

41
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,487
As long as I'm next to him,

42
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:00,740
he won't be able to do a thing
without your permission.

43
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,829
KANG YOON-GYEOM INVESTIGATION REPORT

44
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,039
CONNECTIONS

45
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,082
MADAM JUNG

46
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,833
By the way,

47
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,253
who the hell is this Madam Jung?

48
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:15,129
Why is her name
on his investigation report?

49
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,302
She's always making a big deal
out of nothing.

50
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,429
She works for a members-only club

51
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,557
where they meet customers
in the company president's office.

52
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,602
And she's always bragging
that the president of LY is her regular.

53
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,020
It’s good advertisement, sir.

54
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,063
You see this?

55
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,232
Now everybody wants a piece of him.

56
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,276
I think you can just ignore her, sir.

57
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,529
Yoon-gyeom's never had any scandals
related to women.

58
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,741
Yes, I know how he is.

59
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,245
But for now, he's got
too many pests around him.

60
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,999
You've got to give them a warning
every once in a while.

61
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,378
Give them a warning, sir?

62
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,799
Come on, really?

63
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,969
She was just advertising
her business, that's all.

64
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,268
Gosh, you can be so cold-blooded.

65
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,769
Fine.

66
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,569
I'm leaving, Dad.

67
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,487
I left a newly-released trench coat
in the closet.

68
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,822
Oh, yes?

69
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,366
See? My daughter is the best.

70
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,369
Gosh, you’re both making me feel left out.

71
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:29,746
I'm jealous of you,

72
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,457
but I'm jealous of you too, So-ra.

73
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,167
Your father is cleaning up for you

74
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,628
just so that you can be content.

75
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,215
You mean the madam from the hostess club?

76
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,677
It just may be her.

77
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,115
I slept with my husband.

78
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,329
He's pretty amazing.

79
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,961
Why aren't you saying anything?

80
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:21,756
Aren't you jealous?

81
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,884
I…

82
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,136
am jealous, ma'am.

83
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,558
I'm not going to call you for a while.

84
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,104
But don't let me catch you
with anybody else.

85
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:39,565
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:46,966
It's from CL.

87
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,051
It's custom-made
only for one special person.

88
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,055
The strap has your initials on it, Dam-ri!

89
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,185
Mr. Kang ordered it himself.

90
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,353
Mr. Kang did?

91
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,899
He's worried about No-eul's injury.

92
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,985
He asked me to apologize on his behalf.

93
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,072
I gave him a little nudge
when he was deciding on the gift.

94
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,032
How do you like it?

95
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,659
How did you know what I like?

96
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,954
I paid attention, that's all.

97
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:19,624
I worked as a reporter for Maximums once.

98
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,834
You mean the luxury magazine?

99
00:08:22,376 --> 00:08:25,838
Then you must know all about
the fashion shows and new releases.

100
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,299
Of course.

101
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,885
-That’s nice.
-I guess that's nice.

102
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,850
I'm assuming that you'd want
Mr. Kang to apologize in person too.

103
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,644
That would be great, but…

104
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:41,854
He does seem quite busy.

105
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,652
Well, I guess this is enough.

106
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,320
I envy you.

107
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,281
I wish So-ra's daughter
would fight my kid too.

108
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,824
What are you talking about?

109
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,245
Anyway,

110
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,914
even thinking about So-ra
still pisses me off.

111
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:01,165
Right?

112
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,504
I know a way

113
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,757
to mess with Ms. Han.

114
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,427
Would you like to hear about it?

115
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,890
Who sent these?

116
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,768
She's a parent from the kindergarten's
Parent Association, ma'am.

117
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,655
Hello, Ms. Han.

118
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,824
I'm the temporary parent representative.

119
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,789
Ms. Eun Dam-ri sent me
to apologize on her behalf.

120
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,542
Please forgive her.

121
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,796
Why couldn't she come here herself?

122
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,968
I assume she was afraid
that you'd reject her apology.

123
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,432
She seems like the type
to get scared easily.

124
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,727
There are so many
parent events to arrange,

125
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,145
but nothing is getting done.

126
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:07,398
We need you to come back, Ms. Han.

127
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,483
You're our representative, after all.

128
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,363
What do you mean?
We didn't even get to vote on it.

129
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,575
I called everyone
as the temporary representative,

130
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,076
and they all voted for you.

131
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,998
Will you take charge of
the Parent Association?

132
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,262
These are recycled shoes, aren't they?

133
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,848
Recycled shoes?

134
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,392
Rakatod's hired a new designer

135
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,354
who really cares about the environment.

136
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:48,272
Their new designs look beautiful too.

137
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:52,151
They go perfectly
with your sense of noblesse oblige.

138
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,407
Oh, my.

139
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,618
Your feet are so pretty too.

140
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,621
Mr. Kang sure is lucky.

141
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,498
And you sure are wise with your words.

142
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,294
Please let me know if you need anything.

143
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,798
I can assure you I'll come in handy
when you go shopping.

144
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,979
What's Yoon-gyeom doing there?

145
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,399
He didn't take Secretary Cha with him,

146
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,983
so I'm not sure why.

147
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,905
I assume it has to do with
your upcoming birthday, ma'am.

148
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,158
You think so?

149
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,980
I'm certain this is La-el.

150
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,525
I remember her eyes very clearly.

151
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:15,776
I wonder why…

152
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,155
she's pretending not to know me.

153
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,242
I mean, why did she
take on another identity?

154
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:27,496
This has got to be
related to Mr. Kang, right?

155
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:34,253
Can you look into her family
that she's living with right now?

156
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,964
She said herself
that she's not Lee La-el, sir.

157
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:38,716
Ms. Kim.

158
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,760
Am I supposed to ask
somebody else to do it then?

159
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:45,973
No, sir.

160
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,225
I was just worried, that's all.

161
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,189
But if you truly wish for it,
of course I'll do it.

162
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:54,940
Thank you.

163
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,536
So the rumors are true.

164
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,705
Jung Ye-na had an affair
with Park Jin-woo?

165
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:12,416
There are screenshots
of their conversations online.

166
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,293
I'll send them to you too.

167
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,337
I couldn't believe my eyes either.

168
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,215
This is why you can't
judge a book by its cover.

169
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,759
I mean, Dam-ri and Ji-hui
look all graceful,

170
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,386
but everybody knows
they like to go clubbing.

171
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,721
I thought so.

172
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:29,141
They might be rich,
but they're not like you, Ms. Han.

173
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,185
They're like cheap knockoffs.

174
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,812
That's a perfect comparison.

175
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,607
"Knockoffs."

176
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,318
That's hilarious.

177
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,362
Look in the mirror, Ms. Han.

178
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,911
This is a nice look.

179
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:54,083
-I like it.
-Why don't you hire a model

180
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,876
who has the same body type as you?

181
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,797
You can make her try on your clothes,
and it's more objective.

182
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,258
I heard the female royalties in Britain
all have one.

183
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,970
You're worth ten shopping assistants.

184
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,516
At your service, Ms. Han.

185
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,937
You know, Liyan has a lot of events.

186
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,356
Do you want to be the vice-representative?

187
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,234
We can prepare for events together,

188
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,902
and throw in some chitchat too.

189
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:22,820
What do you think?

190
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,197
It would be my pleasure, Ms. Han.

191
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,783
I mean, Representative Han.

192
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,828
I think I got too excited.
What should I call you?

193
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,538
Just call me So-ra.

194
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:36,208
Call me Ms. Han when we're in public.

195
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,044
So-ra.

196
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,722
-Where's Yoon-gyeom?
-He's in the study, ma'am.

197
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,143
Bring some wine to the study,

198
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,186
and make the bedroom look romantic.

199
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,521
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,039
-Honey.
-What is it?

201
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,219
Honey.

202
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,680
Let's have a glass of wine.

203
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,569
You want to invite
Mr. Jang and his wife to Sehunjeong?

204
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,614
I don't know.

205
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:52,409
I've never invited
a subordinate there before.

206
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,203
Don’t think of him as a subordinate,

207
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,121
but rather as a fellow parent.

208
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,248
The wife seems smart,

209
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,376
so I'm considering having her work for me.

210
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:04,129
I want her to come join us there.

211
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,679
Darling.

212
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,516
I know that our parents
want another grandchild,

213
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,602
but I want one more than anyone else.

214
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,356
A son who's just like you.

215
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,570
Honey.

216
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,456
Here you go.

217
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,168
Thanks, Jin-wook.

218
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:47,047
Really, So-ra?

219
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,217
Are we really invited to Sehunjeong?

220
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,929
Isn't that the name

221
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,681
of Chairman Kang's vacation house?

222
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,976
Of course I'd love to!

223
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,811
I'll start practicing for some games.

224
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,896
By the way, what's the name
of the music you sent me?

225
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:07,359
He was too busy to do anything romantic,

226
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,861
but the mood was nice.

227
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,197
Mr. Kang liked it?

228
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,492
Okay, So-ra.

229
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,745
Thank you for the invite.

230
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,121
Good night.

231
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,380
Did you really get invited
to the chairman's vacation house?

232
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,174
-Did we really?
-Yes.

233
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,636
You should call me
the Master Planner from now on.

234
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:37,347
You're not kidding, right?

235
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,432
Thanks so much, babe.

236
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,185
Thank you, Ms. Jang.

237
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,395
I need to thank your ancestors.

238
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,355
Actually, I'll bow to thank you right now.

239
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,191
Thank you so much.

240
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,818
There's no need to thank me.

241
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,835
DIRECTOR KIM SUN-BIN

242
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:12,257
An invitation to Mr. Kang's
vacation house is an incredible chance.

243
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,803
You must find his account book or safe.

244
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,847
The safe has to be at
either Han Pan-ro's house,

245
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,726
Kang Yoon-gyeom's house, or at Sehunjeong.

246
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,230
I'll find a way to get into their house.

247
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,482
I'll use Han So-ra.

248
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,861
A woman like Han So-ra

249
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,864
can betray you in a heartbeat,
so you must be careful.

250
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,616
I will, Ms. Jang.

251
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:43,038
NO CALLER ID

252
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,498
There's no caller ID.

253
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,047
Hello.

254
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,216
This is Kang Yoon-gyeom.

255
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,473
I should have apologized
to No-eul's mother sooner.

256
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,728
I overstepped my boundaries to interfere.

257
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,273
I apologize, sir.

258
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,899
Don't be.

259
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,317
I should be thanking you instead.

260
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,694
Right,

261
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,865
Ms. Han invited us to Sehunjeong.

262
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:21,743
Will I see you…

263
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,330
at the vacation house?

264
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,133
I can't wait.

265
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,639
I meant I can't wait for the event.

266
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,559
I see.

267
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,562
I'll drop by when you settle on the date.

268
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,397
-All right then.
-All right.

269
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:02,159
DIRECTOR KIM SUN-BIN

270
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,712
I can't believe Mr. Kang
gave you a personal call.

271
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,506
He's known for managing
his private life very strictly.

272
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
La-el.

273
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,718
You're doing a great job.

274
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:22,387
I think he might have a secondary mobile,

275
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,934
seeing that Han So-ra
tracks his first phone.

276
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,688
And the fact
that he's hiding his caller ID…

277
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:36,068
It seems he's aware
that he's being tracked.

278
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,779
The greatest chaebol in Korea

279
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,617
is being watched.

280
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,080
He may live in a prison
of his own choosing

281
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:53,418
before he falls into the hell
that we engineered for him.

282
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,763
I told you, Chairman Kang isn't here.

283
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,646
If he goes missing

284
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,649
whenever I'm supposed to
give him my report,

285
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,027
he must be avoiding me, isn't he?

286
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,948
I wouldn't know, sir.

287
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,705
Goodness.

288
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,374
All right then.

289
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,548
Mr. Han, you have no idea
what I'm going through!

290
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,425
Your son-in-law keeps leaving me out!

291
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,844
It's pissing me off, but what can I do?

292
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,304
I'll have to find a good solution.

293
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,347
Yes, sir. Of course.

294
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,440
When I open my second store
in Cheongdam-dong,

295
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,942
you'll be seeing me more often,
so make sure you're free.

296
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:03,030
We'll have to open another store
thanks to you, Ms. Jung.

297
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,406
See you around.

298
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,843
They say Chairman Kang's
vacation house is like a palace.

299
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,928
I guess the rumors are true.

300
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:31,224
I can't believe this place
is in the middle of Seoul.

301
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,997
Is that a new face I see, Yoon-gyeom?

302
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,126
Hey.

303
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:40,669
Hello, Mr. Jang.

304
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,713
Thank you so much for inviting us, sir.

305
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,383
She's a good friend of mine.

306
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,886
You made a new friend, Ms. Han?

307
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:53,348
I didn't think you made such things.

308
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:54,266
Hello, you're my type.

309
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:55,892
Come on, Sang-hyeon!

310
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,938
Please carry on.

311
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,565
We're going to look around a bit more.

312
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,482
Okay, then.

313
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:31,928
Hello, Ms. Jung.

314
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,388
-Park my car, will you?
-Yes, ma'am.

315
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,231
NO CALLER ID

316
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,278
-Who is this?
-It's me, Madam Jung.

317
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,280
-Excuse me?
-Come on. It's me.

318
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,949
Who is this?

319
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:22,020
Isn't this your first time?

320
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,438
How are you better than us

321
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:25,732
when we've been playing for years now?

322
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,485
I have luck on my side tonight.

323
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,654
Pretending to be a beginner
while having a great poker face.

324
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:32,614
Damn, you're good at this, aren't you?

325
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,740
Don't you agree, Yoon-gyeom?

326
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,743
Ms. Han is the real master here.

327
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,162
I had good hands,

328
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:41,748
but Ms. Han played very well
despite her hands not being as good.

329
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,293
Did you hear that?

330
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:50,173
Sounds like you're enjoying
your husband's hobby, Ms. Han.

331
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,512
Let me focus until the end of the game.

332
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:56,596
Go ahead.

333
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,897
I'm not sure about this one.

334
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,235
I'm not checking my cards.

335
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,070
I'm going all-in.

336
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,032
Really?

337
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,038
Goodness, look at that!

338
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,583
I know Yoon-gyeom really well.

339
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,043
Judging by his face right now,

340
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:32,132
he either has a high pair or an airline.

341
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,259
Why don't you only bet half?

342
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,052
Are you giving up on the game?

343
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,473
I'm not giving up,
but fighting for victory.

344
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,604
The game will never end

345
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,315
unless you risk everything that you have.

346
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:58,950
I'll go all-in too.

347
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,496
Hey, Yoon-gyeom.

348
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,707
All-in.

349
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,964
Wait.

350
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:15,050
Hold on a second.

351
00:27:15,633 --> 00:27:17,344
The sole winner

352
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,346
will be taking all of these chips, okay?

353
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,847
All right.

354
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:29,272
Okay, let's check your cards.

355
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,526
I have a two pair.

356
00:27:34,694 --> 00:27:35,528
What about you, honey?

357
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:41,368
Gosh, I'm dying to see the results.

358
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:42,952
Yoon-gyeom, reveal your cards.

359
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,500
Honey!

360
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,381
If he wins, it's my money anyway.

361
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,801
Wow, is this what you
really wanted, Ms. Han?

362
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,803
Are you two gambling partners or what?

363
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,471
Congratulations, sir.

364
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:03,932
Wait.

365
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:12,148
You haven't checked my cards yet.

366
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,901
There's no way you can beat an aces full.

367
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,236
You're right.

368
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:18,238
This isn't a match I can win.

369
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,993
But since I've bet everything I have,
let me test my luck tonight.

370
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,964
Wait.

371
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,091
King, full house.

372
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,427
That's a good hand,

373
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,388
but you still won't beat Yoon-gyeom.

374
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:08,496
No way. This is insane!

375
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,207
It's four of a kind, Yoon-gyeom!

376
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,669
I've never seen anything like this.

377
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,547
Aces full house
and four of a kind together?

378
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,675
No way.

379
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,594
Unbelievable.

380
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,224
With such great beauty,

381
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,268
nobody would say anything
even if you were a card sharp.

382
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:34,397
If you really are a card sharp,
please do go easy on me.

383
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,441
Mr. Jang.

384
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,735
How can I find a wife like yours?

385
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,529
Well, I honestly don't know
if that's possible.

386
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:44,699
Good game.

387
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,459
Sir.

388
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,002
This seems to be an urgent call.

389
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,475
A car accident?

390
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:12,602
Madam Jung was hit by a car.

391
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,356
It's just like how the singer Ji Hyeon-a

392
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,607
was attacked a while ago.

393
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:23,363
Let's talk tomorrow.

394
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,381
Sir.

395
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,175
I wanted to thank you.

396
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,055
Thank me for what?

397
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,185
You trusted me
to mediate between the parents,

398
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,938
and you also invited me here.

399
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,734
It's a tango song.

400
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:04,696
I played it myself.

401
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,792
They say that two types of people
are attracted to the tango.

402
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,129
Those who like it

403
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,674
and those who need it.

404
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,387
What kind of people need the tango?

405
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:35,059
I'd say it's people who seek to be healed.

406
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:40,648
The tango is about communication.

407
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,861
You heal your wounds through other people.

408
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,073
When I danced the tango with you,

409
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,327
I felt an inexplicable connection.

410
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,212
Have you heard of the term "twin flame"?

411
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,056
Like a twin who once shared the same soul,

412
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:17,060
it refers to two lovers who recognize
each other the moment they meet.

413
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:20,813
That night, I imagined

414
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,235
that was what meeting
my twin flame would feel like.

415
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,157
I felt a void inside you,

416
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,454
and I felt the wanting to fill it for you.

417
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,844
What are you doing?

418
00:32:55,765 --> 00:33:00,478
I asked, what are you doing right now?

419
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:06,359
That night,

420
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,821
it felt so passionate
when I danced with you--

421
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,489
I'm not an idiot.

422
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,870
You've certainly been memorable, Ms. Kim.

423
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,667
So, have you been
analyzing me all this time?

424
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,506
You think I'm your twin flame?

425
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,592
You think I'm your other half
who needs to be healed?

426
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:40,309
Have you noticed a need for me
to be healed that I'm unaware of?

427
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,564
I don't need any healing
nor do I have any wounds,

428
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,190
so I am quite astounded.

429
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:53,114
You know, I can sense these things.

430
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,659
I can sense danger.

431
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,707
And I sense danger from you.

432
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:05,126
I really don't like it.

433
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,012
I don't feel anything toward you,

434
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,182
so don't try to get any closer to me.

435
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,809
Do you understand?

436
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,285
I'll remember that you
don't like being analyzed.

437
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,038
I think you'll like the song though.

438
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,398
If you can sense danger,

439
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,860
I can sense the way men feel about me.

440
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,324
You said you don't
feel anything toward me.

441
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,078
Then why did you come to my studio?

442
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,665
Why did you invite me tonight
and call me over the phone?

443
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,547
They say that one of the twin flames
is a runner

444
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,340
and the other one is a chaser.

445
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,177
I don't know if we're twin flames,

446
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:45,351
but it looks like
you're running away for sure.

447
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:08,416
What took you so long?

448
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,170
You look so pale.

449
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,256
I just started my period.

450
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:16,549
Are you okay staying here?

451
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,679
Hello, everyone!

452
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:28,019
Pardon me.

453
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,443
Hey, where's the chairman?

454
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,653
Mr. Kang.

455
00:36:39,071 --> 00:36:40,615
Mr. Kang.

456
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:45,661
Where's my friend, Mr. Kang?

457
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,746
Mr. Kang.

458
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,790
Mr. Kang.

459
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,667
I don't remember sending you an invite.

460
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:54,503
Mr. Kang!

461
00:36:56,505 --> 00:37:00,051
It's so hard for me to see you, sir,

462
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,178
even though I'm supposed to be the COO.

463
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,390
I knew you'd never
invite me to Sehunjeong,

464
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,936
so I just decided to come on my own.

465
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:10,853
Mr. Kang.

466
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:14,482
You're so mean.

467
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,150
Why did you…

468
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,822
Hold on. What am I saying?

469
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,325
I must be drunk. I'm talking nonsense.

470
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,119
I was just kidding, sir.

471
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,830
Can you look after that guy?

472
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,374
He needs to be on good terms
with Yoon-gyeom.

473
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,754
Are you okay, babe?

474
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,464
I'm fine.

475
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:42,551
Wow, I've only heard of this place.

476
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,846
Boy, this place is just wonderful.

477
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,765
Mr. Kang.

478
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:52,853
I would love to be
one of your close associates too.

479
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:56,857
I'll see you another time.

480
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,237
I just got here,
and you're kicking me out already?

481
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:04,573
Come on. That's kind of harsh.

482
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:08,953
I mean, do you have any idea
what I went through

483
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,663
to clean up after Madam Jung…

484
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:17,670
My goodness, I'm so drunk.

485
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,964
Oh gosh! I've got to snap out of it.

486
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,468
Come on, don't be like that.

487
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,972
Let me join the party.

488
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,391
Mr. Kang.

489
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,062
-Do you know any games, sir?
-What?

490
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,105
Right this way.

491
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,941
Oh, I love gambling!

492
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,946
You're the best, So-ra.

493
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:44,989
Oh, boy.

494
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,073
Thank you so much.

495
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:49,160
-Pardon me, everyone.
-Hello.

496
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:52,663
Sorry. Pardon me.

497
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:01,797
Who's that beautiful lady over there?

498
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,550
I mean, I know everybody else here,

499
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:07,803
but I don't think
I've ever seen her before.

500
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,638
She's one of Da-bi's friend's mother.

501
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,891
This is LY's COO.

502
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,936
I see.

503
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,859
Nice to meet you.

504
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,903
Nice to meet you too.

505
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:28,324
But…

506
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,954
Am I perhaps seeing things?

507
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:59,480
I thought you were a college student.

508
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,817
She married when she was young,
so she's still in her twenties.

509
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,611
That's her husband, Mr. Jang Jin-wook.
He's LY's general manager.

510
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,322
Mr. Jang.

511
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,867
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kim.
I'm Jang Jin-wook.

512
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,369
Pleased to meet you.

513
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,414
Goodness.

514
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,124
-Sorry.
-Excuse me for a moment.

515
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,052
Yes, Ms. Kim.

516
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:30,970
Mr. Seo.

517
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,680
I found something big

518
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:34,598
while looking into Sun-bin's husband.

519
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,685
I'm heading home right now.
I'll tell you about it when I get home.

520
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,555
What are you doing?

521
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,144
My hand slipped.
I was trying to cut a loose strand.

522
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:56,824
Please let me go.

523
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,869
Another all-in!

524
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,539
This won't do. Give me more chips, So-ra.

525
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,208
Are you doing this over and over
because it's not real money?

526
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,293
You should stop now.

527
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:52,838
Oh, come on. Just one last time.

528
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:55,507
One last time, okay?

529
00:43:55,591 --> 00:43:59,136
I think I can win
if I just play one more time.

530
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,639
-I think we've played enough.
-Yes. Let's stop.

531
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,768
So-ra.

532
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,187
Okay.

533
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,272
No more.

534
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:14,652
-Time for me to go.
-All right.

535
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:18,781
Mr. Jang married his current wife
three years ago.

536
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,658
Three years? But her daughter

537
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,410
looked like she was in kindergarten.

538
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,829
The child is from his first marriage.

539
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,498
He divorced his first wife.

540
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,586
Now he's living with his mother-in-law
after his remarriage.

541
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,421
and they're a perfectly normal family.

542
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:38,926
But the shocking part
is Mr. Jang's first job.

543
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:41,929
Where did he work?

544
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:43,722
He used to work at GEDIKS.

545
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,601
When that happened thirteen years ago,

546
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:50,521
Mr. Jang was a new employee at GEDIKS.

547
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:59,488
Babe, I think you managed to
seduce everybody there.

548
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:03,951
I don't think anybody understood why
you married just an average guy like me.

549
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,663
That's why I always say

550
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,125
that I won the marriage lottery.

551
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,754
I mean, not only do I have
a perfect wife like you,

552
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,881
but I also got to go to Sehunjeong.

553
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,008
I feel like I'm living in a dream.

554
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:23,262
Honey. Am I even allowed to be this happy?

555
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:27,641
Of course. Of course you are.

556
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,981
A lot of employees moved
from GEDIKS to LY.

557
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,608
What's so special about Jin-wook?

558
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,862
He worked with Mr. Kang in Buenos Aires.

559
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,865
Also…

560
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:46,827
he played a big role

561
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,745
in helping LY acquire GEDIKS.

562
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,124
I'm home, Ms. Jang.

563
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,209
How was it, Jin-wook?

564
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,628
Was Sehunjeong
as amazing as people say it is?

565
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,882
Seriously, it was fantastic.

566
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,593
Everybody there was so influential,

567
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,678
and they all welcomed me and Sun-bin.

568
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:05,762
I loved it.

569
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:08,932
Congratulations on becoming
the chairman's close associates.

570
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,350
Thank you, Ms. Jang.

571
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,708
Babe.

572
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,043
Don't touch me.

573
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:40,839
Remember our first rule?

574
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,842
If I don't want to be touched,
don't question it.

575
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,385
Get out.

576
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,264
Okay. All right.

577
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,479
Babe.

578
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,108
I can do whatever you want

579
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,818
because I love you very much.

580
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,237
But…

581
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,615
please don't push me away too much.

582
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,660
I'm just saying that would be nice.

583
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,204
Get some rest.

584
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,611
Hey! Did you find it?

585
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,780
I unlocked the safe, Director.

586
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:50,242
I found Lee Tae-joon's seal too.

587
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,205
Good job.

588
00:47:56,832 --> 00:47:58,208
Gosh.

589
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:09,261
I wonder how long
she'd been planning this.

590
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,154
She's betting her entire life on it.

591
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,492
It's too dangerous.

592
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,997
I can't let La-el go down that path.

593
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:41,960
I can't believe you let Mr. Kang
catch you hurting yourself.

594
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,962
He'll become suspicious, and that'll only

595
00:48:44,588 --> 00:48:46,006
get worse as time goes on.

596
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:48,842
Are you trying to ruin our plan?

597
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:52,846
I'm sorry.

598
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:55,223
Why are you so weak?

599
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,934
Don't you know
who you're going up against?

600
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,354
There's only one reason

601
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:03,148
why I used up all of my money to save you.

602
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,776
Prove that you're worth the effort.

603
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:11,615
I…

604
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:16,244
need to see them
falling from their thrones.

605
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:18,664
If you screw us up,

606
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,750
I'm going to make you regret it

607
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:24,586
no matter who you are.

608
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:49,986
Mom?

609
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,794
Your mother went missing, remember?

610
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,590
Let's get you out of the hospital.

611
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:13,885
I'll become your legal guardian

612
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,556
instead of your parents.

613
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,560
Who are you?

614
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,106
I'm someone who understands you
better than anybody else.

615
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,569
I lost my family

616
00:50:31,778 --> 00:50:33,029
in the same way you did.

617
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,116
I lost my only daughter.

618
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:57,763
KANG YOON-GYEOM
CHAIRMAN OF LY GROUP

619
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,571
Where are you going, Mom?

620
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,365
I'm going grocery shopping.

621
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,367
I can do that. You should get some rest.

622
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:21,703
I want to go for a walk. It's okay.

623
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,122
Text me if you want anything, Bo-ram.

624
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,792
Okay, Mom. Bye.

625
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:27,709
Bye.

626
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,261
Hey, you're back.

627
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:42,098
I'm just going for a walk.

628
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:45,435
Has the auction for the bandoneon
started yet?

629
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:48,688
Maybe I'll just get you a fake one
since you're trying so hard.

630
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:59,074
It'd be nice
if a fake could replace the real one.

631
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:03,203
Why are you so obsessed
with the Piazzolla myth?

632
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,622
I know you want it,

633
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,542
but the richest man in Korea

634
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,002
also wants Piazzolla's bandoneon.

635
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,673
He's already paid for it too.

636
00:52:14,756 --> 00:52:17,509
The auction didn't start yet.
How did he already pay for it?

637
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,136
He said he doesn't care how much it costs

638
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,555
and gave a blank check.

639
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:25,642
Who was it?

640
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:28,186
He's pretty famous.

641
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:32,274
Where's his name again? Let me see.

642
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,487
So LLE is you.

643
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:40,615
There he is.

644
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,868
Kang Yoon-gyeom.

645
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,956
KANG YOON-GYEOM
RESERVATION FOR BANDONEON

646
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:52,210
You want to buy
Piazzolla's bandoneon, sir?

647
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,587
Yes, I do.

648
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:57,757
Very few people know
that it's going on auction.

649
00:52:58,425 --> 00:52:59,801
How did you find out about it?

650
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,262
I have a personal interest in it.

651
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:11,813
Speak of the devil.

652
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,481
There he is.

653
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:18,862
You two are going to
fight over the bandoneon.

654
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,798
Ma'am.

655
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,050
Are you leaving?

656
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,903
Why do you need Piazzolla's bandoneon?

657
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,115
Anybody who likes the tango

658
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,284
would want Piazzolla's instrument.

659
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,288
Not somebody who needs the tango?

660
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,417
They say that two types of people
are attracted to the tango.

661
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:16,878
Those who like it

662
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,423
and those who need it.

663
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,552
What kind of people need the tango?

664
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:29,391
I'd say it's people who seek to be healed.

665
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,531
You're definitely hiding something.

666
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:48,535
But what is it?

667
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:57,043
Who are you?

668
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:39,753
Let's stop beating around the bush
and be honest with each other.

669
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,052
You want me, don't you?

670
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:49,637
So badly that it hurts.

671
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:53,975
Well, so do I.

672
00:55:57,896 --> 00:55:59,731
Let's not think about anything else,

673
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,358
and just follow our desires.

674
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,862
What do you think?

675
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,778
Just let me treat the wound.

676
00:57:57,474 --> 00:57:59,309
You said there are two types of people.

677
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,062
Those who like the tango

678
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:06,107
and those who need it.

679
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:13,865
You need the tango, don't you?

680
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:24,334
It's because you need to be healed

681
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,046
that you've been noticing others
who do too.

682
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,767
Thank you for your help.

683
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,862
What do you have buried inside your heart?

684
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,033
What are you hiding,
and why is it hurting you so much?

685
00:58:57,116 --> 00:58:58,243
I'm not hiding anything.

686
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:01,371
I told you, my hand slipped.

687
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,499
Then what about the scars you had before?

688
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:07,544
I can tell you did this repeatedly.

689
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,138
So you don't like being analyzed,

690
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:23,351
but you're fine
with doing it yourself, sir?

691
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,478
Well, too bad.

692
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,397
You guessed wrong.

693
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,357
When we danced the tango together,

694
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:34,070
you talked about someone
who forgot who they were.

695
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,283
Were you talking about yourself?

696
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,676
I wonder what will happen
if I give in to your seduction.

697
01:01:21,135 --> 01:01:24,263
Do you know
what the tallest barrier in the world is?

698
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:27,934
It's your husband's back when
he's lying there, facing away from you.

699
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:29,310
You're the one who needs a son,

700
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,521
so why am I the one
who's getting stressed over it?

701
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,440
I have something to tell you
about Mr. Kang.

702
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,401
This is information on him.

703
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:38,861
You want to go back in time
to your honeymoon

704
01:01:38,945 --> 01:01:40,363
and get pregnant before her.

705
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:44,033
Everybody who's ever approached me

706
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,535
had an ulterior motive.

707
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,245
I don't want anything.

708
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:48,162
I…

709
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:50,540
just want you.
