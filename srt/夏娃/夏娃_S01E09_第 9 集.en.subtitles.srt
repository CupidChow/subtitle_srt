00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,703
Chairman Kang!

4
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:44,419
What do you think you're doing?

5
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,004
You think you're entitled?

6
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,506
She's my wife, do you understand?

7
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,844
Come here.

8
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,013
Calm down, Jin-wook.

9
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,099
How dare you tell me to calm down?

10
00:00:58,183 --> 00:00:59,684
Don't do this, honey.

11
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,479
Why are you holding me back, honey?

12
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,189
You should be stopping him instead!

13
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,066
Jin-wook!

14
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:08,777
Are you okay?

15
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:12,572
Don't touch her.

16
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,699
And who are you to tell me that?

17
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,451
She's my wife.

18
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,786
She's mine!

19
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,164
You can't approach her
while you're acting this way.

20
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,918
You're the chairman.

21
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:28,046
Yet you stole my wife,
and now you're threatening me?

22
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,548
This will be the end of you.

23
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,258
You'll be screwed
once people find out, understand?

24
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,968
You can only yell at me like this

25
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,304
because you're legally her husband.

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,766
Then I guess
I'll just take care of it legally.

27
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:41,476
What?

28
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,978
Are you saying you'll make us divorce?

29
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,441
I can't end things with you.

30
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,528
I'm the husband here.

31
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,905
What the hell do you think you're doing?

32
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,492
What are you doing there? Come here!

33
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,493
Stop!

34
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,665
What are you doing?

35
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,500
-Come here.
-Who are you? Let go of me!

36
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,418
Let go!

37
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,087
Let me go!

38
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,722
I'm not breaking up with you.

39
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,432
Understand?

40
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:29,899
You're being unrealistic right now.

41
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:32,986
Ms. Han knows about us too.
What do you intend to do?

42
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,821
Just give me some time

43
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,532
to deal with So-ra and Jin-wook.

44
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,576
I'll find a way
to resolve this peacefully.

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,037
There's a way to resolve things peacefully

46
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,164
with Ms. Han?

47
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,916
I have her under control.

48
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,843
I'll be waiting then.

49
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,877
This one, and this one.

50
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,088
You wore these when you were
meeting with him, didn't you?

51
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:37,342
Throw them away and forget about him.

52
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,184
And this.

53
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,020
He gave this to you, didn't he?

54
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,022
Return it to him.

55
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,483
Actually, never mind.

56
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,984
I'll do it myself.

57
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,779
I'll go and give him a warning

58
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,822
so he'll never mess with us again.

59
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,785
If you provoke him,

60
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,703
he might retaliate even stronger.

61
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,747
Am I supposed to sit still then?

62
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,376
He thinks he can do
whatever he wants with you!

63
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,295
I won't put up with that.

64
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,399
They'll find out about you
if you keep creating tension like this.

65
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,194
I'll end things before they find out.

66
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,991
Now that there's a rift
between Yoon-gyeom and So-ra,

67
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,284
I'm going to press my advantage.

68
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,868
What if they don't get a divorce?

69
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,287
Do you have another plan?

70
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,958
You've used up all of your cards
by blindly charging at them.

71
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,002
Do you even have another plan after this?

72
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,560
I've been dreaming the same dream
for many years now.

73
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:15,023
I'm wandering in hell

74
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,817
while hopelessly lost.

75
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,839
And one

76
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,216
by one,

77
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:46,804
I watch the ones who made me suffer

78
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:53,144
die while suffering as much as I did.

79
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:02,612
Stay away.

80
00:06:04,363 --> 00:06:05,281
Stay away!

81
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,338
Although it's the revenge
that I have been longing for,

82
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,717
the dream turns into a nightmare

83
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,303
for a reason unknown to me.

84
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,076
Then the dream ends

85
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,245
with a horrific twist

86
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,790
that I cannot bear to stand.

87
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,422
MR. SEO

88
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,302
It looks like So-ra was beyond shocked.

89
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,764
After she's done with Yoon-gyeom,
she'll take her anger out on you.

90
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,270
I'm already worried about you
running into her at Liyan.

91
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:18,855
Will you be all right?

92
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,440
I hope that the news

93
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:25,111
sickens her to her stomach.

94
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,931
Welcome.

95
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,391
Congratulations.

96
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,060
Congratulations, Ms. Han.

97
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,312
I'm so happy for you.

98
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:03,107
Congratulations on LY Pay
getting listed in New York.

99
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,152
LY owes its success to you, Ms. Han.

100
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,948
Would you like to share a word
as the parent representative?

101
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,828
I was able to help Yoon-gyeom
and get LY Pay listed in New York,

102
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,497
all thanks to you ladies.

103
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,291
I'm planning on hosting
a grand party soon,

104
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:21,876
so you can look forward to that.

105
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,128
I hope you continue to support me.

106
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,755
Sun-bin.

107
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,551
-Say hello.
-Hello.

108
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,761
Hi.

109
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:35,473
I haven't seen Da-bi
for the past two days.

110
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,475
I haven't seen Ms. Han either.

111
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,768
Sun-bin.

112
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:42,021
-Let's go to the meeting together.
-Sure.

113
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:46,692
By the way, have you heard
anything about Ms. Han?

114
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,612
So-ra? She's in the conference room.

115
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,012
Wait.

116
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,684
I think we have somebody here
who wasn't invited to our meeting.

117
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:25,898
Secretary Kim,

118
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:27,608
get her out.

119
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,491
Please leave.

120
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:43,583
Why?

121
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,546
You know why I'm angry at you.

122
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,924
And what reason is that, Ms. Han?

123
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,919
I thought you were going to
tell me the reason.

124
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,675
Watch your damn attitude!

125
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,559
Have you given it some thought?

126
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,605
Why all of this is happening to you?

127
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,857
You crazy bitch.

128
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,533
She's been acting out of line,

129
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,619
so I'm trying to correct her manners.

130
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,121
While we were preparing
for the events together,

131
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,792
she would not only talk back to me
but step way out of bounds.

132
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,461
It must have slipped her mind…

133
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,674
that I own her husband's workplace.

134
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,510
Did I?

135
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,930
I didn't know.

136
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:26,519
From now on, I don't want to see her
at any classes or events.

137
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:30,439
Until I decide
how to deal with her formally,

138
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,858
if any of you show her kindness

139
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,236
or include her in your group,

140
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,613
I'll consider it
a challenge to my authority.

141
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,411
I ruined the good mood, didn't I?

142
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,081
But it's important
to correct your subordinates.

143
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,094
Why are you still here?

144
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,769
Director Cha.

145
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,438
We need to start the meeting,

146
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,940
so could you lock the door

147
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:14,567
once our uninvited guest leaves?

148
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,364
Please leave.

149
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,305
-Could you check this one?
-Sure.

150
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,932
Let's see the next page.

151
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,144
There's a typo right here.
Could you fix that as well?

152
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,812
-Sure.
-Sure thing.

153
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:56,066
Are things going the way you wanted
with So-ra?

154
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,658
Hey.

155
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,993
Have a seat.

156
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:22,468
I figured we both needed a moment
to put our cards on the table.

157
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,429
Isn't that right?

158
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,981
The recent events
have made me realize something.

159
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:43,364
I now see…

160
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,076
how inexperienced you are.

161
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,497
I would've never found out
about your fling with Yoon-gyeom

162
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,748
if you hadn't told me about it.

163
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,252
I'm assuming you had me find out
for one of two reasons.

164
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,547
Either Yoon-gyeom wasn't acting
the way you wanted,

165
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,799
or you wanted
to drive the two of us apart.

166
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,595
Is that really the conclusion you came to?

167
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,102
Yoon-gyeom was just
following his desires momentarily.

168
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,522
Do you really think
that will end our relationship?

169
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,358
We're the owners
of the top company in the country.

170
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,197
Do continue.

171
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:32,621
There have been countless women
who wanted to seduce him.

172
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,874
I don't blame them.

173
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,585
I bet anyone would want to destroy
our marriage and take Yoon-gyeom.

174
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:40,588
As if there's anything left to destroy.

175
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,760
You haven't gotten
a single hug from him in years,

176
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,972
stalked him because you were so paranoid,

177
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,933
and checked that
pearl makeup powder so anxiously.

178
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,602
Or am I mistaken?

179
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,231
You're right.

180
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,901
My relationship with him
has been greatly problematic.

181
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,820
I needed something
groundbreaking to happen.

182
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,909
And you did that for me.

183
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,251
He tried so hard to comfort me all night.

184
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,506
It was great, really.

185
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,344
We did argue a little bit,

186
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,181
but we've decided to grow tighter
after this slight stumble.

187
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,643
They do say the calm comes after a storm.

188
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:38,437
What is it?

189
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,898
Is that not the case with your marriage?

190
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,237
Let's stop beating around the bush.

191
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,829
Do you know what I've been given
thanks to you?

192
00:15:57,873 --> 00:16:01,001
A shopping mall.

193
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,841
I'm even going to be involved
in the management.

194
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:12,638
A proper director
with full voting rights, at that.

195
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,728
Yoon-gyeom admitted his mistake

196
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,814
and said he won't let my pride suffer.

197
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,234
We've decided to pull through it
for our kids.

198
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,576
This is what real adults do.

199
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,122
Do you understand?

200
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:47,297
Now, let's talk about
why I had you come here.

201
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,847
I can't just let you off, can I?

202
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,392
You knew what you were getting into,
didn't you?

203
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,645
You have one hell of a resilience,

204
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,273
so it'll be thrilling for sure.

205
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,033
Honey.

206
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,492
Are you ready?

207
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,410
Of course.

208
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,331
How do I look today?

209
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,168
You look great.

210
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,713
Let Korea Exchange know
that we're on our way.

211
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:29,631
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

212
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,924
Let's go, honey.

213
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,867
CONGRATULATIONS ON LY PAY'S LISTING
ON THE NY STOCK EXCHANGE

214
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,285
NY STOCK EXCHANGE'S SUCCESSFUL REBOUND

215
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,090
The commemoration for LY Pay's
new listing on the NY Stock Exchange

216
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,467
took place at Korea Exchange today.

217
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,178
LY Pay's stocks have been hitting
their upper limits

218
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,722
and setting new records daily.

219
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,558
The stocks of LY's subsidiaries
are at an all-time high as well.

220
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:24,686
Korea Exchange held the ceremony
with the expectation

221
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,773
that the listing of LY Pay
on the NY Stock Exchange

222
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,025
would also be beneficial
for the Korean economy.

223
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,361
Mr. Kang and his wife
have been invited to the Blue House

224
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,196
for a luncheon later in the afternoon.

225
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,698
How can a wife act that way

226
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,325
after finding out about
her husband's affair?

227
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:41,787
I can't tell if they're just
putting on a show

228
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,081
or if they're truly in love.

229
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,502
Did Mr. Kang say anything after that?

230
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,799
Did he call you?

231
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:05,310
Things might not go as we had planned.

232
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,856
I don't think they'll be getting
a divorce anytime soon.

233
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,442
And considering what she did
to your mother,

234
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,404
it worries me what she might do to you.

235
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,364
Let's try to come up with a plan somehow.

236
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,418
I won't regret anything,

237
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:31,920
even if the worst happens to me.

238
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,717
After all, Lee La-el

239
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,803
has never even existed.

240
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,266
If there's one thing that worries me,

241
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,226
it would be Ms. Jang.

242
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,149
The person who I'm calling my mother.

243
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,696
If something happens to me,

244
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,283
she'll need somebody to replace me.

245
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:06,288
Do you think you could do that?

246
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,625
Are you not worried about yourself?

247
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,218
I'm sorry for burdening you.

248
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,636
No, don't be sorry.

249
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,015
I told you that I'll do anything you want.

250
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:42,866
I'll let you rest.

251
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:45,535
Thank you for everything.

252
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:56,546
La-el.

253
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:17,359
You once asked me
why I'm being so kind to you.

254
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,281
I've been keeping my feelings hidden…

255
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:25,909
so you wouldn't feel pressured.

256
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,287
But I've changed my mind.

257
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,831
I want to make you feel pressured.

258
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,172
How can you think
that nobody will feel sad for you

259
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,300
if you disappear from this world?

260
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:44,845
Even if there's nobody else,
I'm still here.

261
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,972
You are…

262
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,226
more precious to me…

263
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,479
than myself.

264
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:01,778
I love you.

265
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,709
After meeting you again

266
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,838
and spending time with you,

267
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:26,470
I've realized how important you are to me.

268
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,306
It doesn't matter to me

269
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,600
that Mr. Kang and Jin-wook
are next to you.

270
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,685
I just want you to be safe,

271
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,272
and I'd do anything for you.

272
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,192
That's all that I wish for.

273
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,739
Even if everything falls to pieces
and everybody leaves you,

274
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,366
I'll stay by your side.

275
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,250
Mr. Seo.

276
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,379
-I…
-I'm not asking for a response.

277
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:03,799
I just want you to know.

278
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,303
And I want you to feel pressured.

279
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:12,182
Feel pressured to keep living

280
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,144
because there's somebody
in this world who loves you this much.

281
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,108
And I'm not going to act
like your shadow from now on.

282
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm going to do whatever it takes.

283
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,824
I'll help you to end your revenge

284
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,993
safely and quickly.

285
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,248
And when you've accomplished
everything that you want,

286
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,750
then please give me an answer.

287
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,130
Until then, don't you dare
get yourself hurt or in danger

288
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,095
because I'll be waiting for you.

289
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,611
This is Congressman Seo.

290
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,072
I'll be happy to accept the position

291
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,117
of the president's chief secretary.

292
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,454
Thanks for the meal. I'll go get my bag.

293
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,622
Sure.

294
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,670
I'm going to meet with a lawyer today.

295
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,591
We're going to discuss what Mr. Kang did.

296
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,594
You're meeting with a lawyer?

297
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,095
Yes.

298
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,098
Mr. Kang used coercion
that was backed up by his power.

299
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,227
He tried to threaten our family
using his position as chairman.

300
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,812
I can't let him get away with it.

301
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,238
Hello.

302
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,241
Ms. Han?

303
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,202
Hello, Ms. Han.

304
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,286
Oh…

305
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,456
Yes, ma'am. I'll see you at work then.

306
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:00,832
All right.

307
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:04,669
Ms. Han wants to meet with me.

308
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:06,922
She told me
to come to the director's office.

309
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,940
La-el is very close to making
So-ra get a divorce.

310
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,233
Tell Yoon-gyeom

311
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,778
that La-el is Lee Tae-joon's daughter.

312
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,488
Do it as soon as you can.

313
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,634
The economy isn't doing well
because of the semiconductor issue,

314
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,720
so I'm very happy about your achievement.

315
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,055
Thank you.

316
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,682
It's an honor to be here.

317
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,892
Congratulations, Chairman Kang.

318
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,145
-Good job, So-ra.
-Thanks, Auntie.

319
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,773
Oh, sorry! I'm just used to
calling you that.

320
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,692
It's fine.

321
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,237
So-ra's mother was my best friend.

322
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,906
She's like a daughter to me.

323
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:17,492
You've heard, right?

324
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,995
Congressman Seo

325
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:22,414
will be taking on
the duties of the chief secretary.

326
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,332
He hasn't been formally appointed yet,

327
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,668
but we wanted him
to start working as soon as possible.

328
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,423
My first task will be to hold
the World Economic Council Assembly.

329
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,134
I feel that I'll be asking
for your advice very often.

330
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:35,927
I'll be happy to help.

331
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,347
Since you went to the same school,

332
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,474
I'm sure that you'll work together well.

333
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,684
I'm very excited.

334
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,750
ROAD TO THE BLUE HOUSE

335
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,466
I'm waiting in front of the Blue House.

336
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,885
Yes.

337
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,515
Ms. Jang was also a victim
of the LY semiconductor incident.

338
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,352
I found pictures of the other victims too.

339
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,853
Would you like to take a look?

340
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:27,771
Sure.

341
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,398
Yes.

342
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,317
All right, let's do that.

343
00:28:17,695 --> 00:28:19,114
We're going to GL Hotel.

344
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:20,573
Yes, sir.

345
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,676
Mr. Kang.

346
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,393
-What is this?
-Just take a look.

347
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:54,983
Who are you?

348
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,711
I've been dreaming the same nightmare
for so many years.

349
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,466
And the dream always ends horribly.

350
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,276
Mr. Kang.

351
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,843
So why did you ask to meet me here?

352
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,763
Could you take the lead role
of the Korean businessmen

353
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,848
at the meeting?

354
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,854
-But that's such an important…
-If you agree to do it,

355
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,190
then I'd like to
leave the role to you completely.

356
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:24,322
So I brought along some data
that you might want to take a look at.

357
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,417
GLOBAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS

358
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,504
When did you prepare all this?

359
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:41,130
I didn't do much.

360
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:44,592
As you'll see, it's very incomplete.

361
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,682
Since you're giving me
so much of your trust,

362
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,893
I'll make sure to help you
as much as I can

363
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,812
for your first assignment.

364
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,565
That's great.

365
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:11,160
MR. KANG YOON-GYEOM

366
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,416
Mr. Kang, I have something
to discuss with you.

367
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,293
Would you like to have a drink with me?

368
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:19,419
Sure.

369
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,505
All right, let's do that.

370
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,353
Mr. Kang.

371
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,069
-What is this?
-Just take a look.

372
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,002
Mr. Kang.

373
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,476
Somebody gave Mr. Kang an envelope.

374
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,393
An envelope?

375
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:21,147
I stopped him from opening it,

376
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,108
but that man was also a victim of LY.

377
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,526
Do you think you might know who he is?

378
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,617
Could you give Chairman Kang a call?

379
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,286
I'll take care of the envelope.

380
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:44,337
KIM SUN-BIN

381
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,119
When I saw you at the kindergarten,

382
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,913
I couldn't act
like I was happy to see you.

383
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,582
-You understand, don't you?
-Yes.

384
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,126
Let's meet soon.

385
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:26,337
Not at the usual place though.
Somewhere else.

386
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,839
Where?

387
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:30,341
There's a hotel
where I conduct a lot of my business.

388
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,969
Nobody will think it's strange

389
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,013
even if they see
either of us going in there.

390
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,642
You want to meet me at a hotel?

391
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:43,354
Yoon-gyeom was just
following his desires momentarily.

392
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,773
Do you really think
that will end our relationship?

393
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,235
We're the owners
of the top company in the country.

394
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:57,118
I miss you.

395
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,748
Are you drunk?

396
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:03,833
A little.

397
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,878
That's why I miss you even more.

398
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,797
I hope you get back home safely.

399
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,965
I'll call you again.

400
00:34:23,603 --> 00:34:26,731
Next week, I'm going to tell
the law firm about my true identity.

401
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,984
It would have been perfect
if we had the secret safe,

402
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,360
but I'll just have to wait

403
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,280
for the search and seizure
after the lawsuit.

404
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,202
Once I reveal that I was the person
behind the lawsuit, I can't stay here.

405
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:41,662
I can't just wait
for my identity to be exposed.

406
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,208
Will you leave

407
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,920
with me?

408
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,429
Give me some time, Ms. Jang.

409
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,934
Do you still have those nightmares

410
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,269
about you dying?

411
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,233
-Sometimes.
-I used to comfort you,

412
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,653
saying that the dreams
are different from reality.

413
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:17,156
I told you that you were strong
and that you would never get hurt.

414
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,783
But nowadays,

415
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,788
I find myself thinking
that there must be a reason

416
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:26,791
why you have those dreams.

417
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,710
You see, there's a poison

418
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,506
growing in your heart.

419
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:36,384
A poison that could be fatal

420
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,469
called love.

421
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:44,684
It's cliché to talk about love
ruining everything and killing somebody.

422
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,937
Love makes us weak.

423
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:52,150
I've known you since you were 15.

424
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,317
Even if you deny it,

425
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,195
what's important
is that I can still see it.

426
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,991
One day, your love…

427
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:05,746
could burn down everything
that you've built up so far.

428
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,608
I'll contact you again soon.

429
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,151
-I'll be waiting.
-All right.

430
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,111
See you next time.

431
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:54,003
LA-EL

432
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,468
Hey.

433
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,054
Thankfully, I got the envelope,

434
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,264
but I think

435
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:09,352
you might have to
take a look at this, La-el.

436
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:14,106
REPORT ON KIM SUN-BIN

437
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,402
Kim Sun-bin is the only daughter
of Lee Tae-joon, the CEO of GEDIKS.

438
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,737
Her real name is Lee La-el.

439
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,698
You need to know

440
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,451
who Sun-bin actually is, Mr. Kang.

441
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,623
One day, your love

442
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,835
could burn down everything
that you've built up so far.

443
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,215
The woman whom you call your mother

444
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,762
is the only person
who knows so much about you, isn't she?

445
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,752
I've given the papers to Mr. Kang.

446
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,434
Where have you been?

447
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,441
I'm going to reveal myself soon
and stand on the front lines.

448
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,027
There's a lot to prepare.

449
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,655
Ms. Jang.

450
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:29,158
You know,

451
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:31,118
my dreams…

452
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,080
aren't actually nightmares.

453
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:40,169
I'm fulfilling my wish in that dream

454
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:43,381
by taking the lives I wish to take.

455
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,717
Didn't you say that you die at the end?

456
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,599
I lied.

457
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:59,021
I take the lives of those I wish to take,

458
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,982
one by one.

459
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,276
At the very end of it all,

460
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:09,323
I capture the most evil one out of all.

461
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:14,745
That monster

462
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,957
is so cruel and persistent

463
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:19,917
that God Himself

464
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,128
gave up on her.

465
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,131
And that…

466
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,316
is myself.

467
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,199
I lied to you because I didn't want to
become a monster like them,

468
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,243
not even in my dreams.

469
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,083
I'll inevitably get blood on my hands.

470
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,588
And yet, I still wanted
to be seen as a good person.

471
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,345
Isn't it funny

472
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,514
how selfish humans can be?

473
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,726
But I've snapped out of it now.

474
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,190
What's truly frightening
isn't becoming a monster.

475
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,442
It's losing.

476
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,613
I need to do whatever I can
to win this horrible fight,

477
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,822
don't you think?

478
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,784
So…

479
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,414
I'll take your advice.

480
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,709
You're right.

481
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,546
I am in love with Mr. Kang.

482
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,132
A man and a woman.

483
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,469
I had never experienced anything like it.

484
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,263
My ability to reason became paralyzed.

485
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,059
It scared me.

486
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,187
I also agree that using my body
is the only plan that I have.

487
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,902
So how about this?

488
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,746
We have too many opponents,
and they're all so powerful.

489
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:26,669
There are too many variables…

490
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:32,132
that I failed to account for.

491
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,678
I can't control all of those variables,

492
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,890
but I can

493
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,726
take over the mind.

494
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,312
Yoon-gyeom has already given me his heart.

495
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,523
That means I can completely destroy him.

496
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,318
I can also make them
doubt and kill each other.

497
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:58,158
I need to kill those bastards
who made my life

498
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:02,705
a living hell.

499
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:07,835
I need to do it…

500
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,256
myself.

501
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,278
I'll make sure to succeed.

502
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,446
DAD

503
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:09,832
LY DIRECTOR HAN SO-RA

504
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,437
These are Chairman Kang's schedule

505
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,938
and his call history
from the past few days.

506
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,275
I don't see anything problematic.

507
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,401
RECENT CALLS

508
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,405
Okay.

509
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,917
KIM JEONG-CHUL

510
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,016
So-ra.

511
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,977
I tried to calm down your father,
but it's not working.

512
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,979
He's on his way to see you.

513
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:51,850
Drive!

514
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,101
Hurry!

515
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,649
Wait, So-ra!

516
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:04,488
KIM JEONG-CHUL

517
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,463
Yes, Mr. Kim.

518
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:25,759
What did my dad say?

519
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,265
The press is calling it
the "fight between the in-laws."

520
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:32,641
He's in a terrible mood right now

521
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,935
because of the news
of how he got screwed over.

522
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,813
I covered for you
with some excuses for now,

523
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,314
but you can't run away anymore.

524
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,025
You need to meet with him now.

525
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:46,530
It might be better now,
now that you're a director

526
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,990
with the mall and everything.

527
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,651
STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

528
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:26,570
You idiot!

529
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,953
You goddamn moron.
You useless piece of crap!

530
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:36,455
You dumbass!

531
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,208
You do nothing but eat and put on makeup.

532
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,544
Yet you didn't know anything
about your own husband?

533
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,379
You useless piece of crap!

534
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:50,218
She'll only learn after
she's taught a lesson in the Classroom.

535
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:51,470
I've been going too easy on her.

536
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,055
Take her there!

537
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:30,425
So-ra.

538
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,055
Mom.

539
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,433
Dad.

540
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,519
I'm a director now.

541
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,604
I've got my shopping mall too!

542
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,440
I'll make sure that you get a share, Dad.

543
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,527
Yoon-gyeom listens to me nowadays.

544
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,737
Please give me another chance

545
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,699
and just give me some time.

546
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,908
Please?

547
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,369
Please, Dad.

548
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,578
Mr. Han.

549
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:01,748
So-ra has achieved impressive results
with her hard work.

550
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:02,833
You idiot!

551
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,295
It's too late now, after all that brawl
I got into with Bon-geun.

552
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:11,341
Finding a way to get back at Yoon-gyeom
will be much easier than punishing her.

553
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,720
Damn it!

554
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,222
Mr. Han.

555
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:18,432
Please forgive her.

556
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,225
Just let it go this time.

557
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:24,938
Damn it!

558
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:32,696
So-ra, are you okay?

559
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,197
Are you all right?

560
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,390
SUN-BIN

561
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,350
Let's practice for our performance.

562
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,603
Meet me at the studio tomorrow.

563
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,215
Let Korea Exchange know

564
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,633
that we're on our way.

565
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,634
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

566
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,360
I want to tear them apart into pieces.

567
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,562
They had an affair,
yet they're acting like nothing happened.

568
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,024
But I was helpless because of Dad.

569
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,485
I would have killed them all,

570
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:22,657
but I had to hold myself back
to become the director of the mall.

571
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,037
I despise them all.

572
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,915
This is so unfair.

573
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,043
It's driving me insane.

574
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,611
I saw the security camera footage
from the day of the bag incident.

575
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,780
You switched the kids' bags, didn't you?

576
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,740
How could you?

577
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:06,284
I just don't get it.

578
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,286
She was probably trying to drive us apart

579
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:11,247
so that she could become
a member of the upper class.

580
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,001
Unbelievable.

581
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:17,629
I didn't think you were like that.
I'm so disappointed.

582
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:19,673
The Liyan Foundation
held a council meeting,

583
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,925
and they decided to kick Bo-ram out.

584
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:23,385
The performance team will be disbanded,

585
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:26,012
and your position as the vice parent
representative will be taken away.

586
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,274
What's so funny?

587
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,320
You've tried so hard.

588
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,905
You really didn't have to.

589
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,325
I was going to disband
the performance team anyway.

590
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:49,244
It's useless to me now.

591
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,000
You don't need to come anymore.

592
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,086
Right.

593
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,797
Getting kicked out
is a different story though.

594
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,551
It won't be me getting kicked out.

595
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,303
It'll be Ms. Han.

596
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,184
Don't you want to know

597
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,228
why she hates me so much?

598
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:18,356
I envy you two.

599
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:21,651
The best entertainment
is watching others fight, isn't it?

600
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,822
You can all leave now.

601
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:41,755
By the way, what's the name
of the music you sent me?

602
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,759
He was too busy to do anything romantic,

603
00:55:46,342 --> 00:55:47,677
but the mood was nice.

604
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,037
You've finally lost it, haven't you?

605
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,253
You think so?

606
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,096
Look at your face.

607
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,019
Mrs. Han!

608
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,187
What are you doing?

609
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:42,357
There are dozens of security cameras here.

610
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,984
Are you really going to hit a woman?

611
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,658
You can act like a nice bodyguard at home.

612
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,855
You're still here?

613
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:34,951
What a psychopath.

614
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,844
A psychopath?

615
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:10,069
There's no need to deal with her, ma'am.

616
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:10,987
Let's leave.

617
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,287
You're pathetic.

618
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,414
I won't waste my time.

619
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:10,255
MR. KANG

620
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:15,260
One,

621
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,387
two,

622
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,888
three.

623
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,181
MR. KANG

624
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,773
Why did you hang up?

625
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,733
I miss you so much.

626
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,029
I called wanting to see you,

627
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,657
but I hesitated.

628
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,159
I didn't want to disturb you.

629
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,163
Should we meet?

630
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:14,193
SUN-BIN

631
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,155
She's finally lost it.

632
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,959
What makes you think
you can call like this?

633
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:32,211
Then you can tell her.

634
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,839
So-ra.

635
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:38,259
You'll never think about
why this is happening, will you?

636
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,262
Then I guess I am a psychopath.

637
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,222
You were right.

638
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,433
But that means…

639
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,021
I could do something
completely crazy, doesn't it?

640
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:57,070
I'm going to do

641
01:00:58,071 --> 01:01:01,199
my very best to ruin your life.

642
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,287
You'll try to stop me

643
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:09,123
while I try to break through.

644
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:14,796
Who do you imagine will win?

645
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:37,336
Did you really think
you were in control of everything?

646
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,254
Let's talk now.

647
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:40,631
I'm Han So-ra.

648
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,051
I asked you a question.

649
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,637
Why haven't you told your dad about me?

650
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:48,681
Secret?

651
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,725
Don't make me angrier than I already am.

652
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,977
Chaebols aren't anything special.

653
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:55,897
I want to know what you really want.

654
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,982
I don't want to be hidden anymore.

655
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,400
I want to be your woman.
