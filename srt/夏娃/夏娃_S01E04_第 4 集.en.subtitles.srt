1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:03,104
You two are going to
fight over the bandoneon.

4
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,694
Why do you need Piazzolla's bandoneon?

5
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,865
You're definitely hiding something.

6
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:15,867
But what is it?

7
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:17,535
Who are you?

8
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,084
What do you have buried inside your heart?

9
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:30,173
What are you hiding,
and why is it hurting you so much?

10
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:45,480
Are there any noteworthy news articles
about LY Group?

11
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,275
"Kang Yoon-gyeom is the younger son,
but he kicked out his older brother

12
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,444
and rose to the position of chairman."

13
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,073
"However, our analysis shows
that the successor may change at any time

14
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,951
depending on who Mr. Kang Bon-geun's
inheritance goes to."

15
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:01,412
Well, everybody knows that.

16
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,457
These articles resurface every year
around the ancestral ceremony.

17
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:07,377
Is there anything new
about Kang Yoon-gyeom's mother?

18
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,795
Is her illness getting worse?

19
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,214
It's been seven years since
she was hospitalized due to a stroke,

20
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,632
but her condition hasn't improved.

21
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,303
Anything that has to do
with Kang Yoon-gyeom or LY,

22
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,097
we must know about.

23
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,188
Ms. Han decided
that the themes for this year's events

24
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,608
would be "grand," "remarkable,"
and "fancy."

25
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,279
Starting with the employment
information session and CMN documentary,

26
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:37,323
our goal is to promote Korean education,
host recitals with EBS,

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,951
and hold the Global Speech Competition
in Korea.

28
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,453
Here are the speakers
at the employment info session.

29
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:46,749
Ms. Han wanted to invite
only the best in each occupation

30
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,586
and wished to invite guests
from all over the world,

31
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,963
not just from Korea.

32
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,883
We've already decided
on many of our esteemed guests.

33
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,427
Ms. Han is planning on having these guests

34
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,804
become external mentors for our children

35
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,806
so that they can become
future connections.

36
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,545
By the way, So-ra.

37
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:36,341
Is there a reason why the spot
for "Congressman" is left empty?

38
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,678
There's ex-Prime Minister Han Pan-ro.

39
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,683
I don't want it to be predictable.

40
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,603
I want to invite somebody
who will pose a challenge.

41
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,814
Seo Eun-pyeong,
the next presidential candidate

42
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:52,815
of the ruling party.

43
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,363
My father and husband
both want to connect with him,

44
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:01,616
but he never mingles with chaebols.

45
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,618
It won't be easy.

46
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:05,703
But if I manage to do it,

47
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,623
my father might give me a gift.

48
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,630
Hasn't your father already given you
everything that you need?

49
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:17,215
Is there something else
that you want from him?

50
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:20,385
His trust.

51
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,430
I've been begging him
for a department store for years,

52
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,807
but he hasn't given me anything.

53
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,558
He thinks I'll mess up.

54
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,824
Shall I try recruiting Mr. Seo?

55
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:46,869
How would you do that?

56
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,080
Where there's a will, there's a way.

57
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,000
You've done so much for me, So-ra.

58
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,626
I want to meet your expectations.

59
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,635
MR. SEO

60
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,815
Hello.

61
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,358
Mr. Seo?

62
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,697
I'm calling you to ask you for a favor.

63
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,824
I apologize for what happened last time.

64
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,044
I'm looking for a congressman to come
to Liyan's employment information session.

65
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:41,549
Would you be able to come, by any chance?

66
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,260
Well…

67
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,306
I don't usually participate
in events like that,

68
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:53,770
but I'll give it a thought.

69
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:58,084
This year,

70
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:02,630
in the year of 2021,

71
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,883
October 19th.

72
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,262
Kang Bon-geun.

73
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,470
Chi-gyeom,

74
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:53,181
why do you keep delaying
the opening ceremony for the mall?

75
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,266
The construction is all done.

76
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:57,477
How much longer
are you going to waste time?

77
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,689
Well, I…

78
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,317
I'm looking for the right time to do it.

79
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,402
And when is that, exactly?

80
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,865
Yoon-gyeom, are you sure
you're helping your brother out?

81
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,326
Because of the death
of that construction worker,

82
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,453
the press in Seoul
is keeping a close watch.

83
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,497
A good public perception
is vital for a mall.

84
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,832
I think reaching a settlement
and putting an end to the issue

85
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:21,792
is our top priority right now.

86
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,881
What are you glaring at?

87
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,302
Talk it over with Yoon-gyeom.

88
00:08:32,261 --> 00:08:34,388
And you need to help your brother
above everything else.

89
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,306
All right?

90
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,058
All right.

91
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:38,643
Yes, Father.

92
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,270
So none of you have managed

93
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,981
to fulfill your late grandfather's wish
this year.

94
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,734
How do none of you have any grandsons yet?

95
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,823
So-ra.

96
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,408
How old are you this year?

97
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,205
I'm 43 in international age, Mr. Kang.

98
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,041
What about you?

99
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,794
Using international age can be confusing.

100
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:07,129
Use Korean age, all right?

101
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,132
I'm 37, Mr. Kang.

102
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,844
So-ra is 45.

103
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,935
I want a grandson from either one of you.

104
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,909
Goodness, I've said it so many times.

105
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:40,871
-Said what?
-I don't know why he likes to eat so much.

106
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,876
-That's so funny.
-He never listens to me.

107
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,005
I have no idea why.

108
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:49,922
Seriously.

109
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,970
Oh, no!

110
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,101
-So-ra!
-I'm so sorry, Soo-jung.

111
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,354
I don't usually do chores,
so I have a really weak grip.

112
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,689
You did that on purpose.

113
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,776
Soo-jung, don't say things like that.

114
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,903
I didn't do it on purpose.

115
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,531
Are you saying the bowl
threw itself off the table?

116
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:16,866
You're just trying to find fault with me.

117
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,743
Are you trying to make me look bad?

118
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,329
Do you have something against me?

119
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,455
So-ra!

120
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,625
Come with me.

121
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,726
You didn't have to make a scene.

122
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,354
Do you know how stressful
these ancestral ceremonies are?

123
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,065
They've caused me
indigestion and depression.

124
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,444
Why do you look like
you're not stressed at all?

125
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,945
You're the one who needs a son,

126
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,365
so why am I the one
who's getting stressed over it?

127
00:10:57,448 --> 00:10:58,783
We've tried everything.

128
00:10:58,866 --> 00:10:59,909
Well, try harder.

129
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,118
Try what harder?

130
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,828
Just think about how old you are.

131
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,249
So it's all my fault?

132
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,671
If Soo-jung gives birth to a son
before me,

133
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,091
I bet you'll say
you lost the company because of me.

134
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,261
Why can't you tell him
that it's ridiculous how he wants a son?

135
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,514
You got the company
because you're smarter than Chi-gyeom,

136
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,099
so why does he want a son now?

137
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,558
Don't you know how he is?

138
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:26,811
That's enough. Stop it.

139
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,979
It makes me so upset and furious.

140
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,606
Why are you so calm?

141
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:34,568
What if Chi-gyeom's share
becomes larger than yours?

142
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:39,490
I don't understand you sometimes.

143
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,164
Since when did you care so much
about our company shares?

144
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,125
Five years ago?

145
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,001
Before our marriage?

146
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,423
Or was it after?

147
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,094
-Yoon-gyeom.
-Clean up. We're going home.

148
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,070
Sun-bin.

149
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:22,450
I'm about to explode.
This is driving me crazy.

150
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,411
What is it, So-ra? What's wrong?

151
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,413
These ancestral ceremonies
are driving me insane.

152
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,666
I hate Yoon-gyeom's side of the family.

153
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:32,668
What's the point of preparing a meal
for somebody who's dead?

154
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,295
And so late at night too!

155
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,048
This hanbok looks unstylish,
and I have to do the dishes.

156
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:41,135
Plus, they're always telling me
to give birth to a son.

157
00:12:41,635 --> 00:12:43,929
This is the 21st century
and they're still obsessed with sons.

158
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,017
Isn't the ancestral ceremony in itself
a lot of work?

159
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,269
You must be so upset.

160
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,855
You know what really pisses me off?

161
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,858
On days that we're here,
Yoon-gyeom never takes my side.

162
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,152
That's what really drives me mad.

163
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,655
I'm sure he just acts like that
in front of his elders.

164
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,073
There's no doubt he's on your side.

165
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,498
-Let's just go shopping tomorrow.
-Sure.

166
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,334
Let's take the kids too.
It'll boost your mood.

167
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:32,394
What did you say, So-ra?

168
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,689
The successor for the group could change?

169
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,318
Mr. Kang has been threatening me
with it for a while.

170
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:40,986
If I can't have a son,

171
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,572
he's going to pass on
his company shares to Chi-gyeom's.

172
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,992
If his shares go to them,
then we'll be in second place.

173
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,080
Chi-gyeom's family is
usually challenging us too.

174
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:55,251
So it makes me really nervous
when he threatens me like that.

175
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,714
Then just have a son before they do.

176
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:02,716
Do you think I haven't been trying?

177
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,428
Of course, Yoon-gyeom
won't let them step all over him.

178
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:09,306
But it's such a stress
every time we have the ancestral ceremony.

179
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,518
It takes two to tango, you know?

180
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,353
I can't have a son all by myself.

181
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,772
For a while,

182
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,400
Yoon-gyeom didn't even touch me.

183
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,321
Thankfully, things have gotten better
between us lately.

184
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,035
I…

185
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,705
made a reservation for a vaginoplasty.

186
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,416
Isn't that surgery really painful?

187
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,961
I need to try harder.

188
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,088
Even aside from the company shares,

189
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,216
I need to give birth to a son
to keep Yoon-gyeom by my side.

190
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,303
So-ra.

191
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,390
I know a better solution
that doesn't require any surgery.

192
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,143
What is it?

193
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,607
I'll tell you when we're by ourselves.

194
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,696
Shall we talk about it at home?

195
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,489
Let's go to my place.

196
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,434
I heard there's a new brand from Italy.

197
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,394
Yes, ma'am. We'll get that ready for you.

198
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,563
-I'll come by next week.
-Thank you, ma'am.

199
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,568
I'm finally going to Mr. Kang's house.

200
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,028
I'm on my way there right now.

201
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:46,946
MOM

202
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,828
Prepare some snacks for us,
and you can all go home.

203
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,455
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

204
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,369
So the tango helps you get
strong core muscles?

205
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:39,415
It works your inner muscles
and makes your body feel alive.

206
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,750
The tango helps foster vitality, too,

207
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,628
since there's a lot of physical contact
between men and women.

208
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,507
A dancer even got pregnant
after getting diagnosed with infertility.

209
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,969
Come on, don't hype it up too much.

210
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,681
It may be a slight exaggeration,

211
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,599
but it still happened.

212
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,935
Okay, keep going.

213
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,563
The dresses are so pretty too.

214
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm sure Mr. Kang would love it

215
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,235
if you tried on a tango dress.

216
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,656
My social position
is important to me though.

217
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,159
What if they say I've become a dancer?

218
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:23,083
Maybe the mothers can do a performance
at the info session.

219
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,585
Wouldn't that be a good excuse?

220
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:26,879
Look at you.

221
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:29,548
You could be a businesswoman.

222
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,387
It can just be the two of us
during the CMN shooting.

223
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,640
I'll step out for the group performance,
and you can be the main dancer.

224
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,268
I'll make you look like a queen.

225
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,645
Dam-ri and Ji-hee
will look like your servants.

226
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,774
Your husband's affection and a son.

227
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,693
You can get your hands on both.

228
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,619
Is there anything you want?

229
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,788
Your husband's promotion?

230
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,623
What do you want?

231
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,958
Name it, and it's yours.

232
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,755
Thanks, So-ra.

233
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,298
Where is everybody?

234
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,676
Honey.

235
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,898
We were having a meeting
for the Parent Association.

236
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,283
It’s getting late. I better get going.

237
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,785
Your husband is picking you up.

238
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,911
You should stay longer.

239
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,540
I don't want to bother Mr. Kang
while he's resting.

240
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,126
What do you think, honey?

241
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,714
It's fine with me.

242
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,677
I think I'm drunk. My face feels hot.

243
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,138
I'm going to go fix my makeup.

244
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,848
Can you get the wine glasses ready?

245
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,391
Just a moment, honey.

246
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,199
I'll get the glasses.

247
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,868
Are you crazy?

248
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:28,662
This is my house.

249
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,790
Why are you doing something so drastic?

250
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,668
What do you want?

251
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,921
I don't want anything.

252
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,049
You just…

253
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,469
make me forget

254
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,224
where I am and who I am.

255
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,311
So it's just lust?

256
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,942
Everybody who's ever approached me
had an ulterior motive.

257
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,986
You're no exception.

258
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,905
And I'm going to find out what that is.

259
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,969
Sir, it's me, Jang Jin-wook.

260
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,554
Hello, Mr. Jang.

261
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,694
There must've been a reason
I was called the May Queen in college.

262
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,325
I have to brag about myself

263
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:50,243
because my husband never does it for me.

264
00:22:52,245 --> 00:22:54,956
I bet you've always been
like royalty, Ms. Han.

265
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,375
You're so graceful.

266
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,544
I could never be like you.

267
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,005
Yes, in fact…

268
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,340
Sir.

269
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:06,802
I think every woman
would want to be like Ms. Han.

270
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,220
Why won't you brag about her?

271
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,515
You can brag about your wife first.

272
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,477
How did the two of you first meet?

273
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,735
I was on a bus
returning from a business trip,

274
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,281
and this beautiful college student
was sitting next to me.

275
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,368
That's when I fell in love with her.

276
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,037
That's so romantic.

277
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:40,043
I was head over heels in love
from the moment we met.

278
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,172
Still, I can't believe you're already
a mother to a kindergartener.

279
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,174
Don't you think you got married too early?

280
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,385
Was it a shotgun wedding?

281
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,011
No, of course not.

282
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,014
Her nickname is the Conservative.

283
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,475
I didn't even get to touch her
before we got married.

284
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,310
We had our child right after though.

285
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:04,067
My first impression of you as a dancer
wasn't too great,

286
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,820
but I agree you are a very naive one.

287
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:12,325
Since you're so good at the tango,
I have a question for you.

288
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,330
Do you know the legend
of Piazzolla's bandoneon?

289
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:28,216
No.

290
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,135
What is it?

291
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,846
It's that if you play
Piazzolla's bandoneon,

292
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,099
you can save a soul

293
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,643
that died an unjust death.

294
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,064
How do you know something like that?

295
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,087
That's a beautiful story.

296
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:09,007
Is there a soul that you'd like to comfort

297
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,677
with Piazzolla's bandoneon?

298
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,764
No.

299
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,227
I don't have any
tear-jerking stories like that.

300
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,813
What about you?

301
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,150
Do you have a soul you'd like to save?

302
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:35,242
I don't.

303
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,874
She just dances all the time.
She doesn't care about anything else.

304
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,501
Do you still dance?

305
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:46,294
I go to tango clubs for fun

306
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,881
and do performances
to pay for Bo-ram's education.

307
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,093
Does it not make you nervous
when she goes out to dance?

308
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:56,638
Sun-bin cares about our family
more than anything else.

309
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:58,181
I know that better than anybody.

310
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,279
I'm sorry for staying so late, sir.

311
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,447
I'll get the car. Wait here.

312
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,465
It felt like I was being interrogated.

313
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,807
Do you know about La Boca, by any chance?

314
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,102
That's the birthplace of the tango.

315
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,604
It's a port district in Buenos Aires.

316
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,232
I don't.

317
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:52,819
It's understandable.

318
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:57,073
It's a city for commoners.
Of course you wouldn't know.

319
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,412
The place where I perform
is also called La Boca.

320
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,377
I'd like to invite you to my performance.

321
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,340
Would you like to come this Saturday?

322
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:22,932
If you can make it,

323
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,812
we could spend some time alone.

324
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:47,916
I'll see you next time, sir.

325
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,167
See you.

326
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,781
Imagine that you're raising
your chest from the pit of your stomach

327
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,324
and straighten your core.

328
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,035
Put your weight on the front of your feet.

329
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,852
Straighten your chest and shoulders
a little more.

330
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,367
My goodness, So-ra.

331
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,578
Have you learned the ballet before?

332
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:08,288
Your movements are beautiful.

333
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:18,047
Hello, Ms. Han.

334
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,473
A tango performance?

335
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,226
I don't think it'll be that good
if we start learning it now.

336
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,604
Ms. Han said she'd do it.

337
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,693
How come?

338
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,907
Women her age tend to
want to go out and dance.

339
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,620
You wanted to mess with her, didn't you?

340
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,041
"LY Group's Ms. Han becomes a dancer."

341
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:57,587
Wouldn't that make a great headline?

342
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:01,591
We'll practice for a month,
then do a mock performance.

343
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,968
See if you like any of these dresses.

344
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,224
We're performing
after a month of practice?

345
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,226
Isn't that too early?

346
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:12,894
Exactly.

347
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:15,605
You may be in your twenties,
but we're in our thirties.

348
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,443
Careful, there's somebody here
who's even older than us.

349
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,029
Sorry, Ms. Han.

350
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,573
As long as your male partner is good,

351
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,200
you can look very skilled too.

352
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,423
These are the partners
we'll be performing with.

353
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,968
Hello, I'm Marco.

354
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,428
Hello, I'm Leo.

355
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,097
Hello, I'm Jerome.

356
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,322
Mr. Seo?

357
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,912
Thank you. Let's meet tomorrow then.

358
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,123
Sure.

359
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,793
Seo Eun-pyeong is coming to Liyan?

360
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,671
He's going to be a mentor
at the employment info session.

361
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,174
Does he know
you're the parent representative?

362
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:28,261
Of course. He's famous
for his attention to detail.

363
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,015
That's impressive, Mr. Han.

364
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,184
Wait, how did you manage to convince him?

365
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:39,480
I have someone just like Dad has you.

366
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:41,774
Who is it?

367
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,651
I'll introduce you to her later.

368
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,195
Do you still consider me untrustworthy?

369
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:48,573
No, of course not.

370
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,451
You're the best, So-ra.

371
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,493
This is Congressman Seo Eun-pyeong.

372
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,120
Hello, I'm Seo Eun-pyeong.

373
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,540
Welcome. I'm Cha Elissa,
the director of Liyan.

374
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,833
Nice to meet you.

375
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,753
I'm Han So-ra, the parent representative.

376
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,799
I'm sorry I haven't been
able to communicate with Mr. Kang

377
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,050
despite being a fellow alumnus.

378
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,928
I'm thankful for the opportunity
to meet you like this.

379
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:56,349
I've always thought
I'd get to see you someday.

380
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,809
Thank you for coming.

381
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,440
I've heard how impressive Liyan is,

382
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,526
but it exceeds my expectations.

383
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,988
I can't imagine coming here as a child.

384
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,698
You can't?

385
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:14,617
No.

386
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,160
Oh, I…

387
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,829
grew up in an orphanage.

388
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,586
I've never heard of that

389
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,880
even though a lot is known about you.

390
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,844
I never told anybody
since I didn't feel the need to.

391
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,640
I would've never imagined
since you used to be a lawyer.

392
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:43,146
I had a guardian
who let me take the bar exam.

393
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,900
He took care of me
even after the guardianship ended.

394
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,236
Right.

395
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,366
Lee La-el,
the person that I'm looking for,

396
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,871
is his daughter.

397
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,337
He was like…

398
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,800
a father to me.

399
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:17,513
He passed away a while ago,
but I want to repay my debt…

400
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,725
to his daughter, at the least.

401
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:31,069
I think you've seen
most of the kindergarten.

402
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,570
Let's go back inside, shall we?

403
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,989
I have something to tell you
about Mr. Kang.

404
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,537
This is information on him.

405
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,207
Why are you giving me this?

406
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:46,501
I have nothing to do with him.

407
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:47,710
Just take a look at it.

408
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,046
I'll explain later.

409
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:52,840
Mr. Seo!

410
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,516
Just take it.

411
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,983
Thank you for coming all this way.

412
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,699
I feel like I've seen her
somewhere before.

413
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,701
It's been a while,

414
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,829
Manager Kim.

415
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,165
Manager Kim?

416
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:28,751
You remembered me.

417
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,336
I'm touched, sir.

418
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,256
How could I forget?

419
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:40,471
I've always paid attention to you
as well, Mr. Seo.

420
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,975
You know, I think we're bound by fate.

421
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,352
I'm also the chairman
of the foundation for Liyan.

422
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,270
I see.

423
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,273
Shall we go inside?

424
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,066
-All right.
-Okay.

425
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,531
Mr. Seo gave this to you?

426
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,829
LY GROUP INVESTIGATION REPORT

427
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:08,666
FAMILY TREE OF KANG YOON-GYEOM

428
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,760
"Kang Yoon-gyeom's birth mother
was Lee Jae-eun, a housekeeper."

429
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,096
"Kang Bon-geun raised him
as a son born from his current wife

430
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,682
while hiding the secret behind his birth."

431
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:29,187
He was born out of wedlock?

432
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,869
No conglomerate in the country

433
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,165
has ever passed on the company
to a child born out of wedlock.

434
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,001
The biological child becomes the heir.

435
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,797
If he really was born out of wedlock,
then our plans may have to be corrected.

436
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,093
The successor for the group could change?

437
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,763
Mr. Kang has been threatening me
with it for a while.

438
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:04,680
If I can't have a son,

439
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,557
he's going to pass on
his company shares to Chi-gyeom's.

440
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:09,518
If his shares go to them,
then we'll be in second place.

441
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:13,064
So it makes me really nervous
when he threatens me like that.

442
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:19,862
I wanted to destroy LY
by using Kang Yoon-gyeom,

443
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,241
but if the rightful heir is somebody else…

444
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,542
I need to get some air.

445
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,940
Do you know the legend
of Piazzolla's bandoneon?

446
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,235
It's that if you play
Piazzolla's bandoneon,

447
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,738
you can save a soul

448
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,574
that died an unjust death.

449
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:06,492
LEE JAE-EUN

450
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:09,996
Is there a soul that you'd like to comfort
with Piazzolla's bandoneon?

451
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:13,332
What about you?

452
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,627
Do you have a soul you'd like to save?

453
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,548
I don't.

454
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:36,188
GUARDIAN MARIA

455
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,404
Hello.

456
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,240
I would like to talk to Maria.

457
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,787
I know that she's ill.

458
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:56,125
Could I get the name of the hospital?

459
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,420
I lived with her a long time ago.

460
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,507
Yes, all right.

461
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:07,053
Tell her that it's Sunny. She'll know.

462
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:08,888
Thank you.

463
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,736
This is so hard.

464
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,571
HAVE YOU STILL HEARD NOTHING FROM MARIA?

465
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,995
How tacky.

466
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,207
What is?

467
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,668
She just wants to get laid.

468
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:41,921
It's so disgusting.

469
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,427
Did you know that any kind of dancing
is fundamentally improper?

470
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:53,307
People who adhere
to the societal order don't dance.

471
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,559
So?

472
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,659
Don't you want to
destroy that order, So-ra?

473
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,246
You want to go back in time
to your honeymoon

474
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,997
and get pregnant before Chi-gyeom's wife.

475
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,629
You can practice it here.

476
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,965
Destroy the order of society,

477
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,134
and take everything that you want.

478
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:43,983
Would you like to try the abrazo?

479
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:13,512
Oh, my goodness.

480
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,598
You look so pretty
as if you're wearing a blush.

481
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,515
Do I?

482
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,436
It was fun dancing with a partner.

483
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,770
It was intense.

484
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:27,860
You should ask Mr. Kang
when he'll be home.

485
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,076
This is so annoying.

486
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,705
Is he busy?

487
00:41:49,965 --> 00:41:51,467
Doctor.

488
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,219
I need a session today.

489
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,846
I'll be right there.

490
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:01,268
Kongja and Sunja.

491
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,731
Why do you look so startled? Who was it?

492
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,650
It's my mother, sir.

493
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,819
You said she's battling cancer?

494
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,739
Why, is her condition worse?

495
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,116
No, she was just calling
to check in on me.

496
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:22,873
Kongja.

497
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,042
Kongja.

498
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,379
Here.

499
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:30,798
Can you pick Da-bi up and take her home?

500
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,508
I'm going to therapy.

501
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:34,593
Okay.

502
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,659
-Hello.
-Hello.

503
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,343
Da-bi.

504
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:20,514
I need to change the class schedule.
Is there a computer I could use?

505
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,392
A laptop would be fine too.

506
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,686
There's one in the study,

507
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:28,606
but you can't go in there
when Dad's not home.

508
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,734
I go in there all the time though.

509
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,487
Really, Da-bi? That's amazing.

510
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,381
Your dad's study looks so cool.

511
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,425
Da-bi.

512
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,302
Could you bring me your pointe shoes?

513
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:01,138
I'll take a look at your balance
before I go back home.

514
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,306
Okay.

515
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,817
LY has kept hard copies of records

516
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,737
ever since the former chairman
was in charge.

517
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,740
I heard there's a safe
where they've stored

518
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,950
handwritten account books.

519
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,370
If you can find the safe,

520
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:29,291
I'm certain you'll find
the account book for GEDIKS inside.

521
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,023
Ms. Kim!

522
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,861
I just remembered.

523
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,780
I hid the pointe shoes in the secret box.

524
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:43,407
You did?

525
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,806
I know the password too.

526
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:50,766
LOBBY TARGETS

527
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,757
SLUSH FUND DEPOSITS
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2021

528
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,841
PAID BY CASH

529
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,426
EX-PRIME MINISTER,
THE PRESIDENT OF KOREA UNIVERSITY…

530
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:31,682
Here are my pointe shoes.

531
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,897
-Welcome home, sir.
-Welcome back, sir.

532
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,067
Dad's home.

533
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:44,611
Sir.

534
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:46,321
Bo-ram's mother is here.

535
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,035
Where is she?

536
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:54,621
Where are you, Ms. Da-bi?

537
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:55,789
Let's go.

538
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:56,790
Maybe she's in the study.

539
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,208
Oh, no!

540
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,331
Dad…

541
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,384
Da-bi.

542
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:32,010
It's okay.

543
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,553
Did I scare you? I'm sorry.

544
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,933
It's all right.

545
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:40,435
I'm sorry for coming in here
without permission.

546
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,770
It's my fault.

547
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,898
I'm so sorry, Da-bi.

548
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,149
You should leave now.

549
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,204
It's okay. I'm sorry.

550
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,724
Did you look over the information?

551
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,978
Kang Yoon-gyeom is dangerous.

552
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,940
He'll do anything to get what he wants.

553
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,071
I'm a little tired today.

554
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,199
I would like you to leave.

555
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,493
I'll see you next time.

556
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:22,662
Pardon me if I disturbed you.

557
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:24,623
Bye, then.

558
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,974
La-el!

559
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,811
La-el, wake up!

560
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,522
-La-el, are you okay?
-Oh, my goodness!

561
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,023
-What do we do?
-Call an ambulance. Quick!

562
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,900
-Okay.
-La-el!

563
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,362
That wound…

564
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,079
Did you put a tattoo…

565
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,457
over the injury?

566
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:10,836
La-el.

567
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,765
It's a painful scar that'll last forever.

568
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,270
Why did you make it hurt even more?

569
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,941
Why do you keep
putting yourself through pain?

570
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:46,204
Some wounds can only heal…

571
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,459
if you silence them
with even greater pain.

572
00:52:58,466 --> 00:52:59,718
No.

573
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:01,928
That's not true.

574
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:04,598
I'm sure there's another way, La-el.

575
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,684
What you're doing right now

576
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,854
is far too dangerous.

577
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:17,527
If I were afraid,

578
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,197
I wouldn't have started any of it
in the first place.

579
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,366
Please, La-el.

580
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,743
Please,

581
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,829
leave.

582
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,462
If you get in my way, you won't be spared.

583
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:37,464
Leave.

584
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,013
Fine.

585
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,392
I won't get in your way.

586
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:52,145
But I have a favor to ask of you.

587
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:57,359
Remember one thing,
like how you wanted me to remember you.

588
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:02,030
I sent you away back then
because I couldn't protect you,

589
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,867
but things are different now.

590
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,452
I have the power to protect you.

591
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,162
So…

592
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,416
if you must go down this path,

593
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,922
then please remember me
when you're in need of help.

594
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,635
I want to help you, La-el.

595
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,349
Do you know
what the tallest barrier in the world is?

596
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,144
Tell me.

597
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,479
What do you think it is?

598
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,566
I think it's the Great Wall of China.

599
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,778
It's your husband's back when
he's lying there, facing away from you.

600
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,454
But you're probably too dumb
to know what that means.

601
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,165
SECRETARY KIM

602
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,005
What?

603
00:55:42,088 --> 00:55:43,465
Chairman Kang has left work early.

604
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,011
Okay.

605
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:03,568
You made a mark on my neck!

606
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,199
Damn it.

607
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,579
You idiot.

608
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,269
Honey.

609
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,481
Looks like Da-bi's sleeping.

610
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,860
I was visiting my dad.

611
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:50,240
My face is still red from his nagging.

612
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:52,867
Go rest.

613
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,327
I'll put Da-bi to bed.

614
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:23,374
MALFUNCTIONING BRAKES?
3 CARS COLLIDE IN THE CITY, 2 DEAD

615
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,251
MS. LEE AND HER OLDER SISTER
WERE KILLED IN ONE OF THE CARS,

616
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:28,296
WITH MS. LEE BEING A HOUSEKEEPER
AT ONE OF L GROUP'S HOUSES

617
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,224
Kang Yoon-gyeom is dangerous.

618
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,353
He'll do anything to get what he wants.

619
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:20,473
MALFUNCTIONING BRAKES?
3 CARS COLLIDE IN THE CITY, 2 DEAD

620
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,686
LATE IN THE EVENING,

621
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,854
3 CARS COLLIDED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CITY

622
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:30,275
Your mother was a lowly woman,
and so are you.

623
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,486
Do you think the son
of some pathetic housekeeper

624
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,697
is fit to be the chairman?

625
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:45,331
LA BOCA

626
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,710
LA BOCA

627
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,837
You asked me if I knew about La Boca.

628
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,424
I actually know that place very well.

629
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,719
I liked those streets
where vagrants wandered about

630
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:42,096
more than any luxurious hotel.

631
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,186
I wonder what will happen
if I give in to your seduction.

632
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:52,440
I'll probably act
like some lowlife from La Boca.

633
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,568
You'll be all right with that?

634
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,323
I'll give you the chance

635
01:01:01,032 --> 01:01:02,158
to run away.

636
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,912
A chance to be fondly remembered
by your husband.

637
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:06,871
A chance to not…

638
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:12,126
die like the poor housekeeper on the news.

639
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,865
I'm not running away.

640
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,328
I just want you.

641
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:18,836
MARIA

642
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:23,424
Goodness, Maria.

643
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,509
It's me, Sunny.

644
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:27,136
It's been a long while.

645
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,430
How are you doing? How is your health?

646
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,849
I've missed you, Sunny.

647
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:36,103
I don't think I'll get any better though.

648
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:38,105
Maria.

649
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,232
And you?

650
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,193
You've gotten thinner.

651
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:43,986
By the way,

652
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:45,947
is something wrong?

653
01:03:46,614 --> 01:03:49,742
I heard you were
looking for me in a hurry.

654
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:51,786
That's right.

655
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:54,580
I need to ask you something, Maria.

656
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,667
It's about Piazzolla's bandoneon.

657
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:03,172
Is there another Korean
who knows about it aside from me?

658
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:07,593
Did you meet him?

659
01:04:08,094 --> 01:04:09,011
What?

660
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,931
Sorry, I don't understand.

661
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:15,977
A Korean man came to visit me

662
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:20,231
after you returned to Korea.

663
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,903
He reminded me of you.

664
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:29,407
He was shielding his heart from the world

665
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:33,953
because of an old trauma,

666
01:04:34,036 --> 01:04:37,832
just like you.

667
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:41,127
He was grieving

668
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:48,175
because his biological mother
had died pitifully.

669
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:53,472
So I told him about
the legend of the bandoneon.

670
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:56,058
What was his name?

671
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:58,895
Kang…

672
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:07,820
Kang Yoon-gyeom?

673
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,780
Yes.

674
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,033
Kang Yoon-gyeom.

675
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:13,451
Maria.

676
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:14,368
BUENOS AIRES, 8 YEARS AGO

677
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,286
I'm leaving now.

678
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,914
Are you feeling all right, Sunny?

679
01:05:18,414 --> 01:05:19,999
Yes. Thank you.

680
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:30,384
Sorry.

681
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,809
Did you two really meet?

682
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:43,314
I thought it was just my imagination.

683
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,983
If you really did see him,

684
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,653
then the two of you are bound by fate.

685
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:59,580
They say that twin flames

686
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:06,504
will eventually meet each other,
no matter what.

687
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,746
This world is full of monsters,

688
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,623
but I won't become one myself.

689
01:06:43,958 --> 01:06:45,584
Our secrets will all be revealed.

690
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:50,006
Don't worry. I know that he'll choose me.

691
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:53,092
Mr. Seo is obsessed with you.

692
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:56,804
Why did you do that if you care so much
about what others think?

693
01:06:56,887 --> 01:06:58,347
I'll choose a place for us to meet.

694
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,558
Come see me on your wife's birthday.

695
01:07:00,641 --> 01:07:01,767
Hey!

696
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,103
You make the choice.

697
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,356
But I'm going to be the master.
