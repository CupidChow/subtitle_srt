00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,248
How dare you cross the line?

4
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,169
What makes you think
you have the right to test me?

5
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:30,673
You're fine with meeting
the same fate as the dead housekeeper?

6
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,760
Then I'll let you experience it firsthand.

7
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,180
You will always do as I say.

8
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:39,766
And you will not approach me
if I order you not to.

9
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,270
Act like a dog waiting for its master.

10
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,167
So what happened?

11
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,837
Did you find out anything?

12
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,048
What about Kang Yoon-gyeom's phone number?

13
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,429
You didn't even get his number?

14
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,518
We've worked so hard
to hack into his phone,

15
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,103
and you didn't get anything?

16
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,189
I didn't have the time for that.

17
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,399
You had him right there.

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,942
How did you not have the time?

19
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,653
What on earth happened?

20
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,575
He had to go early
because something urgent came up.

21
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,368
Did you set up another meeting?

22
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,245
No, not yet.

23
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:45,165
What the hell is this?

24
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,920
He came looking for you,
and you just let him go?

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,215
It took us so much effort to approach him,

26
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:56,092
and you let him leave
without even getting his number?

27
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,053
I've poured my entire life
into sending those bastards to court.

28
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,054
What did you…

29
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,891
exactly mess up?

30
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,520
We'll get another chance.

31
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,776
He was just playing with you.

32
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,031
I knew it.

33
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,617
You're too young.

34
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,499
What are you trying to say?

35
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,251
You don't know how to deal with men.

36
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,503
Well…

37
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,506
it's not like you had the chance to.

38
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,384
You only got your husband
to reach your goal,

39
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,887
and I told you
how to seduce Kang Yoon-gyeom.

40
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,096
Just get to the point.

41
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,932
Either you appeared too easy

42
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,975
or he figured out
what you're trying to do.

43
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:46,893
You're so inexperienced.

44
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,355
He'll never come back.

45
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,607
And what if I do get him back?

46
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,986
Since when has my age been a problem?

47
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,574
The bastards who killed my father
were cruel,

48
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,204
but nobody cared for me
when I was a child, not even you.

49
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,664
And I was…

50
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,126
truly so young back then.

51
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,925
You may be doing the planning,

52
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,302
but I'm the one going into battle.

53
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:24,639
I'm the one sleeping with a man
I don't even love.

54
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,517
You think I'm young and inexperienced?

55
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:29,686
You know nothing about me!

56
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:36,484
I'm sure you don't make any mistakes

57
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,528
since you're so old.

58
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:41,656
Then…

59
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,618
don't make the mistake
of running your mouth.

LIYAN KINDERGARTEN JOB FAIR PROJECT

61
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,981
These are the drafts
for Liyan Kindergarten's Job Fair Project.

62
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,275
If you don't want to put in too much time,
you can look at Draft A.

63
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,944
If you'd like to put some time into it,
you can look at B.

64
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,989
Personally, I'd like to recommend A.

65
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:25,700
Let's go with Draft B.

66
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,994
I'll explain it to La-el in person.

67
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,268
How dare you cross the line?

68
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,064
What makes you think
you have the right to test me?

69
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,983
You're fine with meeting
the same fate as the dead housekeeper?

70
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,528
Then I'll let you experience it firsthand.

71
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,364
You will always do as I say.

72
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,909
And you will not approach me
if I order you not to.

73
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,162
Act like a dog waiting for its master.

74
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,714
How come you're doing
all of this by yourself?

75
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:07,468
La-el!

76
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,220
La-el, wake up!

77
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,514
Is there a meaning behind your name?

78
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,724
"A person who belongs to God."

79
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:16,102
My dad named me.

80
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,643

CONTENTS

82
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,947
How are you so kind, Mr. Seo?

83
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:12,533
I'm impressed by how much
you care about the children

84
00:08:12,617 --> 00:08:14,035
despite your busy schedule.

85
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,545
My husband is very thankful
for your cooperation.

86
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,048
He'd like to say thank you in person.

87
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,299
What do you say, Mr. Seo?

88
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,343
Would you like to meet with him?

89
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,099
I think you two
will get along really well.

90
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,477
Don't you think so, Sun-bin?

91
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,438
You'll come too, won't you?

92
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:47,735
Of course I will.

93
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,989
Mr. Kang is a really good man, Mr. Seo.

94
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,161
All right.

95
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,332
I'll meet with him if I get the chance.

96
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,090
I'll take the children home, ma'am.

97
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,805
Mr. Kim?

98
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,558
Why are you picking up my dad's phone?

99
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,144
I'll head back now.

100
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,775
I'm going to brag
to my dad about my achievement

101
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,527
and ask him for a job as my present.

102
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,738
So-ra, you sent your car away, remember?

103
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,699
Oh, right.

104
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,742
What should I do?

105
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,832
Would you like me to drive you home?

106
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,127
Will you?

107
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,802
This place looks so elegant.

108
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:37,928
It's pretty old.

109
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:41,057
I was born here,
and I got married here too.

110
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,063
I'll wait right here then.

111
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,815
It might take a while.
You can wait inside.

112
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,486
Come in.

113
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,962
Oh, gosh.

114
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,600
Did you see that?

115
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,561
No.

116
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,023
Well, pretend that you didn't.

117
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,234
You'll hurt yourself
if you find out too much.

118
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,742
-Hey, So-ra.
-Hello.

119
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:43,786
-Dad.
-Hey.

120
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:45,538
You didn't say you were coming.

121
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,997
I have some good news for you.

122
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,293
Is he still holding out on you?

123
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,254
Eunsang is basically nothing.

124
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,895
Dad!

125
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,650
-Please don't do this!
-He's bleeding.

126
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:16,444
Please help me stop the bleeding.

127
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,531
Honey!

128
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,992
Dad.

129
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,076
Hello.

130
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,079
Let me lead you this way.

131
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,062
Please wait here for a moment.

132
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:52,980
Okay.

133
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,674
Oh, dear.

134
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,635
Are you all right?

135
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:26,514
I think I got burned.
Could you get me some cold water?

136
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,890
I'll get the first aid kit.

137
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,978
Seo Eun-pyeong has agreed
to meet with Yoon-gyeom?

138
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,605
Yes, I'm sure of it.

139
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,985
I wonder why. Perhaps he's short on money?

140
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,947
It never seemed like it.

141
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,657
Well, whatever it may be.

142
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,827
Let's get him
while we still have the chance.

143
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,829
Give him some of my money first.

144
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,124
We can use him for a while
since he's young and smart.

145
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,335
We're good for at least 20 years
if he gets on our side.

146
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:39,753
Yes, sir.

147
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,032
Here's a cold towel.

148
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,576
Thank you.

149
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,144
My dad complimented me so much.

150
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:38,771
I feel great.

151
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,941
Did he say that he'll give you a job?

152
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,359
He'll tell me on my birthday.

153
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,527
I'll have to wait and see.

154
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,576
It's Yoon-gyeom.

155
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,255
Honey.

156
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,718
I just spoke to my dad.

157
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,220
Sun-bin drove me.

158
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:15,933
How's your father?

159
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,393
The same as always.

160
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:18,769
I have some good news.

161
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,689
Once I tell you, you'll want to
do anything I want on my birthday.

162
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,690
Let's talk inside.

163
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,977
I just got a great idea.

164
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,272
You wanted a job, didn't you?

165
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,986
I think you're too intelligent
to go begging for jobs.

166
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,950
You should prove your ability
at a formal event.

167
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,203
Don't even give him water.

168
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:20,456
He'll come to his senses
once we starve him.

169
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,875
Should we call his family over
so they can see him--

170
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,839
If we erase the background noise
and run a voice analysis,

171
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,466
it could be used as evidence.

172
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,762
It looks like Eunsang is in the same boat
as your father's company.

173
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,890
We can include them in our lawsuit later.

174
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,100
That'll be too late.

175
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,560
Please save him right now.

176
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,437
Mr. Lee Chang-hwan, the CEO of Eunsang.

177
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,440
And how exactly would we do that?

178
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,525
Get him an attorney
and give him some of our data

179
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,110
so he can legally defend himself.

180
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,695
Our secrets will all be revealed.

181
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,822
I'll end all of this

182
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,115
before that happens.

183
00:17:57,117 --> 00:18:00,287
If we ignore a victim like him,
how are we any different from them?

184
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,247
This world is full of monsters,

185
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,083
but I won't become one myself.

186
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,502
We'll talk after you actually
get some results.

187
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,128
Han Pan-ro, Han So-ra,
and Kang Yoon-gyeom.

188
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,422
I got them all at the same time.

189
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,382
I can sue them in no time.

190
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,263
Did Kang Yoon-gyeom call you?

191
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,565
Don't worry.

192
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,610
I know that he'll choose me…

193
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,739
on an important day for Han So-ra.

194
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:46,708
Look over here, please!

195
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:18,031
I think you're too intelligent
to go begging for jobs.

196
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,750
You should prove your ability
at a formal event.

197
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,670
Isn't that Seo Eun-pyeong?

198
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,881
-Seo Eun-pyeong?
-It's Seo Eun-pyeong.

199
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,677
Wow, this is big.

200
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,429
A historic meeting

201
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,182
between a presidential candidate
and a top chaebol.

202
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,810
That's Congressman Seo, isn't he?

203
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,480
What's he doing here?

204
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,863
So-ra asked me to translate.

205
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,492
Mr. Seo.

206
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,748
He's your guest?

207
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,044
Mr. Giovanni wants to
get involved in politics, doesn't he?

208
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:13,629
Wow.

209
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:15,589
This is quite impressive.

210
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:38,362
Hello.

211
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,164
Let me introduce you to them, Mr. Seo.

212
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,626
This is Mr. Giovanni, the chairman of CL,
and this is Mr. Kang, the chairman of LY.

213
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,837
And this is my friend
who'll be translating for us.

214
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,674
Hello, Mr. Seo.
I've been wanting to meet with you.

215
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,802
I would say the same, Mr. Kang.

216
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,220
Nice to meet you.

217
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,642
This is Congressman Seo Eun-pyeong.

218
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,186
This is Mr. Kang Yoon-gyeom,
the chairman of LY.

219
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,522
And this is his wife, Ms. Han So-ra.

220
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,898
Thank you.

221
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,985
My husband and I are close acquaintances
of Mr. Kang and Ms. Han.

222
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:18,902
Lovely.

223
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,907
So-ra, why aren't you
introducing my husband?

224
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,077
You don't like it
when I interfere with your business.

225
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,704
You can introduce yourselves.

226
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,999
Mr. Seo is well-known

227
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,418
as a future presidential candidate.

228
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:39,298
Congressman Seo is well-known
as a future presidential candidate.

229
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,969
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo Eun-pyeong.

230
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:48,015
Nice to meet you. I'm Seo Eun-pyeong.

231
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,772
He loves Korean culture,

232
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,733
and he looks forward to working with you.

233
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,776
Thank you for your appreciation.

234
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,696
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

235
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,782
Your Italian is very good.

236
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:11,371
I learned a little bit
of foreign languages for fun,

237
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,748
but I'm not entirely fluent.

238
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,173
Would you like some more champagne?

239
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,427
Thank you.

240
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,980
Excuse me, but are you a model?

241
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,108
No, I'm just a housewife.

242
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42,694
Unbelievable. How is that possible?

243
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,615
Thank you so much.

244
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,909
No problem at all.

245
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,540
Be careful.

246
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,211
Thank you, Mr. Seo.

247
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,804
Don't drink too much.

248
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,610
The Bar Association Seminar
is on the second floor.

249
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,238
Their representative asked
if you could drop by and help.

250
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,697
He must have seen you.

251
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,242
All right.

252
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,454
Feel free to talk more among yourselves.

253
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,081
I have somewhere to be.

254
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,332
Please excuse me.

255
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,516
EVENT IN PROGRESS
DO NOT ENTER

256
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:08,947
Mr. Seo.

257
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:13,410
I truly appreciate you
going out of your way to come here.

258
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,293
Don't be like that, La-el.

259
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,338
Just treat me like an old friend.

260
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,050
We've known each other long enough.

261
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,937
I know you don't normally
participate in such events.

262
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,191
I didn't want to inconvenience you,

263
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,526
but I needed this.

264
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,654
Can I pay you back in some way?

265
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,573
Please let me know.

266
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,533
I know you.

267
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,038
You hate owing anybody anything.

268
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,791
But don't worry.
I'm not doing this for free.

269
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,296
You can do some work for me.
Just pay me back with your skills.

270
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,675
Mr. Seo is obsessed with you.

271
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,927
I'm sure of it.

272
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,721
He's just somebody I used to know
from my hometown.

273
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,349
Besides, I'm married.

274
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,101
That makes you all the more enticing.

275
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,436
You're like the forbidden fruit.

276
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,356
Come on, So-ra.

277
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,858
Anyway, people think

278
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,236
I'm super capable thanks to you.

279
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,570
You've always been capable.

280
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,322
You just haven't had the chance to shine.

281
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,829
You said you wanted
a department store, didn't you?

282
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:44,042
What if you just take
Yoon-gyeom's brother's mall?

283
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,466
Well, Dam-ri's department store
can't even compare to that one.

284
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,606
You said you wanted
a department store, didn't you?

285
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:10,235
What if you just take
Yoon-gyeom's brother's mall?

286
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,004
I should send my child to Liyan too.

287
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,880
You have a child who's in kindergarten?

288
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,591
Liyan is a great kindergarten, Mr. Kang.

289
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:34,718
But…

290
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,594
my kid's in middle school.

291
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,764
Sorry?

292
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:43,059
I can't send
a middle schooler to kindergarten.

293
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,352
That's crazy.

294
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,355
But you're just

295
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,109
that attractive.

296
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:55,196
You've set a fire to my heart.

297
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,450
Help me put it out.

298
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,413
Thank you for having
such a high opinion of me.

299
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,333
Come on.

300
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,251
It's even better than that.

301
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:15,759
Mr. Giovanni seemed happy
to see Mr. Seo was here, didn't he?

302
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,718
Yes.

303
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,094
What do you think?

304
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,971
This is worthy of bragging about, no?

305
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:21,890
Sure.

306
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:25,393
I don't need any luxury items
or cars for my birthday.

307
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,188
I want something else.

308
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,606
Tell me.

309
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,317
Let's go to a hotel suite.

310
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,696
Decorate the entire room
with my favorite roses.

311
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,534
I want you to love me all night,

312
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:43,787
just like our honeymoon.

313
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,004
So-ra.

314
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,465
Who the heck is that woman?

315
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,509
Why did you bring her here?
She doesn't even fit in.

316
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,760
How tacky.

317
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,222
What did my friend ever do to you?

318
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,390
Don't you see?

319
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,853
It looks like your husband
is having a lot of fun.

320
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,025
At least he's being more polite to her
than he is with other women.

321
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:14,943
Thank goodness.

322
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,237
Are you trying to screw me over?

323
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,114
Screw you over?

324
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,198
My goodness, Soo-jung.

325
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,158
That’s so vulgar.

326
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,995
He's drunk.

327
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,124
He drank because he got angry
after you disregarded him.

328
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,126
Why are you acting like this?

329
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,795
How is it my fault
that he got himself drunk?

330
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,007
Well, you're the one
who outright disrespected us.

331
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,761
Why are you always
so rude to me, Soo-jung?

332
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,305
Is this some kind
of an inferiority complex?

333
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,141
An inferiority complex?

334
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,853
Who do you think you are?

335
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,898
Are you saying that I'm nothing?

336
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,027
What makes you think
you're better than me?

337
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:05,201
Chi-gyeom.

338
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,329
You're drunk.

339
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,918
-I'm not drunk.
-You should go home now.

340
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:20,049
Hey.

341
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,552
Are you the older brother here?

342
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,471
No, I'm the older one!

343
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:29,017
Isn't he absurd, Sun-bin?

344
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,978
You little brat.

345
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,774
Let's take this somewhere else.

346
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,026
I said, go home!

347
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,195
Hey, you!

348
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,867
-Are you all right?
-Let go of me!

349
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,456
What do you think you're doing?

350
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,874
What if somebody sees us?

351
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:55,627
Why did you do that if you care so much
about what others think?

352
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,757
Why do you care, Mr. Kang?

353
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,641
You know, at least your brother
isn't a coward.

354
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,476
What?

355
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,438
Are you trying to make me lose it?

356
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,275
What makes you think
I did that because of you?

357
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,487
You want me to wait?

358
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,572
Like a dog waiting for its master?

359
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:27,742
Why should I?

360
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,037
I'm not interested in you anymore.

361
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:05,321
What do you want from me?

362
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,700
Stay with me.

363
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:17,542
He was scared

364
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:20,253
that he'd fall in love.

365
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,673
Let's get out of here.

366
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,094
It's true that I was
momentarily blinded by lust.

367
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,097
But I've snapped out of it thanks to you.

368
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:34,767
I no longer want to be
your one-night stand.

369
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,813
I don't like being treated like that,
you see.

370
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,403
If you want me, then you need to beg.

371
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,406
Plead and tell me that you love me.

372
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,326
I'm going to be the master.

373
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,286
Not you.

374
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,209
Remember the game of poker?

375
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:04,631
The last match is what decides
the outcome of the game.

376
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,221
I'll choose a place for us to meet.

377
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,226
Come see me on your wife's birthday.

378
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,647
This is a notice, not an invitation.

379
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,902
If you show up, you can have me.

380
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:30,239
But if you don't,
then you'll never get another chance.

381
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,159
You make the choice.

382
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:56,099
The adorno is a form of tango

383
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,976
where you dance by yourself
without a partner.

384
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,853
They say it is the art of the free leg

385
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,647
as it makes the woman look beautiful.

386
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,365
Ms. Han, it's like
you were born for the tango.

387
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,908
You look beautiful when you dance.

388
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,870
-Really?
-Absolutely.

389
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:21,457
With your talent, you could debut
at the Milonga right away.

390
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,542
Wouldn't you agree?

391
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,085
What's the Milonga?

392
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:28,715
It's a tango club.

393
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,802
They all look so elegant in their dresses.

394
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,679
I think they're dancing with strangers.

395
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:37,515
Since we're on the topic,
let's go to a tango club together.

396
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:38,766
How about on Ms. Han's birthday?

397
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,978
That sounds great.

398
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:42,895
I'm down.

399
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:46,024
Then I'll prepare a party for VIPs only.

400
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,151
I'll pick out the best dancers.

401
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,197
Did you just plan my birthday party
without my consent?

402
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,955
Mrs. Han has given us new directions
for her birthday party.

403
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,123
Again?

404
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,875
In the afternoon,
there will be a Parent Association party,

405
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:06,002
and at night, she'll be busy
with Mr. Kang's event.

406
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:08,546
So she wants us
to cancel the big surprise party.

407
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,633
She would like a moderate-sized
surprise party instead.

408
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,221
We need to cancel the singers
and the quartet concert.

409
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:21,768
I wonder what
a "moderate-sized surprise" is.

410
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:23,644
How can a surprise party
be moderate-sized?

411
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,729
Exactly.

412
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,980
What should we do, Secretary Kim?

413
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,900
I think I'll be sick tomorrow.

414
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,491
Oh my goodness.

415
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,620
I wanted to get you the tango dress.

416
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,208
My goodness, it's so pretty.

417
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,670
You can wear this at the Milonga.

418
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,550
And this…

419
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,179
is for you and Mr. Kang on your birthday.

420
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,267
Show him a little bit of the adorno.

421
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,230
This is why I like you so much.

422
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,776
This is beautiful.

423
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,618
-Where's Yoon-gyeom?
-He's in his study, ma'am.

424
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,957
Don't tell me the hotel
he reserved for my birthday.

425
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,167
I want it to be a surprise.

426
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,585
Yes, ma'am.

427
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:36,050
Don't forget.

428
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,635
I like surprises.

429
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,972
Moderate-sized surprises.

430
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,974
I'll be looking forward to it.

431
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,183
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

432
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,194
I'll choose a place for us to meet.

433
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,488
Come see me on your wife's birthday.

434
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,453
Da-bi.

435
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:08,708
Dad is thinking about something,

436
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:12,545
so I'm staying super quiet.

437
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,673
Hey, you're here.

438
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,008
Honey.

439
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,677
Are you worried about my birthday?

440
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,430
I'll be fine with anywhere
you pick out for me.

441
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,098
Mom, are you going somewhere?

442
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,061
Mom and Dad are going to a hotel

443
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:30,938
for Mom's birthday.

444
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:31,981
Wow!

445
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,930
Happy birthday, ma'am.

446
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,182
I don't see anything.

447
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,519
It's a moderate-sized surprise party.

448
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,272
We didn't prepare
any decorations or events.

449
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:16,692
But we invited Chef Gabrielle from
a Michelin Star restaurant in New York,

450
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,486
and they've prepared a feast for you.

451
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,114
Where's Yoon-gyeom?

452
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,075
He left for work, ma'am.

453
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,869
This is Chef Gabrielle's handmade cake.

454
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:31,791
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

455
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:36,003
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

456
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,296
-Happy birthday, dear--
-Happy birthday, dear--

457
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,547
Shut it!

458
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,428
You should have woken me up when he left!

459
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:45,596
I'm sorry, ma'am.

460
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,182
He left so early in the morning,

461
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,351
and we weren't sure
if he had a surprise event prepared…

462
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:54,772
Get out of my way!

463
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:10,538
Sir.

464
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:32,393
I've reserved a suite
at Meredian Hotel, sir.

465
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:37,189
Happy birthday, Ms. Han.

466
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,323
It's a riding helmet.

467
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,365
Yes.

468
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,160
Your father loves horses,

469
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,912
so I thought you might need this too.

470
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,999
I've arranged a lunch

471
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,085
with officials from the foundation.

472
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,964
Well, I'm quite busy
on the day of my birthday.

473
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,258
Oh, right. I understand.

474
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,356
Go then.

475
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,899
Come back when I call you at night.

476
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:22,401
The party today is a secret.

477
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:23,986
Yes, ma'am.

478
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,029
See you later.

479
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:36,832
Hi, So-ra.

480
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,671
What's wrong? Did something happen?

481
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,675
Mr. Seo wants to see me.

482
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,260
But it's your birthday.

483
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,184
No, he's an essential figure.

484
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,312
You should prioritize him.

485
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,190
Go see him.
There will be other people at the party.

486
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,404
Everybody else should be coming.

487
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,614
And you'll meet
great people at the Milonga.

488
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,366
I'm sure it'll surpass your expectations.

489
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:11,742
I'm sure it will.

490
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,418
Take good care…

491
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,256
of Mr. Seo.

492
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,242
Dam-ri.

493
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:56,412
Something came up,
so I can't go to the Milonga.

494
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,832
Can you two celebrate
Ms. Han's birthday with her?

495
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,544
-One, two.
-One, two.

496
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,171
And why should we?

497
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,048
We're not going either then.

498
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,052
Hold on.

499
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,265
Should we take this chance
to screw with So-ra?

500
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,730
I'm sure you're busy.

501
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,649
I'll call Marco to cancel it.

502
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:49,465
205, HEEYEON-DONG, GIYEON-GU, SEOUL

503
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:06,232
Let's just leave So-ra stranded there.

504
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,943
On her own birthday too.

505
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,237
That'll serve her right.

506
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,905
This is the best day of my life.

507
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,625
Seriously.

508
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:30,214
This was such a good idea.

509
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,070
Come in.

510
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:56,949
What is it?

511
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:57,950
VICE CHAIRMAN KIM YI-SAK

512
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,077
Somebody asked me
to give this to you, sir.

513
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,955
Thank you.

514
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,385
RECIPIENT: KIM YI-SAK

515
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,971
SENDER: LEE TAE-JOON

516
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,891
MR. KIM YI-SAK

517
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,103
Yes, Mr. Kim. What brings you to call me?

518
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,107
I trust you, Director Kim.

519
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,109
If anything happens to me,

520
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,361
make sure to protect La-el.

521
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:37,281
They'll never guess
that the stock shares for GEDIKS

522
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,574
have been given to La-el.

523
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,701
I'll buy some time,

524
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,746
so please find a way to do it.

525
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,414
That's Mr. Lee Tae-joon's voice.

526
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,668
He passed away years ago.
How could he have sent a package?

527
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,356
This package is for Kim Yi-sak.

528
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,066
SENDER: LEE TAE-JOON

529
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,651
I've waited over a decade

530
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,029
to send this.

531
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,170
Where are you?

532
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,631
Come pick me up.

533
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,590
Now!

534
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,556
Yes, Secretary Kim.

535
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,475
Which hotel did Chairman Kang reserve?

536
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,393
It's the suite at the Meredian Hotel.

537
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:56,897
But he hasn't given me any directions yet.

538
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,607
Mrs. Han is furious right now.

539
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,692
I'm dead if I don't take her
there right now.

540
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,997
What took you so long?

541
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,338
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

542
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,174
The hotel Chairman Kang reserved
is the Meredian.

543
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:25,259
I'll take you there right away.

544
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,520
If you show up, you can have me.

545
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,357
But if you don't,
then you'll never get another chance.

546
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,277
You make the choice.

547
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,661
Sir, would you like to
head straight to the hotel for the event?

548
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,579
Cancel that.

549
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,456
-Sir?
-Something important came up.

550
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,257
Sir, but…

551
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:12,973
POWER OFF

552
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:22,691
Don't take Mrs. Han to the hotel.

553
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:24,359
Chairman Kang just canceled the event.

554
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,694
No, I can't do that.

555
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,989
Mrs. Han already changed into her dress
and left the house.

556
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,429
Honey?

557
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:39,685
Babe.

558
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:14,970
Where are the flowers?

559
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,098
And the presents?

560
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,437
There's nothing here.

561
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,313
Yes, ma'am.

562
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,482
We weren't told anything further…

563
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,363
Today is my birthday.

564
00:50:36,324 --> 00:50:37,534
Today is my birth…

565
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,208
Today's my birthday.

566
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:11,169
It's my birthday today!

567
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:47,664
THE ZEUS PROJECT

568
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,874
The sketch for this project

569
00:52:48,957 --> 00:52:52,794
is the most beautiful
out of everything I've ever planned.

570
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:58,717
We've got the nobodies,
the rich, and the politicians.

571
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,634
Above all…

572
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:02,637
Yes, sir.

573
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,769
-That's…
-He's…

574
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,521
-That's…
-Is that…

575
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,398
You recruited Seo Eun-pyeong too?

576
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:16,192
Get excited,

577
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:18,612
because this one will be big.

578
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:25,076
SO-RA

579
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,580
What?

580
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,956
Dad.

581
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,752
Today's my birthday.

582
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,130
But Yoon-gyeom

583
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,508
turned off his phone,
and I don't know where he is.

584
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:43,803
I can't even track his location.

585
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,267
You can't even
celebrate your birthday properly?

586
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,019
How are you going to manage a job?

587
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:53,688
You're so frustrating. Figure it out!

588
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,693
The bath is ready.

589
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:55,208
SUN-BIN

590
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,171
So-ra?

591
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,257
Sun-bin.

592
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,177
What is it, So-ra?

593
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,387
Why are you crying?

594
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,223
My birthday is ruined now.

595
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:13,768
The Milonga and the suite, everything.

596
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:17,355
I love Yoon-gyeom so much.

597
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:21,609
But I don't think I loved him
the right way.

598
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:26,072
I shouldn't have given him any freedom.

599
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,830
What about your father?

600
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:37,375
Did he say he'll give you a job
as your birthday present?

601
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,253
My dad was never going to give me a job.

602
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,841
I'm so lonely, Sun-bin.

603
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:48,553
So-ra,

604
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:51,139
do you want me there with you?

605
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:55,143
You're the only person that I can trust.

606
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:00,565
But no, it's okay.

607
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,319
Just come see me tomorrow.

608
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,321
I'll help you

609
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,783
get your hands on the shopping mall.

610
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:13,161
Okay, let's do that.

611
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,165
I'll be the president,
and you can be the vice president.

612
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,876
Let's do that.

613
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:26,633
All right, So-ra.

614
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,659
The person you are trying to reach
is not available.

615
00:58:16,743 --> 00:58:19,120
Please leave a voicemail after the tone…

616
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,497
YOON-GYEOM

617
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,722
Don't ever betray me.

618
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,184
You'll always be on my side, won't you?

619
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,353
Of course.

620
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,522
I will, until the day I die.

621
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:56,032
Decorate the entire room
with my favorite roses.

622
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,369
I want you to love me all night.

623
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:52,583
I can't just let this go.

624
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,835
Tell me everything

625
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,336
before I do something crazy.

626
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,464
What the hell are you doing?

627
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,841
This is why I hesitated.

628
01:01:59,924 --> 01:02:01,300
Because I thought I might fall in love.

629
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,261
This is an idea for the mall.

630
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:05,179
Everything will go back
to the way they were.

631
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,224
Isn't it the perfect plan
for money laundering?

632
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,518
Do you really think
you're fit to be the chairman?

633
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:12,979
I'll take over LY and become the king.

634
01:02:13,062 --> 01:02:16,107
If you're with me, I can do anything.

635
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:17,692
I'll be with you

636
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,068
no matter what happens.
