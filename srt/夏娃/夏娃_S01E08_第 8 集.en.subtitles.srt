1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:59,225
We're from the hit-and-run team
of Gongnam Police.

4
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,728
The car involved belongs to this company,

5
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:04,481
and I heard that a family member
of the chairman was in it.

6
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,483
I need to know who was driving that car.

7
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,401
Where can I meet the person in charge?

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,906
An accident on Gongnam Road?
What are you talking about?

9
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,161
Mrs. Han.

10
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:24,584
Give me your phone.

11
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,598
Are there any other traces of me anywhere?

12
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,100
Do you have any texts or my number
on a computer or tablet?

13
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,978
No, ma'am.

14
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,317
Nobody can find out about what we did.

15
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:50,860
If Yoon-gyeom,

16
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,240
or especially my dad, finds out,
we're both dead.

17
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:57,200
Do you understand?

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,620
What on earth has she done now?

19
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,913
Why did it have to be now?

20
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,084
I can't have
the task force team get exposed.

21
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:07,669
Change the location for the meeting.

22
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:10,130
Make sure the press doesn't find out
that So-ra was in the car.

23
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:13,341
Don't let the police or any reporters
into the company building.

24
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:15,009
Yes, sir.

25
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,648
Where's So-ra? Is she not home yet?

26
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:31,317
She's going to stay at a hotel
until things die down, sir.

27
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:35,321
Why did she go out in the early morning
and hit somebody's car?

28
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,949
What the hell did she take?
Why is she acting so crazy?

29
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,993
Mr. Han.

30
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,161
Yoon-gyeom's here.

31
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:50,003
LY'S COMPANY VEHICLE FLEES THE SCENE
AFTER AN ACCIDENT ON GONGNAM ROAD

32
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,462
Lee La-el.

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,092
I've underestimated you.

34
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,174
She might have to visit
the hit-and-run team at this rate.

35
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,217
Where's So-ra?

36
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,928
Why are you looking for
your wife at my house?

37
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,679
Da-bi is waiting for her mother,

38
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,516
but the police came instead.

39
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,519
Do you not care about all this, Mr. Han?

40
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,521
You must've done a bad job
at managing your family.

41
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,315
So this is my fault too?

42
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,694
Where's So-ra? Tell her to clean this up.

43
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,238
-I don't know.
-Mr. Han!

44
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,657
Come on.

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,660
You should work together
in a situation like this.

46
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,703
She's at a hotel,

47
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,498
so I'll go get her.
You two can talk this out.

48
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,541
I'm sure that this isn't
that big of a deal.

49
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,629
Early in the morning yesterday,
on a road in Gongnam-gu, Seoul,

50
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:17,382
a strange car chase took place.

51
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,385
Two cars were involved in a chase
on a relatively empty road

52
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,971
early in the morning,
as if it was a scene from a movie.

53
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,890
The two vehicles stopped
only after one crashed into the other.

54
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,976
You said it was Han Pan-ro?

55
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,310
What did he send?

56
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:49,747
Welcome.

57
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,208
It's good to see you.

58
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,794
I think Han Pan-ro knows

59
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,755
that we tried to take
Yoon-gyeom's company shares.

60
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,091
Oh, you didn't have to.

61
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,926
Goodness. This is amazing.

62
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,052
A car should be comfortable.

63
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,933
Sir.

64
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,854
I've got the footage of the hit-and-run.

65
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,773
The perpetrator was So-ra,

66
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,943
and she was with some man.

67
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,279
A man?

68
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,420
Find out who he is.

69
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,550
And check Pan-ro's location too.

70
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:44,552
Quick.

71
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:45,970
Yes, sir.

72
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,556
-Congratulations.
-Hello.

73
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,433
It must have been a long journey here.

74
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,351
You must've been busy writing your book.

75
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,811
Everything worked out, thanks to you.

76
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,106
-I think I've got to work harder.
-Thank you.

77
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,692
Hello, Congressman Seo!

78
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,487
It's great to see you.

79
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,447
I've been wanting to meet with you.

80
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,533
It's nice to finally meet you,
Prime Minister Han.

81
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,079
We will mutually benefit
if we formally meet each other like this.

82
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,915
I'm happy about this too.

83
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:16,667
Mr. Han.

84
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,672
Hello there, Mr. Kang.

85
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:27,845
I would have given you a call
if I knew that you'd be here.

86
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:32,517
You're really going to act so friendly
after threatening me like that?

87
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,115
I saw that So-ra was with another man.

88
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,370
What should I do about this video?

89
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:54,747
Does Yoon-gyeom know too?

90
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,792
Does he know that So-ra was with a man?

91
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,011
Those people are so dramatic.

92
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:11,889
The Financial Supervisory Commission

93
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,975
thinks that Mr. Kang
is planning something.

94
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:17,103
Does La-el have
anything to do with this, sir?

95
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,773
I think so.

96
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,821
LY GALLERY CLOSED

97
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:29,323
THE GALLERY IS CLOSED FOR TODAY
DUE TO PRIVATE ISSUES

98
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,640
A hit-and-run in the early morning?

99
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,518
What the hell is this?

100
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,770
I should get into accidents more often

101
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,357
if it'll make you come running right away.

102
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,030
I accidentally hit a car
after I had some champagne with a friend.

103
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,742
It's nothing really. I was staying away
because it might become a mess.

104
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,118
Which friend?

105
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,665
Since when have we shared
so many personal details like that?

106
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:20,958
You're seriously going to joke right now?

107
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:24,086
To be fair, although we don't know
each other's private lives,

108
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:26,380
we both know what we're like,
so why avoid the question?

109
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,884
But you need to answer my question first.

110
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:31,969
That's the order of things.

111
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,640
I won't beat around the bush.

112
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,434
Are you having an affair?

113
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,777
No.

114
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,412
What do you think our marriage is?

115
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,541
You know that this gallery

116
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,168
was a gift for
our fifth wedding anniversary, don't you?

117
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,754
The presents for our
20th and 30th wedding anniversaries

118
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,173
have all been decided on already.

119
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,218
I think I have the right

120
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,679
to get a present
on every wedding anniversary.

121
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,432
Our marriage

122
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,352
wasn't a coincidence
or an abstract concept.

123
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,855
I tried so hard to get you.

124
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,899
I made a plan, I made it work,

125
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,445
and I kept it going.

126
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:35,032
Our marriage…

127
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,872
is the result of my efforts.

128
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,417
So…

129
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,044
if somebody is trying to ruin it,

130
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,465
then I can't forgive them.

131
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,260
Never.

132
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,310
Let me ask you one more time.

133
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,105
Are you having an affair?

134
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,111
No.

135
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,951
Your mouth says "no,"

136
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,037
but your eyes say "yes."

137
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,546
I've been hoping that it wouldn’t be true.

138
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,008
No, not hoping. I've been praying.

139
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,388
So, the only question left is,

140
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,893
-"who is it?"
-I told you, I'm not.

141
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,020
I know exactly what I'm going to do now.

142
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,022
I'm going to find out

143
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:50,608
who your mistress is.

144
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,404
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes, ma'am?

145
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,708
Well. I see that your conversation
didn't take very long.

146
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,834
That's a relief.

147
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,879
I'll take care of the cops.

148
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:15,257
Who do they think they are,
trying to investigate you?

149
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,302
Don't worry.

150
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,179
I'll let them interrogate me.

151
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,389
Sorry?

152
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,516
Just make sure the reporters
don't take pictures when I go.

153
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,984
GONGNAM POLICE STATION

154
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,529
Ms. Oh, is it true that you used drugs?

155
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,532
I moved the time for the singer
Oh Seon-hui's drug interrogation.

156
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,492
The chief says you don't need to worry.

157
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,785
He'll cover it up for you.

158
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,253
Go.

159
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,935
CHIEF'S OFFICE

160
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,995
A lot of people
are curious about this case

161
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,497
since both the victim
and the perpetrator disappeared.

162
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,415
So…

163
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,625
I had no choice but to investigate.

164
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,127
I hope you understand, Ms. Han.

165
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:35,045
It's fine.

166
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,631
I'm not here to be interrogated

167
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,175
but to report somebody.

168
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,472
Sorry?

169
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,598
The car that ran away…

170
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,226
is mine. It was stolen.

171
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,315
Wait…

172
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,983
So-ra?

173
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,944
That car belongs to you?

174
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,114
Hold on, so…

175
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,825
You hit your own car?

176
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,704
My husband gave me the car that ran away.

177
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,498
But it was stolen from me.

178
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,918
I was trying to catch the thief
before my husband found out,

179
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,336
but I guess I failed.

180
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,840
Everything will be fine

181
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,343
once the police catches the driver.

182
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,471
What?

183
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,306
My car is wanted as a stolen vehicle?

184
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,523
Make sure that Sun-bin isn't exposed.

185
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,025
Hide the car,
and send the bodyguard abroad.

186
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,656
What?

187
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,868
Ms. Kim Sun-bin is
still not picking up her phone, sir.

188
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,927
Open this when you feel lonely

189
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,554
and alone.

190
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,767
Inside this box, I've put my plan
to take care of everything.

191
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:18,125
MR. SEO

192
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,252
Mr. Seo.

193
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,254
You're doing okay, right?

194
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,840
I think Pan-ro and Bon-geun

195
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,384
have been driven apart.

196
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,095
I thought you should know.

197
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,267
Do you want this to get even bigger?

198
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,605
Okay.

199
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,565
Whatever it is that you want,

200
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,776
I'll trust your decision.

201
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,246
You said that there would be a plan
inside the box that you gave me.

202
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,249
There wasn't anything in there.

203
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,086
There is no plan, La-el.

204
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,881
Not having a plan is my plan.

205
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,051
I'll just stay by your side

206
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,804
like a shadow.

207
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,139
Just remember that I'm always with you

208
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,475
no matter what.

209
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,144
What if I…

210
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,774
do something that only a monster would…

211
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,153
or…

212
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,866
something even worse?

213
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,828
Do it if you want.

214
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:37,788
It's okay.

215
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,217
Hello, Chief Officer.

216
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:53,053
Did you catch the driver?

217
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:02,021
Could you tell me
the driver's phone number?

218
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,856
If they're an employee at LY,

219
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,233
then we'll punish them
and take care of everything.

220
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,115
She was getting ready
to run away to another country.

221
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,910
Is she the right person?

222
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,703
Yes.

223
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,126
Hey, miss.

224
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,087
I'll ask you this one last time.

225
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,758
Who did Chairman Kang tell you to protect?

226
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,365
Gosh, don't get any blood on me.

227
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,041
Move.

228
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,502
Oh, gosh…

229
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,174
Where's her phone?

230
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,260
Thanks.

231
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,452
A VIP?

232
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,010
LEE YEON-WOOK

233
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,735
LEE YEON-WOOK

234
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,415
Who are you?

235
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,169
Who the hell are you?

236
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,881
Who are you to be my husband's VIP?

237
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,224
It'll be child's play
to find out who you are.

238
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,768
I can find you in one day.

239
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,527
Let's meet.

240
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:22,447
I'll go to you tomorrow at noon.

241
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:23,949
However…

242
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,535
you must release the bodyguard right away.

243
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,145
Mr. Han,

244
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,522
don't worry about the video.

245
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,234
So-ra says that he's
a paid designated driver,

246
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,361
and revealing his identity
won't be a problem.

247
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:05,449
You said you can find out
who he is, right?

248
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,993
Yes, sir.

249
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,953
Yoon-gyeom, that bastard.

250
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,998
So he used me to threaten his own father?

251
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,709
You don't know what he's planning yet?

252
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,711
No, but I'm in the process of finding out.

253
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,340
Once So-ra meets Yoon-gyeom
on Da-bi's birthday

254
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:22,883
and confirms a couple of things,

255
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,259
I'll tell you what happened.

256
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,264
I'll take it from here.

257
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,143
Today's a very important day, isn't it?

258
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,188
You have Da-bi's birthday party
and the CMN parent interview.

259
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,566
I'll make sure that you look like
the most graceful parent in the world.

260
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,194
Since when did I like
looking like a parent?

261
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,155
Never, Ms. Han. I'm sorry.

262
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:49,367
-Make me look tough.
-Yes, Ms. Han.

263
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,037
Really tough.

264
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:21,733
-Happy birthday, Da-bi.
-Happy birthday.

265
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,693
Happy birthday.

266
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,445
-Happy birthday, Da-bi.
-Happy birthday!

267
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:37,541
-Happy birthday, Da-bi.
-Thanks.

268
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,793
-Happy birthday, Da-bi.
-Thanks.

269
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,461
-Hello.
-Hello.

270
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,508
-Thanks for coming.
-Happy birthday.

271
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,146
When that bitch arrives at noon,
grab her right away.

272
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,690
Watch the road, parking lot,
and the entrance to the kindergarten.

273
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,108
Yes, Ms. Han.

274
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,536
You know, I don't see Sun-bin.

275
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:16,454
But she'll probably
show up today, won't she?

276
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,290
It's Da-bi's birthday and all.

277
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,375
There's the Parent Association
interview too.

278
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,627
On top of getting ready
for the end-of-the-year events.

279
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,255
She's been absent
for so long, don’t you think?

280
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,257
Don't worry. I'm planning on scolding her.

281
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:31,970
Let's go.

282
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,805
Hello, Mr. Kang.

283
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,169
All right, please look here, everyone.

284
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,880
Thank you for coming
to celebrate Da-bi's birthday.

285
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,341
Thanks for giving Da-bi so much love.

286
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,052
Please enjoy the party,
and tell me if you need anything.

287
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,098
I'm going to light the candles now.

288
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,478
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

289
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:24,940
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

290
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:29,152
-Happy birthday, dear Da-bi
-Happy birthday, dear Da-bi

291
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:32,197
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

292
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,411
Dam-ri, I haven't seen
that bracelet before.

293
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,412
When did you buy it?

294
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,831
I didn't.

295
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,291
It was a gift.

296
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,876
Are you dating somebody?
You're acting super suspicious.

297
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,089
Hey, Ji-hee, are those diamonds?

298
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,883
No, but it's a new product.

299
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,884
-Is it pretty?
-Yes.

300
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,401
Secretary Kim.

301
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,862
Have you spotted an unfamiliar woman yet?

302
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,115
They're all parents
or from the TV station.

303
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,462
-Hi there.
-Hello.

304
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,048
-Hello.
-Hello.

305
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,884
Hello, Ms. Kim.

306
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,929
We've been waiting for you.
They're about to do the interview.

307
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,306
I heard you've been ill.
Are you feeling better?

308
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,599
Yes, I am.

309
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,476
Wow, look at her.

310
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,061
-Mom!
-Bo-ram!

311
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,062
Ms. Kim!

312
00:28:09,562 --> 00:28:10,438
Da-bi!

313
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,065
Happy birthday, Da-bi.

314
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,235
-You look so pretty.
-Thank you.

315
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,361
Let me look at you, Bo-ram.

316
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,030
You're so cute today.

317
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,198
Have you eaten yet?

318
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,825
My baby.

319
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:24,619
Are you sure that you've been sick?

320
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:26,246
Why do you look even prettier?

321
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:29,666
I didn't think that an actual person
could pull off that dress.

322
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,251
So how on earth are you doing it?

323
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,170
The two of you look even prettier.

324
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,172
Have you had something good happen to you?

325
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,215
Not at all.

326
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,925
She's in the mood to laugh?

327
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,719
You say such nice things.

328
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,929
That's why her face is pretty too.

329
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,807
It's because her words are pretty.

330
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,019
Secretary Kim.

331
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,523
Nobody's here yet?

332
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:55,108
I'm sure nobody came here, ma'am.

333
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:57,569
Damn it.

334
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,362
It looks so fancy.

335
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,823
How much is that?

336
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,172
Bring her here.

337
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,769
Mrs. Han would like to see you.

338
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,147
Da-bi, play with Bo-ram, okay?

339
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,273
Okay.

340
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,484
Hello.

341
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,986
-It's been a while.
-You look great.

342
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,551
I hope Da-bi has a good birthday, Ms. Han.

343
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,055
You look so beautiful today.

344
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,102
You're having so much fun, aren't you?

345
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,898
You went off the grid
after telling me something so big.

346
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,274
What do you think you're doing?

347
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,151
I'm sorry.

348
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,364
I saw the news about the car accident.

349
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,741
Are you hurt anywhere?

350
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,535
Why would I get hurt?

351
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,620
The bitch who's coming today
is the one who'll get hurt.

352
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,122
Is somebody supposed to be coming?

353
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,876
A VIP is coming.

354
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,507
So you've finally found her?

355
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,218
I found her.

356
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,513
But she got scared and ran away.

357
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,056
What a coward.

358
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,813
Who says she ran away?

359
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,441
She didn't show up, so she ran away.

360
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:02,610
It's past noon now. She's not here.

361
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:08,658
I did show up.

362
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,619
What are you talking about?

363
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,289
I showed up exactly at noon.

364
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,838
What the hell are you saying?

365
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,568
I told you to release
the bodyguard immediately.

366
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,031
Why didn't you do it?

367
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:37,413
Why did you take your anger out
on somebody else?

368
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,874
Let's not do that anymore.

369
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,753
You…

370
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,466
It's you?

371
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,426
Now I know

372
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,722
why you wanted Mr. Kang's love so badly.

373
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,477
Your birthday was our first day.

374
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,607
It's my birthday today!

375
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,617
Don't ever betray me.

376
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,577
Of course.

377
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,454
Not until the day I die.

378
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,961
I must say, your husband…

379
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,173
is quite a catch.

380
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,786
Ms. Han.

381
00:34:02,248 --> 00:34:05,126
Could we begin
the Parent Association interview now?

382
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,836
All right.

383
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:37,700
You crazy bitch.

384
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,919
Get your act together.

385
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,048
Do you want everybody to know

386
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,759
that you were fooled cluelessly by me?

387
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,672
Bo-ram and Da-bi.

388
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,507
Do you want to see something fun?

389
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,424
-Yes.
-Yes.

390
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,429
Go on and play.

391
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:00,700
I missed you so much.

392
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,203
How could you
stop talking to me for so long?

393
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,123
I missed you too.

394
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,584
Very much.

395
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,255
Stay with me.

396
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,219
I'll go to the House of Roses
after the party.

397
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,221
We can't do that anymore.

398
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:31,480
This will help your task force team.

399
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,079
We're over now.

400
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,081
Over?

401
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,625
What do you mean?

402
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,173
Ms. Han found out.

403
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,114
I don't think
I'll be able to see you again.

404
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:24,575
There's no way that's happening.

405
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,952
There's no other way.

406
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,592
You're crazy.

407
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,517
You're completely out of your mind.

408
00:37:52,478 --> 00:37:53,771
Dad.

409
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,023
Can you open this for me?

410
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,525
Sure.

411
00:37:58,401 --> 00:37:59,277
We'll talk later.

412
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,449
I'll be going then.

413
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:26,887
Hey.

414
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:41,652
I'm going to kill you.

415
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,488
I'll rip your heart apart.

416
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:48,409
It'll be a pain that's on another level.

417
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,037
I'll make you beg for death.

418
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:55,958
"I'll make you beg for death."

419
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,878
That sounds pretty familiar.

420
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,715
But I don't think you
have the time for that.

421
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:04,717
You haven't the slightest idea

422
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,136
what drove me to do it,

423
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,971
why I did it,

424
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:12,141
or what my next move will be.

425
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,061
You don't know a thing,
so what are you going to do?

426
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,355
Why should I know anything
about your intentions?

427
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,939
You're going to be dead soon anyway.

428
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:20,149
Here's something to think about.

429
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,572
Why don't you start thinking about

430
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,033
why this is happening to you?

431
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,621
You've never given it a thought, have you?

432
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:37,333
You've always been
the perpetrator, not the victim.

433
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,045
It's a familiar question for those
who have gone through misfortunes.

434
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:45,883
"Why did something so terrible
happen to me?"

435
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:49,136
Such a question always lingers.

436
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,431
But you'll never find the answer to it.

437
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,518
It will eat you up alive.

438
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,772
Why?

439
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:02,733
Why do you think?

440
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:18,541
If you figure out the answer,

441
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,670
I just might go a little easier on you.

442
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:34,473
So-ra.

443
00:40:59,039 --> 00:40:59,999
Talk to me, not her.

444
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,367
-Get in.
-Why should I?

445
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,537
Do you want to leave separately
with everyone watching?

446
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,455
Get in.

447
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,373
Come on, get in.

448
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,335
Just get in.

449
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,003
Let go of me.

450
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,694
Let's talk.

451
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,749
I'm disgusted that you cheated on me,

452
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,504
but why did it have to be her?

453
00:42:29,505 --> 00:42:32,049
Do you know how shitty
I'm feeling right now?

454
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,802
I'll never forgive her.

455
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:37,972
I'm going to kill her.

456
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:39,765
I started all this.

457
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,184
She didn't do anything wrong.

458
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,228
Just blame me.

459
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,943
You're worried about her even now?

460
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:53,821
Not me?

461
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,906
I know how you're feeling.

462
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,909
That's why I'm telling you to blame me.

463
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,663
Unbelievable.

464
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,669
And?

465
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,631
I'm sorry.

466
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:13,549
And?

467
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,344
What else do you have to say?

468
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,846
Tell me what you want.

469
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,097
What I want?

470
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:24,476
What I want
is for nothing to have happened.

471
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:28,439
I want you to not have done anything!

472
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,192
Let's talk inside.

473
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:35,654
Why should I?

474
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,573
I'm going to my dad's.

475
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:40,492
Let's go inside first.

476
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,037
I'm going to think about what to do there.

477
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,455
Mr. Park.

478
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,623
Turn the car around.

479
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,754
Grandma.

480
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,381
Honey.

481
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:08,812
Babe.

482
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,648
Thank you for coming back.

483
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,442
I've given it a lot of thought,

484
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,736
and I realized
that I can't live without you.

485
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,822
Let's start over. I'll do better.

486
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:25,162
Your secret.

487
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,917
Can you tell me
about the video that I saw?

488
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,925
Fine, I'll tell you everything.

489
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,096
Vice President Kim Yi-sak
is the real bad guy.

490
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,557
He sold GEDIKS over to LY.

491
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,060
I was a new employee back then.

492
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,437
But I had no reason to be threatened.

493
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:54,483
I've never seen the chairman
of GEDIKS nor his daughter.

494
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:23,554
I don't want anybody
getting involved in this.

495
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,264
I won't tolerate that.

496
00:45:27,724 --> 00:45:30,185
Why did you start all this
if you're so scared of my dad knowing?

497
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,564
I haven't forgiven what you've done yet.

498
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,942
If you start planning something,

499
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,153
then I truly won't forgive you.

500
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,990
Are you trying to threaten me right now?

501
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,244
Don't take my warning lightly.

502
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,121
Stay here for the night,

503
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,373
but come back home tomorrow.

504
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,004
He told me all about
how Yi-sak sold over GEDIKS.

505
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,507
We could use this data in our lawsuit.

506
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,467
You weren't listening to me at all,

507
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:46,887
and now you want to help me?

508
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,097
It's not that I wasn't listening to you.

509
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:53,018
My resolve to sue them with you
has never changed.

510
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,312
Didn't you say
you're going to make So-ra get a divorce?

511
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,397
Nothing that I do with So-ra

512
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,816
will affect our lawsuit.

513
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:03,070
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?

514
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,199
Do you think human feelings are that easy?

515
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,785
As I've told you before,

516
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,955
I don't have any feelings
toward Yoon-gyeom.

517
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:14,915
And even if I did,

518
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,792
that's not important.

519
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,655
-Sir.
-Yes?

520
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,115
I have some bad news.

521
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,535
Yoon-gyeom has put together
a task force team

522
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:53,787
to get listed in New York.

523
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,207
He has professionals working for him.

524
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,043
What about the people
who were supporting the listing?

525
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,753
Why the sudden task force team?

526
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:04,423
The LY Distribution was a trick.

527
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:07,467
He's backstabbed us.

528
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,264
That little…

529
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,765
LY PAY COMMEMORATES
NY STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING

530
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,058
LY Pay?

531
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,643
Not LY Distribution?

532
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,896
Both you and Bon-geun
have some of LY Distribution's shares,

533
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:22,941
but Yoon-gyeom alone
owns the entirety of LY Pay.

534
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,485
Wait, so…

535
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,113
that one's listed
on the New York Stock Exchange?

536
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,239
If he makes it work,

537
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:32,159
it's only a matter of time
until he takes over the company.

538
00:48:59,686 --> 00:49:00,520
I'm sorry, sir.

539
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:02,856
I cannot let you enter.

540
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:05,025
How dare you treat me like this?

541
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:06,985
Do you not know who I am?

542
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:08,654
Chairman Kang has ordered

543
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,365
not to let you into the building
until he gives permission.

544
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,407
How dare you?

545
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,452
-Call Yoon-gyeom.
-Yes, sir.

546
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,706
You bunch won't get away with this!

547
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,208
I'm sorry, sir.

548
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,255
Yoon-gyeom, that punk.
How dare he screw me over like this?

549
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:29,966
He screwed over his father too.

550
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,510
He's really something else.

551
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,512
Gosh, what a creepy little guy.

552
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:36,473
What is it?

553
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,141
I'm sorry, sir.

554
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,436
You cannot enter
without Chairman Kang's permission.

555
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,897
You son of a bitch!

556
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:51,905
My son-in-law is a real son of a gun,

557
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:53,448
but he's your actual son, isn't he?

558
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,410
It looks like he backstabbed
his own father too.

559
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,912
What a fine family.

560
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,540
I mean, there's that video too.

561
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:02,749
Maybe it runs in the family.

562
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:04,501
Watch your mouth.

563
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,586
This is happening all because of you.

564
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,464
So you've decided to pin it all on me now?

565
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:14,386
It all started because you were trying to
bite a chunk off of the company!

566
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,431
LY has always been mine,
you fucking thieves!

567
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,016
Don't you dare cuss at me,
you vulgar bastard!

568
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,768
-You're a worthless parasite.
-What?

569
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,354
A politician parasite
that feeds off of chaebols!

570
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:25,814
-You…
-Hey!

571
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:30,819
Watch what you're saying!

572
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,821
You rude brat!

573
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,614
Why you…

574
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,492
Goddammit.

575
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,704
Have you lost your mind?

576
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,997
-Huh?
-You little brat!

577
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:44,583
What the…

578
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:47,878
-Sir.
-Let go!

579
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:48,795
Stop, for goodness' sake!

580
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,547
-Let go.
-What do you think you're doing?

581
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,048
-Let go!
-Stop it.

582
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,383
I said, stop it.

583
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:55,927
You think you can stop me, you bastard?

584
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:56,970
You asshole.

585
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,056
How dare you hit him?

586
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,602
LY is mine, you son of a bitch!

587
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,729
You asshole, this is all your fault!

588
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,232
You've lost it, haven't you?

589
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:10,317
How dare you hit me?

590
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,028
Who the hell was that?

591
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,654
Come over here, you asshole!

592
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,657
Are you all right, sir?

593
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,830
-Gosh, that hurts!
-Oh, that hurts!

594
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,040
You little shit.

595
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,483
LY, THE WORLD'S LEADING COMPANY

596
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:02,452
She must be truly oblivious.

597
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,371
Okay.

598
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,169
How dare she?

599
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:14,631
Fine.

600
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:20,136
LY Pay will be taking
a different approach…

601
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,013
Chairman Kang is on TV, ma'am.

602
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,809
…by introducing an unprecedented
biometric payment system

603
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,479
that uses skin texture
and body temperature for transactions.

604
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,314
LY Pay's historical…

605
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,859
So LY is a global company now.

606
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,278
Chairman Kang is amazing.

607
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,864
Congratulations, Ms. Han.

608
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:42,576
It looks like you and Chairman Kang
will be quite busy at the end of the year.

609
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,515
I don't want to bother you,

610
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,185
but I can't solve this issue
by myself this time.

611
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,314
Please help me.

612
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:15,275
Sure, just tell me what you need.

613
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,612
The female bodyguard that Yoon-gyeom
assigned to me is in danger.

614
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,822
She got caught by So-ra,

615
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:24,075
but I can't rescue her alone
because So-ra probably has a lot of men.

616
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:27,579
And I can't have anybody
finding out that you're helping me.

617
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,333
What is that?

618
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,174
Shit, it's the cops. Run!

619
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,893
-Go after them.
-Yes, sir.

620
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,479
Ms. Lee, are you okay?

621
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:53,897
Wake up, Ms. Lee.

622
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:55,315
Ms. Lee!

623
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:58,151
Hurry and check where the ambulance is at.

624
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,736
-Check on the ambulance.
-Ms. Lee!

625
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,074
It'll arrive soon, sir.

626
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,408
All right.

627
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,165
Thanks, Myeong-hoon.

628
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:13,083
I owe you one.

629
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,501
Don't worry about it.

630
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,294
If it weren't for you,

631
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:19,798
all of us would still be
living like gangsters.

632
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,300
Thanks.

633
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:25,720
Ms. Lee, open your eyes.

634
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,139
Open your eyes, Ms. Lee.

635
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,214
She needs to be hospitalized
for a few more days.

636
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,428
Things might have gotten bad
if it weren't for you.

637
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,353
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

638
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,271
Congratulations!

639
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:23,445
Good work, everybody.
This is all thanks to you.

640
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:24,404
Let's have a drink.

641
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,908
-Cheers.
-Great work!

642
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,202
-Great work!
-Great work!

643
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:44,382
We're over now.

644
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,260
I don't think
I'll be able to see you again.

645
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:55,977
Sir.

646
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:59,731
-Where are you headed?
-I need to go somewhere.

647
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,858
So-ra, that brat.

648
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,569
She can't even
keep track of her own husband?

649
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,655
How useless can she be
to embarrass me in public?

650
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,408
Find where she is, quick.

651
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,494
Yes, sir.

652
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,039
So-ra.

653
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,501
I tried to calm down your father,
but it's not working.

654
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:20,835
He's on his way to see you.

655
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,911
I'm in front of your house.

656
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:57,372
I miss you so much.

657
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,708
It's driving me crazy.

658
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:02,877
I need just a moment.

659
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,256
Let me see you for just a moment.

660
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,385
I can't do that.

661
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:13,138
Think about Ms. Han.

662
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:14,222
I know that.

663
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:18,143
But you're the only one I could think of
on a day like this.

664
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,477
Please, just let me see your face.

665
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:22,188
I'm begging you.

666
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,025
We're over.

667
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:57,640
Chairman Kang.

668
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,521
How dare you show up here?

669
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:06,191
Jin-wook found out about you two.

670
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,568
Don't cause any more problems.

671
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,862
If you don't heed my warning now,

672
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,364
you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

673
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,212
Please return home, ma'am.

674
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:28,630
I'll be fine on my own.

675
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,840
Lie down.

676
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,467
I'll be all right.

677
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:40,934
You seem like a good person.

678
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,995
Do you know
where Chairman Kang's task force team

679
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:04,082
is holding their celebration party?

680
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:50,753
Ms. Kim Sun-bin
sent this to your office, sir.

681
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:20,241
PIAZZOLLA
1968, BUENOS AIRES

682
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:48,019
It's Piazzolla's bandoneon.

683
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:52,231
I noticed your scar.

684
01:00:54,233 --> 01:00:56,361
That scar may never fade,

685
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:58,363
but the heart…

686
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:02,367
may be healed, little by little.

687
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,623
I hope this bandoneon

688
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,667
can comfort you

689
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,253
just as much as it can comfort

690
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,048
the soul of your late mother.

691
01:02:15,356 --> 01:02:16,399
I missed you.

692
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,195
I can't live without you.

693
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,656
Please don't say that it's over.

694
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:26,159
Please.

695
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,664
Chairman Kang!

696
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:38,880
What do you think you're doing?

697
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,048
You think you're entitled?

698
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,509
She's my wife, do you understand?

699
01:02:44,969 --> 01:02:46,137
Honey.

700
01:02:48,181 --> 01:02:50,641
Did I surprise you
by calling you out of the blue?

701
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:53,352
Not at all. I'm so happy right now.

702
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,813
Let's go look at the view
and have a drink too.

703
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:57,523
Thanks so much.

704
01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,525
Let's go.

705
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,198
Come here.

706
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:06,991
Calm down, Jin-wook.

707
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,036
How dare you tell me to calm down?

708
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,621
Don't do this, honey.

709
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:14,415
Why are you holding me back, honey?

710
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:16,125
You should be stopping him instead!

711
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:18,002
Jin-wook!

712
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:20,838
Are you okay?

713
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,423
Don't touch her.

714
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,550
And who are you to tell me that?

715
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,302
She's my wife.

716
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,637
She's mine!

717
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,015
You can't approach her
while you're acting this way.

718
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,602
You're the chairman.

719
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:37,897
Yet you stole my wife,
and now you're threatening me?

720
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,316
This will be the end of you.

721
01:03:40,399 --> 01:03:42,068
You'll be screwed
once people find out, understand?

722
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:43,778
You can only yell at me like this

723
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,155
because you're legally her husband.

724
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,617
Then I guess
I'll just take care of it legally.

725
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,327
What?

726
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,830
Are you saying you'll make us divorce?

727
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,999
I'm Kang Yoon-gyeom.

728
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,085
I've always taken everything
I ever wanted.

729
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,631
You're insane.

730
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,175
You're seriously crazy.

731
01:04:06,759 --> 01:04:08,177
You are too, aren't you?

732
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:12,223
Anyone would go crazy
over a woman like her, after all.

733
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:19,522
I can't end things with you.

734
01:04:21,899 --> 01:04:23,442
I have a question.

735
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,904
I'm assuming your disappearance back then

736
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,908
was for an intentional purpose.

737
01:04:34,412 --> 01:04:35,371
What were you waiting for?

738
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:38,124
The critical point.

739
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,879
You mean, when the water boils over?

740
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,591
Water doesn't start boiling suddenly.

741
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:49,468
Ten degrees.

742
01:04:50,678 --> 01:04:52,471
Twenty degrees and seventy degrees.

743
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,559
Water boils over

744
01:04:56,642 --> 01:04:59,103
when it reaches the critical point
after all its steps.

745
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,523
Then it changes form from gas to liquid,

746
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,526
something entirely different.

747
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:18,164
Humans are the same.

748
01:05:19,665 --> 01:05:21,292
When we reach the critical point,

749
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:25,755
we lose our ability to reason
and do things we shouldn’t do.

750
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:33,429
Drive!

751
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:35,264
Hurry!

752
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:39,810
La-el is very close
to making So-ra get a divorce.

753
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,354
Tell Yoon-gyeom

754
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:44,607
that La-el is Lee Tae-joon's daughter.

755
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:46,442
Do it as soon as you can.

756
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,778
Doing things we shouldn't do

757
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:51,113
when we've passed the critical point.

758
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:53,658
How are you planning to use that?

759
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:57,662
It'll give me a chance

760
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,332
to change a fate that was God-given.

761
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,996
I won't regret anything,

762
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,664
even if the worst happens to me.

763
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,333
Why did you call me here?

764
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:46,752
Honey.

765
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:49,880
You've tried so hard.

766
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:53,551
I wonder why So-ra hates me so much.

767
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:54,593
What a psychopath.

768
01:06:55,136 --> 01:06:56,387
I can't just let you off, can I?

769
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:58,848
It'll be thrilling, for sure.

770
01:06:58,931 --> 01:07:00,099
I'm going to do

771
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:03,894
my very best to ruin your life.
