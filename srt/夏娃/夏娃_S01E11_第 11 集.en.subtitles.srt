1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:50,300
No. My head has never been clearer.

4
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,180
Let's break up.

5
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,726
We should split up now.

6
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,147
I'm not changing my mind
no matter how many times we talk about it.

7
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,357
We're getting a divorce.

8
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,945
He can't be serious.

9
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,573
A divorce so suddenly?

10
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,117
There's no way he meant it.

11
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:18,828
I bet he was just angry.

12
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,806
It's so pretty, Mom.

13
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,766
I'll put in
a new family picture every year.

14
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,813
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday, La-el.

15
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,497
I don't want to be hidden anymore.

16
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,958
I want to be…

17
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,127
your woman

18
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,171
instead of Ms. Han.

19
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,763
I'm going to raise Eun-bi and Da-bi.

20
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,723
There's no way you're taking them.

21
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,935
Honey, we can't get a divorce.

22
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,687
The kids need both of their parents.

23
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,982
I don't even want to think about them
growing up with just one of us.

24
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:29,983
The doctor said

25
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:33,403
that it'd be better
to separate Da-bi from you.

26
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,363
That's not my fault.

27
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,073
We're famous businessmen.
We're basically celebrities.

28
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,700
People pay attention to us.

29
00:02:38,783 --> 00:02:40,118
The kids didn't get to
have a normal childhood

30
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,495
because they knew
they were always getting watched.

31
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,332
You're the one who cheated on me.

32
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,627
So why are you asking for a divorce
when I should be angry?

33
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,464
This is unacceptable.

34
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,720
Since Chairman Kang has decided
to get a divorce, I need to hurry.

35
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,806
This is the schedule
for Ms. Jang's lawsuit.

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,851
As soon as the lawsuit starts,
she'll start using the press.

37
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,728
She wants to shift
the public's opinion in her favor.

38
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,188
When she gets exposed to the press,
your identity will be revealed too.

39
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,026
I'm going to ask her
to delay the plan with the press.

40
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,407
These are the contracts
for the insiders who sold GEDIKS.

41
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,909
It'll be a huge advantage for us

42
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,994
if we can get
the original GEDIKS contracts

43
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,621
from Chairman Kang's safe.

44
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,582
Don't worry about Pan-ro and Jeong-chul.

45
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,500
I'll do my best to ensure

46
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,336
that they won't do anything to you.

47
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,799
How could you be so cruel?

48
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,553
You can't just do this all of a sudden.

49
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,597
You have to give me
some room for negotiation.

50
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,767
How can you do this to your wife
who got you two children?

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,394
If I don't make myself clear,

52
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,940
then you'll try
to argue with me even more.

53
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,030
So?

54
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:08,248
Why are you packing your clothes?

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,166
Where do you think you're going?

56
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,293
You can take some time alone
to think over things.

57
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,088
Once you've made your decision,

58
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,048
you need to leave this house for Da-bi.

59
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,384
No way, you're not going anywhere!

60
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:20,385
Please!

61
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,973
I'm tired of you hitting me.

62
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,185
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

63
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:55,169
Divorce, my ass.

64
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,297
I won't allow it.

65
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,091
I'm not getting a divorce.

66
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:01,509
Never.

67
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,428
Never.

68
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,641
Never!

69
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,448
Da-bi.

70
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,164
Secretary Kim.

71
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,915
I need to hold Da-bi hostage.

72
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,084
I'm going to the kindergarten.
Get the car ready.

73
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,294
Quick!

74
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,933
LY GROUP SEMICONDUCTOR
LAWSUIT PLAN

75
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,268
LAWSUIT DISMISSED DUE TO
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN 2010

76
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,779
The lawsuit was filed
under the name of LY Victims Group.

77
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,572
A date hasn't been set yet,

78
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:07,116
but it'll be a huge societal issue
when word gets out.

79
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,410
That's why they told us about it first.

80
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,162
The representative is Jang Moon-hee.

81
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:15,333
She's supposed to
be La-el's mother, right?

82
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:22,256
I sacrificed the entirety
of my life and wealth for 13 years

83
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,550
to reveal LY's illegal slush fund

84
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:27,887
accumulated by Kang Yoon-gyeom
and Han Pan-ro,

85
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:32,141
as well as the crimes
they committed against their victims.

86
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,270
Yoon-gyeom worked with
Pan-ro and Jeong-chul

87
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,733
to illegally seize GEDIKS 13 years ago

88
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,528
and eventually dominate
the global semiconductor market.

89
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,322
Article 350.

90
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,615
The crime of blackmailing

91
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,576
and taking an individual's stock shares
by a forced signature.

92
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,997
On top of that, various illegal acts
in the hostile process of an M&A…

93
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,165
I found Lee Tae-joon's seal too.

94
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,167
…as well as
violations of insider trading laws

95
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,753
are enough to get
a life sentence at the very least.

96
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:03,840
Dozens of janitors and researchers died

97
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:06,175
as they were exposed to carcinogens

98
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,594
while developing
LY semiconductor chemicals.

99
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,223
The researcher who died
under unknown circumstances

100
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,309
while trying to reveal
the unjust deaths of the workers

101
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,562
was my daughter.

102
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:22,775
Seon-a!

103
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,200
HONEST CONFESSION
BY RESEARCHER PARK DESPITE RISKS

104
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,869
58 WORKERS AT SEMICONDUCTOR FACTORY DEAD,
NO COMMENTS FROM LY

105
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,413
MALFUNCTIONING BRAKES?
3 CARS COLLIDE IN THE CITY, 2 DEAD

106
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,752
They also committed
numerous acts of corruption,

107
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,214
such as the embezzlement of
800 billion won in slush funds,

108
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,717
as well as those going against
Article 356 of the Criminal Law,

109
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,761
and sections 1 and 2
in Article 3 of the Special Cases Act.

110
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,889
I'm planning on destroying LY
brick by brick

111
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,476
and giving their tainted money
back to our society.

112
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,728
I'll establish justice

113
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:02,690
by ensuring that Kang Yoon-gyeom,
Han Pan-ro, and Kim Jeong-chul

114
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,275
will get the heaviest sentences
in Korean history.

115
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,209
The information about
LY's accounting fraud in 2011 is missing.

116
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,377
I'll send it to you when I find it.

117
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,803
What?

118
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:41,312
What's going on?

119
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,883
La-el, did you change the passcode?

120
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,139
SECURITY SYSTEM SETTINGS

121
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:19,392
FINGERPRINT RECOGNITION SECURITY SYSTEM

122
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,519
How dare you mess with
the security system?

123
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:23,896
I don't know
why you think the room belongs to you.

124
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:26,566
We each own half of it.

125
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,609
In that case,
then I own half of it as well.

126
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,070
You can't change the system

127
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,282
without my permission.

128
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,285
I think I can, actually.

129
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:39,829
You're the one who betrayed me first.

130
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,666
If you can admit that you were wrong,

131
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,501
then come find me at the House of Roses.

132
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,260
Why did you let Da-bi go?

133
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,472
How dare you let her go
without my permission?

134
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,807
I'm sorry, Ms. Han.

135
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,768
I just assumed that it'd be fine

136
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,812
since Chairman Kang
came to get her himself.

137
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,331
Hey!

138
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,817
Are you dumb?

139
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,987
Don't you know who I am?

140
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,615
Chairman Kang ordered us to guard Ms. Kim.

141
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:00,451
Let her be.

142
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,085
What a joke.

143
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,755
You don't know what you're doing.

144
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,550
You're all getting fired!

145
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,886
Take Bo-ram and go.

146
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,080
Don't try to act all classy.

147
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:52,169
You'll never be a part of the upper class.

148
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,675
How pathetic.

149
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,890
The real master of this game
is starting to change.

150
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,435
Do you still not understand?

151
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,023
Maybe you'll understand after you've lost
your husband, wealth and power,

152
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,735
and your mind and body
begin to deteriorate

153
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,571
with nothing left at all.

154
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,913
I'm going to kill you.

155
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,917
So will I also end up

156
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,463
like those two women
who had their destinies

157
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,382
changed by Han So-ra?

158
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:06,076
DR. JUNG

159
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,955
This is so cool!

160
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,499
It's chocolate!

161
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:16,795
You'll spend this spring break

162
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,839
at Bo-ram's grandmother's.

163
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,217
You can play games
and learn ballet from me.

164
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,635
That sounds great!

165
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,221
Dad, I love this place!

166
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,389
-Let's go play.
-Sure.

167
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,478
I didn't think about coming here.

168
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,021
But I'm glad that I did.

169
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,316
Ms. Han is having a hard time

170
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,693
accepting this, isn't she?

171
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,237
Everything's fine now.

172
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:43,989
I'm with you.

173
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,886
I want information about her.

174
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:08,264
Her weaknesses, scandals,

175
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,307
and who she dated before she got married.

176
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,017
I want everything that might be useful.

177
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,519
If you can't find anything,
then come up with some.

178
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,062
Yes, ma'am.

179
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:19,400
Mr. Prime Minister and Mr. Kim also
ordered me to find out more about her.

180
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,152
I want to hear about it first.

181
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,822
-Do you understand?
-Yes, ma'am.

182
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,216
BLUE HOUSE

183
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,223
Chief Secretary Seo.

184
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,936
Is something wrong? It's pretty late.

185
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,107
You surprised me
by calling me out of the blue.

186
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,192
Have a seat.

187
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:03,611
Sure.

188
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:14,914
Did I do something wrong, sir?

189
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,349
The Swiss borrowed-name account.

190
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,392
That was you, wasn't it?

191
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:39,021
It looks like you stole some money
from almost all of the projects.

192
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,482
Does Prime Minister Han know about this?

193
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:43,734
How do you expect me

194
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:49,073
to be a part of the Zeus Project
if you're going to act like this?

195
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,131
Sun-bin

196
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,968
is the daughter of a man who saved me.

197
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,010
Sun-bin?

198
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,639
Kim Sun-bin.

199
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,766
The one who had an affair
with Chairman Kang--

200
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,812
Hey, Jeong-chul.

201
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,480
Yes, sir?

202
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:23,899
Sun-bin is like family to me.

203
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,193
Do I really need to elaborate?

204
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,278
Not at all, sir.

205
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,281
I completely understand.

206
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,459
The tea's getting cold.

207
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,470
Welcome.

208
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,949
Would you like to order?

209
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,160
One coffee and tea, please.

210
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,077
Sure.

211
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:20,414
You like tea, don't you?

212
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,004
I had no choice

213
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:31,258
but to reveal your identity to Yoon-gyeom.

214
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,636
My safety will be compromised

215
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,680
if you decide to team up with Yoon-gyeom.

216
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,891
And what about the lawsuit?

217
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,103
Still, you shouldn't have
changed the security system.

218
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,563
Put it back to the way it was.

219
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,568
There's just one thing that I want.

220
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:53,947
You can go ahead with the lawsuit,
but I don't want the press to know.

221
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,491
I also want you
to send a representative to court.

222
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,868
I want to know what happened to my mother,

223
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:00,496
and I want to see So-ra dead.

224
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,583
Then I'll give you
the original GEDIKS contract,

225
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,794
as well as Yoon-gyeom's secret safe.

226
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,296
This isn't a negotiation. It's a threat.

227
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,257
If you reveal my identity
without my permission,

228
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,510
then we're going down together.

229
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:40,619
Chief Secretary Seo.

230
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,506
I didn't know
that you'd be here, Chairman Kang.

231
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,008
Yes. Sun-bin isn't here right now.

232
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,219
I see.

233
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,349
You said you have something for her.
Would you like me to pass it on?

234
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:05,144
No thanks, I'll just do it myself.

235
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,604
Well, have it your way.

236
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,693
It feels very different
to see you in a private setting.

237
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:16,530
You also look very different here.

238
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,739
Really?

239
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,580
I don't know a lot about politics.

240
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,081
Chief Secretary Seo,

241
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,543
do you know the difference
between a businessman and a politician?

242
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,880
Politicians are a bit reckless.

243
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,966
Even if the possibility of success is low,
they still try to do it.

244
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,636
But businessmen never invest
in something that won't work out,

245
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,930
things like M&As and investment decisions.

246
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:42,973
And they'll never

247
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,894
fall in love with a woman
who loves somebody else,

248
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,771
or anything like that.

249
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,899
Is that so?

250
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:56,403
Well, this is my view
on that same subject.

251
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,489
Businessmen put too much faith

252
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,992
in what they can see.

253
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:09,082
But politicians try to consider
what's not visible to the eye.

254
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,043
For example,

255
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,212
thinking that a woman will be his forever

256
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,547
just because she's with him
at the present moment.

257
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,633
Politicians would never

258
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:21,011
be so arrogant.

259
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,571
Hello, Chief Secretary Seo.

260
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,034
Have you had dinner yet?

261
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,411
Would you like something to eat?

262
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,789
No thanks, I'm just here
to give you something.

263
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:50,540
I have to get going.

264
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,543
You two can talk.

265
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,586
I'll give you some space.

266
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,464
No, it's fine.
I'm sorry for barging in so suddenly.

267
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,800
Let's sit down
for a proper meal next time.

268
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,885
Sure, Chief Secretary Seo.

269
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,096
Goodbye then.

270
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,998
This is the draft for Ms. Jang's lawsuit.

271
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,544
Thank you.

272
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,546
I'll take a look.

273
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:41,591
La-el.

274
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,095
I won't beat around the bush with this.

275
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,222
Is revenge the only thing

276
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,517
that you want from Chairman Kang?

277
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,527
Why are you asking me that?

278
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,279
I'm just nervous.

279
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,283
You told me everything else,

280
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,410
but you never mentioned
you were staying with him.

281
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,121
You don't really have to do that, do you?

282
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,833
Do you really have feelings for him?

283
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:17,961
You're acting just like Ms. Jang.

284
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,339
Why do my feelings matter?

285
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,467
What's important is
that I do what I'm supposed to do.

286
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,302
I'm sick and tired

287
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,055
of people being melodramatic.

288
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,098
Do you really think
I'm being melodramatic right now?

289
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,115
You asked me

290
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,577
what my name means

291
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,663
13 years ago.

292
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,459
Lee La-el. It's a pretty name.

293
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,545
Is there a meaning behind it?

294
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,423
"One who belongs to God."

295
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,176
My dad named me.

296
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,178
Hey, Dad.

297
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,014
What exactly does La-el mean?

298
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,558
"One who belongs to God"?

299
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:15,936
I mean, what does that mean?

300
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,273
Does it mean that I'm as powerful as God?

301
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:21,566
No way.

302
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,111
A human can't be as strong as God.

303
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,779
Then what does it mean?

304
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:29,491
It means that you don't
belong to the world.

305
00:23:30,408 --> 00:23:31,368
What do you mean?

306
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,453
In this world,

307
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,957
there are thousands of wrong paths.

308
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,669
But you won't go down one of those paths

309
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,797
since you don't belong to the world.

310
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,759
There's not a shred of darkness
inside your heart.

311
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:48,677
Wow.

312
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,263
So I can't do anything wrong?

313
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,183
No matter how hard things get,

314
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,144
just follow your heart.

315
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,647
That way, you'll always be in the right.

316
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,190
That's awesome.

317
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:07,070
My heart is full of revenge,

318
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:10,365
and I'm following my heart.

319
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,830
I understand.

320
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,709
But…

321
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,461
if you really do love Mr. Kang,

322
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:28,758
then you'll end up in unimaginable pain.

323
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,679
And I hope you don't go through that.

324
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,466
MR. KANG

325
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,759
Can you come to my room?

326
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,921
Just as how you've healed me,

327
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:52,467
I want to try to heal you too.

328
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,163
Is revenge the only thing
that you want from Mr. Kang?

329
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,561
Are you okay?

330
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,608
-Are you hurt?
-I'm fine.

331
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:47,123
One day, your love

332
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:51,252
could burn down everything
that you've built up so far.

333
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,879
If you really do love Mr. Kang,

334
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,507
then you'll end up in unimaginable pain.

335
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,759
And I hope you don't go through that.

336
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,594
Sun-bin.

337
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,659
Ms. Kim.

338
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,710
Is it safe for you to be here?

339
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,212
Ms. Han isn't in the best of moods
right now.

340
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,131
Da-bi wanted to come to kindergarten.

341
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:25,138
Don't you think
that she looks a lot happier

342
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,140
now that she's staying
with me instead of her mother?

343
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,351
So Da-bi is with you now?

344
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,855
Didn't you know she's staying with me?

345
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:39,277
Chairman Kang, Da-bi, and Bo-ram
are all living with me now.

346
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:44,157
I see.

347
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,713
MS. HAN

348
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,634
Ms. Han.

349
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:12,811
She's been spotted.

350
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:16,981
I'm tracking her.

351
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,316
Da-bi is in the car too.

352
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,151
I think I can find out
where Chairman Kang is.

353
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,778
Do not lose her.

354
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,197
Shoot as soon as you confirm the address.

355
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,532
Yes, ma'am.

356
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:36,000
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

357
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,627
MR. KANG

358
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:40,004
-Rock, paper, scissors.
-Rock, paper, scissors.

359
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,007
I think somebody is following me.

360
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,844
They're trying to find this place.

361
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,346
You don't know
what So-ra and her father are like.

362
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,347
You're in danger. You need to run.

363
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:52,475
Should I act like I'm going back
to the kindergarten instead?

364
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,853
Yes. I'll go to the kindergarten now.

365
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:55,770
Okay.

366
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,817
Secretary Cha, get the car ready.

367
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,971
Did you find their lair? Where is it?

368
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,306
Ms. Han, this is Marco.

369
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:34,934
I just slept with Ms. Eun,

370
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,853
and I took plenty of pictures for proof.

371
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,609
I'm calling you because I'd like to ask
for the money you promised.

372
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,903
Should I send you the pictures,
or should I visit you in person?

373
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,405
You pathetic asshole, get lost!

374
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,587
The woman that Yoon-gyeom
had an affair with

375
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:04,339
is really nothing special.

376
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,424
I have no idea
why he fell for her so hard.

377
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,885
What do you mean?

378
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,180
I mean, she's just
a regular old housewife.

379
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,681
I looked into her,
but I couldn't find anything.

380
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:15,934
So?

381
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,479
I'll do some more research, of course.

382
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,440
I'm planning on looking into it
extremely thoroughly, Mr. Han.

383
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,365
It's So-ra.

384
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,160
What's up, So-ra?

385
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,538
What?!

386
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,999
Yoon-gyeom is living with her now?!

387
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,128
Those little assholes.

388
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,799
These crazy bastards.

389
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,926
I’m going to kill them.

390
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,552
Where's my hammer?

391
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,243
This is where they're staying at.

392
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:18,955
Come out, you bastards!

393
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,291
I swear, I'm going to skin them alive.

394
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,544
Come out!

395
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,132
Come on out!

396
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:31,134
Are you ignoring me?

397
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:33,136
Damn you!

398
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,524
KIM SUN-BIN

399
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,495
KIM SUN-BIN

400
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,123
Dad.

401
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,125
Da-bi?

402
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,086
What's wrong, Da-bi?

403
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,756
Da-bi!

404
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,398
What's going on? Are you okay?

405
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,443
We didn't make it to the kindergarten.

406
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,195
We were threatened on the road.

407
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:37,075
Mr. Han and Mr. Kim
showed up with weapons.

408
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,126
Sir.

409
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,670
Rumors are beginning
to spread in the stock market

410
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,547
about your relationship with Sun-bin.

411
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:55,802
I think Mrs. Han and ex-Prime Minister Han
are already aware of it.

412
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:53,276
THE RUMORS ARE OUT, LET'S BOYCOTT

413
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,278
WORLDXX CHAEBOL'S SCANDAL, K AND H

414
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,032
What a mess.

415
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,493
LY KANG YOON-GYEOM'S SHOCKING SCANDALS

416
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,292
-Unbelievable.
-Who is she?

417
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,169
SHE'S THE PARENT OF HIS KID'S CLASSMATE!

418
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:15,089
LY KANG YOON-GYEOM "HAVING AN AFFAIR"
SHOCKING SCANDALS!

419
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,806
Ma'am, it's a call from your father.

420
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:44,368
-Yes, Dad.
-Have you lost your mind?

421
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,579
What the hell are they saying on the news?

422
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,331
Have you been paying attention
to your husband at all?

423
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,083
-What were you thinking?
-I called Congressman Park.

424
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,919
I told him to take everything down.

425
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,588
What's the point?
Everybody's seen it already!

426
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:59,217
What the hell is Yoon-gyeom up to?

427
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,635
This is upsetting for me too.

428
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:03,304
Just give me some time.

429
00:37:04,597 --> 00:37:05,681
I'll take care of it.

430
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,308
That piece of shit.

431
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,143
He's out of his mind!

432
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:32,541
LY KANG YOON-GYEOM'S
QUESTIONABLE PERSONAL LIFE

433
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,546
Mr. President wants the floor leader
to publicly withdraw his words.

434
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,007
I'll convince him
if you can let me speak with him.

435
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:41,092
Yes, sir.

436
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,136
So nobody knows

437
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,389
who Chairman Kang's mistress is?

438
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,308
Everybody's looking for her online,
and nobody's found her yet?

439
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,227
What is she, an alien?

440
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,561
She seduced the chairman of LY,

441
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,897
the richest man in the country.

442
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,691
I wonder who she is.

443
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,859
His wife is Han Pan-ro's daughter, no?

444
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,822
-She’s got some guts.
-Right?

445
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,245
You dumbasses.

446
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:10,997
Absolutely useless.

447
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,456
What the hell were you doing?

448
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,125
Where the hell were you?

449
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,169
You should have stopped it.
How the hell didn't you see it coming?

450
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,171
What were you doing?

451
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,966
Where's the hammer?

452
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,719
Mr. Han! Please have mercy!

453
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:27,013
I'm sorry, Mr. Han!

454
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,815
The news of Mr. Kang's secret mistress

455
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:39,608
has caused controversy to grow.

456
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:43,946
LY has not released
any official statements yet.

457
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,364
Fine.

458
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,992
I won't go to the press.

459
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,953
I'll try to protect you
as much as possible.

460
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:55,207
But two weeks is the most I can get you.

461
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,043
Two weeks is more than enough.

462
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,138
MR. KANG

463
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:18,189
Mr. Kang.

464
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,982
Everybody's saying

465
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,486
that I'm just a mistress
who destroyed your family.

466
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,279
I don't know how I'll be able to live

467
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:28,657
if people find out that it was me.

468
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,204
What would I say to Bo-ram?

469
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,887
Mr. Kang is having an affair.

470
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,555
But he has a wife.

471
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,307
Who is she?

472
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,934
His mistress? Or his girlfriend?

473
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:55,935
Oh my goodness.

474
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,395
Look here. It must be true.

475
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,693
You make me sick.

476
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,654
Let's break up. We should split up now.

477
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:07,696
After the report

478
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,615
-about Mr. Kang's personal life…
-Mr. Kang's hidden…

479
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:12,493
Do you want everybody to know
that you were fooled cluelessly by me?

480
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,663
I'm not changing my mind
no matter how many times we talk about it.

481
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:16,580
We're getting a divorce.

482
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:34,515
Mrs. Han.

483
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,059
Go away and get lost.

484
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,369
Mrs. Han, I--

485
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:58,372
Turn off the TV and disconnect the Wi-Fi.

486
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,416
Don't tell me anything.

487
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,294
I don't want to hear it.

488
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,379
A court bailiff was here.

489
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:10,259
We've been saying you're not here
to chase the reporters away.

490
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,552
The bailiff went back for now, but…

491
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,056
Why was a bailiff here?

492
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,058
Chairman Kang…

493
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,270
has filed a divorce petition.

494
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:42,082
BAILIFF

495
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,918
-Who are you?
-I'm here to deliver a trial service.

496
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,045
I heard that she's here
instead of her house.

497
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:47,505
This is the divorce petition

498
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,924
that plaintiff Kang Yoon-gyeom
filed for defendant Han So-ra.

499
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,728
The YBN Economic News

500
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:05,314
just reported on the controversy
over Mr. Kang's personal life,

501
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,943
as well as the possibility
of a new ownership structure.

502
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,612
LY's annual exports
have surpassed 100 billion dollars,

503
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,324
accounting for 20 percent
of the country's total exports.

504
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,952
However, the stock prices
fell slightly today,

505
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,121
and the related stocks have been
inevitably affected as well.

506
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,250
LY's stocks have fallen by 20 percent
during the past few days.

507
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,255
PRIME MINISTER HAN PAN-RO

508
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,382
It's Han Pan-ro, sir.

509
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,121
Sir, why did you ask to see me

510
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,456
when you must be having a rough time
because of your son-in-law?

511
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,416
Mr. Seo.

512
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:09,169
I heard you're well acquainted
with the woman who ruined So-ra's life.

513
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,049
What should I do?

514
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,551
She screwed up my family,

515
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,846
as well as the entire country.

516
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,931
I can't let her get away with it, can I?

517
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,397
I completely understand
that you're shocked.

518
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,817
But Sun-bin is like family to me.

519
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:35,821
I won't let anything dangerous,

520
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,532
not even the slightest,

521
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,453
happen to her.

522
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:51,712
We have no choice then.

523
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:58,469
Then…

524
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:00,721
you can

525
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,681
just get a divorce!

526
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,100
Dad.

527
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,019
Don't try to cling to something
that won't work out.

528
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,104
Yoon-gyeom has lost his mind.

529
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,482
Don't you think so, Mr. Seo?

530
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,318
I'm the one who gave him GEDIKS.

531
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:16,320
Yoon-gyeom and LY are nothing.

532
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:18,280
I've given him so much.

533
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:21,283
There's no reason for my daughter
to get this kind of treatment!

534
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,205
I'll just take everything from him

535
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,082
and chase him away once he's penniless.

536
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,792
I'm never getting a divorce.

537
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,002
I'll never let her take him from me!

538
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:34,004
How would you get back a lunatic like him?

539
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:36,340
This is all because
you went there with the hammer!

540
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,508
You little…

541
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:41,261
We'll never get him back
doing something like that.

542
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:42,971
You couldn't even control
your own husband.

543
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,264
Shut the hell up!

544
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,101
Please, Mr. Han…

545
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:01,615
This family is falling apart.

546
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,367
It's breaking apart!

547
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,121
Everybody got screwed over
because of some woman.

548
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,882
How about this, Mr. Seo?

549
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,760
I wouldn't ever let her
get away with this.

550
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,596
But if you like her so much,

551
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,598
then I can't do anything to her.

552
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:31,478
So the only way for my daughter

553
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:34,815
and me to get out of this mess

554
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,651
is to countersue for divorce.

555
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:44,324
Let's do that
and strip Yoon-gyeom of his wealth.

556
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,913
And you, Mr. Seo,
will help me with the lawsuit

557
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,416
since I'm leaving that woman unharmed.

558
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:14,480
I need to see you
once you leave Han Pan-ro's house.

559
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:27,534
Do-wan.

560
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,412
There's no way I'm getting a divorce.

561
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,000
I can't do what my dad
wants me to do anymore.

562
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,960
Understood, ma'am.

563
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,510
I know you need money…

564
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,930
for your mother's surgery.

565
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:54,811
Take this.

566
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,861
CHECK
HAN SO-RA, DIRECTOR, LY CO., LTD.

567
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,159
Thank you so much, Mrs. Han.

568
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,453
You're the only one I have left.

569
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,499
I need you on my side.

570
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:17,709
Yes, ma'am.

571
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:18,961
I'll do anything for you.

572
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:23,882
Bring that bitch to me

573
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,842
without Yoon-gyeom or my dad finding out.

574
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,262
Do whatever you have to do.

575
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:40,566
I heard about Han Pan-ro's lawsuit.

576
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:42,401
The battle will be bigger
than we expected.

577
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:45,362
That's fine. There's a good side to it.

578
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,115
When Ms. Jang's lawsuit

579
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,534
meets Han Pan-ro's divorce lawsuit,

580
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,705
then the world will find out
that LY took GEDIKS illegally.

581
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,250
All right then.

582
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,335
Then I'll use the lawsuit

583
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,922
to prove that LY belongs to you,
the inheritor of GEDIKS.

584
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,467
It's only right

585
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,429
that Yoon-gyeom loses everything
and suffers.

586
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,308
You're the rightful owner of LY, La-el.

587
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:21,023
Let's make this the country's
biggest divorce lawsuit ever.

588
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,524
I want Park and Kim Tae-ul,

589
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:26,320
the law firm owned by Kim Myung-cheol,
the former Supreme Court Justice.

590
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,822
Make a joint request
to the biggest law firm in the country.

591
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,199
Yes, Mr. Han.

592
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,049
It's only right

593
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:50,135
that Yoon-gyeom loses everything
and suffers.

594
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,431
Just as how you've healed me,

595
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,476
I want to try to heal you too.

596
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:00,646
Is it good?

597
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,981
-Should I eat too?
-It tastes great.

598
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,566
It's good.

599
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,486
You should be happy, La-el.

600
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,489
Who do you think you're feeling bad for?

601
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:44,064
A cosmos?

602
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,743
I knew you'd spot the cosmos first.

603
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,709
It's not even spring yet.

604
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,795
Where did you get it?

605
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,591
If I must, I will travel
to the other side of the planet

606
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:13,301
to get it before autumn comes.

607
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,888
Cosmos flowers somehow remind me of you.

608
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,684
These are cosmos flowers
that look just like you, La-el.

609
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:25,981
I wish it could be my birthday every day.

610
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:29,151
-Is that possible?
-Of course it is.

611
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,902
I'll do anything for you.

612
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:34,072
Then the cosmos flowers
are the problem, Dad.

613
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:36,950
You give them to me on my birthdays,
but they only bloom in autumn.

614
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,077
Then…

615
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,748
I'll go to the other side of the planet
to get some before autumn comes.

616
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,126
Cosmos flowers

617
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,671
are the first ones that God created
to illuminate the world.

618
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:52,883
So your world will be full of light

619
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,468
all year round.

620
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,972
I love you, Mom and Dad.

621
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:02,225
I know you're carrying a wound with you.

622
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,270
One that's so hard to bear

623
00:51:06,855 --> 00:51:08,190
that you must hurt yourself even more.

624
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,359
I know that it's not easy
to talk about it.

625
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,611
But that's okay.

626
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,988
You just follow your heart.

627
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:18,450
I'll find more cosmos flowers
before winter falls.

628
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:24,539
Then you'll make them bloom someday.

629
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,222
I have something else for you.

630
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:10,330
Maybe you'll understand after you've lost
your husband, wealth and power,

631
00:54:10,997 --> 00:54:12,916
and your mind and body
begin to deteriorate

632
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:15,251
with nothing left at all.

633
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:46,783
THE BLUE HOUSE

634
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,785
He's my husband.

635
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,288
I'm not letting her take him.

636
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:11,349
Our meeting felt like destiny.

637
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,228
I fell in love with you
because I saw myself in you,

638
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,898
and I could show myself to you…

639
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,193
because you understood me.

640
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,116
I can't live without you anymore.

641
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:33,705
I love you.

642
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,340
I, Kang Yoon-gyeom, swear

643
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,428
that I'll only love you
for the rest of my life.

644
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,182
If there is a single lie in my words,

645
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,268
then I won't be afraid

646
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,229
to die.

647
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,527
Can you, Kim Sun-bin,
swear in the name of God

648
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,198
that you love this man…

649
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,827
standing in front of you?

650
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,461
But Dad.

651
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:26,049
What if I can't make a decision?

652
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,928
What if I can't decide
between two things or a lot of things?

653
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:33,765
Then which path should I follow?

654
00:56:35,934 --> 00:56:37,143
In that case,

655
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,232
just follow the most sincere path.

656
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:50,490
Do you love me?

657
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,131
Yes.

658
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:26,359
Do you swear that you'll live
the rest of your life with me…

659
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:30,822
until we are parted by death?

660
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:36,619
You see, there's a poison
growing in your heart.

661
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,956
A poison that could be fatal

662
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,041
called love.

663
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:43,501
One day, your love

664
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:46,421
could burn down everything
that you've built up so far.

665
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,923
If you really do love Mr. Kang,

666
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,259
then you'll end up in unimaginable pain.

667
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:54,179
It's cliché to talk about love
ruining everything and killing somebody.

668
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,014
Love makes us weak.

669
00:57:56,097 --> 00:57:57,724
You don't have to be scared of me

670
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:59,142
having some love in my heart.

671
00:57:59,642 --> 00:58:01,186
Love is such a worthless emotion.

672
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:04,606
I can't live without you anymore.

673
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:05,523
I love you.

674
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:06,816
I love you.

675
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,359
Yoon-gyeom has already given me his heart.

676
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,695
That means I can completely destroy him.

677
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,656
Can you swear in the name of God
that you love this man

678
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,616
standing in front of you?

679
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,825
Love makes us weak.

680
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,619
Then you'll end up in unimaginable pain.

681
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,412
Love is such a worthless emotion.

682
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:22,665
Just follow the most sincere path.

683
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:33,718
Sun-bin.

684
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:37,555
Sun-bin.

685
00:58:39,432 --> 00:58:41,226
-Just like how Adam and Eve
-Sun-bin.

686
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:44,312
committed the original sin
by disobeying God's plans,

687
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:49,651
I've given birth to a terrible sin
by meeting you.

688
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:14,801
The sin

689
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,720
of killing the man I love
with my own hands.

690
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,792
She loves him, but she can't admit it,

691
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,669
and has to drag him down to hell.

692
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,296
She must feel horrible.

693
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,172
This is an all-out war for me.

694
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:54,215
Take her outside.

695
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,759
Let go of me!
How dare you tell me to leave?

696
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,970
I'm not going to hide
and let the world think

697
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,805
that I'm your mistress.

698
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,141
Did you approach me on purpose?

699
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,809
You don't know who she is, do you?

700
01:00:04,892 --> 01:00:06,519
Let me tell you.

701
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,564
Don't make me look for
the answer to this on my own.

702
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:10,898
What are you doing?

703
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:14,277
You're screwed now, Lee La-el.
