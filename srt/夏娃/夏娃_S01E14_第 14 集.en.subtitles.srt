1
00:00:30,905 --> 00:00:33,074
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,827
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,041
You must've thought I was pathetic…

4
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:46,546
when I fell for your seductions.

5
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,091
You were probably ecstatic

6
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,427
that your plan was working.

7
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,808
I loved you.

8
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,273
It was the first time in my life…

9
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,904
that I ever opened my heart to somebody.

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,907
But this is what I get.

11
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:18,411
What was I doing?

12
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,755
Is Seo Eun-pyeong on your side too?

13
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,341
He's working with you, isn't he?

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,760
He doesn't know about this place.

15
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,303
Don't try to blame him for this.

16
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,435
This was Sun-bin
when she started high school.

17
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:45,146
But she had a different name.

18
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,314
"Lee…

19
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,775
La-el."

20
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,573
Why didn't you run away

21
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,034
when you knew you'd be exposed?

22
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,710
It was because of
the GEDIKS contract, wasn't it?

23
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,214
-Where is that contract?
-I don't have it.

24
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,091
You can't hand that over. Give it back.

25
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:14,843
Get away from me!

26
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,856
You're okay, right?

27
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,155
Mr. Kang is at my studio.

28
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:00,657
Come and get him.

29
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,017
You think you can make me
get the maximum sentence?

30
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,853
Well, that's hilarious.

31
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,481
How would you do it
when even the president can't?

32
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,650
I'll make sure you get the death sentence.

33
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,070
Tell us who planted the bugs here.

34
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:40,613
Hey.

35
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,200
Wow, she's really something else.

36
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,704
All of the GEDIKS associates
must have got some serious guts.

37
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,746
She's pissing me off.

38
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,374
Go upstairs and get some rest, Mr. Han.

39
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:53,042
I'll find out who planted the bugs

40
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,503
and make them give up on the lawsuit.

41
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,462
All right.

42
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,172
-Don’t mess up.
-Yes, sir.

43
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,388
Listen, Jang Moon-hee.

44
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:09,684
Just forget about the lawsuit.

45
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,312
Write a confession
saying it was just a conspiracy

46
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,773
and beg for forgiveness.

47
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,744
DR. JUNG

48
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,787
Mr. Han has left, ma'am.

49
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,123
Jang Moon-hee will be alone soon.

50
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:36,961
Wake up, Jang Moon-hee.

51
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,134
Nobody has left this place alive.

52
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,261
You need to get out of here.

53
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,139
You can do whatever you want.

54
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,683
I just want my husband back.

55
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,409
What's so funny?

56
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,453
Have you lost your mind?

57
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,539
Looking at you up close…

58
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:22,340
I see you've already
gotten your punishment.

59
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,929
La-el may have lied,
but she's sincere at heart.

60
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,890
Your husband

61
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:33,810
will never come back to a woman like you.

62
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,522
You

63
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,649
and your father both!

64
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,904
Neither of you know
what it means to be sincere.

65
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,368
You will all keep betraying each other

66
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,748
and die a lonely death.

67
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,875
That's your punishment!

68
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,128
You crazy bitch!

69
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,089
Drag her out of here!

70
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,943
Mr. Han, I thought you wanted
to take a break.

71
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,278
The hearing is coming up.

72
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:27,363
I need to make her give up on the lawsuit.

73
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:28,781
Oh jeez.

74
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,202
What is this?

75
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:35,955
What are you guys doing with her?

76
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:42,336
-Dad…
-So-ra, why are you taking her?

77
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,589
That bitch knows that we have her.

78
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,466
-If Yoon-gyeom finds out--
-Put her down.

79
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,062
You have a death wish, don't you?

80
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,481
Dad.

81
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,857
I'm not getting a divorce.

82
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,275
Divorce isn't what matters!

83
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,904
If she files her lawsuit,

84
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,156
I'll be in jail until the day I die!

85
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,917
Where the hell do you think you're going?

86
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,377
-That little…
-How dare you try to run away?

87
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,087
Have you gone crazy?

88
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,423
Where do you think you're going?

89
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,341
Huh?

90
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,263
Damn you!

91
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,450
Damn it!

92
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:07,857
It's me, Seo Eun-pyeong.

93
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,192
I'm here with the police. Open the gate.

94
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,457
Chief Secretary Seo
is here with the police.

95
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,374
Damn it.

96
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,965
Wipe up the blood
and hide the body in the basement.

97
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,508
The two of you go together.

98
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,678
Wipe your hands and don't act suspicious.

99
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,596
Yes, sir.

100
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,266
Hurry, goddamn it.

101
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,208
What brings you here
at this hour, Mr. Seo?

102
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,834
And why are you with the police?

103
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:10,753
I must say, this is all quite startling.

104
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,964
Ms. Jang Moon-hee
has been reported missing.

105
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:14,882
What?

106
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,428
Hello, Mr. Seo.

107
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,182
What's going on?

108
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,767
Where is Ms. Jang Moon-hee?

109
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,768
Jang Moon-hee?

110
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,728
Who's that?

111
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:31,023
You mean the person from the
LY Victims Group who filed the lawsuit?

112
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,651
Why are you looking for her here?

113
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,950
-Start searching.
-Yes, sir.

114
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,576
Mr. Seo!

115
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,205
What do you think you're doing
without a warrant?

116
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,581
You're trespassing on my property.

117
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:50,543
Well, I'm here because
I don't need to worry about that.

118
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,045
Please cooperate.

119
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,840
-Start searching, please.
-Yes, sir.

120
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,133
Look inside the house too.

121
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:13,858
Check over there.

122
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,368
Ms. Jang!

123
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,413
-Ms. Jang!
-Ms. Jang!

124
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,081
Ms. Jang!

125
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,305
There's nobody here.

126
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,516
Let's look again.

127
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,566
MS. HAN

128
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,043
We didn’t find anybody, sir.

129
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,004
Mr. Seo.

130
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,633
Do you understand the gravity
of what you've done?

131
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,136
It's not too late to apologize
to Prime Minister Han.

132
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,888
Stay out of this, Jeong-chul.

133
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:33,354
I'll say this very clearly.

134
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,524
Let Ms. Jang out.

135
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:45,866
Let's go.

136
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,373
I'll be going now, then.

137
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,653
We searched everywhere in Pan-ro's house,

138
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:24,780
but there wasn't a trace of her.

139
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:31,787
Oh, Ms. Jang.

140
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,833
The police are looking for her,
so let's just wait.

141
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:42,756
Did something happen?

142
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,176
Mr. Kang

143
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,846
found me at my studio.

144
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,431
He saw everything.

145
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,725
Did he try to hurt you?

146
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,270
I've hurt him too.

147
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,315
Just let him be.

148
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,363
I hope we've finally seen
each other at our worst.

149
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,202
Then it can't get any worse from here.

150
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,458
Dad.

151
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,419
I'm sorry, Dad. Please forgive me.

152
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:24,715
If you had let Jang Moon-hee go,
Seo Eun-pyeong would have seen her.

153
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,675
What would have happened to me then?

154
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,678
You ungrateful brat.
After all that I've done for you!

155
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,600
You don't deserve to live,
just like your mother.

156
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,518
I'll end your life now!

157
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:39,939
Mr. Han.

158
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,484
We've taken care of the body.

159
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,113
You've lost your mind over a man.

160
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,908
Lock her up in Jang Moon-hee's place.

161
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,165
Dad.

162
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,418
Dad.

163
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,295
Do as I said!

164
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:14,807
Dad!

165
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,531
Find her at all costs.

166
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,408
If you can't find Lee La-el,

167
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,911
find Jang Moon-hee or Seo Eun-pyeong.

168
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,373
They'll give leads to find Lee La-el.

169
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:40,958
Yes, sir.

170
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,712
Where could be a good spot?

171
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:50,509
What's that?

172
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,641
What is this thing?

173
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:29,840
Hello?

174
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,091
This is the police.

175
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,719
Is Ms. Jang Moon-hee your mother?

176
00:17:34,428 --> 00:17:35,262
Yes.

177
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,599
I'm sorry, but I have
some unfortunate news.

178
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,627
Her hand is so cold.

179
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,418
These are Ms. Jang's personal belongings.

180
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,052
BELONGINGS OF THE DECEASED
JANG MOON-HEE

181
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,313
It's a voice recorder for emergencies.

182
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,283
You think you can make me
get the maximum sentence?

183
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,077
I'll make sure you get the death sentence.

184
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,495
Listen, Jang Moon-hee.

185
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:49,873
Just forget about the lawsuit.

186
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,083
Listen to me, Jang Moon-hee.

187
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,252
Nobody has left this place alive.

188
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,419
You crazy bitch!

189
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,922
Damn it!

190
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,043
Man, she's dead.

191
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,130
What should we do with her body?
Should we leave it here?

192
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,424
No, Seo Eun-pyeong might come back.

193
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,592
We can't leave it here. Throw it out.

194
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,760
Throw it out where?

195
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,763
Do what you did
when you took care of that GEDIKS woman.

196
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,184
Mom?

197
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,602
Ms. Kim.

198
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:56,189
Mom…

199
00:21:59,067 --> 00:21:59,901
Hello?

200
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,238
Is anybody there?

201
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,116
Please help me.

202
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,286
La-el…

203
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,668
It was So-ra, that brat,

204
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,588
who dragged that woman here
and starved her to death.

205
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,175
Look, you kidnapped Jang Moon-hee

206
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,635
and starved Kim Jin-sook to death.

207
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,971
You killed them both, you little brat.

208
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,601
Mom…

209
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,879
Damn it.

210
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:21,191
Kim Jin-sook's body was never found
thanks to the typhoon.

211
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,026
Do you think we'll be safe this time?

212
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:26,488
Find that truck driver from before.

213
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:28,907
Quick!

214
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,706
Goodbye, Jang Moon-hee.

215
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:38,667
You've dug your own grave.

216
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,675
Good work.

217
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,176
Thank you, sir.

218
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,708
But they threw her out.

219
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,173
Do-wan.

220
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,133
Do-wan!

221
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,094
Do-wan!

222
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:32,512
Do-wan!

223
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,813
Go away!

224
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,190
Get away from me!

225
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,246
So-ra.

226
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:16,932
You'll never leave this place.

227
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,269
Nobody has left this place alive, no?

228
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,439
So die.

229
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:26,316
Then I'll…

230
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,571
follow you to hell.

231
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,589
Mrs. Han!

232
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,968
Are you all right, ma'am?

233
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:53,885
Do-wan.

234
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:56,221
Please let me out.

235
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,392
I'll die if I stay in here, Do-wan.

236
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,019
Please.

237
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,980
Prime Minister Han will kill me.

238
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,400
I need an ambulance.

239
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:10,986
Call me an ambulance.

240
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,393
Sir.

241
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,186
Ms. Jang has passed away.

242
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,987
Ma'am, you can come out.

243
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:06,333
Hurry!

244
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,558
A suicide?

245
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:25,101
Why would Ms. Jang kill herself?

246
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,146
It doesn't make sense.
She just started the lawsuit.

247
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:29,481
Who would believe that?

248
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:34,819
It's suspicious that the police
rushed to conclude her case as a suicide.

249
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,738
They're all working together.

250
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,745
Out of the way.

251
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,724
JANG MOON-HEE

252
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,823
I don't know what to say.

253
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,701
This is all so sudden.

254
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,912
Ms. Jang told me

255
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,875
how my mother, Kim Jin-sook, died

256
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,128
before she passed away.

257
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,757
Ms. Jang

258
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:22,302
always had a voice recorder on her.

259
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,765
I bet you all had no idea.

260
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,266
"You all"?

261
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,560
Who do you mean by that?

262
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:31,811
Han So-ra,

263
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,146
Han Pan-ro,

264
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:35,940
Kim Jeong-chul,

265
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:38,735
and Kang Yoon-gyeom.

266
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,501
Do what you did
when you took care of that GEDIKS woman.

267
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,838
Kim Jin-sook's body was never found
thanks to the typhoon.

268
00:29:58,922 --> 00:30:00,381
Do you think we'll be safe this time?

269
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,675
Find that truck driver from before.

270
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:19,943
I really didn't know, I swear.

271
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,287
I was always occupied with my worries.

272
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,624
So I would wonder how Ms. Jang

273
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,626
could stay so strong.

274
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,550
If I don't end this,
it'll just repeat itself.

275
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,261
It's not that I wanted to do it.

276
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:49,806
I had no choice because I had to do it.

277
00:30:57,397 --> 00:30:58,314
Go.

278
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:00,733
Go and wait for your punishment.

279
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,743
Hello.

280
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,301
I was just going to ask for
the money I was promised,

281
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,345
but I need some more.

282
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:15,642
Ms. Han So-ra ordered me to do that.

283
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,646
I had no idea she was
married into such a big company.

284
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,815
Just think of it
as giving me the money I deserve.

285
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:23,900
That's all I ask.

286
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,863
Honey.

287
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,913
Have you lost your mind?

288
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,416
How could you do something like this?

289
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,252
-What do you mean?
-Who is she?

290
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:52,720
She was a stalker

291
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,099
who threatened to ruin our marriage
with an insignificant matter.

292
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,266
She was a total nutjob,

293
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,268
so I just locked her up until our wedding.

294
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:01,646
But she died because of an illness.

295
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,148
I was shocked too.

296
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,194
-It wasn't me, honey.
-Let go of me.

297
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,029
Seriously, it was just an accident.

298
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,197
Let go!

299
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,370
Honey.

300
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,872
Can't you just pretend it never happened?

301
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,333
It was just an accident, I swear.

302
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,894
You really have no shame.

303
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,525
I was not involved…

304
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,155
-in Ms. Jang's death.
-No.

305
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,576
All of you are responsible.

306
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:58,995
There's only one thing you can do now.

307
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,705
Confess your crimes,

308
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,000
and pay the price.

309
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,595
Go get some rest.

310
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,541
What are you doing here, Secretary Kim?

311
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:48,294
I think your dad's here.

312
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:55,301
Da-bi, just do what I told you to do.

313
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,345
-Okay?
-Okay.

314
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:58,846
Let's go.

315
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,312
Honey.

316
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,484
I hadn't seen Da-bi in so long.

317
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,820
I forgot to call you
while spending time with her.

318
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,322
Get out.

319
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,909
-Honey.
-I said, get out.

320
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:25,581
Da-bi, want to go play in your room?

321
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,345
Darling.

322
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,891
Honey!

323
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,404
Honey.

324
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,781
I won't do anything.

325
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,908
Just let me stay here.

326
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,451
Didn't you hear me? Get out.

327
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,328
Please, honey.

328
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,880
The woman who died 13 years ago.

329
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,799
The one who supposedly
threatened our marriage.

330
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,759
Was she La-el's mother?

331
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:23,890
The wife of GEDIKS's CEO?

332
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,309
Was she?

333
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,437
She died because of an illness.

334
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,231
If anything, leaving her alone
was all I did wrong.

335
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,608
Don't lie to me!

336
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:35,943
You killed Ms. Jang too.

337
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,408
I don't want to see you ever again.

338
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:44,785
Stay away from me forever.

339
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,996
-This is a warning.
-Honey.

340
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,376
Please help me.

341
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,005
If you kick me out, my dad will kill me.

342
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:57,882
Honey, please.

343
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,809
You're not the only one
who doesn't like my dad.

344
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,646
I don't want to be under his thumb either.

345
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,900
I'm not asking for a reconciliation.

346
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:17,652
Just let me hide here.

347
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:20,238
Please, at least for Da-bi's sake.

348
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,283
Let me just stay and take care of Da-bi.

349
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,036
Please, honey.

350
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,626
Please…

351
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,258
Ms. Jang was the one
who had prepared everything.

352
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,469
Do you think we can sue them without her?

353
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,348
The hearing is right around the corner.

354
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,811
And honestly, I'm not sure what to do.

355
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:53,980
Since the plaintiff has died,

356
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,899
the law firm can't appear
in her place either.

357
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,863
These are the questions
for the live broadcast news.

358
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,367
You just need to glance over it
since we have control over how it goes.

359
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:09,412
INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
FOR CHIEF SECRETARY SEO EUN-PYEONG

360
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,871
No, this is useless.

361
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,750
It won't go the way we planned.

362
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,383
[URGENT] INFORMATION ON
THE LY VICTIMS GROUP LAWSUIT

363
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,427
[URGENT] INFORMATION ON
THE LY VICTIMS GROUP LAWSUIT

364
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:35,396
This is Lee La-el,
the daughter of Lee Tae-joon,

365
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,689
former CEO of GEDIKS.

366
00:38:36,772 --> 00:38:41,027
I would like to represent
the LY Victims Group's class suit.

367
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,530
The first hearing of the lawsuit
is tomorrow,

368
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,825
and I will personally come forward.

369
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,204
In order to share our pain with the world,

370
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,457
I will agree to interview requests

371
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:59,045
as well as make the hearing public.

372
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,301
YOUR EMAIL HAS BEEN SENT

373
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,430
Hey, Bo-ram. I'm back in Korea.

374
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,307
I'll visit you after I go see your mom.

375
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:13,392
I'll see you at your aunt's house, okay?

376
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:27,490
Where the hell has So-ra gone?

377
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,158
I told you to watch her!

378
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:32,328
She suddenly got sick,
so I didn't have the chance to tell you.

379
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,873
Sir.

380
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:39,168
Mrs. Han swore that she would
live quietly at the vacation house.

381
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,711
-Damn it.
-Mr. Han!

382
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,799
There's bad news.

383
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,342
So-ra is the least
of our concerns right now.

384
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:47,802
Lee La-el has stepped forward.

385
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,178
Who's Lee La-el?

386
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,389
The daughter of GEDIKS's Lee Tae-joon.

387
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:57,603
She's announced to the entire country
that she's going to get us.

388
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:13,994
There she is.

389
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,329
She's here.

390
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,084
Come on, go and stop them!

391
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,353
How did you get the materials
for the lawsuit?

392
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,730
You worked at the
Future Strategic Planning Office.

393
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:44,400
So are you a whistleblower,
or did you join the company on purpose?

394
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,744
Goddamn it.

395
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,754
Why are you making the hearing public?

396
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,174
Wait.

397
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,176
What's going on here?

398
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,763
That's Lee La-el?

399
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,977
The daughter of GEDIKS's Lee Tae-joon?

400
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,563
Who the hell do you think you are?

401
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:25,816
Damn, you little brat.

402
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,234
You've got some spirit in you,
haven't you?

403
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,111
So what are you going to do now?

404
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,071
What are you going to do?

405
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:31,989
Hey.

406
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,825
If your dad doesn't sign it,

407
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,328
he's going to die.

408
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:02,413
At this rate, your relationship with her
will also be revealed.

409
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,541
We can't let her
participate in the lawsuit.

410
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:17,136
DAUGHTER OF DECEASED CEO
REPRESENTS LY VICTIMS GROUP LAWSUIT

411
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,722
She's out of her mind.

412
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,515
She's a monster.

413
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:31,900
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT COURT

414
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:33,652
Thank you for all of your hard work.

415
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,029
Thank you, ma'am.

416
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:36,530
Thank you so much.

417
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,325
Now that I have my identity back,

418
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,493
I can finally retrieve
my mother's personal belongings.

419
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,747
I was told the nursing home
has her journals and videos.

420
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:46,582
So let's be patient.

421
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:49,418
Please let us know if you need anything.
We'll help.

422
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,255
-I'll see you all at the law firm.
-All right.

423
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:57,801
Let's go.

424
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:04,433
I'm looking right now, Mr. Han.

425
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,392
Well…

426
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,310
Okay.

427
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,116
Yes.

428
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,868
I mean, okay.

429
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,246
I'll try talking with her
when she comes outside.

430
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,456
All right.

431
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,046
Just a moment, Mr. Han.

432
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,053
Goddammit.

433
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,236
Hey.

434
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:40,154
You idiot.

435
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,281
It's not that hard.

436
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,661
Just sign it, you idiot!

437
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,414
Dad!

438
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,166
Please don't do this!

439
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,469
LY VICTIMS GROUP

440
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,888
Call me, Kim Jeong-chul.

441
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,017
Let's take this somewhere more private.

442
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,311
You bitch!

443
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,273
Honey.

444
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,198
Don't call me by that disgusting pet name.

445
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,158
I'm Lee La-el.

446
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,162
You need to pay
for handing GEDIKS over too.

447
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:34,124
I'm only taking legal action
because of Bo-ram.

448
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,751
Take your kid and get lost.

449
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:38,045
But…

450
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:39,671
Darling.

451
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,090
Mr. Jang. Please help me.

452
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,842
Call an ambulance, Mr. Jang.

453
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,261
Mr. Jang.

454
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:00,567
There was a lot of controversy
surrounding your absence

455
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,277
at the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

456
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,488
I heard you have something
to say about this, sir.

457
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,405
In fact,

458
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:08,116
there was an illegal act
of violence against me.

459
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,535
I was assaulted

460
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,079
in the middle of the night
before the Foreign Ministers' Meeting.

461
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,208
You, the chief secretary, got assaulted?

462
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,293
Who on earth did something like that?

463
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,545
Was it a political party?

464
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,674
He's somebody who used to be
the prime minister of this country.

465
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:26,969
His corrupt acts stem from his daughter
marrying the best businessman in Korea.

466
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:30,847
Assault, murder, illegal M&As,
and politically corrupt businesses,

467
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:31,974
only to name a few.

468
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:35,602
I'm going to make sure
that they all get punished.

469
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,439
You're making it quite obvious

470
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:43,110
who you're talking about,
Chief Secretary Seo.

471
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,027
That's right.

472
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:45,779
I'm putting out a wanted notice

473
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:47,823
to specific individuals.

474
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:49,866
There are four people in total.

475
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,034
However,

476
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,912
I'll make an exception
for just one of them.

477
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:57,040
To the first criminal
who conscientiously reports their crimes,

478
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,169
I swear in my name
that I'll get you pardoned.

479
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,213
That bastard.

480
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:05,841
Damn them all.

481
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,223
Excuse me,

482
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,641
Prime Minister Han.

483
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:16,143
What now?

484
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:21,315
All three law firms are giving up
on the divorce lawsuit, sir.

485
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:25,819
They can't handle both the
LY Victims Group and the chief secretary.

486
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:47,299
-He still hasn't come out?
-He's not even drinking anything, ma'am.

487
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,097
Give it to me. I'll bring it in.

488
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:07,235
Honey.

489
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,446
Could you open the door?

490
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:11,782
Honey.

491
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,452
Darling.

492
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,749
Come on, open the door.

493
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:22,918
You should eat…

494
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,088
Where are you going so late?

495
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:28,507
Honey.

496
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:42,229
UNSEO

497
00:49:47,734 --> 00:49:51,029
DEATH OF PARK SEON-A, EMPLOYEE OF LY

498
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,156
DEATH OF KIM JIN-SOOK, EMPLOYEE OF GEDIKS

499
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,537
UNSEO LAW FIRM

500
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:24,062
I'll pay you
a fair opportunity cost for GEDIKS.

501
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:28,233
So let's end this horrible battle.

502
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,318
Why?

503
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,031
This is too painful for me.

504
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,665
What's so painful?

505
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,960
My love for you is nothing but a joke now,

506
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:49,713
and I need to attack you to survive.

507
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:52,591
It's all too painful to bear.

508
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,946
I'm so sorry.

509
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:18,241
Let's end this, please.

510
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:51,733
What's so special
about being on your knees?

511
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:53,527
Watch me.

512
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,487
I'm doing the same.

513
00:51:56,488 --> 00:51:58,031
That makes us equal,

514
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:00,742
so it's meaningless now, no?

515
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:05,372
An apology never asked by the victim
is no proper apology.

516
00:52:06,706 --> 00:52:09,668
The perpetrator should follow
what the victim wants.

517
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,589
What do you want from me?

518
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:18,927
Die.

519
00:52:21,221 --> 00:52:22,430
Just like how my parents

520
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,225
and Ms. Jang passed away.

521
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,854
You, Han So-ra, Han Pan-ro,
and Kim Jeong-chul

522
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,439
must all die to make it fair.

523
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,649
All four of you.

524
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,361
If any one of them fights back,
kill them all with your own hands

525
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:39,072
and kill yourself at the end of it all.

526
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,244
Then this will be over.

527
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,839
That's all I want from you.

528
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,257
La-el.

529
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:41,676
Are you okay?

530
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:13,833
Look, you kidnapped Jang Moon-hee

531
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:15,877
and starved Kim Jin-sook to death.

532
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,712
You killed them both, you little brat.

533
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,298
So-ra.

534
00:54:29,224 --> 00:54:30,308
La-el.

535
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:31,768
She killed my mother.

536
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,897
She sent Yoon-gyeom to convince me,
all the while waiting down there.

537
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,191
And it wasn't even a proper apology.

538
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,193
I'm going to kill her.

539
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:41,820
I'm going to kill them all!

540
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,198
La-el.

541
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,920
What are you doing here?

542
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,672
I could ask you the same thing.

543
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,435
You shouldn't be begging
that woman for anything.

544
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,610
Come on, get to your senses!

545
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:27,115
You made LY
the best company in the entire world.

546
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:29,367
An obstacle like this is nothing for you!

547
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,957
We can come out victorious
if we work together.

548
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,257
Why did you do it?

549
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:50,055
Why did you do it, So-ra?

550
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,310
You already had the power and money.

551
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,229
You had it all.

552
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,442
If I hadn't had GEDIKS,

553
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,324
then you would never have married me.

554
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,871
I did it because I loved you, honey.

555
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,331
Even now,

556
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,876
you're the only person I love.

557
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:20,794
Honey.

558
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,089
That's not love.

559
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:30,470
Please let me go now.

560
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,809
That's all I want from you.

561
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,314
You wanted to have GEDIKS, didn't you?

562
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,233
You were craving it.

563
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:45,276
That's why my dad and I
got blood on our hands.

564
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,279
We did it for you,
so why are you acting ignorant now?

565
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:52,742
You're the one who benefited
the most from it, not us!

566
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,869
No matter how much you want her,

567
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,497
you will always be La-el's sworn enemy.

568
00:56:58,164 --> 00:56:59,207
Die.

569
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,000
You, Han So-ra, Han Pan-ro,
and Kim Jeong-chul

570
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,169
must all die to make it fair.

571
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,379
All four of you.

572
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:07,966
If any one of them fights back,
kill them all with your own hands

573
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,093
and kill yourself at the end of it all.

574
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:11,845
Then this will be over.

575
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,889
You and I are the ones
who share the same destiny.

576
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,308
Are you listening to me?

577
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:18,518
Are you listening?

578
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,602
Honey!

579
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,484
I said, are you listening?

580
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,740
If you just let her be,
you'll be attacked instead.

581
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,869
Our destiny is to work together
and bring her down.

582
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,290
I just had…

583
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,502
one wish.

584
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,634
I just wanted her
to have fond memories of me,

585
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,681
even if…

586
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:03,688
our love didn't work out.

587
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,115
Don’t listen to him, La-el.

588
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:57,784
Don't let him sway you.

589
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,054
We wanted to love each other,

590
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,641
but true love was never an option for us.

591
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,519
That is our tragic ending.

592
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:55,383
Was your love for me ever sincere?

593
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:59,095
It looks like So-ra will be blamed
for all the murders too.

594
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,598
So-ra made a report to the police?

595
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:03,808
Move!

596
01:00:04,684 --> 01:00:06,144
If I really must die…

597
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,021
I want you to die for what you've done!

598
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,105
…I will.

599
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:12,400
Chairman Kang has given all of his rights
and shares to you, Ms. Lee.

600
01:00:12,483 --> 01:00:13,484
You can't reach Mr. Kang?

601
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:14,652
Where's Yoon-gyeom?

602
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,364
I really need him right now.
