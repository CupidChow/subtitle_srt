1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:37,579
Secretary Kim!

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:41,916
Did Yoon-gyeom call?

5
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:45,587
Still no call?

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,591
It's five in the morning right now.

7
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,969
He's sleeping somewhere else.

8
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,472
He didn't come home all night?

9
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,932
What the hell is this?

10
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:03,855
Come on, say something.
Gosh, this is frustrating!

11
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,649
I'm sure something urgent came up.

12
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,902
He'll probably explain everything
once he comes back.

13
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,111
You think I'm wrong?

14
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,405
Then why is his phone turned off?

15
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,449
And why did he leave his car here?

16
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,707
I want to see Secretary Cha.

17
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,860
Love is a feeling you can't hide.

18
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,198
You don't plan it out at all,

19
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,826
and it makes your head spin.

20
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,288
It paralyzes any sense of logic
with an incredible destructiveness.

21
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,375
The ecstasy caused by love

22
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,712
can numb your senses to an extent

23
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,591
where you won't even feel
the pain of death.

24
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,511
It's incredibly dangerous.

25
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:35,780
Mr. Kang.

26
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:43,329
I didn't want to wake you up,
but you should go back home.

27
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,090
Did I really sleep all night?

28
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,886
It's been so long.

29
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:02,223
I usually can't sleep for very long.

30
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,812
It's not like I asked you
to bring me the moon.

31
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,564
It's really not that difficult.

32
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,524
How on earth can you not know
where he went?

33
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,525
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,861
You think that solves anything?

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,030
Answer me.

36
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,289
Keep this with you.
It's just for the two of us.

37
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,922
Can I call you too?

38
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,465
Yes. I'll always be waiting.

39
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,628
It's too extravagant.

40
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,256
I don't know if I can wear this.

41
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,552
No jewel is beautiful enough…

42
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:25,556
to be compared to you.

43
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,396
Chairman Kang is coming.

44
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,776
Hide.

45
00:04:57,297 --> 00:05:00,466
What do you think you're doing?
Have you kept them up all night?

46
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,176
What else was I supposed to do?

47
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:04,137
You didn't come home.

48
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,349
You can all go home.

49
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,184
-Honey.
-Go home!

50
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,402
How many times have I told you?

51
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,696
Our employees are not slaves.

52
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,364
Yet you're always harassing them.

53
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,491
When will you stop?

54
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,952
Who cares about them?

55
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:30,079
What were you doing with your phone off?

56
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,165
Where were you?

57
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,751
On my birthday too.

58
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,836
Tell me everything

59
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,963
before I do something crazy.

60
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,467
I was thinking of an explanation
on my way back.

61
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,804
But now that I'm here,
I don't even want to say it anymore.

62
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,350
You make me sick.

63
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:55,730
What are you saying?

64
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,107
Are you on drugs?

65
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,693
Are you out of your mind?

66
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,279
I'm amazed
that I've held it in for so long,

67
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,491
when I despise you this much.

68
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,621
How are you planning on
apologizing for that?

69
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,249
I can't just let this go.

70
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:17,668
You spent the night out on my birthday,

71
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,587
and you're talking to me like I'm trash.

72
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,883
I'm not going to put up with this.

73
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,052
As if you put up with anything
in your life.

74
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,639
Secretary Cha.

75
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,518
I saw your car parked outside.
Come out here!

76
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,360
I called him
because I was worried about you.

77
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,655
Am I not allowed to ask
your secretary about you

78
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,156
when you weren't coming home?

79
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,951
So you put the tracking device in my car
because you were worried?

80
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,330
What tracking device?
I don't know what you're talking about.

81
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,498
Secretary Cha.

82
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,918
Who told you
to install the tracker in my car?

83
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,974
There's only one person here
who can give an order like that.

84
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,810
Please forgive me, sir.

85
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,811
Get out.

86
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,618
Is that really so important right now?

87
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:36,330
I did it because I love you.

88
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,748
Then what else is important?

89
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:39,500
Your birthday?

90
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,336
Of course my birthday is important.

91
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,047
But also are my feelings…

92
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,718
and the things that I want.

93
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,014
You should prioritize me
over everything else, no matter what.

94
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,226
You want me to act like
one of your employees, don't you?

95
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,147
Are you changing the subject
because you spent the night out?

96
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:05,151
Tell me where you were
and what you were doing first.

97
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,528
I just…

98
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,408
needed a place to rest.

99
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,787
You could've rested here.

100
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,665
At our house!

101
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,503
You mean, your house?

102
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,969
I’m not done talking yet.

103
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,513
Where are you going?

104
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,606
Why are you coming to the guest bedroom?

105
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,318
I don't want to sleep
in the same bed as you.

106
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,403
Let's use separate rooms.

107
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:52,823
No, we can't.

108
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:54,450
I'll never allow that.

109
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,744
I’m so sick of you. Stop this.

110
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,622
Why are you acting like this?
I'm the one who should be angry.

111
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:00,748
Honey.

112
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,461
Now, Ms. Jang.

113
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:11,425
I installed a hacking app
on Mr. Kang's phone.

114
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,024
There we go.

115
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,696
Mom.

116
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,533
How was the wedding?

117
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:38,077
The bride was so beautiful.

118
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,914
You must be tired after the drive.
Did you eat breakfast?

119
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,249
I ate at the rest stop.

120
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,879
Hey, honey.

121
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:51,382
Babe.

122
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,926
There was a package for you at the door.

123
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,386
From Lee Tae-joon.

124
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,221
Who's GEDIKS?

125
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,932
What?

126
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,434
What is it?

127
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,560
Let's open it together.

128
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,603
No.

129
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,064
What's wrong, Dad?

130
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:08,149
Jin-wook.

131
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,945
Sorry, honey. I'm sorry, Ms. Jang.

132
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,489
I think it was misdelivered.

133
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,159
I need to go make a call, honey.

134
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:30,421
Mr. Han.

135
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:34,508
These are the prosecutors
who want to be a part of the Zeus Project.

136
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,093
Take a look.

137
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,013
Chief Prosecutor Kwon?

138
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,849
No, he was almost indicted
on a lobbying charge.

139
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,727
How about him, sir?

140
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:47,355
I like him.

141
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,149
He hasn't made blunders
and won't cause any issues.

142
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,109
Next, we have Special Prosecutor Park.

143
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,572
Didn’t he pocket a lot of money last time?

144
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,282
He'll get too greedy
if we recruit him again.

145
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,413
…A LOT OF MONEY LAST TIME?
HE'LL GET TOO GREEDY IF WE…

146
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,271
The paperwork is all ready.

147
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,272
Thank you.

148
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,821
I know the password too.

149
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:03,514
What?

150
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,766
Mr. Kang spent the night somewhere else?

151
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,685
And it was on So-ra's birthday too?

152
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,020
That’s hilarious.

153
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,606
So that's why she hasn't shown up today.

154
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,650
She's too embarrassed.

155
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:17,153
First we ghosted her,
and then her husband spent the night out.

156
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,530
She must be going crazy right now.

157
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,158
This is too good.

158
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,123
Yes, Ms. Han.

159
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:35,629
You must be feeling unwell.

160
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,884
I'll take Da-bi to your place.

161
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,445
So-ra.

162
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,909
Oh no. Da-bi.

163
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,257
So-ra.

164
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,470
What took you so long?

165
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:28,015
Da-bi had a golf correction class.

166
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,644
What's going on, So-ra?

167
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,313
Yoon-gyeom wants to use separate bedrooms.

168
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,441
And I'm not letting that happen.

169
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,236
Mom.

170
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,797
Call your dad and tell him to come home.

171
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,299
Now!

172
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,011
I'll do it.

173
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,972
I'll tell Mr. Kang.

174
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,599
It’s okay, Da-bi.

175
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,852
Let's get out of here.

176
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,274
I couldn't disobey Mrs. Han.

177
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,443
I'm sorry, sir.

178
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,155
You've done so much for me.

179
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,123
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

180
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,751
I'm going back to my hometown.

181
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,092
If…

182
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,305
I give you one last chance,

183
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,017
will you work for me
completely and without question?

184
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,944
SO-RA

185
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,716
KIM SUN-BIN

186
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,932
I missed you.

187
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:35,017
Every day feels like a year now.

188
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,395
Mr. Kang, this is Kim Sun-bin.

189
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,148
You really need to come home.

190
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,375
What on earth happened?

191
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,336
Are you hurt?

192
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,423
Mr. Kang is here.

193
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:09,510
-Da-bi, your dad is here.
-Da-bi.

194
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:10,427
Are you okay?

195
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,929
Dad.

196
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,097
Honey.

197
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,018
What the heck!

198
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:35,953
You don't plan it out at all,

199
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:38,914
and it makes your head spin.

200
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,502
It paralyzes any sense of logic
with an incredible destructiveness.

201
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,048
Love is a feeling you can't hide.

202
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,686
Are you okay, Da-bi? Are you hurt?

203
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,604
Da-bi, you go to your room!

204
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:03,897
Stay where you are. You'll get hurt.

205
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,858
What the hell are you doing?

206
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,862
Did you…

207
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,323
just yell at me?

208
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:18,704
In front of your subordinate's wife?

209
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:25,085
Don’t cry, Da-bi. It's okay.

210
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,298
Don't cry, Da-bi.

211
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,508
Ms. Han.

212
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,510
You'll hurt yourself on the shards.

213
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,180
Could you stay in your room?

214
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,556
Just to keep you safe.

215
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:54,031
Did you see him when he was yelling at me?

216
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,158
Did you see his eyes?

217
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,161
I didn't get a good look.

218
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,431
This is valerian root. You should try it.

219
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,727
It’ll help you relax.

220
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,611
This is a disaster.

221
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,657
They must've all gone insane or something.

222
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:39,785
How else could they all be
so damn disrespectful?

223
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,412
I'm going to crush them.

224
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,959
I'll get my revenge on everybody
who ruined my birthday.

225
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,505
And I want to meet with
Dam-ri and Ji-hee's partners.

226
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,093
How dare they?

227
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,460
This is an idea for the mall.

228
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,796
Try showing it to your father.

229
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,841
Just keep yourself busy with your work,

230
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,135
and everything will go back
to the way they were.

231
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:41,346
You can crush Dam-ri and Ji-hee

232
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,058
by showing them how fierce you are.

233
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,313
Do you have a plan?

234
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,568
We'll be doing
the solo performance soon, remember?

235
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,377
She's asleep now.

236
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,306
You should get some rest.

237
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,458
I did mix in some sleeping pills,

238
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,089
but what if Ms. Han wakes up?

239
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,472
Well, why did you do this to me then?

240
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,436
I hope that doesn't scar.

241
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,856
Have you been eating well?

242
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:31,224
It's good.

243
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,187
I'm not the best cook.

244
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,650
I never realized…

245
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,696
that the best things in life…

246
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,910
are hidden in the most mundane things.

247
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,400
FATE

248
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,656
I thought you only listened
to tango music.

249
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,578
That is tango music.

250
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,207
You can dance the tango to pop music too.

251
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:22,419
Do you know what it'd be called
if I danced the tango right here?

252
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:27,132
A "room tango."

253
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,162
This is why I hesitated.

254
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,582
Because I thought I might fall in love.

255
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,785
There are at least 20 points
in Han Pan-ro's voice analysis files

256
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,287
that could have a legal effect.

257
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,080
And this evidence from Mr. Kang's phone

258
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,375
shows that the M&As with GEDIKS
and other companies were illegal.

259
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,626
Good work, La-el.

260
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,128
Let's file a lawsuit…

261
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,964
with a law firm, Ms. Jang.

262
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,342
If you file a lawsuit,

263
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:18,011
you must be prepared
to reveal your identity.

264
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,971
It'll be hard to collect evidence
at that point.

265
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:22,223
That's why the lawsuit has to be
the last thing we do.

266
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:26,186
I want to see Han Pan-ro
and Kang Yoon-gyeom in the courtroom.

267
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,355
Without further ado.

268
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:32,442
So do I.

269
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,361
But the best time to file the lawsuit

270
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:37,238
is after we've obtained
Kang Yoon-gyeom's safe, as we planned.

271
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,409
That way, we can make it
a bigger social issue.

272
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,327
Still…

273
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:44,829
I want to move things faster.

274
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,503
You're uncomfortable around him,
aren't you?

275
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,886
It's not easy to sleep with your enemy.

276
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,305
I want to end this quickly.

277
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,025
I heard you come back
early in the morning.

278
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,235
Where were you?

279
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,490
That package,

280
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,243
why did you throw it away?

281
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:31,876
Didn't you work for GEDIKS
as your first job?

282
00:28:33,086 --> 00:28:34,254
Why did you lie to me?

283
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,339
And what's this?

284
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,517
What's going on here?

285
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,273
I told you, it was misdelivered.

286
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:56,359
Honey, I--

287
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,823
You said you weren't
hiding anything from me.

288
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,411
I married you because you said
you have nothing to be ashamed of.

289
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,373
Don't you dare touch me
until you tell me what this is about.

290
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,336
-Honey.
-Get out.

291
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,405
Try losing the person you love.

292
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,867
The pain will make you wish
that you were dead.

293
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,590
I didn't tell my dad
about how you've been acting.

294
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,095
The documentary take
for the Autumn Recital is next week.

295
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,014
He's coming to see my performance then.

296
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,017
You know how perceptive he is, right?

297
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,771
He'll know something's up
if you don't show up.

298
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,569
Are you threatening me?

299
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,445
I'm just giving you advice.

300
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,947
Our marriage is already flawed.

301
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,658
It's meaningless to act like it's not
when we're in public.

302
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,370
I'm trying really hard.

303
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,790
I'm not doing anything
and I'm staying quiet,

304
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,542
especially compared to before.

305
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:18,918
"Not doing anything"?

306
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,880
Are you really proud of that?

307
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,427
You're living a normal life
after doing such a terrible--

308
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,220
That was just an accident.

309
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,152
ANALYSIS OF 4 DEPARTMENT STORES

310
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,281
Negotiate with the city saying
that you'll renovate the brothel area,

311
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:52,118
and just transform that area
into an LY shopping district?

312
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:53,453
Yes.

313
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,080
You know, nobody has been
able to do anything there.

314
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,749
This is a great idea.

315
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:02,420
It's true that brothels
are a pain in the neck for the city.

316
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,297
Mr. Han.

317
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,716
What if we merge this
with the Zeus Project?

318
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,719
If you add in the shopping mall,

319
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,472
it'll be good for money laundering,
and we can expand our business.

320
00:32:12,555 --> 00:32:14,307
Isn't it the perfect plan?

321
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,726
Right, it is.

322
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,312
I want the largest shopping mall
in the country.

323
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,524
First you got us the congressman,
and now this?

324
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,110
You're on a roll nowadays, So-ra.

325
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,074
Who came up with this?

326
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:35,328
I did.

327
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,707
Come on, be honest.

328
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,377
Who was it?

329
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,924
It was a parent
from the Parent Association.

330
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:51,511
I told her I'd get her husband promoted,
so she's willing to do whatever it takes.

331
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:54,055
I'll introduce you to her
if you come to the kindergarten recital.

332
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,851
Han Pan-ro bit the shopping mall bait.

333
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:01,646
Now we can find out
how LY launders its money.

334
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,440
I'll contact the law firm.

335
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,068
Like you said, it might be better
to hurry things along.

336
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,659
You've exceeded my expectations, La-el.

337
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,955
I apologize for calling you
inexperienced the other day.

338
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,290
I'm truly sorry.

339
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:28,881
I know…

340
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,593
you've also given this your all, Ms. Jang.

341
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:38,725
A lot of our data is only available
to their closest associates.

342
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,852
If LY's legal team
finds out about the lawsuit,

343
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:44,313
you'll be the first person they suspect

344
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,108
since you approached them so suddenly.

345
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,278
I'm worried they might
get their revenge on you

346
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,656
before we can make this a social scandal.

347
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,036
From now on,
distance yourself from Kang yoon-gyeom.

348
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:01,539
Just to be safe.

349
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,752
Okay.

350
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:10,006
Please check over
all of the data thoroughly.

351
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,174
Let's wrap it up for today.

352
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:12,759
Okay.

353
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,265
What do you think of
the chief secretary's proposal, sir?

354
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,685
The spokesperson was asking me about it,
so I thought I'd ask.

355
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,480
I'm going to think over it
for a bit longer.

356
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,898
I need a few more days.

357
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,400
Will it be another "Don't Disturb Day"?

358
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,986
One of those days to think
before a major decision?

359
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,575
I know it's meaningless to ask,
but I'm curious.

360
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,912
You go off the grid on every
Don't Disturb Day.

361
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,371
What do you do?

362
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,207
Could you give us a hint?

363
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,295
It doesn't get its name for nothing.

364
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,298
It would ruin the whole purpose
if I told you about it.

365
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,300
It'd be an Open Day instead, wouldn't it?

366
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,261
-True.
-Yes.

367
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:58,763
You can all go home.

368
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,890
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

369
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,574
La-el.

370
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,702
I'd like to talk about
the work request I mentioned before.

371
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:23,162
Call me when you're free.

372
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,131
She’s here.

373
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,507
It’s Ms. Han!

374
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,800
Yay, she’s here!

375
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:37,385
You look so pretty!

376
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:41,806
What is this?

377
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,725
We felt bad we didn't get to
do anything for your birthday.

378
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,145
We're the Parent Association's
dance team, aren't we?

379
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,105
We should take care of each other.

380
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:51,399
It's not even my birthday anymore.

381
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:55,069
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

382
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,364
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

383
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,991
That's enough.

384
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,535
Secretary Kim.

385
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,252
I appreciate the thought.

386
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,172
We got you a gift too.

387
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:18,050
It's from a super luxury brand.

388
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,928
They opened a shop in Cheongdam-dong,
so we got you one.

389
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,057
-Oh dear.
-Isn’t that a dildo?

390
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:25,975
Oh my.

391
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,734
I have a membership with Meredian Hotel,

392
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,736
so I heard what happened.

393
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,865
I was sad to hear that you were all alone,
so I thought you'd appreciate the toy.

394
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,035
You know, they say when you're older,

395
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:48,581
that toy is so much better
than your own husband.

396
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,792
I hope it makes you feel better.

397
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,094
Let's cut the cake.

398
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,764
You can wait in the common room.
I'll bring it to you.

399
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,815
Did you see her face?

400
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:17,151
Did you see her?

401
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,407
Please forgive them.

402
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,201
I didn't know they'd do that.

403
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,507
They've all left, ma'am.

404
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:44,679
Open them.

405
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,436
100,000,000 WON

406
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:59,068
What is this money for, Mrs. Han?

407
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:01,070
-It's an allowance.
-Excuse me?

408
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,280
Use it however you want.

409
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,364
All of it?

410
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,786
In here…

411
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,330
is three times that money.

412
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:18,004
I want you to sleep
with Eun Dam-ri and Yeo Ji-hee.

413
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:21,924
Seduce them,

414
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,844
or use some other method.

415
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,139
Whoever who does it first
with either one of them…

416
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,225
wins this.

417
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:34,353
On one condition.

418
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,439
I want evidence.

419
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,233
Something decisive.

420
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:41,902
Go on now.

421
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,676
So-ra.

422
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:09,764
I know you hate them,
but are you sure about this?

423
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,807
It's a crime.

424
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,685
I've lived my whole life
doing whatever I want.

425
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,856
What if it becomes a problem?

426
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,649
It's never been a problem.

427
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,698
Has something like this happened before?

428
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,374
Do you know why my dad
won't give me a job?

429
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,459
Because I'm immature?

430
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,631
It's because he's always
cleaning up after me

431
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,383
after I go around causing problems.

432
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,803
He’s probably tired of it.

433
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,430
He wants to live in peace now.

434
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:58,479
Have you ever done anything

435
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:02,149
related to Mr. Kang or LY Group?

436
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,032
The biggest one is probably
what I did to marry Yoon-gyeom.

437
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,743
What did you do?

438
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,996
I altered the fates of two women
by the slightest…

439
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,041
to marry him.

440
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:23,754
When he was single, all of the chaebols
wanted him as their son-in-law.

441
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,090
I mean, he's handsome and tall.

442
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:29,427
He was the elite of the elite,
and didn't even cause any scandals.

443
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,221
The competition was so intense,

444
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,472
but I was older than him,

445
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,474
and I had been married before.

446
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:36,851
So?

447
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,394
I heard a rumor

448
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,605
that he was flirting with another woman.

449
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,274
So

450
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,568
I got rid of her.

451
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,823
And this woman started messing with me,

452
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,159
telling me to give
her husband's company back.

453
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,579
Apparently she was the wife
of the CEO of GEDIKS or whatever.

454
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,039
But you see, GEDIKS was my dowry.

455
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:03,085
So a young woman and an old woman

456
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:05,963
had their lives changed forever.

457
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:08,632
All thanks to me.

458
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,107
GEDIKS…

459
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,568
No,

460
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,573
what did you do to those two women?

461
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:40,414
Don't try to dig too deep.

462
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,210
There will be plenty
of interesting events from now on.

463
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,671
I hope you're excited.

464
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:03,187
LA-EL

465
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:28,921
La-el.

466
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,246
What happened, La-el?

467
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,707
Why do you want to know
what your mother last looked like?

468
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,128
Did you hear something from somebody?

469
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,464
Do you know…

470
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:16,677
if she said anything

471
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,139
or what she was like

472
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:23,434
before she went missing?

473
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,020
It's important to me.

474
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,773
Soon after you left for the US,

475
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,194
she disappeared while she was
in the nursing home.

476
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,739
That's all I know.

477
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,867
What? What is it?

478
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,328
Do you think it's possible…

479
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,335
that Han So-ra hurt her?

480
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,800
How could somebody
disappear without a trace?

481
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,511
Don't you think it's strange?

482
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:10,147
When I last visited her
in the nursing home…

483
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,698
Are you all right?
I got you some porridge.

484
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,451
Please don't come visit me anymore.

485
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,082
You have a bright future ahead of you.

486
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,459
You shouldn't get involved
in anything dangerous.

487
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,087
Don't say that.

488
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,421
Listen to me.

489
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,260
Don't ever visit me again.

490
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,221
Okay?

491
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,724
She seemed so anxious.

492
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,187
As soon as your father passed away,

493
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,440
LY took over his company.

494
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,861
I thought it was all over.

495
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:00,239
What did she say…

496
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:03,242
when she left the nursing home?

497
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:07,996
Apparently she said
that she was going to visit a relative.

498
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,917
Then she went missing.

499
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:18,674
A woman disappeared for no reason,

500
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,260
and she hasn't been seen for ten years.

501
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,303
It makes no sense.

502
00:45:24,721 --> 00:45:27,891
But if somebody very powerful
was involved,

503
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,353
then it just might make sense.

504
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,190
It's just an assumption for now though.

505
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:46,660
La-el.

506
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:53,917
La-el!

507
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,842
I've only wished
that she'd still be alive.

508
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:07,639
Excuse me, did you hear anything
about Ms. Kim Jin-sook?

509
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,935
We haven't heard anything about Ms. Kim.

510
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,354
"I'll be able to

511
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:17,733
meet my mom again someday."

512
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,236
That hope is what kept me going.

513
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:27,784
La-el.

514
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,203
La-el.

515
00:46:32,414 --> 00:46:33,499
Mom…

516
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,182
Mom.

517
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,067
Mom.

518
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,730
What is it, Secretary Jung?

519
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,444
Your father would like to see you.

520
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:52,077
Ex-Prime Minister Han wants to see me?

521
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,121
He sent something through his secretary.

522
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,374
It said something like,
"Thank you for caring about Liyan."

523
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,545
He probably thinks this is his chance
since you went to the event.

524
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,088
You know he's doing all sorts of

525
00:48:03,171 --> 00:48:06,008
corrupt things involving businesses
in government projects.

526
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,134
I rejected it right away.

527
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,720
He’s such a snake. How dare he?

528
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,185
Tell him I'll meet with him.

529
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:20,814
Sir?

530
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:23,942
I'll meet with him.

531
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,714
-What do you think?
-You look so beautiful, ma'am.

532
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,466
That looks so good on you.

533
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,801
You look so pretty today.

534
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,713
Father.

535
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:44,272
You bastard.

536
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,483
Kneel down!

537
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,366
Have you forgotten the reason

538
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:57,703
why I raised you
on the same level as Chi-gyeom?

539
00:49:58,620 --> 00:49:59,621
No, I haven't.

540
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,456
Well,

541
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:05,794
Han Pan-ro is messing with
the shopping mall now.

542
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,964
How dare he take away
your brother's plaything?

543
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:11,925
I didn't know anything about that.

544
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,719
Well, that's an even bigger problem!

545
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,513
How the hell are you
controlling your household?

546
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,643
That's a contract for you
to give up all your rights

547
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,395
and inheritance papers.

548
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,147
I can't trust you anymore.

549
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:26,940
Sign it.

550
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,820
I gave this company
everything that I have.

551
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,072
You can't do this.

552
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:37,242
The real heir of this family is Chi-gyeom.

553
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:39,786
-Father.
-If I leave it to you,

554
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,913
I don't know what your wife
or father-in-law will do.

555
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,832
Sign it.

556
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,585
What about my children?

557
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,339
Your mother was a lowly woman,
and so are you.

558
00:50:51,423 --> 00:50:53,133
Your children won't be any different.

559
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,012
You're just the son of some housekeeper.

560
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:59,097
Do you really think
you're fit to be the chairman?

561
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,267
I took you in
so you could support Chi-gyeom

562
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,060
since he lacks in health and ability.

563
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,314
I didn't take you in
so you could step over your brother.

564
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,610
I'm the person who hid
the secret behind your birth,

565
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,779
but it's about time

566
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,032
that your wife and father-in-law
found out about it too.

567
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:18,325
Sign it now.

568
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,021
Some wounds can only heal…

569
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,983
if you silence them
with even greater pain.

570
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,151
La-el!

571
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,862
La-el!

572
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,322
If I were afraid,

573
00:51:57,906 --> 00:52:00,075
I wouldn't have started any of it
in the first place.

574
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,540
La-el.

575
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:11,628
Why are you being so nice to me?

576
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:14,172
When I first met you,

577
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,884
I still believed in
the value of innocence.

578
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:21,179
Times have changed,

579
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,808
but I still want to protect you.

580
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,446
I don't have an innocence
for you to protect.

581
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:42,576
I've become evil.

582
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:44,035
No.

583
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,956
Nothing has managed to taint you yet.

584
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,669
Circumstances have driven you
to where you stand,

585
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,047
but you haven't changed a bit.

586
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:00,844
Lee La-el.

587
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,430
A person who belongs to God.

588
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,142
You have a reason for your revenge,

589
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:12,105
but I'll probably pay the price
for doing something so terrible.

590
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:14,524
Yet still…

591
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,445
I wish to help you with your revenge.

592
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,242
It's not something I had in plan,

593
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:29,456
but how can I stop now…

594
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:34,127
when I've fallen so much for you?

595
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,395
Sun-bin, my dad's here.

596
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,107
Why aren't you wearing your dress yet?

597
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,073
I'll put it on now.

598
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,658
Where's Mr. Han?

599
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,370
Come in.

600
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,498
Congratulations on your performance.

601
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,042
It's been a while.

602
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,017
Hello.

603
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,271
Your plan was very impressive,

604
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,942
especially for someone
who's only ever done housework.

605
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,697
I studied business administration
in college.

606
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:46,741
No wonder.

607
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,788
I heard Ms. Kim is an outstanding dancer.

608
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:53,373
Won't you look bad next to her?

609
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,626
Don't be too shocked when you see me.

610
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:59,754
Mr. Han, I think we should
just cheer her on.

611
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,922
-Right?
-Yes.

612
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:14,477
-See you later.
-All right.

613
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:16,229
Good luck!

614
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,397
Good luck!

615
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:19,774
Get ready, okay?

616
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,870
Hello.

617
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:16,915
I'm Cha Elissa, the director of Liyan.

618
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:22,587
First, I would like to thank
the parents, students, and associates

619
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:26,883
for coming to Liyan Kindergarten's
Autumn Recital.

620
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,094
Now, for our first performance,

621
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:31,471
we have our pride and joy of Liyan.

622
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,183
Our students will be performing for you.

623
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,393
Please give them a big round of applause.

624
00:56:55,328 --> 00:56:56,412
He disappeared?

625
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:59,916
He went outside for a second
to call somebody.

626
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,210
I'll go get him, sir.

627
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:35,201
Next,

628
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:41,207
the parents prepared a special performance
for Liyan Kindergarten.

629
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,584
Let's welcome them onto the stage.

630
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:44,002
Please give them a round of applause.

631
00:59:00,161 --> 00:59:01,704
Well, pretend that you didn't.

632
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,498
You'll hurt yourself
if you find out too much.

633
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:06,793
Honey!

634
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,597
And this woman started messing with me,

635
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:21,808
telling me to give
her husband's company back.

636
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,353
Apparently she was the wife
of the CEO of GEDIKS or whatever.

637
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,564
But you see, GEDIKS was my dowry.

638
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,198
So a young woman and an old woman

639
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:40,076
had their lives changed forever.

640
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,704
All thanks to me.

641
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,397
-There you go.
-Let’s take a picture.

642
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,815
I’ll take the picture now.

643
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:12,984
One, two, three.

644
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:40,219
Just look at that woman.

645
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,929
She's a charming one.

646
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,933
She's really something else.

647
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:05,346
What happened to your face?

648
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,562
Remember the clown
who thought he was the king?

649
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:18,651
If that clown takes over the throne
and actually becomes the king,

650
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:21,529
then he's no longer delusional, is he?

651
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:25,116
What do you mean?

652
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,871
What if I really become the king?

653
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,376
My father-in-law, my father,
and my brother.

654
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,963
I'm going to destroy everyone
who's trying to step on me.

655
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:42,759
I'll take over LY and become the king.

656
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:45,928
Not just a clown,

657
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,639
but a real king.

658
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:29,597
If you're with me, I can do anything.

659
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:32,892
Promise me…

660
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:37,313
that you'll stay with me no matter what.

661
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,654
Okay.

662
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,283
I'll stay with you.

663
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,416
I'll be with you…

664
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,462
no matter what happens.

665
01:04:29,657 --> 01:04:30,867
You saw Yoon-gyeom, right?

666
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,419
That man is mine forever.

667
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,052
By the way, So-ra.

668
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,221
Yes?

669
01:04:56,851 --> 01:04:58,269
Go on, what is it?

670
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:03,441
I just had a strange thought.

671
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:09,530
I have this instinct
since I've been married for a while.

672
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,746
It's about Mr. Kang.

673
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:24,128
What about Yoon-gyeom?

674
01:05:30,968 --> 01:05:32,720
I think he's having an affair.

675
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:37,350
What?

676
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:14,011
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
OF THE ECONOMIC ADVISOR, HAN PAN-RO

677
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:17,033
What if I become the lady of LY
instead of Han So-ra?

678
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:18,617
Do you think he'll get a divorce
because of an affair?

679
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,161
Snap out of it.

680
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:21,787
Bring me proof.

681
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:23,664
If you don't have any
or say that you were mistaken,

682
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:24,665
I'm going to kill you.

683
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:26,417
I'll put them in so much pain

684
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:29,420
that they'll wish they were dead.

685
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,798
You shouldn't have come here.
It's too dangerous.

686
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:34,759
This is all because of Sun-bin.

687
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:36,427
Tell me, who is she?

688
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,304
Why can't I reach Sun-bin
for the past few days?

689
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,139
Damn it, just hit her!

690
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,558
I’ve got you now.
