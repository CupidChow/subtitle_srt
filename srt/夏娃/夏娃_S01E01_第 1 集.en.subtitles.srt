00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,652
-Hello.
-Welcome in.

4
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,079
Let me lead you inside.

5
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,167
Ms. Han, thank you for choosing
to shop with us today.

6
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:11,214
Chairman Jung sent me several invites
after opening this store in Apgujeong.

7
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,092
It's something to be proud of, for sure.

8
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:18,012
We've always been wondering
when you would visit us.

9
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,557
Any advice and feedback
would be greatly appreciated.

10
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:34,988
LY received an award for the highest
export profit at the 45th Trade Day Awards

11
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:37,740
with a profit of 110 billion dollars.

12
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,870
This was achieved over only two years,

13
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,289
after the award was given
for a profit of 90 billion dollars.

14
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:48,001
It's the greatest accomplishment
in the history of the Korean economy.

15
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,963
Isn't this Kang Yoon-gyeom of LY?

16
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,923
-Did you see the scandal?
-I think it is.

17
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,592
WORLDXX CHAEBOL'S SCANDAL, K AND H

18
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,552
MR. K, USUALLY CONSERVATIVE WITH WOMEN,
RECENTLY SEEN WITH MS. S

19
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,638
So he's cheating on his wife?

20
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,640
-What a mess.
-Have you seen this?

21
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,144
-So that article wasn't lying.
-The rumors were true.

22
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:08,855
Despite the world's economy
experiencing negative growth

23
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,066
and during the time with a high risk
of an economic downturn,

24
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,360
we were able to achieve
such an accomplishment

25
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:18,406
all thanks to our employees
who put in their best efforts

26
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:22,744
and the people of this country
who have rooted for us.

27
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:24,454
Does this make any sense?

28
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,665
LY KANG YOON-GYEOM'S SHOCKING SCANDALS

29
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:30,251
Wow, I never thought
he would do something like this.

30
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,794
-My gosh.
-Why is he holding a press conference?

31
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,212
The stocks are going to fall.

32
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,505
He's the chairman of a company.

33
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,217
-Unbelievable.
-Who is she?

34
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,343
SHE'S THE PARENT OF HIS KID'S CLASSMATE!

35
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:39,761
IT'S HIS FAULT. HE EVEN HAS A FAMILY.

36
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,681
He's cheating on his wife? I knew it.

37
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,060
LY KANG YOON-GYEOM "HAVING AN AFFAIR"
SHOCKING SCANDALS!

38
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,311
How could he do such a thing?

39
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,771
I thought he was better than that.

40
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,064
LY "WILL TAKE LEGAL MEASURES
AGAINST FALSE RUMORS"

41
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,787
MR. K, CHAIRMAN OF COMPANY L…
DIVORCED BECAUSE OF MS. S

42
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,667
MS. S MET MS. H IN KINDERGARTEN…
THAT'S WHEN MS. S AND MR. K MET

43
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:21,302
I promise you all

44
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:24,597
that I will contribute
to the growth of our economy

45
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,517
and fulfill my duty to this society

46
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,435
as a businessman.

47
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,745
-Mr. Kang, are the rumors true?
-Mr. Kang.

48
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,830
-Are the rumors true?
-Mr. Kang.

49
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,873
Could you please explain?
Are the rumors true?

50
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,875
Is it true you are having an affair, sir?

51
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:53,918
-Mr. Kang.
-Mr. Kang.

52
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,670
Mr. Kang.

53
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,861
Mr. Lee.

54
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,696
Aim well.

55
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,698
Just do what you usually do, okay?

56
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,465
Come on, clap.

57
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,304
Swing on three.

58
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,308
One,

59
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:17,770
two,

60
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,029
three.

61
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,174
See? They're on the same side.

62
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:50,052
He's played golf for 20 years.
He shouldn't have missed.

63
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:58,895
You little whistle-blowers.

64
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,104
You reported me to the prosecutors

65
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:04,609
and you gave them the data, didn't you?

66
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,404
Please don't kill me, Mr. Prime Minister.

67
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,531
Do-wan.

68
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,283
We'll have to bury them both today.

69
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,785
Mr. Prime Minister, please don't do this.

70
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,871
Please don't kill me.

71
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,373
I'm so sorry.

72
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,627
Mr. Prime Minister, please don't kill me.

73
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:37,350
Kongja and Soonja, run!

74
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,691
Come on, run!

75
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:47,860
That's it.

76
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,718
Mr. Prime Minister.

77
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,096
Mr. Kim Sin-chu has been
waiting for two hours.

78
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,932
He's asking you to post on social media

79
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,017
that he's the best candidate
for the mayor of Seoul,

80
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,352
even if he can't meet with you.

81
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,441
I said I don't want any visitors
when the prosecutors are watching.

82
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,360
And don't call me "Mr. Prime Minister."

83
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:31,195
I told you to call me "sir," didn't I?

84
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,698
Yes. I'm sorry, sir.

85
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,451
KIM JEONG-CHUL

86
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,040
-What is it?
-I have bad news, Mr. Han.

87
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:46,335
Your son-in-law messed up.
He messed up big time.

88
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,628
Oh my goodness.

89
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,673
Why on earth is he doing this?

90
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,217
When she finds out,
things are going to get really bad.

91
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,886
-The news of Mr. Kang's secret mistress…
-Turn the TV off.

92
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:06,897
Call Congressman Park right now.

93
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,483
Tell him to take all the articles down

94
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,528
and to claim it as a false report.

95
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,281
Don't let it spread anymore.

96
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:18,784
Do it now.

97
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:19,702
Yes, ma'am.

98
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,675
Ma'am, it's a call from your father.

99
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,409
Yes, Father.

100
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,619
Have you lost your mind?

101
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,038
What the hell are they saying on the news?

102
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,416
Have you been paying attention
to your husband at all?

103
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,210
What were you thinking?

104
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,754
I called Congressman Park.

105
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,506
I told him to take everything down.

106
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,758
What's the point?
Everybody's seen it already!

107
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,845
What the hell is Yoon-gyeom up to?

108
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,263
This is upsetting for me too.

109
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,933
Just give me some time.

110
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,394
I'll take care of this.

111
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,895
That piece of shit.

112
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,647
He's out of his mind!

113
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,982
Damn it!

114
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:08,727
LY KANG YOON-GYEOM'S
QUESTIONABLE PERSONAL LIFE

115
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:24,076
Mr. President wants the floor leader
to publicly withdraw his words.

116
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,537
I'll convince him
if you can let me speak with him.

117
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,663
Yes, sir.

118
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,749
So nobody knows

119
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,043
who Chairman Kang's mistress is?

120
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,963
Everybody's looking for her online,
and nobody's found her yet?

121
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:37,840
What is she, an alien?

122
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,550
She seduced the chairman of LY,

123
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,510
the richest man in the country.

124
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:43,262
I wonder who she is.

125
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,431
His wife is Han Pan-ro's daughter, no?

126
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,143
-She’s got some guts.
-Right?

127
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,151
3 MONTHS AGO

128
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,948
My father wants to have a meal
with us and Congressman Kim.

129
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,493
His wife is coming as well,
so we all have to be there.

130
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:10,623
Mommy, am I going too?

131
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,084
Your grandfather wants to see you, Da-bi.

132
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,921
-Of course you're going.
-What about my diaper?

133
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,173
Remember what I said?

134
00:13:19,256 --> 00:13:20,508
When you have to go, it's too late.

135
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,636
Press the button before that, okay?

136
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:26,889
What if my friends find out?

137
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,308
That's why I keep telling you
to stop using diapers.

138
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:33,187
Why aren't your therapy sessions
showing any improvement?

139
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,022
Don't scold her like that.

140
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,359
Just leave it until she can do it herself.

141
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,276
And what then?

142
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,321
Do you really want everyone to know
that she's not potty-trained?

143
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,501
That's the end
of Liyan Kindergarten's entrance ceremony.

144
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,127
Now, let's move on to the second part,

145
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,172
prepared just for the parents.

146
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:05,386
In order to produce global leaders,
we begin our school year in the fall

147
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,846
and offer classes
taught in three languages,

148
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,016
as well as a special arts program
and a program for the gifted.

149
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,812
All of our entrance ceremonies so far,

150
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,856
which we have continued even throughout
the Japanese occupation,

151
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,817
have been accompanied by a donation event

152
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:22,403
in order to share
our educational spirit with the world.

153
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,989
I'm asking you,
our dear alumni and family members,

154
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,700
as well as the returning parents,

155
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,160
to become family
with our young, gifted students

156
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,579
who will shape the future of our nation.

157
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:35,249
Please enjoy the ceremony
and make a caring donation

158
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,418
for our children who are in need.

159
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:38,919
Thank you.

160
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,248
-Hey.
-Yes?

161
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,001
Doesn't So-ra look way older
from up close?

162
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,046
She doesn't look any older.

163
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,756
She's just old.

164
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,135
She had her kid when she was nearing 40.

165
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:29,929
You're right.

166
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,142
Honey.

167
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,394
Doesn't this remind you of Eun-bi?

168
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,772
I miss her.

169
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,611
A bandoneon?

170
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,032
-What's a bandoneon?
-It's an instrument used in tango.

171
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,493
That's a pretty niche thing to know.

172
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,853
That female dancer is Korean.

173
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:41,977
Who is she?

174
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:43,687
She's so good at dancing.

175
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,938
Maybe she's a celebrity.

176
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,691
I love her style.

177
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,495
Apparently, she's the mother
of one of the kids here.

178
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,996
-Really?
-Yes.

179
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,665
Did you hear that?
She's the mother of a student.

180
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,459
-She's a kindergartener's mom?
-Yes.

181
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,842
Apparently, she's a mom here.

182
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,097
Liyan's not as good as it used to be.

183
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,602
It'd be embarrassing
to associate with her.

184
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,493
Thanks to you,
we've gone far above our goal amount

185
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,370
for the donation event tonight.

186
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:07,414
Thank you.

187
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:10,125
Let me know if you need anything.

188
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,752
All right, thank you.

189
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,672
You're so cool.

190
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,925
-That was great.
-That was amazing.

191
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,386
-I loved it.
-Amazing performance.

192
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,930
You were awesome.

193
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,389
-Great performance.
-Thank you.

194
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,599
I loved the performance.

195
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,309
You were amazing.

196
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,021
Her child is in our Royal Class.

197
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,148
I didn't know she was such a great dancer.

198
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:35,901
The Royal Class?

199
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,122
I've never seen her before.

200
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,959
What family does she come from
for her child to be in the Royal Class?

201
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,880
I heard her mother has connections
with the foundation.

202
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,551
Please do let me know

203
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,512
if she gives you any trouble.

204
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:09,810
-That was great.
-Thank you.

205
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:12,771
Wow, she looks even younger in person.

206
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:13,855
How old is she?

207
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,274
She looks younger than you.

208
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,234
Come on.

209
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,456
Hello.

210
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,166
Nice to meet you.

211
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,460
I'm honored to be
in the same class as you.

212
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,838
I enjoyed the performance.

213
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,181
I wanted to meet the two of you first.

214
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,475
I'm also a member of the SE Club.

215
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,810
Really?

216
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,396
You're an SE member?

217
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,982
Are they accepting more people now?

218
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,650
I didn't hear anything about new members.

219
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,404
I've actually been a member for a while.

220
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,406
My mother is one of the original members.

221
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:05,991
I see.

222
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,620
Then how come I haven't seen you before?

223
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,497
I know, right?

224
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:15,959
Have we ever met while working out?

225
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,672
Well, I'm not very noticeable
when I'm not dressed up.

226
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,842
You guys are very prominent
with your natural glow.

227
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,972
If I'm being honest,
you guys are kind of like celebrities.

228
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:29,931
At least to me, that is.

229
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,100
You don't need to exaggerate like that.

230
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,025
We have a variety of programs
prepared for this year.

231
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,986
Mom, can I go play in the playroom?

232
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,071
Of course.

233
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,906
Bo-ram.

234
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,075
I think she does ballet too.

235
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,410
Can you ask her where she learned it?

236
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:53,080
It'd be fun if I taught her too, right?

237
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,372
Okay, I'll ask.

238
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:58,460
You all have fun in the playroom, okay?

239
00:22:59,044 --> 00:22:59,878
Go have fun.

240
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,678
Do you want to
come to the playroom with me?

241
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,891
Mom, can I go with her?

242
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,601
Sure, go ahead.

243
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,189
Have fun, Da-bi.

244
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,860
She's so cute.

245
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,904
You look young. How old are you?

246
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm 28.

247
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,199
Twenty-eight?

248
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,117
What…

249
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,538
Your husband must be quite a catch
for you to get married so early.

250
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,665
Is he here? What does he do?

251
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,084
He has a regular corporate job.

252
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,836
He couldn't make it because of work.

253
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,505
By the way,
how are you so good at dancing?

254
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,548
Are you a professional dancer?

255
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:47,509
No.

256
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,678
I started tango as a hobby,

257
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,263
and I fell in love with it.

258
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,890
You do it as a hobby,
and you're that good?

259
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,642
Wow.

260
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,560
My goodness.

261
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,285
You know Han So-ra, right?

262
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,995
She's in our class too.

263
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,874
Does Ms. Han

264
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,668
not like to mingle with other people?

265
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,087
Well, everybody knows

266
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,256
that ex-Prime Minister Han
didn't teach her any manners.

267
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:29,843
She was the parent representative
when her older kid went here,

268
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,428
and she didn't even
look at the other moms.

269
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:33,972
She's too good for us, apparently.

270
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,391
No way.

271
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:39,186
Is she going to be
the parent representative again?

272
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,645
She's too old for that.

273
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,064
-Somebody around our age should do it.
-That's true.

274
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,193
Maybe you'll do it this time.

275
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,617
Hello.

276
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:56,578
Yes.

277
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,789
Can you come to the front gate?

278
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,500
Okay.

279
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,213
The flowers that I ordered are here.

280
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,214
Excuse me for a moment.

281
00:25:55,512 --> 00:25:56,638
Hello, sir.

282
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,306
You're here for the delivery, right?

283
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:01,434
Ta-da.

284
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,271
What are you doing here?

285
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,772
I thought you were working late today.

286
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:08,566
I came to see you as soon as I was done.

287
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,654
Congratulations on your performance.

288
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,411
I wish I got to see you dance.

289
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,745
What a shame.

290
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,088
You missed the performance,

291
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,385
but you get to see something
that nobody else can see.

292
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:09,044
WAITING ROOM FOR FEMALE PERFORMERS

293
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,304
Mom, Dad.

294
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,600
Mom, I'm friends with Da-bi now.

295
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:26,811
Da-bi wants to learn ballet
from you too, just like me.

296
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,521
Really?

297
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,607
Yes. You're so pretty.

298
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,902
If your parents agree to it,
you can learn from me.

299
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,819
Okay.

300
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,075
Did you have fun, Da-bi?

301
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,161
Mom, I made a new friend.

302
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:44,662
Did you, now?

303
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,459
I told you not to make friends
with the poor kids, didn't I?

304
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,920
I'll pick out your friends for you.

305
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,969
Director Kang?

306
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,141
Director Kang.

307
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,935
Wait, you're the chairman now.

308
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,937
I haven't seen you in a while, sir.

309
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,647
Assistant Manager Jang?

310
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,857
I'm actually a general manager now.

311
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,151
I've been in Seoul
for more than eight years now.

312
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:18,405
He was the branch manager
when I was in Argentina.

313
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,866
Nice to meet you, ma'am.

314
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,289
I guess it really is a small world.

315
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,751
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

316
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:32,836
And you too, ma'am.

317
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,714
This is my wife and my daughter, Bo-ram.

318
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,677
Hello.

319
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,680
I enjoyed your performance.

320
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:45,098
Thank you.

321
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,609
Da-bi, do you want something to eat?

322
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,821
Do you want this?

323
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:40,737
-Hello, Mr. Prime Minister.
-Hello.

324
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,198
I haven't seen you
since my oldest granddaughter graduated.

325
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,034
Liyan has come a long way since then.

326
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,494
It's all thanks to you, sir.

327
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,122
-Liyan is looking great.
-Thank you.

328
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:53,458
What is it?

329
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,961
The chairman of the foundation
and ex-Prime Minister Han are here.

330
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:59,339
We'll assist you soon.
Please wait just a moment.

331
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,925
Why aren't we moving, Mom?

332
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,511
Yes, I wonder why.

333
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:07,680
Bo-ram, I'll be right back.

334
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:09,974
Wait in the car.

335
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:12,060
Gosh, so we don't even matter?

336
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,146
Are we to expect this kind of treatment
all throughout?

337
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,815
This is pissing me off!

338
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,984
How can you discriminate
between people like this?

339
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:22,320
Seriously, you have to be kidding me.

340
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,697
Do you know how much money
I spent on this school?

341
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,784
-I'm sorry.
-Open the gate right now.

342
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,577
We'll assist you soon.
Please wait just a moment.

343
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,788
Wait for how long? Just open it already!

344
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,958
You get prettier every time I see you.

345
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,836
All thanks to Mr. Han here,

346
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,630
Liyan has become one of
the best kindergartens in the world.

347
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,975
-Dad!
-Honey!

348
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,726
-Stop!
-Honey!

349
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,978
Dad!

350
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,688
Just sign it, you idiot!

351
00:30:57,814 --> 00:31:00,900
Now that you've got him,
he'll confess in no time, sir.

352
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,069
The higher-ups won't let me do it.

353
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,116
You little brat.

354
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,785
If your dad doesn't sign it,

355
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,787
he's going to die.

356
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,331
-Honey!
-Dad!

357
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,208
It's okay.

358
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,126
Get it from the inside.

359
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,545
-It's okay. Just a bit more.
-It's okay.

360
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,462
Come on!

361
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,841
Just a bit more.

362
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:25,884
From the inside.

363
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:27,010
-It's okay.
-It's good now.

364
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,304
-Hurry up!
-We got it, we're done.

365
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,180
-All right.
-We're done.

366
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,265
No, a bit more.

367
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:33,224
There, done.

368
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,152
If it says Han Pan-ro,
everybody will know.

369
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,503
This is to show our gratitude.

370
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,297
HAN PAN-RO

371
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,840
The donations that you gave us

372
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,092
were used to remodel the gymnasium.

373
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,844
That's good to hear.

374
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,894
Wow, this space has gotten a lot bigger.

375
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:20,396
The kids will love running around here.

376
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,233
We've built a climbing wall
that's suitable for children.

377
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,819
Wow, I've never seen this.

378
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,197
This looks great.

379
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,367
This looks fun.

380
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,284
Right?

381
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,504
This is a classroom that was set up
so that our students

382
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,799
can get the best education
in a comfortable setting.

383
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:51,386
They'll learn how to play
all of the instruments.

384
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,887
Even right now, our students

385
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,766
are getting numerous awards
in competitions all over the world.

386
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,977
Like so, we're producing
the finest students

387
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,853
in every single category.

388
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,940
Since you're working so hard
for the children,

389
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,567
maybe I should build
a horseback riding center next time.

390
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,569
I would be grateful.

391
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,405
You're going to make another donation?

392
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:11,614
-Yes.
-But you don't have

393
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:12,949
any more grandchildren.

394
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,368
What are you talking about?
I'm still waiting on a grandson.

395
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,495
Right, So-ra?

396
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,540
Oh, come on.

397
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:05,293
Thank you so much for visiting us today.

398
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,380
You've worked so hard for this place.

399
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:10,673
I mean, just look at this.

400
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,052
-It's all thanks to you, sir.
-Oh, don't say that.

401
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:17,847
This place will look even greater
with a horseback riding center.

402
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,932
No, I'm going to build that
next to my house.

403
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,397
Da-bi, make sure to study hard
and become a great person, okay?

404
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,774
Okay.

405
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,276
Should we get going now, Da-bi?

406
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,360
Let's go.

407
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,528
This way please.

408
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:58,513
His political book was a huge hit,
and loved especially by the millennials.

409
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,389
Here with us today,

410
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,391
please welcome Congressman Seo Eun-pyeong.

411
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:08,648
THE MAN WHO OPENED A NEW POLITICAL HOTSPOT

412
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:10,733
Hello, I'm Seo Eun-pyeong.

413
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,069
Well…

414
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,196
My book is titled

415
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,240
The Man Who Opened
A New Political Hotspot.

416
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:21,452
But if you came here today expecting me
to introduce you to a new hotspot,

417
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,789
you might be disappointed.

418
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,252
SEO EUN-PYEONG'S FALL BOOK FESTIVAL

419
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:32,964
I actually wrote this book
during the darkest period of my life.

420
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,217
I'd given up a lot of things
when I was studying for my exams.

421
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,344
Dating, marriage, getting a child,

422
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,263
buying my own house, and friends.

423
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:42,348
I gave up on all such things.

424
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,725
I didn't have anyone to meet up with,
and I was broke.

425
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,979
So I came up with
thousands of ideas at home by myself.

426
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,189
Then I wrote a book like this,

427
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,025
and it helped me earn a lot of money.

428
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,029
But it's more than just this book.

429
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,992
If I ever lose my job as a politician,

430
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,703
I'll just open a small restaurant nearby

431
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,497
and give you guys a 50 percent discount.

432
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,458
Then maybe people will come
out of sheer curiosity.

433
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:12,461
And then it'll gain popularity,

434
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,674
and then just maybe it'll make a huge hit.

435
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,389
So what am I really trying to say here?

436
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,515
Giving up?

437
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,601
I gave up on things too.

438
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,770
But don't start getting used to it.

439
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,356
Don't start giving up
your hopes and dreams too.

440
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,151
I don't know how you're feeling right now

441
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:37,236
or what you're doing with your lives.

442
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,696
But what you do in the present

443
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:42,200
will become a great skill for you,
ten years in the future.

444
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:45,119
Just like me, standing in front of you.

445
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,415
So never give up.

446
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:50,791
We can do this,

447
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,752
everyone.

448
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,964
Thank you.

449
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,522
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

450
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,858
-Are you Mr. Seo Eun-pyeong?
-Yes, I am.

451
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,027
This is for you, from the United States.

452
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,280
Could you sign this right here?

453
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,784
-Thank you.
-No problem. Thank you.

454
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,197
IT'S LEE LA-EL

455
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,657
THIS IS TEN TIMES
WHAT I GOT FROM YOU, AS PROMISED

456
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,242
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING
THAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME

457
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:09,829
Lee La-el.

458
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,375
13 YEARS AGO

459
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,299
Are we allowed to come here
without any prior approval?

460
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,467
Shouldn't we officially request a visit?

461
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,053
Come on, I'm scared.

462
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,806
You think they'll let me in
on the investigation if I send a request?

463
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:32,727
You don't know if Mr. Lee
is at the NIS or a police station.

464
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,312
We need to be sure--

465
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,273
Are you all right?

466
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,361
Are you okay?

467
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,703
We're in front of
Ms. Han So-ra's residence.

468
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,122
Her husband, Mr. Kang Yoon-gyeom,

469
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,042
is the heir of LY Group,
which will soon acquire GEDIKS

470
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,543
and become a global enterprise.

471
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:02,840
LY CURRENTLY IN 30TH PLACE,
WILL IT BECOME A CONGLOMERATE?

472
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:07,845
You're early.

473
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,556
Yes.

474
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,393
You're not looking too good.

475
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,356
I know it's for your safety,

476
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,985
but I wish I didn't have to send you

477
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,488
to another country all alone.

478
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,281
It's all right.

479
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,495
I…

480
00:39:33,662 --> 00:39:36,665
I was worried since it's hard
to get a Bar Association scholarship.

481
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,001
But you have great grades.

482
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,841
Thank you, sir.

483
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,636
I'll never forget your kindness.

484
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,140
And…

485
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:01,982
Lee La-el.

486
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:05,403
Lee La-el.

487
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,949
I've never called you by your name before.

488
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,118
It's a pretty name.

489
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:16,163
Is there a meaning behind it?

490
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,753
"A person who belongs to God."

491
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,382
My dad named me.

492
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,385
A person who belongs to God.

493
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:38,144
Here.

494
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:41,188
If you ever need help
in the States, call me.

495
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,106
It's a new number.

496
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,817
I don't have a law office anymore.

497
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,611
Why don't you have one?

498
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:50,364
I'm not going to be a lawyer anymore.

499
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,826
I want to live a different life.

500
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,162
Why?

501
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,833
I wanted to help people.

502
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,587
That's why I became a human rights lawyer.

503
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,590
But I realized something

504
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,843
after seeing what happened to your family.

505
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,679
If I don't have any power,

506
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,266
then I can't help anybody.

507
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,268
I wonder…

508
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,399
what kind of person you'll become.

509
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,026
And I also want to know

510
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,571
what your life will be like.

511
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,241
Although it won't be the same as before.

512
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,243
Probably not.

513
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:39,705
As time passes,

514
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,459
I'll most likely be forgotten.

515
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,464
But someday,

516
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:54,428
when people start talking
about their misfortunes,

517
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,846
take a moment to think of me.

518
00:41:55,930 --> 00:41:57,264
HAN SO-RA'S HUSBAND
CHAIRMAN OF LY, KANG YOON-GYEOM

519
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,850
Because I'm going to pay them back…

520
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,150
tenfold.

521
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,786
After she left for the US,

522
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,871
she stopped talking to me.

523
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:25,793
Her mother suddenly disappeared
one day too.

524
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:29,004
Nobody knew what happened to those two.

525
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:34,051
She disappeared without a trace,

526
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,430
and her name, La-el,

527
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,059
became faint in my memory.

528
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:29,898
La-el.

529
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:38,782
I'm sorry.

530
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,577
Dad…

531
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,580
I have to do this to protect my company

532
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:48,167
so that I can protect my employees.

533
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:50,711
You understand me, right?

534
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:56,717
-Honey!
-Dad!

535
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,261
Honey!

536
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:03,015
Who are you? Why are you doing this?

537
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,516
-Honey!
-Dad!

538
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,648
Hey, Lee Tae-joon.
This isn't rocket science.

539
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:13,359
"I became a corporate spy
to get more money."

540
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,402
"I'm sorry for handing over
that technology."

541
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,238
"This will never happen again."

542
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,699
Just sign it, and we'll let you go.

543
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,202
I promise.

544
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:27,331
That never happened.

545
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:31,502
That's not true…

546
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:35,881
Why you…

547
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:38,884
Dad!

548
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,511
Hey.

549
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,180
You idiot. It's not that hard.

550
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,182
-Dad!
-Just sign.

551
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:47,184
It's just one signature, you idiot.

552
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:50,396
Is it that hard? Just sign it, you idiot!

553
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:52,356
-Please don't do this!
-He's bleeding.

554
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,440
-Please don't hurt him.
-Please don't do this.

555
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:54,525
Gosh, they're so loud.

556
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,529
If you're not going to convince him
to admit his fault, get out.

557
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,280
This is the end of your damn visit.

558
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:03,117
-What are you doing? No! Honey!
-No! Dad!

559
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,368
Honey!

560
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:07,538
Damn, you're made of tougher shit
than I thought.

561
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,455
Mom.

562
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,167
Hey, is it really so damn hard
to just draw a signature?

563
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:13,669
Mom…

564
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:15,879
Mom…

565
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:20,384
Back in the day,
he'd be spilling the truth right now.

566
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,389
This world has gotten
so much easier to live in.

567
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,015
Goddammit.

568
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,644
This is taking so long
because I'm trying to be nice.

569
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,271
Now that you've got him,

570
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,022
he'll confess in no time, sir.

571
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,691
In no time, my ass.

572
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,318
The higher-ups won't let me do it.

573
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,700
Hey.

574
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,785
Just leave her.

575
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,973
I can't eat this anymore.

576
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,057
This is choking me up.

577
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,108
All right, give that here.

578
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,111
Okay, let's do this, like that.

579
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,331
Who the hell do you think you are?

580
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,082
Sir!

581
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,460
Why, you little…

582
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:39,922
Hey.

583
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,548
Move aside.

584
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,224
Damn, you little brat.

585
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,267
You've got some spirit in you,
haven't you?

586
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:55,145
You've been glaring at me all this time.

587
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,063
The entire time.

588
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,857
So what are you going to do now?

589
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,776
What are you going to do?

590
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:01,693
Hey.

591
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,614
If your dad doesn't sign it,

592
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,866
he's going to die.

593
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,494
You see him right there?

594
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,828
Lying on the ground?

595
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,293
You little brat.

596
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,598
-Dad.
-Honey!

597
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,766
Dad.

598
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,230
Honey!

599
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,690
Dad.

600
00:47:40,857 --> 00:47:42,317
Honey!

601
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:43,819
Mom!

602
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:45,487
-Mom!
-What are you doing?

603
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,697
Get her out of here.

604
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,407
No!

605
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:51,451
Mom!

606
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,374
LEE TAE-JOON
CAUSE OF DEATH: STRANGULATION

607
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,251
Cremate him right away,

608
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:01,878
and don't allow any family interviews.

609
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,046
Yes, sir.

610
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,522
If your dad doesn't sign it,

611
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,816
he's going to die.

612
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,272
I've gotten rid of Lee Tae-joon.

613
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:06,735
LY and GEDIKS are all yours now.

614
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,247
MEETING BETWEEN VARIOUS MINISTRIES
AND FINANCIAL INDUSTRIES

615
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,772
Today, we're interviewing
Prime Minister Han and Ms. Han So-ra.

616
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,358
Prime Minister Han.

617
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:50,987
Thank you for being at this charity event
to help kids with incurable diseases.

618
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,865
I see that your daughter, Ms. Han So-ra,
is here as well.

619
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,867
I'm here to make sure that people know

620
00:49:55,951 --> 00:49:58,829
that this pretty young lady
is my daughter,

621
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:00,455
since a lot of people
don't seem to know that.

622
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,241
Excuse me.

623
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,373
I didn't know his daughter was home.

624
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,625
Isn't your mother at the hospital?

625
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,210
I thought you'd be with her.

626
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,754
What do you think you're doing?

627
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,214
Well, we're just…

628
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:58,054
Find Mr. Lee's seal first.

629
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,389
We can get the
daughter's statement tomorrow…

630
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,187
Director.

631
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:11,526
What are you doing here?

632
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:16,865
La-el. We…

633
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,743
Well…

634
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,000
Hold on.

635
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,251
I just need a moment.

636
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:30,045
Hey! I just need…

637
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,352
Go and look.

638
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,865
You know Han So-ra, right?

639
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,616
She's in our class too.

640
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,620
Does Ms. Han

641
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:48,248
not like to mingle with other people?

642
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,403
Honey.

643
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:04,282
You want to… Here?

644
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,243
I can't help myself.

645
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,663
Dancing to the tango made me feel so hot.

646
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:11,748
Babe.

647
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:14,876
You know that I want you
and that I've been waiting for this.

648
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,211
But can we do this at home?

649
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,796
I don't want somebody to find us.

650
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,469
WAITING ROOM FOR FEMALE PERFORMERS

651
00:55:41,671 --> 00:55:42,756
I love you, honey.

652
00:56:07,238 --> 00:56:08,364
Did you have fun, Da-bi?

653
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:12,285
Mom, I made a new friend.

654
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,203
Did you, now?

655
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,595
Da-bi, do you want something to eat?

656
00:56:31,346 --> 00:56:32,472
Do you want this?

657
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,748
You all live up in a castle in the clouds.

658
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,337
You're still too far to reach,

659
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,674
but the key to the shortcut there

660
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,427
lies in your heart.

661
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,352
When I have it in my hands,

662
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,897
I'll drag all of you with me

663
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:26,818
into the hellfire that burned my soul.

664
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,857
Because I'm going to pay them back

665
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:06,816
tenfold.

666
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,776
I wonder what she's trying to do.

667
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:13,323
Would you mind helping me with something?

668
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,785
Honey.

669
00:58:17,869 --> 00:58:22,081
Let's just take three days
to find out who Mr. Kang knows.

670
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:24,459
Do you recognize me?

671
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,044
Because I recognize you,

672
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:26,961
Lee La-el.

673
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,631
I didn't ask for your opinion.

674
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:33,051
She doesn't know her place.
I'll just get rid of her.

675
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:34,385
The bandoneon.

676
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,596
Do you know how to play it?

677
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:37,972
Where's Yoon-gyeom?

678
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,266
You're supposed to listen
to your partner's heart

679
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,644
and become one with them
when you dance to a tango.

680
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:43,853
With all your attention only on me.

681
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:45,980
May I help you with that?
