00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,427
Hello. Who is this?

4
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,386
Hello.

5
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,888
This is Seo Eun-pyeong.

6
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,556
Oh, Mr. Seo.

7
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:58,391
This is Kim Jeong-chul.

8
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,351
I'll put Mr. Prime Minister on the phone.

9
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,479
It's Congressman Seo.

10
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,028
Hello, this is Pan-ro speaking.

11
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,946
Thank you for your thoughtful gift.

12
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,076
I saw it at an auction,
and it's supposedly 400 years old.

13
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,244
It made me think of you.

14
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,705
I heard you have a great love for books.

15
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,167
Thank you for showing up
to my granddaughter's kindergarten event.

16
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,921
I really appreciate
your thoughtful gesture.

17
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,757
I would love to talk to you in person.

18
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,177
Of course. I'd be more than happy.

19
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,637
Shall we do that then?

20
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,264
Great, I'll see you at my house.

21
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,141
All right.

22
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:47,774
Promise me

23
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,276
that you'll stay with me no matter what.

24
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,241
Okay.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,787
I'll stay with you.

26
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,542
I'll be with you…

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,462
no matter what happens.

28
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,807
You're supposed to
distance yourself from him.

29
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,225
We've already requested the lawsuit.

30
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,726
What if he finds out who you are?

31
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:26,646
In public too.
What do you think you're doing?

32
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:28,606
I don't want you interfering with this.

33
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,240
You think Yoon-gyeom

34
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,034
is seeing another woman?

35
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:45,707
What makes you say that?

36
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,375
He came to your performance,

37
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,628
but he didn't get you
any flowers or gifts.

38
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,174
I've been watching him,

39
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,887
and he didn't even glance at you.

40
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:17,071
Did you find out where he had been
when he spent the night out?

41
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,622
Follow me.

42
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,351
Secretary Cha.

43
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:51,481
We've strengthened the security.

44
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,526
We'll make sure
nobody can approach you, sir.

45
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,072
Can I trust you…

46
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,616
to be on my side?

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,370
I'll do anything you order me, sir.

48
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,538
I'll work for you, and you only.

49
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,375
You said it was Han Pan-ro?

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,626
What did he send?

51
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,965
There should be two boxes in my car.

52
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,801
They both contain the same thing.

53
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,597
Send one of them to my father

54
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,849
and tell him that Han Pan-ro sent it.

55
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,066
And send the other box
to my father-in-law.

56
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,901
Make it anonymous.

57
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,208
My, my.

58
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,641
Here, So-ra. Use this.

59
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,932
Isn't it hot? You'll burn yourself.

60
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,322
You.

61
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,876
Have you forgotten your place

62
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,337
with me being so nice to you?

63
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,517
Have you forgotten who I am?

64
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,602
Not at all, So-ra.

65
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,562
How could I?

66
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:37,814
If you haven't forgotten,

67
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,149
then where are your damn manners?

68
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,195
I'm sorry, Ms. Han.

69
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,159
You've accused my husband of cheating.

70
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,411
That better not

71
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,623
be a figment of your imagination.

72
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,043
Bring me proof.

73
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,630
If you don't have any
or say that you were mistaken,

74
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,049
I'm going to kill you.

75
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:09,262
Understood?

76
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,766
I understand, Ms. Han.

77
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:37,248
FATHER

78
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,795
Honey.

79
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,093
It’s fine.

80
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:53,890
Darling.

81
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,934
How was my performance?

82
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,024
I'll wait for you at the House of Roses.

83
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,411
Let's go, Sun-bin.

84
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:22,502
You can go.

85
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,062
Honey.

86
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,480
Mom.

87
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,148
You two can go home ahead of me.

88
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:47,693
Bo-ram.

89
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:52,073
A friend of mine is having a hard time
right now, so I need to stay with her.

90
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:53,491
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,244
No.

92
00:08:57,995 --> 00:08:59,247
What are you…

93
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,917
Let's talk when we get home. Let's go.

94
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,002
-We can talk when I'm back.
-Are you serious right now?

95
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,505
Grandma.

96
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,883
Ms. Jang, she probably has a good reason.

97
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,801
Let's go.

98
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,263
-Is that okay, Bo-ram?
-Yes.

99
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:19,725
Thanks, Bo-ram.

100
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,935
See you later, Mom.

101
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,148
Sorry, Mom.

102
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,284
Babe.

103
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,287
I feel so tense right now
because of the performance.

104
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,955
Let's go home.

105
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,541
Can you take care of me?

106
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,959
I have something important to do.

107
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,254
-What is it?
-It's just work stuff.

108
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,631
Why do you need to know?

109
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,550
Aren't you here to make up with me?

110
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,718
Let's talk later.

111
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:55,678
Honey.

112
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,858
Follow him.

113
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:12,570
I want to know
who he meets and where he goes.

114
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:18,326
What do you think about this
to secure your company shares?

115
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:22,705
It's a bit of a risk, but it'll work.

116
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,378
How did you think of this?

117
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,425
A luxury company in Europe
once fought over its management rights.

118
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,844
That's where I got my idea from.

119
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,349
I looked into
your subsidiary companies too.

120
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,823
You must have been so lonely.

121
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,161
How did you last this long?

122
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,919
What makes you think that I'm lonely?

123
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,715
You never had anybody you could trust,

124
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,469
ever since you were a child.

125
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,422
You talked about twin flames.

126
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,259
I don't believe in such things.

127
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,931
But what I really want to know…

128
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,227
is how you know so much about me.

129
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,949
I won't ask you
any uncomfortable questions.

130
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,952
So just stay next to me.

131
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,918
He's not picking up.

132
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,880
Are you sure
Yoon-gyeom's not in his office?

133
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,633
He said he had work.
Where is he if he's not at work?

134
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,387
I just spoke to his secretary.

135
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,931
Chairman Kang won't be coming today.

136
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,475
Apparently something urgent
came up at work.

137
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,104
It's about Mr. Kang.

138
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,690
I think he's having an affair.

139
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,735
He didn't even glance at you.

140
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,281
Ma'am.

141
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,080
Ma'am, are you all right?

142
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:18,375
I'm cold.

143
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,381
Are you not controlling
the temperature in here?

144
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,638
It's cold in here!

145
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,057
Turn down the AC and get me a heater.

146
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,974
Hurry.

147
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,772
You're not coming home today?

148
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,816
I'll pick you up early in the morning.

149
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,526
I'd prefer it if you didn't sleep outside.

150
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,153
I won't let her sleep outside.

151
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,905
Give me the phone. I'll talk to her.

152
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,491
You better come home right now.

153
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,760
I told you, it's cold!

154
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,595
-Bring some more heaters.
-Okay.

155
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,324
You're not coming home today either?

156
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,453
Don't you think
this is a bit too much, babe?

157
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,997
A friend? Which friend?

158
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,127
Chairman Kang won't be
coming home today either, ma'am.

159
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:45,898
It's hot.

160
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,694
-Come on, get up.
-Gosh, it’s so hot.

161
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,446
Turn the heater off.

162
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,289
Bo-ram.

163
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,709
Your mom said she'll be back soon,
so let's wait just a bit longer.

164
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,211
-Okay?
-Okay.

165
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,094
It's Mom.

166
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,930
Mom!

167
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,640
Bo-ram.

168
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,059
I missed you.

169
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,978
Are you going to kindergarten?

170
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,272
I'll drive you.

171
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,858
I can go with Dad today.

172
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,401
You should go inside and rest.

173
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,656
Come to the studio afterward, okay?

174
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,575
Ta-da!

175
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,869
You can practice with a chiffon tutu on.

176
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:25,539
Okay, Mom. You're the best!

177
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,541
Let's go, Bo-ram.

178
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,813
I told the law firm about who I am

179
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:54,151
because I thought
you would stop seeing Mr. Kang.

180
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:57,654
What if they find out what our plan is
before I can do anything?

181
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,156
Why are you acting so reckless?

182
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,241
My mother…

183
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,871
passed away because of So-ra.

184
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,375
So-ra told me herself.

185
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,799
So-ra is one evil woman.

186
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,594
Your mother had already lost everything.

187
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,262
Why did she do that?

188
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,642
She'll pay for what she's done.

189
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,062
Let's punish her with the law.

190
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,191
The law is on their side, actually.

191
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,236
I realized that
after spending time with them.

192
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,131
A death can only be repaid by death.

193
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,426
La-el.

194
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,638
You said that you don't
want to be a monster.

195
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:05,973
What happened to that?

196
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,434
She took that from me.

197
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,570
I'll make her kill herself.

198
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,284
I’ll put her

199
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,870
in so much pain…

200
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,250
that she'll wish she was dead.

201
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,136
So-ra's here.

202
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,686
You stay inside, Ms. Jang.

203
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,410
How could you not show up

204
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,913
after telling me something like that?

205
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,749
I've been reflecting on what I did.

206
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:17,878
I'm sorry for telling you that
so suddenly, Ms. Han.

207
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,131
Yoon-gyeom…

208
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,676
hasn't been coming home.

209
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,013
Not since the performance.

210
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,643
I have a bad feeling about this.

211
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,579
Let's find out what he's up to, Ms. Han.

212
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:55,874
Yes, I do need to find out.

213
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,960
But he blocked me,

214
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,005
and I can't even track him.

215
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,466
His bodyguards are protecting
every inch of him.

216
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,051
How am I supposed to do anything?

217
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,014
I have a good idea.

218
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:15,477
I have a proposal
for opening a shopping mall.

219
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,063
You can go tell him about it,

220
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,023
saying that you had a sudden inspiration.

221
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,692
He won't stop you

222
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,362
if you're visiting him for work,
not for personal matters.

223
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,782
MOM

224
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:56,476
Mrs. Han is here.
Could you come downstairs?

225
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:05,360
MOM

226
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,740
I understand your anger, La-el.

227
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:14,661
But you can't go
to the LY Chairman's office unprepared.

228
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,247
You've made no plans
on how to make So-ra kill herself.

229
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,250
So-ra will be divorced from her husband…

230
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:26,381
if I become the lady of LY instead of her.

231
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,385
What if I broadcast to the entire nation

232
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:32,596
how she's abandoned by her husband?

233
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,683
She's always trying to appear perfect.

234
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,602
I bet she'll wish for death.

235
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,479
Let me lead you inside, ma'am.

236
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,943
It may have taken 20 years to build,

237
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,113
but I can destroy it in five minutes.

238
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,076
My anger may be small,

239
00:24:57,204 --> 00:25:00,498
but I can do anything
if that rage runs deep enough.

240
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:21,603
Hello, sir.

241
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,321
Hello. I'm Seo Eun-pyeong.

242
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,406
Welcome, Mr. Seo.

243
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,243
I haven't had the honor
of meeting you in person until now.

244
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,953
You sure are impressive, Mr. Seo.

245
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,454
Thank you so much for inviting me.

246
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,666
-Let’s go inside.
-Let’s go.

247
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,005
Sir.

248
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,090
Mrs. Han is here.

249
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,303
Let's wrap up today's meeting here.

250
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,404
Don't you know who I am?

251
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:55,780
-Sorry, ma'am.
-Sorry, ma'am.

252
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,166
Chairman Kang would like to
see you in his office.

253
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:27,187
Honey.

254
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,190
I'm sorry that I wasn't home for so long.

255
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,943
I'm at your workplace right now.
Can we meet?

256
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,906
I'm here to see Mr. Kang and Ms. Han.

257
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,077
I'll meet you
at the chairman's office then.

258
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:09,270
What is he doing?

259
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,439
Are they scheming together or something?

260
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,109
There's nothing wrong
with the one I gave him.

261
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,404
He must be hiding something.

262
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:20,407
Wait.

263
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,368
Maybe it's my misunderstanding.

264
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,204
Perhaps he's actually just doing work.

265
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:34,879
Ms. Han.

266
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:37,757
What?

267
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,259
What is it?

268
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:49,477
Come take a look at his suit.

269
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:35,583
Whose is it?

270
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,627
Whose makeup is that?

271
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,255
I don't know, Ms. Han.

272
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,340
I just happened to notice it.

273
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:46,553
Tell me whose it is.

274
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,597
Tell me, who is she?

275
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,392
I really don't know.

276
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,602
No, I can't have that. I need a name.

277
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,521
Who is it?

278
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:06,990
Dam-ri normally talks
a lot about Mr. Kang.

279
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,658
You little…

280
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,494
Is your brain just there for decoration?

281
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,455
There's no way it can be her.

282
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,332
Tell me the truth!

283
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,503
What do you think you're doing?

284
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,882
Are you out of your mind?

285
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,845
She could have gotten hurt.

286
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,684
You're worried
about somebody else getting hurt,

287
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,229
but you can't see
that you're hurting my feelings?

288
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,440
You're the one embarrassing me right now,

289
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,443
coming here without an appointment
and making a scene!

290
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,987
You tell me what you've been up to.

291
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,448
Why aren't you coming home?

292
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,159
What have you been doing?

293
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,745
And what was that meeting about?

294
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:56,623
Why do you have so many security guards?

295
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,543
Don't you see how strange you're acting?

296
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:04,297
I'd be a moron if I didn't do anything!

297
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,214
Get out.

298
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,133
Don't ever come back here again!

299
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,481
Mr. Kang.

300
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,947
Get lost.

301
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,664
"Get lost"?

302
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,802
I'm going back to my father's house.

303
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,178
I'm staying with my dad!

304
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,182
You're the one to blame
for this situation.

305
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:00,812
So-ra.

306
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,443
I mean, Ms. Han, what's going on?

307
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,657
Mr. Kang.

308
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,079
Ms. Han.

309
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,123
Let's get you out of here first.

310
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,091
Wait outside.

311
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,602
What is it?

312
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,062
What happened?

313
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,497
Your wife is in the chairman's office.

314
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,093
I'm okay.

315
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:15,928
Are you hurt?

316
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,938
Ms. Han is suspicious of you.

317
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,233
She thinks you're cheating on her.

318
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,486
Distance yourself from her.

319
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,946
I'll assign somebody to protect you.

320
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,537
Will you be all right?

321
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,652
You've been doing everything
without any political funds?

322
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,487
You've got some guts, Mr. Seo.

323
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:58,531
I've always been quite fearless.

324
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,242
But you need more
than just guts for politics.

325
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,830
I'm glad you came to talk to me.

326
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:10,126
From now on, I'll be your supporter.

327
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,296
Things will be a lot easier for you.

328
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:19,218
It's so nice being able to
talk to you like this.

329
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,555
Let's have a drink, shall we?

330
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:29,729
So-ra.

331
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:32,815
I got it, okay? I'll look into it.

332
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:36,194
I saw it with my own eyes.
There was eyeshadow on his suit!

333
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:38,112
So-ra, calm down.

334
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,032
That eyeshadow didn't get there
by accident.

335
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,492
Some woman was rubbing her face on him!

336
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,661
Please, can you bring it down?

337
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,205
That little…

338
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:48,623
Is somebody there?

339
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,584
-I've got a guest here with me.
-Yes, sir.

340
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,628
Here. Cheers.

341
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,185
If your father finds out
when you're not completely sure,

342
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,604
then somebody innocent
will get screwed again.

343
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,606
The incident with Madam Jung
wasn't even that long ago.

344
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:16,317
I'll look into it, so calm down, okay?

345
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,111
I wasn't really going to
come to my father's place.

346
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,863
Then just go back home.

347
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,407
What about my pride then?

348
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,576
All right, I get it. Okay?

349
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:28,246
I'll make sure that Yoon-gyeom
comes begging on his knees.

350
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,083
I called Sun-bin here,
so you can take out your anger on her.

351
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,628
What are you doing, Mr. Kim?

352
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,046
Mr. Seo is here.

353
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,756
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister.

354
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,260
Change into something else
and come out later.

355
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:43,761
Okay?

356
00:38:29,557 --> 00:38:30,391
Ma'am.

357
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,060
Ms. Kim is here, so I let her in.

358
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,077
Why the hell are you looking at me…

359
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:53,706
as if I'm pathetic?

360
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,043
I would never, ma'am.
You've misunderstood.

361
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,669
You think I've misunderstood?

362
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,422
I'm sorry, ma'am.

363
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,841
Where the hell are your manners?

364
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,181
Did you look into the eyeshadow?

365
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,058
Do you know anybody who uses that type?

366
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:13,559
Who is it?

367
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:17,271
I haven't had enough time to check yet.

368
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,693
But

369
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,946
apparently this was
custom-made by Mr. Kang.

370
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,867
I heard Dam-ri bragging about it.

371
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,793
I'm telling you, it's not her.

372
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,796
Why would he go for someone
that's not even on my level?

373
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,506
Is there anybody else more plausible?

374
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,133
Ms. Han.

375
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,760
Mr. Seo is leaving.

376
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,736
You make some great conversation.

377
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,571
You flatter me.

378
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:12,868
Wow, your pretty faces
are brightening up this place.

379
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,039
-Please come back anytime, Mr. Seo.
-Of course.

380
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:18,124
Wait.

381
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,127
Why won't you say anything
about my handsome face?

382
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,629
So-ra, can you get him a mirror?

383
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:26,382
After you, sir.

384
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,425
Please.

385
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,886
Are you eating dinner outside?

386
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:33,431
No, let's eat together
after I see Mr. Seo off.

387
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:35,975
You shouldn't have come here.
It's too dangerous.

388
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,727
I could say the same to you.
Why are you here?

389
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,398
Mr. Seo.

390
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,150
Your car is ready.

391
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,869
Why did you go to Han Pan-ro's house?

392
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:56,871
It has something
to do with me, doesn't it?

393
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,748
What's the rush? Come take a seat.

394
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,130
Here.

395
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,302
You don't even eat, do you?

396
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:16,599
Come on, eat.

397
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,150
Those people are dangerous.

398
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,401
And they're not to you?

399
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,279
I'm just doing what I need to do.

400
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,989
It's too much for you to do alone.

401
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,492
Are you going to
face them then, Mr. Lawyer?

402
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,451
See?

403
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,453
This is the reason why.

404
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,539
You called me a lawyer like you used to.

405
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:45,336
I assume that means you've had
a change of heart, even by little, no?

406
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,048
La-el.

407
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,633
As you know,

408
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,676
I don't have any family.

409
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,931
After your father, the only person
I relied on, passed away,

410
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,516
I ended up alone again.

411
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,644
Now, you're the only one I have left.

412
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,314
I know it may sound strange

413
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:08,734
that I think of you
and your father as family.

414
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,612
But I've realized that family

415
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:14,698
isn't just about being blood-related.

416
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,617
A family is formed

417
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,869
with love and bonding.

418
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,499
La-el.

419
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:28,295
You're still in your twenties
and you're young.

420
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,839
You can still learn and get corrected.

421
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,967
You can still get help.

422
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:36,887
I fully understand
why you're running so blindly…

423
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,932
toward your goal.

424
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:45,479
The stew is getting cold. You should eat.

425
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:48,315
If you're not feeling hungry,
why don't you try these?

426
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,193
This is my masterpiece.

427
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,363
Sugar is good for stress.

428
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,553
Who are you?

429
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:19,680
Chairman Kang sent me.

430
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,265
I'm your bodyguard.

431
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:24,852
I was told to protect you
like your own shadow.

432
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,118
I'll protect you.

433
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,413
I'm sorry, and thank you.

434
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,939
Do you really think
that a couple with two kids

435
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,858
will divorce because of a simple affair?

436
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,568
Snap out of it.

437
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,280
An affair is just an affair,
especially to chaebols.

438
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,705
Are you sure about that?

439
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,917
You think you can
make So-ra get a divorce?

440
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:31,543
Yes.

441
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,963
Let me ask you one thing.

442
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,715
Did you get enticed by the car or jewelry?

443
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,885
Or do you wish to be the lady of LY?

444
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,642
You have feelings for Mr. Kang, don’t you?

445
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:54,525
Some things you just can't hide,
no matter how hard you try.

446
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,902
Poverty, a sneeze,

447
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:58,946
and love.

448
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,533
I saw you staring at him
as if you were in love.

449
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,535
This is why they say
that sex is dangerous.

450
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,537
Are you feeling greedy now?

451
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,373
Do you wish to have him all for yourself?

452
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:15,003
I'm back, Ms. Jang.

453
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,675
You're here too.

454
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,679
My darling.

455
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,974
Have you decided to sleep at home tonight?

456
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,894
Honey.

457
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,855
What were you doing

458
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,940
in the chairman's office…

459
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,943
today?

460
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:42,406
Right.

461
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,032
Ms. Jang.

462
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,325
You see, Ms. Jang,

463
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,745
I saw something today.

464
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:52,583
Right?

465
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,792
Honey.

466
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,295
What exactly did I see?

467
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,721
What did you see?

468
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,098
You know exactly what I saw!

469
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:11,977
Ms. Jang.

470
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,105
Could you ask her who she was with

471
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,066
when she spent nights away from home?

472
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,696
Where are you going?

473
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,448
I'm asking you a question!

474
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,367
What's going on between you and him?

475
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,995
Jin-wook, what are you doing?

476
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,734
This man once told me
that he would take a bullet for me.

477
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,237
And now, he's acting like this
out of mere jealousy.

478
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,030
You saw how it is.

479
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,200
Love is such a foolish thing.

480
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,037
So you don't have to be scared of me

481
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,414
having some love in my heart.

482
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,668
Love is such a worthless emotion.

483
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,965
What the hell are you talking about?

484
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:24,925
On the day of my friend's wedding,

485
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,053
and during the past few days,
I've been with Mr. Kang.

486
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:32,975
Jin-wook.

487
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:34,851
Sun-bin is a bit out of it

488
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,854
because she's been
doing things for Ms. Han.

489
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,314
There's nothing going on here.

490
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,732
What she said isn't true.

491
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,067
It's true.

492
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,541
What do you think you're doing?

493
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,168
You're also hiding
something from me, aren't you?

494
00:48:00,877 --> 00:48:02,421
How can we stay married

495
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,298
if we're both hiding things
from each other?

496
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:06,633
I need some time to think.

497
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,927
No, don't go.

498
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,429
You can't go. I won't let you.

499
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:17,686
Please.

500
00:48:17,769 --> 00:48:19,605
Please don't go.

501
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,482
I won't hurt you again.
I'll never do it again.

502
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:26,361
It's all my fault, so please don't leave.

503
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:31,658
I'm just so scared.

504
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:39,541
What on earth happened to us?

505
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,176
You want to know what happened to us?

506
00:49:16,453 --> 00:49:17,579
Honey…

507
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:22,668
You can't do this. Where will you even go?

508
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:25,253
You know that I don't have anywhere to go.

509
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,006
And I'm sure you also know

510
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,385
that siding with me
rather than trying to stop me

511
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:33,595
is the only way for both of us to live.

512
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,831
Let's take a break.

513
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,471
KIM SUN-BIN

514
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:02,100
The person you are trying to reach
is not available.

515
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,560
You will be charged…

516
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,403
Look.

517
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,532
THE ZEUS PROJECT

518
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,017
Just like that?

519
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,310
You're so good.

520
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:47,354
Come on, I'm not that good.

521
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,606
I've never seen anybody as good as you.

522
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,691
You're tickling me.

523
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:55,070
Hey.

524
00:51:55,153 --> 00:51:56,071
You're here.

525
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:59,533
Wait, so…

526
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,037
if we sleep with those two,
we can get three times that money?

527
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:20,554
Dad.

528
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,723
Are you crying again?

529
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:26,226
I'm not.

530
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,569
I'm sorry, Bo-ram.

531
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,030
I'm sorry.

532
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,201
Why can't I reach Sun-bin
for the past few days?

533
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,202
Is something wrong?

534
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:10,705
She told me to stay away
for the time being, sir.

535
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,666
I told you to stay close and protect her!

536
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,751
I’m sorry, sir.

537
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:49,577
Please call me. I miss you.

538
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:51,913
I'm worried sick about you.

539
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,674
REPORT ON KIM SUN-BIN

540
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,051
This is La-el's information.

541
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:07,512
Why are you giving me this?

542
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:10,974
I nourished a viper in her bosom.

543
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,560
When it's time,

544
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,898
tell Kang Yoon-gyeom
about who La-el really is.

545
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,279
If I want to protect myself,

546
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:28,116
I need to catch her
before she grows even bigger.

547
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:36,041
She told me she's going to her relative's,
but she's still not back.

548
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,928
When is your mother coming?

549
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,972
I don't know.

550
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,329
Apparently this was
custom-made by Mr. Kang.

551
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,665
I heard Dam-ri bragging about it.

552
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,542
You're here.

553
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:22,587
Are you going to practice today?

554
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,380
Dam-ri.

555
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:29,385
That's a limited-edition bag.
Where did you get it?

556
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,517
You know the answer to that, don't you?

557
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,770
Mr. Kang gave it to me.

558
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,163
What do you want?

559
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:18,101
What's wrong?

560
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,908
-Dam-ri.
-What's wrong with her?

561
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,619
She's scaring me.

562
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:39,539
Do you need to go to the hospital?
Should I call somebody?

563
00:57:39,622 --> 00:57:41,124
-It's about Mr. Kang.
-What is it?

564
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,459
I think he's having an affair.

565
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,502
-Oh my goodness.
-Oh my, So-ra.

566
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:45,587
-So-ra.
-Hold on.

567
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,130
Get yourself together.

568
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,299
So-ra.

569
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,660
Snap out of it.

570
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:20,497
I need to snap out of it
to find out who it is.

571
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,007
SUN-BIN

572
00:58:33,885 --> 00:58:36,596
The person you are trying
to reach is not available.

573
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,848
You will be charged for the call
after the beep.

574
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,397
KIM JEONG-CHUL

575
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:52,153
The person you are trying
to reach is not available.

576
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:54,697
You will be charged for the call
after the beep.

577
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,325
KIM JEONG-CHUL
I CAN'T ANSWER THE PHONE RIGHT NOW

578
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,304
Where are you?

579
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:23,101
I need to see you right now.

580
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:32,860
What is it?

581
00:59:36,197 --> 00:59:37,615
I heard about the 300 million won.

582
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,703
Could you give me a chance too?

583
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,960
I've been at my father's place
for over five days,

584
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,170
but Yoon-gyeom still hasn't called.

585
00:59:53,715 --> 00:59:56,634
This would have been a disaster
if I told my dad everything.

586
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,227
He's definitely having an affair,

587
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:08,605
but who is it?

588
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,315
No.

589
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:12,483
I know him too well.
He's not having an affair.

590
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,614
This is all because of Sun-bin.

591
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,243
She better watch out.

592
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,081
I'm bleeding.

593
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:29,500
-Damn it.
-Mrs. Han.

594
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,012
I really don't like…

595
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,850
the look you're giving me.

596
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,455
You should be thankful
for a pretty and kind woman like me.

597
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,540
So why are you
looking down at me like that?

598
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:13,294
Maybe I should just kill you.

599
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,771
SUN-BIN

600
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,233
Where are you?

601
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:39,153
Mr. Kang gifted a car to some woman.

602
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,864
It took me some time to find this out.

603
01:01:57,505 --> 01:02:01,676
It's a two-toned sedan,
and the plate number is 0518.

604
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:04,137
It's headed toward Gongnam Road.

605
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,471
Go faster.

606
01:02:07,056 --> 01:02:09,142
-I said, go faster!
-Yes, ma'am.

607
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,484
I found it.

608
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,654
It's about Mr. Kang.

609
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,115
I think he's having an affair.

610
01:02:24,198 --> 01:02:25,074
I have something important to do.

611
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,325
Why do you need to know?

612
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,243
Honey.

613
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,457
Catch up to her.

614
01:02:32,540 --> 01:02:33,583
I need to see her face.

615
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:52,769
Step on it!

616
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,896
Step on it harder!

617
01:02:55,646 --> 01:02:56,856
Get closer!

618
01:03:02,236 --> 01:03:03,154
Step on it! Harder!

619
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,449
More!

620
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:09,869
Get closer!

621
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,334
Closer!

622
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,672
Damn it, just hit her!

623
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,140
Are you all right, ma'am?

624
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:33,976
Good job.

625
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:43,444
I've got you now.

626
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:15,142
Open the door.

627
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,145
Get out!

628
01:04:32,326 --> 01:04:34,203
I told you to stay close and protect her!

629
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:35,162
I'm sorry, sir.

630
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,831
How can I find out if she's all right?

631
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,583
I can't go find her myself.

632
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:41,460
I'll go check on her at her place.

633
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:42,962
Where are you?

634
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:47,508
Mr. Kang gifted a car to some woman.

635
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:51,012
It took me some time to find this out.

636
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,478
I'LL PROTECT YOU.
I'M SORRY, AND THANK YOU.

637
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,823
LEE YEON-WOOK

638
01:05:17,204 --> 01:05:18,372
Yeon-wook.

639
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:20,416
Could you come get me?

640
01:05:58,162 --> 01:05:59,580
Watch out.

641
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:08,506
Run!

642
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:17,223
Fuck!

643
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,102
When we reach the critical point,
we lose our ability to reason

644
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,895
and do things we shouldn’t do.

645
01:07:04,979 --> 01:07:07,314
Nobody can find out about what we did.

646
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:08,482
So this is my fault too?

647
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,859
LY has always been mine!

648
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,402
You're a worthless parasite.

649
01:07:11,485 --> 01:07:13,195
I sent a small gift.

650
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,321
We're over.

651
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,490
I miss you so much. It's driving me crazy.

652
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:18,743
I know exactly what I'm going to do now.

653
01:07:18,826 --> 01:07:21,537
I'm going to find out
who your mistress is.

654
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,247
Who are you?

655
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,542
Let's meet tomorrow at noon.
