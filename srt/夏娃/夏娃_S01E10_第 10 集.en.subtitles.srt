1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,829
So-ra.

4
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,958
You'll never think about
why this is happening, will you?

5
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,961
Then I guess I am a psychopath.

6
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,796
You were right.

7
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:49,716
But that means…

8
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,678
I could do something
completely crazy, doesn't it?

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:57,724
I'm going to do

10
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,269
my very best to ruin your life.

11
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,605
You'll try to stop me

12
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:06,399
while I try to break through.

13
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:12,322
Who do you imagine will win?

14
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,940
Is Yoon-gyeom still at the same location?

15
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,024
And Secretary Cha too?

16
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,944
He's still at the KTCA building.

17
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,946
He must still be in
the executive board meeting.

18
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,714
I'm preparing a place for the two of us.

19
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:14,008
Whether it's in Seoul,
Namhae, or Jeju Island,

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,094
we can move into a house or an apartment.

21
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,973
Just tell me where you want to go.

22
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:26,271
I'll send Jin-wook
to a different city for now.

23
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,109
If he ends things with you,
I'll give him a handsome reward.

24
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,444
If not,

25
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:35,613
I'll do the opposite.

26
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,869
You can either send Bo-ram to Jin-wook

27
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,537
or keep her with you.

28
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,247
Do whatever you want.

29
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,498
I'll support you
regardless of your decision.

30
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,712
Things are going well with So-ra too,

31
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,298
so let's deal with this one by one.

32
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,382
By the way,

33
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,593
is Ms. Han going to be

34
00:02:57,802 --> 00:02:59,053
part of the management now?

35
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,806
She's been wanting it for a while.

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,309
I let her do it to make her feel better.

37
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,733
Let's be careful when we see each other
for the time being.

38
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,320
We'll need to stay hidden like this.

39
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,071
I'm so sorry.

40
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,331
What? Are you going somewhere?

41
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,876
I need to visit the kindergarten.

42
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,086
I asked to meet with the director.

43
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,796
So you're going to leave right now?

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,714
I just remembered.

45
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,257
It's not easy for me to see you.

46
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,968
Yet I took time out to stay with you.

47
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,221
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,643
I've been wanting to hold you for so long.

49
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,611
Why are you acting like this?

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,572
It's getting late.

51
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,869
Can you try to arrange another meeting?

52
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:09,123
I'll try to spend more time with you then.

53
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,553
-Ms. Han.
-What is it?

54
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,764
I'm from Tomorrow Economy.

55
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:27,308
Are company shares the cause
of the fight between the in-laws?

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,893
I also heard that the CEO
of the shopping mall is changing.

57
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,770
Could you give us a hint
as to who it's going to be?

58
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,480
-Please give us a statement.
-Sorry.

59
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,940
-Ms. Han.
-I'm sorry.

60
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,990
Why do they care
if we're fighting over the company shares?

61
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:43,491
It's not like it's their money.

62
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,576
They're hurting my dad's pride

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,912
because they're calling it
the fight between the in-laws.

64
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,332
It's a good thing for a CEO of a mall
to get lots of attention.

65
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,960
It'll look like Chairman Kang
kicked out the elders for his wife.

66
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,670
Any woman would be jealous.

67
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,173
Just ignore Sun-bin, ma'am.

68
00:04:59,257 --> 00:05:01,509
Once you start managing
the company with Chairman Kang,

69
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,012
she'll realize her place and get lost.

70
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,391
Tell the promotion team

71
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,978
that I'm going to announce myself
as the CEO of the shopping mall

72
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,147
and that they should
stay silent until then.

73
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,231
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,275
I want to see Mr. Jang.

75
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,192
Yes, ma'am.

76
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,492
I would love it
if you could step in, ma'am.

77
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:28,578
I've been so angry
and frustrated all alone.

78
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,623
I met with a lawyer, but it's
Chairman Kang we're talking about.

79
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:34,959
Ms. Han.

80
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,753
You'll stop Chairman Kang, won't you?

81
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,713
I'm really trusting you with this.

82
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,133
Mr. Jang.

83
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:43,926
Yes, Ms. Han.

84
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,267
Do you think I called you here
to team up with you?

85
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,562
-Sorry?
-You can't even control your wife?

86
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,857
What a dumbass.

87
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,902
Goodness, how can you call yourself a man?

88
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,073
You have two choices.

89
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,616
Either quit your job,

90
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:08,159
or get fired.

91
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,085
This is the insider trading table

92
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,628
from back when GEDIKS
was sold 13 years ago.

93
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:20,421
Mr. Jang.

94
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,590
You helped cover up the project
while in the development team

95
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,342
and caused a decline in company value.

96
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,344
Wait, this…

97
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,388
All of the GEDIKS employees
were in on this, Ms. Han.

98
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,557
So that makes it legal?

99
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,770
A developer who fabricated
a development project?

100
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,688
If this gets out, not only
will you face legal action,

101
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,607
but you'll never be able to work
in the industry again.

102
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,364
-Ms. Han.
-Wrap up your life here,

103
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,242
and go abroad somewhere
with all of your family.

104
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:52,703
You have exactly ten days.

105
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,124
Ms. Han…

106
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,129
Please leave.

107
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,343
Move to the United States?

108
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,180
What are you talking about?
This is all so sudden.

109
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,891
Well, we might as well.

110
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:18,271
My mother has wanted
to live with us in the U.S. for a while.

111
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,814
Besides, I've thought about it,

112
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,524
and I think this situation with Sun-bin

113
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,526
will be resolved naturally
if we go to the U.S.

114
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,194
Still…

115
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,155
I understand your surprise, Ms. Jang.

116
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,740
But I really think
that this is the best way.

117
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,038
Thinking of Bo-ram too,
I don't think that it's a bad idea.

118
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,084
We'll get a new beginning in a new place.

119
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:42,920
You should look into it.

120
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,632
It won't be too difficult
since my mother is there.

121
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,760
Don't worry, Ms. Jang.
I'll make sure everything goes well.

122
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,312
Hi, Mom.

123
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:00,855
Can we talk right now?

124
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,318
This is unbelievable.

125
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,736
When the lawsuit begins,

126
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,947
Pan-ro and Jeong-chul
will realize who we really are

127
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,866
in just a few days.

128
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,826
It might be more helpful for us

129
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,621
if that man is gone.

130
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:18,206
Don't you think so?

131
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,668
Let me buy some time
until we can find the right time

132
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,713
to take care of this.

133
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,550
General Manager Jang
turned in his letter of resignation.

134
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,220
His entire family
is moving to the United States.

135
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,137
What?

136
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,683
LETTER OF RESIGNATION
JANG JIN-WOOK

137
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:43,523
Bo-ram, you haven't seen
Da-bi in a while, have you?

138
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,193
There's a tablet in the lounge,

139
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,654
so you should call her
and invite her to your birthday party.

140
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:51,614
That sounds awesome, Mom!

141
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,956
MR. KANG

142
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,668
The person you are trying to reach
is not available…

143
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,370
Why weren't you picking up my calls?

144
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,125
I had to take care of something
at the kindergarten.

145
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,210
Is it true that you're going to the States

146
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,129
with Jin-wook?

147
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,256
I'm thinking about it.

148
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:54,010
We need to talk.

149
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:56,679
It can be now or later.
When is it best for you?

150
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,932
I'll call you
after I've organized my thoughts.

151
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,394
Let's talk now.

152
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,897
Are you actually
planning to go to the States?

153
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,027
I told you,

154
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,904
I'm still thinking about it.

155
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,158
-So just wait.
-For how long?

156
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,287
Why are you doing this?
This isn't like you at all.

157
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:25,458
I thought that we could
pretend to be strangers

158
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,709
whenever we felt like it.

159
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:33,716
So just wait
until I feel like seeing you again.

160
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:43,684
I want to know why
you're acting like this all of a sudden.

161
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,361
Did you really think

162
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,946
you were in control of everything?

163
00:10:58,699 --> 00:10:59,950
I'll call you.

164
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,641
Yoon-gyeom has already given me his heart.

165
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,353
That means I can completely destroy him.

166
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,613
The president will now award
the letter of appointment.

167
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,116
The letter of appointment
goes to Seo Eun-pyeong.

168
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:43,285
I appoint you to serve
as a high-ranking public official,

169
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:47,248
and you will hold the position
of the Chief Secretary to the President.

170
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,673
I look forward to working with you.

171
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,092
I'll do my very best, Mr. President.

172
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:04,181
Wow, it looks like Eun-pyeong
is paying you back in full.

173
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,391
FOR PRIME MINISTER HAN…

174
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,437
SEO EUN-PYEONG APPOINTED
AS THE NEW CHIEF SECRETARY

175
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:18,028
I mean, the chief secretary
to the president?

176
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:21,073
He's rising up so quickly.

177
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,993
What do you think he wants?

178
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:24,910
Money?

179
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:26,245
Power?

180
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:31,917
Should I use Eun-pyeong,

181
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,754
-or the prosecutors?
-What do you mean?

182
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,341
How should I
destroy Yoon-gyeom and his father?

183
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:44,346
Well, whichever one it is,
you just need to decide, Mr. Han.

184
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,184
We have an abundance of information.

185
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,196
Hello, Director Cha. What is it?

186
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,405
The Office of Education

187
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,282
sent a warning
for the abuse of foundation status.

188
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,200
What?

189
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,161
You know Ms. Kim, don't you?
Her daughter is friends with Da-bi.

190
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,539
She's the one who filed a protest.

191
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,376
I think you'll need to
give an explanation yourself, sir.

192
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,963
What? What's wrong?

193
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:23,344
You know the woman that So-ra was fond of?

194
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:24,762
I'm sure you know her.

195
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,056
The one who was really great at the tango?

196
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:28,265
Yes.

197
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:32,019
Apparently that woman made
a request to the Office of Education.

198
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,354
I wonder what it is.

199
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,982
I'm sure it's nothing. I'll look into it.

200
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,985
Mr. Han.

201
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,780
I heard that this is great for your knees.

202
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,994
What?

203
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:51,705
She's the woman
that Yoon-gyeom is having an affair with?

204
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,501
Wow, that asshole.

205
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,212
How can he date
the mother of his daughter's friend?

206
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:00,339
He's out of his mind, he really is!

207
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,549
Lower your voice.

208
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,468
If my dad finds out,

209
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:07,471
he'll just say that it was my fault.

210
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,641
I became the director of the mall
because of Yoon-gyeom's affair.

211
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,850
So I don't want him to find out.

212
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,437
Oh, so that's why Jin-wook quit his job.

213
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,564
I'm going to send them to the States.

214
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,816
Wow, this bastard.

215
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,402
When I announce the opening
of the CL store with Mr. Giovanni,

216
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,988
I'm also going to announce
that I'm the CEO of the mall.

217
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,157
Once I start doing my job,
my dad will stop yelling at me,

218
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,743
and once things get busy,

219
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,621
that bitch will be forgotten.

220
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,552
How do you like the store?

221
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,019
He says that the store
is amazing and very fancy

222
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,145
and that he loves it.

223
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:57,855
Thank you.

224
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:13,037
CL has finally entered a department store.

225
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,716
The business partner
who made this possible

226
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,551
is LY Group.

227
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,802
Ladies and gentlemen.

228
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:33,098
Let me introduce Mr. Kang Yoon-gyeom,
the Chairman of LY.

229
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,313
Actually, I'm not the person
who should be applauded.

230
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,065
It's Han So-ra,
the CEO of LY Shopping Mall,

231
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:44,109
who worked very hard for the entry of CL.

232
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,449
So So-ra's really
taking the shopping mall.

233
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,410
She stole her brother-in-law's mall.

234
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:59,583
I'm a bit embarrassed. Yoon-gyeom
always introduces me as his wife,

235
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:02,336
but now he's telling everybody

236
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,129
that I'm the CEO of LY Shopping Mall.

237
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:06,340
So I don't have anything special to say.

238
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,176
But please make sure
to shop at LY Shopping Mall

239
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:12,179
after shopping here for today.

240
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,771
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

241
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,106
Thank you.

242
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,840
That bitch is here.

243
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,009
Who invited her? Was it Mr. Giovanni?

244
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,552
She's not here.

245
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,804
Nobody can enter this place
without being invited, Mrs. Han.

246
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,641
Maybe you were mistaken, ma'am.
I think you might be a bit too sensitive.

247
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,934
I'm sure that I saw her!

248
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,905
But that means

249
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,658
I could do something
completely crazy, doesn't it?

250
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,482
How dare you show your face here?

251
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,903
Am I not allowed to celebrate?
I thought we used to be friends.

252
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,677
You're amazing, Ms. Han.

253
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:14,695
Oh no.

254
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,071
You're bleeding.

255
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,199
Why don't you run to your daddy
and tell him that I did it?

256
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,286
By the way,

257
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,955
why haven't you told your dad about me?

258
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,457
Should I do it for you?

259
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,881
Stop.

260
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:41,471
Stop right there!

261
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,266
What's up with you?

262
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,447
You brought her here too?

263
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,867
-Did you really?
-What are you talking about?

264
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,744
That bitch is here!

265
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,038
You saw her, didn't you?

266
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:07,831
Did you bring her here on a date?

267
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,374
You did.

268
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,876
What the heck are you talking about?

269
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,377
She's really not here!

270
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,503
You're going to deny it

271
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,589
when she was at the store
and I just talked with her?

272
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,258
Are you really going to do this to me?

273
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,301
Look at this!

274
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,471
What about it?

275
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,848
That bitch got me flowers.

276
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,226
Must you check the security cameras
to believe me?

277
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,686
She thinks she can do whatever she wants

278
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,064
since I didn't do anything to her
because of you.

279
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,316
I should have brought her to her knees
in front of me!

280
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,443
No, I was so stupid.

281
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,779
I was naive to think it'd be over

282
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,698
if I kicked her out of the kindergarten
and sent her to the U.S.

283
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,493
Bring her here,
and make her kneel in front of me!

284
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,994
Just stop, will you?

285
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,372
Is Mr. Kang cheating on her?

286
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,791
Oh my goodness. What the heck is this?

287
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,167
I wonder who she is.

288
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,878
-That's impressive.
-Yeah.

289
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,901
What is it? What's wrong?

290
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,116
Ma'am…

291
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,412
What you two just talked about
was broadcast over the speakers.

292
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:00,777
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

293
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,529
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

294
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,745
Get lost.

295
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:11,997
All of you, get out!

296
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,341
People are going to
start talking about your affair.

297
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,718
We need to stop them.

298
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:28,388
Come on, do something!

299
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:29,973
How am I supposed to do anything?

300
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:31,767
So?

301
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,269
You're not going to do anything?

302
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,111
Where are you going?

303
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,768
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

304
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,688
How dare you show your face here?

305
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,732
Am I not allowed to celebrate?
I thought we used to be friends.

306
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,111
You're amazing, Ms. Han.

307
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,759
It was her.

308
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,680
She put the microphone in my bag
and broadcasted it all over the store.

309
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,765
-Stop it.
-Stop what?

310
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,726
You don't know how insane she is.

311
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,271
She keeps messing with me
and then disappearing.

312
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,022
She's totally crazy!

313
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:02,274
Just stop it!

314
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,403
Why are you yelling at me?

315
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:11,116
She's the one who told me
that you were having an affair with her.

316
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:12,033
Did you know that?

317
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,537
She told me first
that you were cheating on me,

318
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,665
and that you two slept together.

319
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,459
She's playing with us right now!

320
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,380
Are you crazy?

321
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:27,841
Let go!

322
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,502
Da-bi.

323
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,088
Don't cry. It's Dad.

324
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,965
Were you scared?

325
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,843
Come here, my baby.

326
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,349
It's okay, Da-bi. Don't cry, okay?

327
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,683
I'm sorry, Da-bi.

328
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,853
She announced that she's
the CEO of the mall

329
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,190
right in front of Yoon-gyeom.

330
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,942
Yoon-gyeom's betrayed his entire family.

331
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,860
His father-in-law hit you, Dad,

332
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,946
and his wife completely
ruined my reputation.

333
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,281
Are you really going to
do nothing about him, Dad?

334
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:37,118
She's basically telling Chi-gyeom
to go and die by stealing the mall.

335
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,954
How am I supposed to live now?

336
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,997
My brother's wife took what's mine.

337
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,041
I completely lost face!

338
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,003
Sir.

339
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,882
Ms. Seol is in critical condition
at the hospital.

340
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:54,219
The director of the hospital
just called me.

341
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,304
What?

342
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,898
Mrs. Han, I'm here.

343
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,109
Mrs. Han!

344
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,070
Mrs. Han, are you all right?

345
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,490
I'll go get the first aid kit, ma'am.

346
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,221
Now I know

347
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:41,474
why you wanted Mr. Kang's love so badly.

348
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,353
Your birthday was our first day.

349
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,106
I must say, your husband is quite a catch.

350
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,858
You've finally lost it, haven't you?

351
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,402
Oh no.

352
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:53,987
You're bleeding.

353
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,781
Why don't you run to your daddy
and tell him that I did it?

354
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,284
Should I do it for you?

355
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,043
For goodness' sake.

356
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,796
I wish I could just…

357
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:18,470
stop thinking about her.

358
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,559
I'm Han So-ra.

359
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,020
Han So-ra.

360
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,070
I'm Han So-ra, aren't I?

361
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,031
She's nothing.

362
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:44,329
She means nothing to me.

363
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:53,963
You know,

364
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,009
no matter what happens,

365
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,597
I'm never going to
let my dad control me again.

366
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,059
The Classroom…

367
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,312
is a living hell.

368
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,317
So-ra.

369
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,302
I'm going to protect my marriage

370
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,389
and live a good life, no matter what.

371
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,338
Did you really tell So-ra about us?

372
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,844
And did you announce my secret
at the event?

373
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:24,554
"Secret"?

374
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,266
So I'm your secret now?

375
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,101
That's not what I'm saying!

376
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,022
It is.

377
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,483
You're embarrassed and angry
because people know about me.

378
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,611
You wanted to keep me hidden
and only meet me when you wanted to.

379
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,821
There's a reason
why I kept you hidden away.

380
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,073
I tried my best to be together with you.

381
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,159
I did things
that were completely ridiculous!

382
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:48,077
Now what? What else do I need to do?

383
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:48,995
Oh.

384
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,289
So that's your best?

385
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,458
You want to keep me
as your little mistress?

386
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,211
Well, I'm not planning
on becoming your mistress.

387
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,213
So if that's all you have, then get lost.

388
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,464
Watch your mouth.

389
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:00,757
Why?

390
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,801
If I put it differently, will this change
from a horror to a romance?

391
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,386
Chaebols aren't anything special.

392
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,432
You think that you were chosen by God
because you have some money.

393
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,767
And whose money is that?

394
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,769
Where did you get it from?

395
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,105
You want to pay me
with a house for sleeping with you?

396
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,490
Well, I'm the one who had fun doing it.

397
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,742
So I should be the one
paying you for the night.

398
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,786
Don't make me angrier than I already am.

399
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,376
Did you have fun
while meeting me in secret?

400
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,128
I hate men who are scared of their wives.

401
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,133
You think you'll be able to
see me again after doing this?

402
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:46,052
Probably not.

403
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:48,930
People even cut off
from their own parents when they get mad.

404
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:55,061
This isn't what I kept seeing you for.

405
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,859
So I'm the one who did this to us?

406
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:06,948
Right.

407
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,201
We both have
our own troubles to deal with.

408
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,871
Perhaps I was being too greedy.

409
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,664
Let's…

410
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,043
never see each other again.

411
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,095
Mr. Kang.

412
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,121
I'm sorry.

413
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:18,937
See?

414
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:22,774
You're not the one who can decide
if we're going to see each other.

415
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:24,317
It's me.

416
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:28,905
Wait for me to make a decision.

417
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,450
Now, leave.

418
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,466
LA-EL

419
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:58,726
You're more precious to me than myself.

420
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,481
I love you.

421
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,990
PRIME MINISTER HAN

422
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,623
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister.

423
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,625
I was going to call you.

424
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:25,420
People are talking about
the conflict between your two families.

425
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,172
Yes. Actually, I need your help

426
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,425
regarding that problem.

427
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,969
I'm going to teach them a lesson.

428
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,139
Since the carrot didn't work,
I'll need to use the stick.

429
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,855
As long as you don't touch Sun-bin,

430
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,232
I'll do anything that you want.

431
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:48,568
-Just don't hurt her.
-Why should I listen to you?

432
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,988
What are you going to do with Sun-bin?

433
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:54,365
I'm going to tell my dad about her.

434
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,533
I don't know what'll happen after that.

435
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,952
You can't.

436
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,912
Sun-bin will get hurt.

437
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,792
Did you tell Mr. Han about her?

438
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:05,710
Did you?

439
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,547
Tell her to come and kneel in front of me.

440
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,302
Just do it to me.

441
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:15,845
Do it to me, not Sun-bin!

442
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,517
I'm going golfing with my dad.

443
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,894
What? Am I not allowed to?

444
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,187
Fine.

445
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,355
You can have the shopping mall.

446
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,610
You aren't going to make me the director?

447
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:32,987
I guess that's all I mean to you.

448
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,865
I'm going to talk with my dad about this.

449
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,991
Fine.

450
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,244
Just leave Sun-bin alone.

451
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,663
I'll make you the director.

452
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,380
There's a reason why
I kept you hidden away.

453
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,591
I tried my best to be together with you.

454
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,676
I did things
that were completely ridiculous!

455
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,762
Now what? What else do I need to do?

456
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,693
I have some information
to give you about Mr. Kang.

457
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,028
Let's meet.

458
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,600
I'm sorry about that day.

459
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:47,228
I got too agitated.

460
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:51,399
I'm here to talk to you about something.

461
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,278
Ex-Prime Minister Han

462
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,989
might threaten you with the slush fund.

463
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,200
He's trying to get
some of the company shares.

464
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,287
How did you know about that?

465
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:07,290
Chief Secretary Seo told me.

466
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,332
Why did he do that?

467
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,710
Because he knows
that I'm worried about you.

468
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,719
Are you going to go
to the U.S. with Jin-wook?

469
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,179
What'll happen to us then?

470
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,307
Have you made your decision?

471
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,391
I have.

472
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,150
SECRETARY CHA

473
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:36,652
What?

474
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:39,572
Ms. Seol is in critical condition.

475
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,494
Seol Gyeong-ok, the wife of Kang Bon-geun,

476
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,955
who had been bedridden
for nearly eight years,

477
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,707
was reported to be in critical condition

478
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,751
due to pneumonia
caused by a secondary infection.

479
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,420
She has been attached to an ECMO machine…

480
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,589
Chairman Kang has left
to his father's house.

481
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,467
Yoon-gyeom went to his dad's place?

482
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,843
Without me?

483
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,178
I confirmed with Secretary Cha.

484
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,764
He should have taken me too.

485
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,599
They are transporting her to their home--

486
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,149
Why did you go by yourself?
We should have gone together.

487
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,985
What's Mr. Kang and Chi-gyeom saying?

488
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,487
Would it be okay for me to go?

489
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,988
Don't come.

490
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,157
I'm talking with my family.

491
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,868
What about my dad then?
He should go at least.

492
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,412
I'll go with my dad then.

493
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,998
It's better than going alone
and getting all of the blame.

494
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,541
I'll call you back.

495
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,975
You said your journey so far
hasn't been easy,

496
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,395
but you don't know
what else will happen either.

497
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:58,276
Only your family will help you

498
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,404
when you're in true danger.

499
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:04,824
Even if you only share
half of their blood.

500
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,752
I know how much pain you're going through.

501
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,672
You're so desperate to be healed

502
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:23,509
that you even relied
on that bandoneon, didn't you?

503
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,680
This might end up being

504
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,350
a part of your healing process.

505
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,525
Just think about the future.

506
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,125
I've never seen you drink before.

507
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,753
Do you want something weaker?

508
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,713
Where is it? I'll get it.

509
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,840
No, I'll go get it.

510
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,313
I think Mr. Kang

511
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,649
knows about So-ra's murders.

512
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,402
He's worried that Pan-ro might hurt me

513
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,280
if he finds out about me.

514
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,535
That means that
So-ra, Pan-ro, and Jeong-chul

515
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,372
have all involved themselves with murders.

516
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,084
It's time for me
to face Pan-ro and Jeong-chul

517
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,962
as Chairman Kang's lover.

518
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,256
La-el. If those people
find out about you--

519
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,591
Lee La-el

520
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,303
died 13 years ago.

521
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,766
I don't care if they find out.
I'm not scared at all.

522
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,354
I'm going to get my revenge,

523
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:03,609
and I'm going to make it a lot more cruel

524
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,404
than what they did to me.

525
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,561
You told me to feel pressured
to keep on living, right?

526
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:45,234
I have warm blood running through my veins
and a beating heart

527
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,403
just like anybody else.

528
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,406
But unfortunately,

529
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:53,784
I can't hold anything in them.

530
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:01,000
I don't want to feel guilty
because of you.

531
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,627
So, no matter what happens to me,

532
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,173
please don't feel guilty because of me.

533
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:12,803
Even if…

534
00:41:14,847 --> 00:41:17,266
you've become a different person,

535
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,685
I can still see all of your worries.

536
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,355
You're wrong if you think
that this will change my mind.

537
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:27,359
I'll wait until your heart
becomes warm again.

538
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:31,447
I'm going to stay by your side
even after everybody else leaves.

539
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:43,501
Seol Gyeong-ok,
the wife of the initial Chairman of LY

540
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,253
and the eldest daughter
of Hyeonyoung, has died.

541
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,505
Ms. Seol…

542
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,883
How dare they tell you about
your mother-in-law's death over the news?

543
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:56,639
Let's just go, Dad.

544
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,974
We'd be giving them
an opening to strike if we don't.

545
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,477
They'll say that we didn't go
to the funeral because of the shares.

546
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,229
Then it'll be our fault, not theirs.

547
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,651
Fine, let's go.

548
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,320
But we're bringing Chief Prosecutor Ahn

549
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,864
and all of his subordinate prosecutors.

550
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,991
He was the special prosecutor
for LY's slush funds, wasn't he?

551
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:19,036
We need to bring someone like him
to intimidate them properly.

552
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,680
REST IN PEACE

553
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,119
Dad.

554
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,891
That's Chief Prosecutor Ahn, isn't he?

555
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,234
Mr. Kang.

556
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,696
Mr. Kang…

557
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:42,953
Ms. Seol cared for me
and loved me so much.

558
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,499
I'm heartbroken to have to
say goodbye to her like this, Mr. Kang.

559
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,837
Ms. Seol!

560
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,881
Cut the bullshit.

561
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,092
Are you pretending to be
a good daughter-in-law?

562
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,512
I don't think it's too late for you
to become an actress.

563
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,606
Chi-gyeom.

564
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,274
Soo-jung.

565
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,985
We're here to
lay Ms. Seol to rest, aren't we?

566
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:16,779
We're family. We should stick together.

567
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:19,573
Whatever.

568
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,702
Let's go take care of Da-bi.

569
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,582
Da-bi!

570
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,834
Here, Ms. Yoon!

571
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,222
Ms. Kim!

572
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,228
Thank you for coming, Mr. Seo.

573
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,648
Thank you.

574
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,029
May Ms. Seol rest in peace.

575
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:02,157
Chief Secretary Seo.

576
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,911
Thank you for coming all the way here.

577
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,456
She's like a sister to me.

578
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,209
She came with me
because she knows your granddaughter.

579
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,547
I'm sure that you must be heartbroken.

580
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,841
I would like to offer you
a sincere word of comfort.

581
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,419
Honey.

582
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,004
You remember back
at the luxury goods event

583
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:00,090
when So-ra fought with Yoon-gyeom
because he was cheating on her?

584
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,383
Isn't that her?

585
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:04,261
Right?

586
00:46:04,761 --> 00:46:06,889
I've been suspicious
ever since the CL event.

587
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:10,392
Yoon-gyeom has high standards.

588
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,351
That crazy bastard.

589
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,197
What? Are you angry?

590
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,991
Well, I feel a hundred times worse

591
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,202
than you do right now.

592
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:31,079
That sounds like

593
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,791
you brought that woman here
even though you know everything.

594
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,266
I'll get Da-bi.

595
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,162
Get lost.

596
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,544
What do you think you're doing here?

597
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:20,504
Get lost now.

598
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,478
It's okay, Da-bi.

599
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,272
Don't cry.

600
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,484
What the hell are you doing?

601
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:46,113
Whose side are you on?

602
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,578
What is it?

603
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:04,756
What's going on?

604
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:11,597
I'll tell you about it privately, sir.

605
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,267
Honey.

606
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,375
Tell me.

607
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:42,794
I asked you a question.

608
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,653
By the way,

609
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:09,613
why haven't you told your dad about me?

610
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,948
Should I do it for you?

611
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:15,827
I think Mr. Kang is waiting.

612
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,245
You should go, sir.

613
00:49:22,751 --> 00:49:23,960
Have you lost your mind?

614
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:24,878
Shut up.

615
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,050
I…

616
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,552
didn't tell him about that.

617
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,643
It looks like

618
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,938
your daughter is keeping
a lot of secrets from you, sir.

619
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:44,940
What secrets?

620
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,281
What the hell is she doing?

621
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,449
Sun-bin.

622
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,954
Let’s go. I have somewhere else to be.

623
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,128
I'll be going then.

624
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,824
LAWSUIT INITIATION CEREMONY
FOR THE LY VICTIMS GROUP

625
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,416
The president of the LY Victims Group,

626
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,335
Ms. Jang, has arrived.

627
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,738
I'm Jang Moon-hee.

628
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,950
I would like to honor
the 31 litigators' patience

629
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,661
for waiting through
the long preparation period

630
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:26,124
and the courage of the law firm Unseo.

631
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:30,170
In addition, thank you for adhering
to the confidentiality clause.

632
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:31,713
From now on,

633
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,383
I'm going to stand on the front lines.

634
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,270
You son of a bitch.

635
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:50,106
You've been acting crazy
because of a girl?

636
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:55,111
You really lost your mind
because of some woman?

637
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,616
Find out who he was having an affair with.

638
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,326
Yes, sir.

639
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,263
MR. KANG

640
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,139
Answer it.

641
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:45,453
You said you made
your decision, didn't you?

642
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:49,666
Could you give me your answer now?

643
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,712
No matter how harsh you may act toward me,

644
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:56,464
I know that you were being genuine

645
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,550
when you sent me to the funeral.

646
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,512
I want to know

647
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,432
what you really want.

648
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,357
I don't want to be hidden anymore.

649
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,612
I want to be…

650
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:24,492
your woman instead of Ms. Han.

651
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:01,571
All that I remember from my youth

652
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:04,908
is getting whipped for no reason

653
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,495
and the fear of being forced to survive.

654
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:21,841
I'm on thin ice
with my brother and father.

655
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,220
I also don't know what Mr. Han will do.

656
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,138
I need to be careful.

657
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,099
Do the company shares come first

658
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,102
even when your mother has passed away?

659
00:54:32,185 --> 00:54:34,312
I've never thought of her as my mother.

660
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,440
I don't share
a single drop of blood with her,

661
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,901
and she's always been so cold to me.

662
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,697
Mother.

663
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:46,533
Mother!

664
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,122
They all have
their own reasons to hate me.

665
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,627
You bastard.

666
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,878
Kneel down!

667
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,589
Your mother was a lowly woman,
and so are you.

668
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,341
Your children won't be any different.

669
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,260
I took you in
so you could support Chi-gyeom

670
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,178
since he lacks in health and ability.

671
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,347
I didn't take you in
so you could step over your brother.

672
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,852
You said you wanted
to be the king, didn't you?

673
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:17,063
You've gotten what you wanted already.

674
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,400
This might end up being

675
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,112
a part of your healing process.

676
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:44,841
It's not easy being
a part of a businessman's family.

677
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:48,261
There are many obstacles in the way.

678
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:52,599
But we must not forget
that we're a family.

679
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:57,228
Let's comfort each other
after losing Gyeong-ok,

680
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,066
and use it as an opportunity to grow.

681
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,297
Honey.

682
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,134
We need to talk.

683
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,351
Don't you think that living like this

684
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,062
is meaningless?

685
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,901
What do you mean?

686
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,737
I've always done
what I was supposed to do.

687
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:50,865
Now that Mr. Han
knows about me and Sun-bin,

688
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,078
I'll have more things to do tomorrow.

689
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,708
Honey.

690
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:04,587
I'm tired.

691
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,259
I want to stop doing the things
I'm supposed to do.

692
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,264
I want to live my life
doing what I want to do.

693
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,354
What are you saying?

694
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,863
Never mind. I don't want to hear it.
You're too tired right now.

695
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,823
You're not in your right mind
after your mother's death.

696
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,616
Just rest for now.

697
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,952
You'll be able to think straight
after you've gotten some sleep.

698
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,831
No. My head has never been clearer.

699
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,216
Let's break up.

700
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:54,679
We should split up now.

701
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,583
-There you go.
-Let’s take a picture.

702
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:25,251
One, two, three.

703
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:30,256
Happy birthday, La-el.

704
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,759
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday, La-el.

705
00:58:33,468 --> 00:58:34,594
Here.

706
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,138
It's your present!

707
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,983
It's so pretty, Mom.

708
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:51,736
I'll put in
a new family picture every year.

709
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,363
It looks great.

710
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,159
I'm so happy right now.

711
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,203
I wish it could be my birthday every day.

712
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:12,590
I'm not changing my mind
no matter how many times we talk about it.

713
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,344
We're getting a divorce.

714
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:56,301
Do you still not understand?

715
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,052
I'm going to kill you.

716
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,888
Why are you packing your clothes?
Where do you think you're going?

717
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,890
-No way, you're not going anywhere!
-Please!

718
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:04,392
Don't you dare lay a finger on me.

719
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:05,727
I'm tracking her.

720
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,145
Do not lose her.

721
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,896
Shoot as soon as you confirm the address.

722
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:11,149
Come out!

723
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,191
Hey, Jeong-chul.

724
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,360
Sun-bin is like family to me.

725
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,446
This isn't a negotiation. It's a threat.

726
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:19,490
I started loving you
because you were so much like me,

727
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:22,076
and now I can't live without you.
