1
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,422
Are you all right?

4
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm sure you have
mixed feelings toward Mr. Kang.

5
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:56,890
I understand.

6
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,893
But let's end all of this
first and foremost.

7
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,229
After that, we'll find a solution
one way or another.

8
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,695
I have a great plan, actually.

9
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,990
When I said I would pardon
only one of them,

10
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,619
I was using the prisoner's dilemma.

11
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:22,582
You want to make the criminals

12
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,794
suspect each other?

13
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,630
Kang Yoon-gyeom, Han Pan-ro,
Han So-ra, and Kim Jeong-chul.

14
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,176
We know exactly how they work.

15
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,928
We'll make them attack each other,

16
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,263
using their desires to trap them.

17
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,933
They'll fall for it, no doubt.

18
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,396
And La-el,

19
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,857
you've gotten so thin.

20
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,785
Is there a future that you've pictured
after all this is over?

21
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:02,580
I've never thought about it.

22
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,332
Well, it will all end soon.

23
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,418
Maybe you should start thinking about it.

24
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,423
I wonder…

25
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,176
what my future holds.

26
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,685
What about you, Mr. Seo?

27
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,687
Well…

28
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,816
I want to cook
a warm meal for you at home.

29
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,903
What matters to us the most

30
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,782
are the small things, don't you think?

31
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,504
Mr. Kang is going to appear
at the hearing.

32
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,964
Are you sure?

33
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:39,260
The head of a chaebol has never appeared
in a public hearing before.

34
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,596
LY Group is also in a state of chaos.

35
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,097
Mr. Kang himself

36
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,725
told the prosecutors
that he would appear at the hearing.

37
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,479
That means he'll reveal himself
being prosecuted to the media.

38
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:51,231
What's his strategy?

39
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,108
Is he trying to influence the hearing
by using the press?

40
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:55,026
Or…

41
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,654
is he trying to use his own presence

42
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,864
to put pressure on the prosecution?

43
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,200
What is he trying to do?

44
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:10,833
Tell him to come.

45
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,544
Whatever he does,

46
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,048
he won't be able to beat
somebody who's prepared to die.

47
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,314
Mr. Kang, why did you come here in person?

48
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,733
Is Ms. Kim Sun-bin
the same person as Ms. Lee La-el?

49
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,443
-Please give us a statement.
-Can you give a statement?

50
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,778
Please give a statement.

51
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:43,825
It's Lee La-el.

52
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,248
-Mr. Kang, could you give us a statement?
-Please give a statement.

53
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:56,587
Ms. Lee, is it true that you were
romantically involved with Mr. Kang?

54
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:00,633
Please give us a statement.

55
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,056
Were you two lovers?

56
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,857
Please look this way.

57
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,652
Ms. Lee, the chairman of LY
will be at the hearing.

58
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,238
Will there be any changes
to your original lawsuit?

59
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:28,578
Yes.

60
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,205
I have some further charges to disclose.

61
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,166
Kang Yoon-gyeom,

62
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,668
Han Pan-ro, Han So-ra, and Kim Jeong-chul.

63
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,297
Under Article 250 of the Criminal Law,

64
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,007
I would like to accuse the four of murder.

65
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,925
-Murder?
-Murder?

66
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,552
Miss, declaring unproven facts like that

67
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,929
goes against the principle
of presumption of innocence.

68
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,351
They tortured my father,

69
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,604
Lee Tae-joon, the CEO of GEDIKS,

70
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,189
and forcibly took his company from him.

71
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,524
Kim Jeong-chul administered the torture,

72
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,069
and those who ordered it
were Han Pan-ro and Han So-ra,

73
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:04,322
as well as Kang Yoon-gyeom.

74
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,161
It was a premeditated murder.

75
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,662
Mr. Kang, is that statement true?

76
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,749
Mr. Kang, did you know
that this would be a criminal trial?

77
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,626
Mr. Kang, please give us a comment.

78
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,795
Ms. Lee!

79
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,713
Wait, please give us one more statement.

80
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,383
-Wait.
-Please move aside.

81
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,135
Just one more statement!

82
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,475
Is what she said true?

83
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:44,112
The severe compound fractures
resulted in nerve and muscle damage.

84
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:46,739
We performed another operation
but there is a high chance

85
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,283
of permanent disability
due to nerve damage.

86
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,244
Permanent disability?

87
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,541
My leg!

88
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,835
What will I do with my leg?

89
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,796
I can never walk normally again.

90
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,632
Why did this have to happen to me?

91
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,467
Calm down. We'll look for a solution.

92
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,052
How am I supposed to calm down?

93
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,180
She crushed my damn leg!

94
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,558
I can't let her get away with this.

95
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,685
I want her leg crushed
just as she did with mine.

96
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,602
Please, Mr. Han.

97
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,980
Sir, I have some bad news.

98
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:22,233
Lee La-el accused you of murder
in front of the courthouse.

99
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,318
She mentioned you,
Chairman Kang, Mrs. Han,

100
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,237
and you, Mr. Kim.

101
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,239
That crazy lunatic!

102
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,199
Are you hearing this?

103
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,577
On top of that,
Chairman Kang went to appear at the court.

104
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,495
Why the hell did he go there?

105
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,039
Why, when I'm trying to
take care of things here?

106
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,916
Call all of our legal teams right now!

107
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,085
Where are you going?

108
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,795
What about me? What about my leg?

109
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,298
You'll crush that bitch, won't you?

110
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:46,215
Damn it.

111
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:48,092
Just shut up and get your treatment!

112
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,470
Yoon-gyeom, that bastard.

113
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,388
Mr. Han!

114
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:59,187
This case was filed by the plaintiff
and leader of the LY Victims Group,

115
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,523
Lee La-el, against the defendant,
Kang Yoon-gyeom.

116
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,359
The case is both
a civil and criminal case.

117
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,236
The range of the compensation will vary

118
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,864
depending on the outcome
of the criminal trial.

119
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,949
In order to settle
on an amount for the compensation,

120
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,203
we must wait until a verdict
is released for the criminal case.

121
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,080
Ms. Lee, do you agree?

122
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:22,919
I wish to submit additional evidence
to prove the defendants' crimes.

123
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,547
Even so, we still need to wait
for the verdict of the criminal case.

124
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,759
I can see why Mr. Kang is here.

125
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,762
I think he's trying to buy some time.

126
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,766
No matter what the verdict is
for the criminal case,

127
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,851
I'll reach an agreement
desired by the plaintiff.

128
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:45,149
Mr. Kang.

129
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,026
What you said is not in our favor.

130
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,736
Mr. Kang.

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,906
It sounds like you haven't
discussed this with your attorneys.

132
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,324
Could you say that again?

133
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,369
I'll consult with Ms. Lee's lawsuit.

134
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,579
In that case,
a mediation will be possible.

135
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,248
Ms. Lee.

136
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,791
Do you accept the mediation?

137
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:07,296
What if he has an ulterior motive?

138
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,763
I accept.

139
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,351
All right, then.

140
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,853
We'll set a mediation date
for the two of you.

141
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,236
Mr. Kang.

142
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,822
You don't have to agree to a settlement.

143
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,449
If you do that,
the criminal lawsuit will be even worse.

144
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:36,951
I can take care of it.

145
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,644
Kang Yoon-gyeom,

146
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,396
Han Pan-ro, Han So-ra, and Kim Jeong-chul.

147
00:10:05,479 --> 00:10:08,274
I would like to accuse the four of murder.

148
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,567
What the hell are they doing?

149
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,402
Why are they together even at court?

150
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,738
Are they magnets or what?

151
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,747
Ma'am, what's worse is
that she just accused you of murder--

152
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,720
That drink is too strong.
You could get seriously sick, ma'am.

153
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,853
No matter what I do,
they find a way back to each other.

154
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,731
What are they, twins?

155
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,567
Will only death drive them apart?

156
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,819
Is that what it is?

157
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,621
DR. JUNG

158
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,377
What's my dad doing?

159
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,464
Why is he letting La-el
do whatever the hell she wants?

160
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,174
This is pissing me off.

161
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:01,554
Do-wan.

162
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:03,764
Meet me at the studio.

163
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,182
Yes, ma'am.

164
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,587
How did you…

165
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,507
How did you find out about this place?

166
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:45,055
How did you get in here?

167
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,307
At this point,

168
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,018
you should've realized

169
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,645
that I know everything about you.

170
00:12:55,733 --> 00:13:00,070
I've been preparing this for 13 years.

171
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,879
Get the hell out of here.

172
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,051
Sit.

173
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,651
You're underestimating our family.

174
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,695
You won't get out of this alive.

175
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,822
Kim Jeong-chul
has a permanent disability now,

176
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:48,327
and your dad is forming
an escape plan for himself.

177
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,082
And you saw how
Mr. Kang is trying to appease me

178
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,668
to find a way out.

179
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,009
The only one isolated without a plan

180
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,428
is you, So-ra.

181
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,267
It looks like you'll be blamed

182
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:14,562
for all the murders too.

183
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,822
You're losing places to go to,

184
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,241
and you have nobody to lean on.

185
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,535
You'll be destroyed in no time.

186
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:31,954
How sad.

187
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,667
Don't give me that crap.

188
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,131
I like that we have something in common.

189
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,508
We both know that fear…

190
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,470
is more terrifying when it's creeping up,

191
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,641
not right when something bad happens.

192
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,020
Real terror doesn't come
right when something bad happens.

193
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:58,397
What's really scary…

194
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,859
is feeling it creeping up on you.

195
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,905
You shouldn't have made so many enemies

196
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,949
while getting what you wanted.

197
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,454
When you're angry enough,

198
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:20,127
you don't even feel
the strongest of pains.

199
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,382
Now that my parents and I
have shown blood,

200
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:27,384
it's time for you

201
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,387
to pay back with your blood.

202
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,682
I'll pour your blood on my father's grave

203
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,477
to let him know that you've died.

204
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:42,149
I won't stop until this world…

205
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:45,736
runs red with your blood.

206
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:32,324
LEE TAE-JOON

207
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:37,454
Dad.

208
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,249
Mr. Lee.

209
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,212
I'm sorry I haven't been able
to get your revenge for so long.

210
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,214
But we're almost there.

211
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,342
Please wait just a little longer.

212
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,139
And don't worry too much about La-el.

213
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,434
I'll be with her until the very end.

214
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,322
When you start the mediation process,

215
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,285
you'll have to meet with Mr. Kang
one-on-one.

216
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,705
Will you be all right?

217
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,752
It's something I have to do.

218
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,422
All right.

219
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,880
This mediation is separate
from the LY Victims Group's lawsuit.

220
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,341
As the inheritor,
this is for the compensation

221
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,427
regarding the victims,
who are Lee Tae-joon, your father,

222
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,138
and Kim Jin-sook, your mother.

223
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,766
Is that correct, Ms. Lee?

224
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,434
That's correct.

225
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,022
And you're willing to settle, Mr. Kang?

226
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:29,024
Yes, I am.

227
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:32,861
Ms. Lee, aside from Mr. Kang,
you're also suing

228
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,281
Han So-ra, Han Pan-ro, and Kim Jeong-chul.

229
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:39,952
The problem is that those three
are not willing to settle.

230
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,830
I'll make sure that they settle.

231
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,916
The attorneys for
the three defendants are claiming

232
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:50,337
that much of the evidence submitted by you
was illegally collected,

233
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:53,507
and therefore cannot be
accepted as evidence.

234
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:57,427
The circumstances under which they were
collected are found to be illegal.

235
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,264
You were involved in identity theft,
personal data infringement,

236
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,849
illegal recording, and more.

237
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,351
The evidence cannot be used in the hearing

238
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,645
as you got the information
under false pretenses.

239
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,857
I lost my parents when I was 15 years old.

240
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,901
I had nothing,

241
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,988
and nobody listened to me.

242
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:19,533
It was the only way to get the truth out.

243
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,373
As a young girl without any other options,

244
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,543
even legitimacy was a luxury
that I couldn't afford.

245
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:40,888
Furthermore…

246
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,475
not all of it was a lie.

247
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,231
Ms. Lee.

248
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,110
Your mother, Ms. Kim Jin-sook,
who's among the victims,

249
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,153
is currently missing

250
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,989
and not confirmed as dead.

251
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:01,992
The criminal trial to determine
the exact circumstances is ongoing.

252
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,537
The problem is, the verdict for that
hasn't been decided yet,

253
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,165
so it's difficult
to reach a settlement on these matters.

254
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:12,878
I wish to apologize to the plaintiff

255
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,505
by ending the civil trial…

256
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,343
as soon as possible.

257
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:24,139
Therefore, I wish to reach a settlement
under the premise

258
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,850
that her claims have a basis.

259
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,061
Even though there's no evidence

260
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,438
to prove Ms. Kim's death?

261
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,607
I will retrieve my mother's
personal belongings

262
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,151
and submit them
as evidence to prove her death.

263
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,655
Even then, are you sure
you can prove her death?

264
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,658
As the settlement
is important in mediation,

265
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,159
I'll check the evidence myself.

266
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,620
All right.

267
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,122
I'll see you both
at the next mediation then.

268
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,759
If not all of it was a lie,

269
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:04,054
then which part was true?

270
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,601
Why does that matter?

271
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,479
Does it have anything to do
with the settlement?

272
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,190
I'm leaving.

273
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:19,361
I need to hurry if I want to get
my mother's belongings and submit them.

274
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,612
I'll check them myself.

275
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:24,408
That way, you can skip the paperwork
when you submit them.

276
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,368
Let me come with you.

277
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,290
I'll check this person again
and report back to you.

278
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,457
-All right.
-Yes, sir.

279
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:38,630
KIM HYEON-CHUL

280
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,470
Hello, Hyeon-chul.

281
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,471
What is it?

282
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:48,265
I was told that they can't allow us

283
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,767
to take Ms. Kim's personal belongings.

284
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:54,563
Han Pan-ro has raised an issue
with La-el's identity being fraudulent.

285
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:19,588
What are you talking about?

286
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,924
I'm sorry, but we can't give them to you.

287
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:27,179
Mr. Han's party suddenly
turned it into a legal issue.

288
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,723
The supervising office
took your mother's personal belongings.

289
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,850
I got permission
from the Public Interest Law Center.

290
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,686
We're also trying to figure out
how to handle the situation.

291
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,023
If you could wait just a moment,
I'll let you know.

292
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:21,441
Why are you still wearing that ring?

293
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,610
I didn't have a chance to take it off.

294
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:26,446
You had the perfect chance
when you found out who I am.

295
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,240
I put it on because I love you,

296
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,535
so I'll take it off
when I stop loving you.

297
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:35,247
Just because I dislike you…

298
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,792
doesn't mean that I don't
love you anymore.

299
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:40,877
Don't you think so?

300
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:45,924
Can I ask you something?

301
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,927
I really believed in the twin flame.

302
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,055
I saw myself reflected in your scars,

303
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,642
and even though we're like this,
I felt like we were connected.

304
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,020
Was your love for me…

305
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,024
ever sincere?

306
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:12,951
You can supposedly communicate
wordlessly with your twin flame.

307
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,371
And in a situation of life or death,

308
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,000
you can find each other
no matter where you are.

309
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,590
But that's not true with us.

310
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,051
I approached you to ruin your life.

311
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,012
Fate had nothing to do with that.

312
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,442
Mr. Seo.

313
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:47,527
I'm sorry.

314
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,279
I didn't realize you'd be coming.

315
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,782
This is the paperwork proving
that Ms. Lee is the rightful heir.

316
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,242
There's nothing wrong with the paperwork,

317
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,786
so why is the supervising office
not giving her permission?

318
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,913
You see…

319
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,624
Mr. Han was putting
so much pressure on us.

320
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,752
I just don't have that much power, so…

321
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:06,671
So you do things

322
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,759
with force instead of principle?

323
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:14,137
Perhaps I should, too?

324
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,399
The final approval has been given.

325
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,735
Your mother's final video
is on the flash drive.

326
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,912
STORAGE BOX
KIM JIN-SOOK

327
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:38,471
I put on another protest today.

328
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,767
Yoon-gyeom, going to work.

329
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,732
INVESTIGATE THE WRONGFUL DEATH
OF GEDIKS'S LEE TAE-JOON!

330
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:54,279
Han Pan-ro and Kim Jeong-chul,
frequenting the company building.

331
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,532
Every time I see their lively faces,

332
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,118
it feels like my heart
is being torn apart.

333
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,538
What are you waiting for? Get rid of that.

334
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,085
I get trampled on every day.

335
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,172
Nobody listens to me,

336
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:16,509
but this is the only way
I can keep living.

337
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,429
Life…

338
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,140
is hell.

339
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,440
TO LA-EL

340
00:27:30,523 --> 00:27:31,941
Anorexia?

341
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,443
Self-harm?

342
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,988
I never wanted you
to go through such things.

343
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,158
My heart is bleeding for you.

344
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,786
I'm so sorry I couldn't protect you.

345
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:48,083
Erase the memories
of your father's torture, La-el.

346
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:51,461
You can't live with that in your heart.

347
00:27:52,045 --> 00:27:53,546
I'll carry all of the burden,

348
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:55,465
so you just forget.

349
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,720
We've got two of the biggest lovebirds
in the country here.

350
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,806
We're in front of
Ms. Han So-ra's residence.

351
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,141
Her husband, Mr. Kang Yoon-gyeom,

352
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,144
is the heir of LY Group,
which will soon acquire GEDIKS

353
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,687
and become a global enterprise.

354
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:24,994
You evil bastards!

355
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,044
You bastards!

356
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,171
Mom…

357
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,883
How can you live so happily
after killing a man?

358
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,928
You should be punished!

359
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:46,266
Kang Yoon-gyeom and Han Pan-ro.

360
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:47,726
You murderers!

361
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,478
I hope you go to hell.

362
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,022
I had no idea…

363
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,569
that she lived in so much pain…

364
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,363
because of me.

365
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,908
You were so young back then.

366
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,830
I can't even ask for forgiveness.

367
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,958
I'm so sorry.

368
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,505
Exactly.

369
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,466
I want you to die for what you've done!

370
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,555
I'll do anything.

371
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,435
If I really must die…

372
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,774
I will.

373
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,891
Wait in the car.

374
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:25,907
Mr. Seo.

375
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,120
What am I supposed to do now?

376
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,333
Please tell me.

377
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:46,094
I acknowledge all of the damages
brought by the LY Victims Group.

378
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:49,597
GEDIKS was the target of an M&A.

379
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,892
We proposed a merger 13 years ago,
which was rejected.

380
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:56,479
Then there was a plot
to take the company by force.

381
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,941
In the process, Mr. Lee Tae-joon,
the CEO at the time,

382
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,111
unfortunately lost his life.

383
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,238
He died due to complications
acquired during torture,

384
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,406
and it was a murder.

385
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,491
There was definitely a hidden agenda

386
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,953
behind the death of his wife, Ms. Kim,
and Ms. Jang Moon-hee.

387
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:17,625
And thus,
an investigation must be conducted.

388
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,294
Yoon-gyeom, come out here.

389
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,545
Come out!

390
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:24,591
Chairman Kang is not here.

391
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,134
I know he's up there.

392
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,468
Come here, you punk!

393
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,095
We don't know where he is, sir.

394
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,555
Get him out of here.

395
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,141
-Please leave.
-Do you not know who I am?

396
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:34,851
I'm going to kill you all.

397
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:36,978
Yoon-gyeom, come out, you bastard!

398
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:37,979
I said, come out!

399
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,690
In the process, Mr. Lee Tae-joon,
the CEO at the time,

400
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,984
unfortunately lost his life.

401
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,236
He died due to complications
acquired during torture,

402
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,279
and it was a murder.

403
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:48,323
What? A murder?

404
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,409
That bastard is out to get me, isn't he?

405
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:52,744
Does he think I'm an idiot?

406
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,580
Everybody's ganging up on me now,
aren't they?

407
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,667
Mr. Han, have you seen the news?

408
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:00,585
He--

409
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,046
Shut your goddamn mouth, you idiot!

410
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,173
Mr. Han.

411
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,591
Mr. Han!

412
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,016
Damn it.

413
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,062
Who's here?

414
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:21,940
The police are here
to investigate you, ma'am.

415
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,447
After Chairman Kang's press conference,

416
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:32,033
the murders of Jang Moon-hee
and Kim Jin-sook were filed as well.

417
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,954
Tell them I don't know anything.

418
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,330
I mean, why me?

419
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,582
I didn't do anything.

420
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,960
A voice recording
that will become crucial evidence

421
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:43,753
was reported to the police.

422
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,214
I was told by the police chief
who works for your family.

423
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,055
You will all keep betraying each other
and die a lonely death.

424
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,224
That's your punishment!

425
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,894
Look, you kidnapped Jang Moon-hee

426
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,896
and starved Kim Jin-sook to death.

427
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,107
You killed them both, you little brat.

428
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,401
That bitch knows that we have her.

429
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,820
-If Yoon-gyeom finds out--
-Put her down.

430
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,030
Ma'am.

431
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:14,117
The police are still waiting
in front of the house.

432
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,034
What should I do?

433
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,160
Tell them I'm not here!

434
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:17,704
Yes, ma'am.

435
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,838
Where's Yoon-gyeom?

436
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,468
Call him.

437
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,513
Ask him what I should do.

438
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:36,681
Chairman Kang…

439
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,809
disappeared right after
the press conference.

440
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:43,271
Nobody knows where he went, ma'am.

441
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,773
His secretary's office is in panic too.

442
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,654
Who gave the voice recording to the cops?

443
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,324
Who got it, and how?

444
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,578
SUN-BIN

445
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,839
Don't you think the recording
obtained by the police is pretty clever?

446
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:12,216
It made it sound like
you were behind everything.

447
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,677
Guess who handed it over?

448
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,308
Han Pan-ro made a deal with me.

449
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,018
He said he'd hand his daughter over

450
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:23,853
in exchange for his life.

451
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,319
You ungrateful brat.
After all that I've done for you!

452
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,738
You don't deserve to live,
just like your mother.

453
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:35,573
You've lost your mind over a man.

454
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,950
The only one isolated without a plan
is you, So-ra.

455
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,411
You're losing places to go to,

456
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,038
and you have nobody to lean on.

457
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,831
You'll be destroyed in no time.

458
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:48,252
It looks like you'll be blamed
for all the murders too.

459
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,222
I'm not going to believe a word you say.

460
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:03,309
The driver you and Kim Jeong-chul hired
to get rid of the bodies

461
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,685
is appearing in court too.

462
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,149
First your husband abandoned you,

463
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,193
and now your father has abandoned you too.

464
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,571
You'll die a lonely death

465
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:17,782
without anybody's sympathy.

466
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,309
Do-wan.

467
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,104
That bitch told me…

468
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:53,901
that my dad betrayed me. Is that true?

469
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,069
Mrs. Han.

470
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,654
He's telling the prosecution

471
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,241
that you're the one
who ordered everything.

472
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,244
He said that it'll be easier

473
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,329
if one person takes all the blame.

474
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,556
DR. JUNG

475
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:13,856
I didn't think So-ra's boyfriend
would be anything special,

476
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,651
and I was right.

477
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,903
Moon Do-wan.

478
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:36,629
Chief Secretary Seo.

479
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,175
I'm sorry, sir. Please forgive me.

480
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,390
My mother is ill, sir.

481
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,558
I just needed the money.

482
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,476
Please…

483
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,021
Please forgive me, sir. I'm sorry.

484
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,148
How can I forgive you
when you tried to kill me?

485
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,277
You shouldn't be asking for forgiveness,

486
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,405
but rather what you should do from here.

487
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:33,019
UNSEO LAW FIRM

488
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,729
This isn't enough evidence.

489
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,336
So you're telling me

490
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:01,714
So-ra made a report to the police

491
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,383
with these pictures?

492
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,136
Yes, sir.

493
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,099
That little brat…

494
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,062
That wench.

495
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,485
Sir!

496
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,862
Please don't do this to Mrs. Han.

497
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,030
She's your daughter.

498
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,865
And who the hell do you think you are?

499
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:29,283
Get out of my way!

500
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,161
Dad!

501
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,748
That little…

502
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,209
How could you do that to me?

503
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,670
Did you really hand me over
to save yourself?

504
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,216
There you are.

505
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,676
Did you turn in the pictures?

506
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,012
You're the reason
all of this is happening to me.

507
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,432
This is all because of you!

508
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:56,769
Everything is falling apart
because of you!

509
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,289
Mrs. Han!

510
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:02,042
Mrs. Han, please.

511
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,919
It's not too late to stop this.

512
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,089
You're going to bring me down with you.

513
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,549
I told you to shut your mouth!

514
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,384
You're not my concern if I let him go.

515
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,552
It's my life at stake.

516
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,609
Hurry!

517
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:31,280
Lock it!

518
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,157
Lock it!

519
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,661
Open the door.

520
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,122
I said open it, you bastards.

521
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,335
Open the door.

522
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:47,171
I'm not gonna cower
in front of you like Mom.

523
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,674
I'm no longer the kid

524
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,428
who used to be terrified of you!

525
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,346
You brat.

526
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,556
Open the door…

527
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,563
Snap out of it.

528
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,065
Let's get out.

529
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:13,781
Open it…

530
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,456
I'm leaving because I can't stand
the visitors from the lawsuit.

531
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,375
You all can leave too.

532
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,378
Don't come back until I call for you.

533
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,587
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

534
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:36,637
You get lost too.

535
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:39,890
But Prime Minister Han…

536
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:42,768
Didn't you hear me?

537
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,936
Get lost.

538
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,854
Try anything, and you'll end up like him.

539
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:46,939
Do you understand?

540
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,483
Yes, ma'am.

541
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:17,136
Chairman Kang has never been
unreachable for this long.

542
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,472
Shouldn't we report him missing
to the police?

543
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,864
You can't reach Mr. Kang?

544
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:44,997
He left this open on his computer
and it looks like a will.

545
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,499
He also resigned from his position.

546
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,127
I shouldn't be asking you about this,

547
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,463
but I had no other choice.

548
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,011
I'm resigning from my position as CEO

549
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,888
and leaving everything behind.

550
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,222
I feel miserable

551
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:05,476
because it feels like everything
is crumbling around me at once,

552
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,894
but it is all my fault.

553
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,731
There is no way of reparation
for the people that I've hurt,

554
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:13,067
so I will carry all of the burden myself.

555
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,152
Die.

556
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:18,906
If any one of them fights back,
kill them all with your own hands

557
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,574
and kill yourself at the end of it all.

558
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,034
Then this will be over.

559
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,244
I want you to die for what you've done!

560
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,871
If I really must die…

561
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:27,956
I will.

562
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,959
Do you know where he might be?

563
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,465
I told him to confess,

564
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:38,717
but he disappeared instead.

565
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,682
Maybe he decided to pay for his crimes.

566
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:47,142
I'm glad he has.

567
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,701
SECRETARY CHA

568
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,536
Our legal team told me

569
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,789
Chairman Kang has given all of his rights
and shares to you, Ms. Lee.

570
00:45:51,623 --> 00:45:55,002
He also wrote a will for Da-bi
to inherit his personal property.

571
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:58,672
He assigned the legal team
to be in charge until she's an adult.

572
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:01,508
I can't help but think of the worst.

573
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,520
MR. KANG

574
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,857
The person you are trying to reach
is not available.

575
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,235
Please leave a message after the tone.

576
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,654
Fees will apply once you are connected.

577
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,117
I told him

578
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,204
to die.

579
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,373
To make up for it with his own death.

580
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,129
If he dies,

581
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,924
then I'd be responsible.

582
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,344
I was so harsh to him.

583
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,137
I shouldn't have been.

584
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,515
He's more resilient than that.

585
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,392
Don't worry, we'll look for him.

586
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,236
Have you heard of the term "twin flame"?

587
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:07,032
Like a twin who once shared the same soul,

588
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,161
it refers to two lovers who recognize
each other the moment they meet.

589
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:15,249
They say that twin flames

590
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:20,963
will eventually meet each other,
no matter what.

591
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,592
Twin flames are able to find each other

592
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,511
in a life-or-death situation.

593
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,019
If I really must die…

594
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,397
I will.

595
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,335
Our meeting felt like destiny.

596
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,588
I fell in love with you
because I saw myself in you,

597
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,298
and I could show myself to you

598
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,258
because you understood me.

599
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,595
I can't live without you anymore.

600
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,472
I love you.

601
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,223
Mr. Kang.

602
00:48:58,852 --> 00:48:59,978
Mr. Kang.

603
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,975
What are you doing here?

604
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,644
I was so scared…

605
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:26,356
something bad might have happened to you.

606
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,109
I didn't mean

607
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,362
any of what I said.

608
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,115
I shouldn't have said that to you.

609
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:40,996
I…

610
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:47,961
I just…

611
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,673
PRIME MINISTER HAN

612
00:51:34,966 --> 00:51:37,677
The person you are trying to reach
is not available…

613
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:40,847
Damn it, he's not even
picking up his phone?

614
00:51:42,307 --> 00:51:43,308
Goddammit.

615
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:44,226
My goodness.

616
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,727
Sir, what are you doing? Stay still!

617
00:51:45,811 --> 00:51:46,645
Move!

618
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,897
You stay still, damn it!

619
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,568
He would order me around,

620
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:57,405
and now he thinks I'm his doormat?

621
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,323
Fucking hell!

622
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,660
Who does he think I am?

623
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,912
I'm not as stupid as he thinks!

624
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:31,773
Secretary Cha.

625
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,985
Where's Yoon-gyeom?

626
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,740
I really need him right now.

627
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,161
I might go crazy

628
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,790
if he's not next to me.

629
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,502
Please tell me where he is.

630
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,879
I don't know where he is, ma'am.

631
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:58,300
Chief Secretary Seo
even reported him missing to the police.

632
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:17,087
Honey.

633
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,939
SECRETARY KIM

634
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:42,529
Ma'am, I found Chairman Kang.

635
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:43,488
Where is he?

636
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:44,823
At the vacation house.

637
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:46,199
But…

638
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:47,492
But what?

639
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:50,078
The house manager says
that bitch is there too.

640
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:28,867
Mr. Han!

641
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,495
Mr. Han!

642
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:36,166
Mr. Han!

643
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,003
Come on out!

644
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:42,797
You can't just ignore me like this!

645
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,216
Mr. Han!

646
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,678
Come on out!

647
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,562
Where's your dad?

648
00:55:57,645 --> 00:56:00,690
He's treating me
like I'm a complete idiot.

649
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:03,151
It's seriously pissing me off.

650
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,615
He fled overseas
after taking care of his assets.

651
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,534
Damn it!

652
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:31,304
It's just the two of us now.

653
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,348
If we can't get La-el,

654
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,892
we'll be blamed for everything.

655
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,241
La-el!

656
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,201
I'm going to end you today.

657
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,779
The security camera control center
located Mr. Kang's car.

658
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:14,699
It looks like La-el is with him too.

659
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:16,284
But the problem is, sir…

660
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,410
What is it?

661
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,830
They located another company car
near the vacation house.

662
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,245
Do you have a wish?

663
00:59:42,328 --> 00:59:44,455
I want this anger gone from my heart.

664
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,249
I don't know where Da-bi is.

665
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,584
Da-bi!

666
00:59:49,127 --> 00:59:49,961
No.

667
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,090
I think La-el has been kidnapped.

668
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:56,509
Get all of the security footage
from nearby areas.

669
00:59:59,053 --> 00:59:59,887
Stop the car!

670
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,472
Die!

671
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,308
What about you, Mr. Kang?

672
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,143
I just want to be true to my heart

673
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,396
and love as much as it desires.
