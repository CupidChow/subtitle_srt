00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,574
THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION AND ALL NAMES,
CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND INCIDENTS

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,410
ARE EITHER PRODUCTS OF THE AUTHOR'S
IMAGINATION OR ARE USED FICTITIOUSLY.

3
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,904
What's wrong?

4
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:54,781
Are you okay?

5
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,032
Did you have a nightmare?

6
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,160
What did you dream about?

7
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,039
I keep dreaming…

8
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,086
about you dying.

9
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,931
Promise me you won't
try to take your own life.

10
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,474
It was just a dream.

11
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,226
But you left a will behind.

12
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,940
I did it just in case.

13
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,734
I just thought…

14
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,071
it wouldn't do harm to leave one behind,

15
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,907
just in case.

16
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,076
When you decide
to do something irreversible,

17
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,789
you don't get to do it step by step.

18
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,293
It happens before
you even realize you're doing it.

19
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,965
Remember Piazzolla's song from the movie?

20
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,261
A man wearing an emperor's clothes
hurt his head…

21
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:01,222
Once, a man went to the carnival
dressed as the emperor

22
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,807
and accidentally hurt his head.

23
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,394
He lived the rest of his life
thinking that he was the emperor.

24
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,271
This is a song about that man

25
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:10,857
who forgot who he was.

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,319
…and he lived the rest of his life
thinking that he was the emperor.

27
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,738
Maybe he hadn't forgotten
who he was after all.

28
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,699
Perhaps he had forced himself to forget

29
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,410
so he could live his life
the way he wanted to.

30
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,246
Living life the way one wants…

31
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,008
Maybe you could
force yourself to forget too.

32
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:40,136
You could live a much happier life.

33
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,597
You could have hope.

34
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,267
A hope that you'll be able
to fulfill your wish.

35
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,104
Do you have a wish?

36
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:54,692
Tell me.

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,861
What's your wish?

38
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,619
I want this anger gone from my heart.

39
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:09,457
I want to live a peaceful life.

40
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,922
What about you, Mr. Kang?

41
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,133
I just want to be true to my heart…

42
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:25,181
and love as much as it desires.

43
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,397
That's such a simple wish.

44
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,485
Did the two of us suffer so much

45
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,696
because we couldn't even do

46
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,825
something so small?

47
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,131
That bitch crushed my leg.

48
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,092
I'll break every single bone in her body.

49
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:41,257
You'll sleep better
once you drink some hot tea.

50
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,639
Perhaps it isn't so complicated after all.

51
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,726
If you want something simple,

52
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,480
that means it has to be
easy to achieve, doesn't it?

53
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:03,780
You asked me
if my love for you was ever sincere.

54
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,699
And you said everything
had been deliberately planned.

55
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,786
-I was lying.
-I understand how you feel.

56
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,039
I realized that if I had the choice
to force myself to forget,

57
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,793
then I can also choose to face the truth.

58
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,379
You'd shown your true feelings to me
countless times,

59
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,591
but I never tried to understand you

60
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,261
because I was blinded by my own suffering.

61
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:29,430
But I'm no longer blinded anymore.

62
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,361
Let's go back to Seoul.

63
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,198
We can pay for our sins there,

64
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,742
and then we wait.

65
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,329
Loving somebody
can't be too much to ask for.

66
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:55,414
Wouldn't you agree?

67
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,574
So-ra.

68
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,492
La-el and your husband

69
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,287
are still acting like some damn lovebirds

70
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,415
when they've ruined both of our lives.

71
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:44,046
If you were here,
you would've completely lost it.

72
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:46,757
Listen carefully.

73
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,261
Things will get worse
if we don't get them tonight.

74
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:53,264
I've already called people
to clean up afterward,

75
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,558
so do whatever you can to kill her.

76
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,934
You don't need to remind me.

77
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:01,147
I want her legs shattered into pieces.

78
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,356
Is there a way

79
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,067
to make Yoon-gyeom leave that place?

80
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,527
Of course there is.

81
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,826
DA-BI

82
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,496
Call your secretary's office.

83
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,873
Da-bi could have gotten scared,

84
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,375
so make sure to look after her.

85
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,461
You're right.

86
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,553
DA-BI

87
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,514
I have so many missed calls from Da-bi.

88
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,809
What's going on this late at night?

89
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:44,982
Hey, Da-bi. It's Dad.

90
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,693
-What--
-Dad.

91
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,904
-Da-bi, honey, why are you crying?
-Dad.

92
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,280
Where are you right now?

93
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:52,615
Da-bi?

94
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,033
Da-bi.

95
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:55,952
Da-bi!

96
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,794
The person you are trying to reach
is not available.

97
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:06,379
Your call will be forwarded…

98
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:08,839
What's going on?

99
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:13,261
Da-bi was crying,
and then the call suddenly ended.

100
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:15,137
I think something happened to her.

101
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,433
SO-RA

102
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:22,853
Hello?

103
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:23,771
Honey.

104
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,608
Are you with Da-bi right now?

105
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,859
Why would she be with me?

106
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:30,736
She's supposed to be at home in Seoul!

107
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,321
She was begging to see you

108
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,991
after she heard that you had
gone to the vacation house.

109
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,285
We were on our way
but I felt like I'd be bothering you,

110
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,995
so I was going to go back to Seoul,

111
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,955
and now she's missing.

112
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,125
Honey, I'm freaking out.

113
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,960
What am I supposed to do now?

114
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,921
I don't know where Da-bi is.

115
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,674
What do I do?
Where do I even start looking?

116
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,050
Where are you right now?

117
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:55,344
I'm near the coast.

118
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,985
Don't leave the house.

119
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,695
Don't go anywhere without me.

120
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,280
I'll help you look for her.

121
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,406
Da-bi could come here.

122
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:17,867
You need to stay, okay?

123
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,835
Yes, Mrs. Han?

124
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,587
Don't let Da-bi take any calls

125
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,465
until I give you my permission.

126
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:33,883
Understand?

127
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,551
Yes, ma'am.

128
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,936
Ms. Da-bi.

129
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,190
I'm so sorry for waking you up.

130
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,609
I can't go back to sleep now.

131
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,319
I want my dad!

132
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,696
Da-bi!

133
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,864
Da-bi!

134
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,285
DA-BI

135
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:05,289
The person you are trying to reach
is not available…

136
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,624
SO-RA

137
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,960
The person you are trying to reach
is not available…

138
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,921
Da-bi!

139
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,722
La-el.

140
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:24,850
No.

141
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,084
Mr. Kang?

142
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,589
Is that you, Da-bi?

143
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,621
Hey, La-el.

144
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,040
I remember your dad
scared out of his mind,

145
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:16,253
begging me, "Please don't kill me."

146
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:22,051
He pleaded with every last breath
as life slipped away from him.

147
00:13:24,094 --> 00:13:26,055
I'm curious to see what you'll do.

148
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,395
-Stay away.
-I promise you

149
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:38,275
that you'll die much more painfully
than your dad did.

150
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,835
You have a taste of it first.

151
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:59,964
I'll make you see what
real pain and shame feel like,

152
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,257
enough to kill you!

153
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:11,642
You goddamn bitch.

154
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:24,655
Die.

155
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:01,901
Die!

156
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,195
Please don't kill me.

157
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,448
Die!

158
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,215
Die.

159
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,675
Just die.

160
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,388
You don't deserve to live!

161
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:34,808
Die.

162
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,685
Die!

163
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,189
-Mr. Kang!
-Die!

164
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,106
Let go!

165
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:05,756
KIM JEONG-CHUL

166
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,994
Da-bi is fine,

167
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:18,704
so don't worry.

168
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:20,998
Here, drink some warm water.

169
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,518
You're a good person, you know.

170
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,812
You're a terrible liar,

171
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:47,441
and you can't harbor
ill feelings for others.

172
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,110
Being that way, it must've been so painful

173
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,656
for you to do such harsh things.

174
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,203
I know you hurt yourself

175
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:02,289
because you hated what you were doing.

176
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,170
From this moment on,
live as the person you really are.

177
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,968
What do you mean?

178
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,389
I killed that man, okay?

179
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,850
You had nothing to do with it.

180
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,561
I did it, and I caused it.

181
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,479
No.

182
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,606
I killed him.

183
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,775
Please let me do this for you.

184
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,443
Please.

185
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,987
I'll turn myself in,

186
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,659
so don't try to do anything, all right?

187
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,330
You shouldn't take all of the blame.

188
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,748
I'll tell the police.

189
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:12,025
I'm sorry.

190
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,404
Just rest for a little while.

191
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,258
KIM JEONG-CHUL

192
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:55,819
What's going on?

193
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,948
What's Eun-pyeong doing here?

194
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:19,718
I got into a physical fight with him.

195
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,137
Thank you for coming so briskly, Mr. Seo.

196
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,390
Please call the police for me.

197
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,393
And…

198
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,773
please take good care of La-el.

199
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,486
She took some sleeping pills,
but she'll wake up soon.

200
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,739
I don't want her to see me…

201
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,409
getting arrested.

202
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,165
Kim Jeong-chul broke in, didn't he?

203
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,836
I'll tell them that it was self-defense.

204
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,311
ATTORNEY KIM, LY LEGAL TEAM

205
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,565
Ms. Han So-ra?

206
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,151
"Ms. Han So-ra"?

207
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:02,070
I'm Attorney Kim, in charge of
Chairman Kang's divorce lawsuit.

208
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,113
The divorce

209
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,614
has just been settled.

210
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,159
You'll need to vacate the house
as it belongs to Chairman Kang.

211
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,287
And you'll be legally obligated
to give up your stock shares

212
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,332
as well as your parental rights,
as per your prenuptial agreement.

213
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:49,701
Divorce?

214
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,663
A divorce?

215
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,791
Me?

216
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,496
So-ra, that brat…

217
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:05,003
That bitch…

218
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,965
She deserves to die…

219
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:14,137
just like her mother.

220
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,227
Just wait until I get out of here.

221
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,812
I'll make sure…

222
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,816
to gouge her eyes out.

223
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,158
Please give me a sip of water.

224
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,536
Just…

225
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:42,457
a sip of water.

226
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,377
I'll deal with the initial investigation.

227
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,254
Perhaps you should take a short nap…

228
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,348
Ms. Kim, I think La-el has been kidnapped.

229
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:01,268
Secretary Cha,
find out where So-ra is immediately.

230
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,811
Request cooperation
from the local government

231
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,729
and get all of the security footage
from nearby areas.

232
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,231
All of it within the past hour.

233
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,699
I'll get the security footage before I go,

234
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,075
so please search the nearby area.

235
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:17,993
All right.

236
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,619
Call me as soon as you find her.

237
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,321
La-el.

238
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:55,947
Die!

239
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,327
One of us has to die.

240
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,579
And it's going to be you.

241
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,372
So die!

242
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,968
All right.

243
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,595
Keep tracking her and let me know.

244
00:27:47,123 --> 00:27:48,249
SO-RA

245
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,129
YOON-GYEOM

246
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,341
CALL ENDED

247
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,731
Stop the car!

248
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:13,817
Get lost!

249
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,027
I'll kill her if you keep tailing me!

250
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,362
Stop the car!

251
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:23,284
Stop the damn car!

252
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,580
Stop the car!

253
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,102
Yes?

254
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,438
The National Police Agency's
CCTV Control Team just called me.

255
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,314
Han So-ra is on the coastal road.

256
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:54,232
Got it.

257
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,293
Stop the car.

258
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,294
Stop the car!

259
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,005
Stop the car.

260
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:20,258
Stop the car!

261
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,635
I said, stop the car!

262
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:48,328
Die!

263
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:09,891
No matter what you do,

264
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:12,852
you'll never be able to beat me.

265
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,104
And it's because

266
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,357
you've never been loved before.

267
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,944
You'll never know

268
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,947
what love feels like.

269
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,536
What a pathetic life.

270
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:35,667
Stop it!

271
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,837
-Stop.
-Let go!

272
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,630
-Let go of me!
-Just stop!

273
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,173
-La-el.
-I'll kill her.

274
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,509
I'm going to kill that bitch!

275
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,344
-Please stop!
-Let go!

276
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,930
Let go of me!

277
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:51,891
Open the door.

278
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,269
Open it!

279
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,312
I need to kill her.

280
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,564
Let me out.

281
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,901
I'm going to kill her!

282
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,238
Honey!

283
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,785
I'll chase her down and kill her!

284
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:14,998
I'm the one who needs to end this.

285
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,252
Open the door!

286
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,295
So-ra.

287
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,018
So-ra.

288
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,607
I'm really sorry.

289
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,630
No.

290
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,094
Tell me.

291
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,305
What's your wish?

292
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,643
I want this anger gone from my heart.

293
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:21,022
I want to live a peaceful life.

294
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,132
-No!
-La-el.

295
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,300
Honey!

296
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,677
-Don't go!
-La-el!

297
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:52,929
La-el.

298
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,013
Please.

299
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,932
Please don't do it, please.

300
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,060
Honey!

301
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:10,715
The former COO of LY,
Mr. Kim Jeong-chul, has passed away.

302
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,259
The cause of his death
has not yet been revealed,

303
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,636
and an investigation is ongoing,
looking at multiple possibilities.

304
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,723
On the same day, a car belonging
to LY Group's Mr. Kang Yoon-gyeom

305
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,768
was found after having fallen
from a cliff by the ocean.

306
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:25,521
A passenger is in critical condition,
while the other has passed away.

307
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,983
As of now, their identities remain unclear
with only assumptions to go by.

308
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,819
The former prime minister,
Mr. Han Pan-ro, has fled abroad

309
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,946
and could not be reached.

310
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,324
Some believe that the incidents

311
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:40,787
are the aftermath of the lawsuit
filed by the LY Victims Group.

312
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,582
The police investigation is currently
ongoing with multiple possibilities.

313
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,502
I found Mr. Han's passport.

314
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,712
Is this his real passport though?

315
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,798
It just doesn't make sense
that he's abroad

316
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,382
while his passport is right here.

317
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,386
There must be something
we don't know about.

318
00:34:58,638 --> 00:34:59,639
I don't know anything.

319
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,309
Tell me.

320
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,229
What's your wish?

321
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,068
I want this anger gone from my heart.

322
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,155
I want to live a peaceful life.

323
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,408
What about you, Mr. Kang?

324
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,912
I just want to be true to my heart…

325
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,082
and love as much as it desires.

326
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,378
La-el.

327
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:14,630
La-el.

328
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:17,049
Lee La-el.

329
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,428
You're awake.

330
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:28,144
The doctor told me to wait
until you wake up on your own.

331
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,898
How long has it been?

332
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,441
It's been three days since.

333
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,614
La-el.

334
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:43,868
I can't just stay here like this.
I need to help Mr. Kang.

335
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,411
I need to save him.

336
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,329
La-el.

337
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,916
Mr. Kang is dead.

338
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,377
He died on the spot.

339
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,006
There's nothing we can do now.

340
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,718
They followed his will
and cremated him without a funeral.

341
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,640
I know it's hard to believe,
but you saw his last moment, La-el.

342
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:54,272
Mr. Kang left this for you
before he left after you,

343
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,399
along with the bandoneon.

344
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,212
TO LA-EL

345
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,730
I'm sorry.

346
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,692
I'm so sorry.

347
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,614
Father.

348
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:49,994
Do you know what Yoon-gyeom did
before he died?

349
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,582
He gave all of his shares
to La-el, that wench.

350
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,543
Since he repaid the value of GEDIKS too,

351
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,795
LY is basically nothing now!

352
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:02,298
How dare he make that decision?

353
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,800
What are we supposed to do now, Father?

354
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:05,926
Tell me!

355
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:12,975
This is why they say…

356
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,687
bloodlines matter.

357
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,191
You should've never taken in

358
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,401
such a lowly woman's child!

359
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,695
Honey, wait…

360
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,447
Stop it.

361
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,120
Damn you!

362
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:34,830
You fool.

363
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,792
You idiot!

364
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:42,046
Just shut your mouth
if you don't know anything!

365
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,341
Don't you know why Yoon-gyeom
lived the way he did?

366
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:49,512
He worked so hard
to take care of the company

367
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,931
because you're so incapable.

368
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,893
This is all because of you,
you incompetent idiot!

369
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,562
Stop hitting me!

370
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:04,235
I can't take this anymore, all right?

371
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,075
Oh goodness.

372
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,954
I should've never tried to look after him.

373
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,415
CORRUPTION EVIDENCE OF HAN PAN-RO

374
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,834
It has records of everything

375
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,421
that I've seen, heard, and done.

376
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,757
How long has Han Pan-ro
been locked in there?

377
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,510
Around 15 days.

378
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,598
I didn't even check on him

379
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,643
because Mrs. Han told me not to.

380
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,479
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

381
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,482
Give a truthful testimony

382
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,234
in court.

383
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,613
Then accept your punishment.

384
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,079
I'll turn myself in after I visit Mrs. Han

385
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,415
just one last time.

386
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,919
How pretty.

387
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:07,882
Isn't she so pretty, honey?

388
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,677
How can she be so pretty
when she was just born?

389
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:15,181
Her nose looks just like yours,

390
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,475
and she has my eyes.

391
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,351
She's so beautiful, isn't she?

392
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,313
Here, try holding her.

393
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,649
It's okay, you can hold her.

394
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,404
Are you frightened
because it's your first time?

395
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,201
Honey.

396
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,163
She's our daughter.

397
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,977
How are her symptoms, Doctor?

398
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,940
I've been keeping a close eye on her
because the court requested her presence.

399
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,776
But she's in no state to go anywhere.

400
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,277
In fact, she's getting worse.

401
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:11,695
She chose

402
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,822
to erase all of her memories.

403
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,826
What she has is Methuselah Syndrome,
with all her unhappy memories erased.

404
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,912
It's an early stage of schizophrenia.

405
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,331
She's struggling with reality
and could kill herself

406
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,916
if she ever regains her memories.

407
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:26,877
Well, then.

408
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:28,504
Thank you.

409
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,177
She survived,

410
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,431
but she lost herself.

411
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,226
I guess she's no longer truly alive.

412
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,103
Oh, my darling. You're so pretty.

413
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,490
How dare you come in
without my permission?

414
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,911
Who are you?

415
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:04,164
Are you an LY employee?

416
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,023
What is this?

417
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,244
What's wrong with my face?

418
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,583
Who did this?

419
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,336
Who did this to me?

420
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,171
You did it to yourself.

421
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,718
You don't have the right

422
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,513
to lose your memories.

423
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:06,852
Yoon-gyeom…

424
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,732
is dead.

425
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,028
He was murdered.

426
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,676
You killed your beloved husband

427
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,303
with your own hands.

428
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,849
You don't get to wish for death anymore.

429
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:48,310
True suffering

430
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:52,439
is living with what you've done.

431
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,732
No.

432
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,402
This isn't real.

433
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,196
This isn't me.

434
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,827
I can't look like this.

435
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,663
That’s not me.

436
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,499
There's no way.

437
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,001
No.

438
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,629
This isn't me!

439
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,174
It's not me!

440
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,555
That's not my face!

441
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:29,268
Who are you?

442
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,270
Why are you doing this to me?

443
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,440
What did I ever do to you?

444
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,529
Why are you doing this?

445
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,326
Who the hell are you?

446
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,831
Why are you doing this to me?

447
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,584
Who are you?

448
00:45:58,046 --> 00:46:00,215
Why are you doing this?

449
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,177
Who are you?

450
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:08,098
Han Pan-ro, Kim Jeong-chul, and Han So-ra

451
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:13,187
profited from their political corruption
through political and economic collusion.

452
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,855
They gave the companies

453
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:17,191
the right to get profits
through the Zeus Project,

454
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,612
and they themselves profited fiscally.

455
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:23,280
I had the duty…

456
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:27,701
of kidnapping and threatening…

457
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:35,250
those who would go up against Mr. Han.

458
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,839
I partook in disposing of the body
of Ms. Jang Moon-hee,

459
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,550
who was the representative
of the LY Victims Group.

460
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:49,598
I also harmed
Chief Secretary Seo Eun-pyeong…

461
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,477
by stabbing him with a knife.

462
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,109
I found somebody down here.

463
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,194
Get me a metal cutter.

464
00:47:41,858 --> 00:47:42,985
Mr. Seo.

465
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,612
You once told me

466
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,198
that life

467
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,368
is full of suffering.

468
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:53,954
But how come…

469
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:58,292
you seem so indifferent?

470
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:01,878
You also spent a tough childhood

471
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,174
growing up without your parents.

472
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,305
How is it that
I don't feel any rage in you?

473
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,015
How did you overcome

474
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,768
your resentment?

475
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:21,815
I never overcame it.

476
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,485
If I look indifferent,

477
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,988
there's probably another reason.

478
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,575
It's true that life

479
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,536
is full of suffering and misery.

480
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:39,750
But there will come a beautiful moment
that overrules it all.

481
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,586
Only human beings can do it.

482
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:46,048
And because that moment
is so beautiful and splendid,

483
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,469
we have no choice but to praise life.

484
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:54,640
I'm sure that moment will come to you too.

485
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,308
A moment when a beautiful blessing

486
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:58,894
finds its way to your heart.

487
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:27,964
ON BUILDING A BETTER FUTURE

488
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,551
During the process of trying to make
LY exceptional and greater,

489
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,845
countless victims
were made to be sacrificed.

490
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,390
Although the purpose of a business
is to pursue profit,

491
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:41,019
it also has a social responsibility
to contribute to the community.

492
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:43,814
Therefore, we have compensated the victims

493
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,525
with the returned
corporate value of GEDIKS,

494
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,819
and we will become a non-profit foundation

495
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:51,321
to assist other victims
of corporate crimes.

496
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,241
However, no matter what we do,

497
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,702
we cannot get back
the lives that were lost.

498
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:00,539
In order to prevent such misfortune
from befalling us again,

499
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,877
it is up to you, who remain,
to build a better future.

500
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:13,343
CHAIRMAN KANG YOON-GYEOM

501
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,006
Just as how you've healed me,

502
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:55,093
I want to try to heal you too.

503
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:02,642
Do you know what it'd be called

504
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,644
if I danced the tango right here?

505
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,357
A "room tango."

506
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,265
This is why I hesitated.

507
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,435
Because I thought I might fall in love.

508
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:11,503
Cosmos flowers somehow remind me of you.

509
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,173
I know you're carrying a wound with you.

510
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,176
One that's so hard to bear

511
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,304
that you must hurt yourself even more.

512
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:24,266
You just follow your heart.

513
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:27,978
I'll find more cosmos flowers
before winter falls.

514
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:32,816
Then you'll make them bloom someday.

515
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,487
I never realized

516
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:39,698
that the best things in life

517
00:52:40,532 --> 00:52:42,284
are hidden in the most mundane things.

518
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:03,138
Hello, Ms. Lee.
I'll be your flight attendant today.

519
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,976
I'll make sure that your journey
to Buenos Aires is exemplary.

520
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:12,063
What would you like for your companion?

521
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:15,609
I'm traveling alone.

522
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,779
I thought you were with somebody

523
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,698
since the seat was reserved.

524
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:24,868
He wasn't able to make it.

525
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:29,414
I'm taking his instrument in his place.

526
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:31,082
I'm sorry to hear that.

527
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:34,461
I hope he can join you on your next trip.

528
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:02,072
There are things
that can be seen without eyes,

529
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,993
and there are people who remain
in your heart even when they're gone.

530
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:09,871
My dad,

531
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,414
my mom,

532
00:54:12,248 --> 00:54:14,834
Ms. Jang, and…

533
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,920
you.

534
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,482
Let's check this again and go with plan B.

535
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:38,400
Let's do that.

536
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:57,043
All right.

537
00:54:58,169 --> 00:54:59,045
Let's eat.

538
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:04,467
When did you have the time
to prepare all this?

539
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,053
I'm not as busy as you.
You'll be going away tomorrow.

540
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,013
Let's eat.

541
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:14,936
I must say, I'm jealous
that you're going to Buenos Aires.

542
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,022
I've never been there.

543
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:24,446
It's a return ticket, right?

544
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,698
No, it's a one-way.

545
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:33,955
I don't know if I'll come back.

546
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,790
So you're never coming back?

547
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:38,835
I'll come back. I just don't know when.

548
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,422
Well, I hope you'll want to
come back soon.

549
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,468
You're making me worried now,

550
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:51,598
hearing you'll be flying off
to another country all by yourself

551
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:53,558
without a return ticket.

552
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:09,991
You still kept it?

553
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:14,412
I learned that this doll you got for me
is supposed to bring luck.

554
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:19,751
I'll bring it with me to Buenos Aires.

555
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,920
For good luck.

556
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:23,338
All right.

557
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,966
Be safe.

558
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,927
Don't forget to call me.

559
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:30,386
Of course.

560
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:32,972
Thank you so much…

561
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,227
for all that you've done for me.

562
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,020
Hey.

563
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:42,524
Don't say that
like you'll never see me again.

564
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:44,984
Let's just eat for today.

565
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,071
This means that we'll
see each other again.

566
00:56:50,323 --> 00:56:51,157
Let's eat.

567
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:15,807
BUENOS AIRES

568
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,244
Come in.

569
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,047
Sir, you can't resign.

570
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,425
I can't believe
you made such a sudden decision.

571
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,554
I think I've worked with you
for way too long, honestly.

572
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,849
We've worked together
since I was in my twenties.

573
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:00,393
It's about time
we both become independent, no?

574
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,936
Independent, huh?

575
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,273
You still need to give credit
where it's due.

576
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,651
You're the one
who needed me to do everything.

577
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:10,445
Who, me?

578
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:17,869
Are you going to Buenos Aires
to meet with La-el?

579
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:19,829
Probably.

580
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,666
-Have you told her that you're coming?
-No.

581
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,085
So you're just going without a plan?

582
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,880
I don't know if I'll see her there

583
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:32,091
or if I'll be able to spend time with her.

584
00:58:32,967 --> 00:58:33,885
Nothing is set.

585
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,556
Are you going there
so you can get an answer

586
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:41,100
to the question you asked her?

587
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,686
That's just an excuse, really.

588
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:47,524
I just miss her too much.

589
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:54,489
All right, then.

590
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,951
I'll be taking a break
until you come back.

591
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,203
I can't work with other men

592
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,665
after all those years of working
with a great man like you.

593
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,333
So don't take too long, okay?

594
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:09,379
We'll see.

595
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,910
TO LA-EL

596
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,209
You said

597
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,545
that even mistakes can become
a part of the tango.

598
00:59:52,046 --> 00:59:54,424
If that's true,
then everything we did was love,

599
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,843
and it was beautiful in itself.

600
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,887
Even if I could start all over
knowing everything,

601
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,765
I would fall for you and love you,

602
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,101
all over again.

603
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,321
Thank you, everyone.

604
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,866
This is my last performance.

605
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,869
That was "Adios,"
a song about farewells and the past.

606
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:28,124
I think that true love

607
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,503
gives you the courage
to move on to the next stage of your life.

608
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:38,051
I, too, will be stepping into the future
and leaving my past behind.

609
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,220
I can't be sure what awaits me,

610
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:44,474
but I do know…

611
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:47,393
that it'll be something great.

612
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,981
And now, my last song

613
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,525
is a song of freedom.

614
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:43,574
What if our meeting
had truly been coincidental?

615
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:43,885
Will you dance with me?

616
01:02:45,303 --> 01:02:46,179
Sure.

617
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,849
There is another side to everything.

618
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:36,562
We simply see what is visible to us.

619
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,609
But if you don't look
at what's hidden behind the beauty,

620
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,154
then you'll never realize
the truth of the world.

621
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:51,452
What if our meeting
had truly been coincidental?
