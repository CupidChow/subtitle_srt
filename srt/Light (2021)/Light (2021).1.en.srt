1
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:09,965
Thanks ma'am

2
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:11,258
Ok, thanks

3
00:01:45,102 --> 00:01:46,729
It's my fault.

4
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,856
You behaved pretty well today

5
00:02:31,023 --> 00:02:33,025
What a good boy.

6
00:02:33,484 --> 00:02:35,444
You are my favorite.

7
00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:42,868
Ma'am

8
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:45,162
Luo！You are here.

9
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,248
Where is master?
His hands aren't recovered yet?

10
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:50,918
Not so soon!
He has had both hands in a cast.

11
00:02:51,168 --> 00:02:52,836
After taking apart the plaster bandage
then he needs to rehabilitate.

12
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,796
Not so fast.

13
00:02:54,338 --> 00:02:55,381
It is troublesome.

14
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:58,342
Luo！Your suit is ready！Want to try it on？

15
00:02:58,384 --> 00:02:59,510
Sure, let me have a look.

16
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,052
Shuo

17
00:03:17,695 --> 00:03:19,238
Master really does master job.

18
00:03:21,073 --> 00:03:22,700
Ok, please wrap it up for me.

19
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,617
No problem.

20
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:25,077
Luo

21
00:03:25,744 --> 00:03:28,664
This is Alishan tea,
my father specially keeps it for you.

22
00:03:28,706 --> 00:03:29,998
Try some

23
00:03:30,666 --> 00:03:32,793
How nice.

24
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:34,920
You take care of us so well.

25
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,921
Thanks

26
00:03:37,464 --> 00:03:38,215
Smells good

27
00:03:46,515 --> 00:03:48,559
Put away those guns.

28
00:03:48,559 --> 00:03:49,977
So rude.

29
00:03:50,227 --> 00:03:52,771
Look, you scared ma'am.

30
00:03:58,444 --> 00:04:00,612
Here you are.

31
00:04:00,696 --> 00:04:01,405
Luo, thanks

32
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:05,701
See you next time,
please send my greetings to master.

33
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:06,535
Ok no problem.

34
00:04:06,577 --> 00:04:07,202
Bye

35
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:08,120
Bye Luo

36
00:04:09,329 --> 00:04:11,540
Luo, thanks

37
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:27,765
Are you dead?

38
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:32,394
Not moving at all.

39
00:04:34,688 --> 00:04:37,316
Sticky and messy.

40
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:42,362
Give me the money.

41
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:46,533
As we agreed 3000 dollars.

42
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:51,830
What the hell do you want?

43
00:04:52,498 --> 00:04:53,874
What the hell do you want?

44
00:04:55,334 --> 00:04:56,794
Did I fuck you just then?

45
00:04:58,712 --> 00:04:59,880
I didn't get in, right?

46
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:14,436
You should have told me

47
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,648
You have no money
and got premature ejaculation problem.

48
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:20,692
I will give you discount next time.

49
00:05:22,736 --> 00:05:24,363
What the fuck did you say?

50
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:25,405
Fuck

51
00:05:26,365 --> 00:05:27,324
What did you just say?

52
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:30,118
I PEed right? What are you laughing at?

53
00:05:30,244 --> 00:05:31,787
Fuck you.

54
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:34,998
Fuck! sticky and messy.

55
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:38,794
Sticky and messy.

56
00:06:46,028 --> 00:06:48,363
See anything interesting?

57
00:06:50,115 --> 00:06:53,118
Nothing, I’m just passing by.

58
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,918
Come and have a look.

59
00:07:06,214 --> 00:07:07,466
Come on

60
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:15,515
Mom, that man is so strange.

61
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:18,268
Don’t go there, let's go.

62
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:24,650
I got things to do. I will go now.

63
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:26,026
You

64
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:30,072
Are you leaving? Don't wanna stay longer?

65
00:07:30,489 --> 00:07:31,615
No, thanks.

66
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,868
It is going to rain soon,
stay inside would be better.

67
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:40,415
You got bruise.

68
00:07:40,707 --> 00:07:41,208
Shuo

69
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,920
I’ll go get the first-aid kit

70
00:07:45,045 --> 00:07:46,046
Shuo, take care of him.

71
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:49,007
Stay inside, don't go.

72
00:07:49,967 --> 00:07:51,551
Let's go inside.

73
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:02,270
Let me have a look.

74
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,147
This one

75
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:05,983
Apply this, it is good for bruises.

76
00:08:06,358 --> 00:08:07,609
Here and here.

77
00:08:08,694 --> 00:08:10,404
Drink some water.

78
00:08:13,865 --> 00:08:15,784
Your button has come off.

79
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,577
Don't go to the alley anymore.

80
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,621
It is dangerous there.

81
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:22,457
I saw it.

82
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:31,633
Light is gone?

83
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:36,221
Ma'am, you know him?

84
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:40,100
Light's stepfather would beat him
and his mother up.

85
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:41,810
Pretty hard.

86
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,856
You think you are so fully fledged?

87
00:08:46,189 --> 00:08:47,691
Every time when they got beaten.

88
00:08:48,066 --> 00:08:50,235
My father would let them hide here.

89
00:08:50,277 --> 00:08:51,695
Drink up! Drink till you drop.

90
00:08:51,945 --> 00:08:54,489
Afterwards, his mother passed away.

91
00:08:54,573 --> 00:08:57,075
Get the fuck out, I am your father.

92
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,787
The situation became worse for the kid.

93
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:04,666
You see, all the wounds.

94
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,960
He didn’t even get a chance to have a cup of tea.

95
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,010
Are you ok?

96
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:58,553
Let me hold you up.

97
00:09:58,553 --> 00:09:59,179
Come

98
00:10:01,223 --> 00:10:01,765
Come on

99
00:10:07,896 --> 00:10:09,815
Are you all right?

100
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:15,654
I feel so cold

101
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:25,413
Put this on first, you will be fine.

102
00:10:29,626 --> 00:10:32,087
I will hold you up,
you push yourself a bit.

103
00:10:34,422 --> 00:10:34,881
Come

104
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:39,261
Hold on.

105
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:44,266
Let me carry you.

106
00:10:46,685 --> 00:10:48,061
Your hands go up here.

107
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,608
2 3

108
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:12,127
No! No!

109
00:11:31,438 --> 00:11:32,606
Money?

110
00:11:33,565 --> 00:11:34,232
None.

111
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:36,318
None?

112
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:38,028
That's my money! I earned it.

113
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,655
Your money, you eat more than you earn.

114
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:41,489
You don't spend at all?

115
00:11:42,365 --> 00:11:44,576
Fuck! your money?!

116
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:56,129
Take a breath.

117
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:04,888
You changed my clothes for me.

118
00:12:08,725 --> 00:12:09,935
Why did you save me?

119
00:12:10,477 --> 00:12:13,104
Anyone would save you when they see you like that

120
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,444
Turn over, let me check your wound at the back.

121
00:12:28,453 --> 00:12:29,829
Does it hurt?

122
00:12:33,041 --> 00:12:34,000
I will apply the ointment on.

123
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,909
Could you say you like me?

124
00:13:09,327 --> 00:13:11,037
What?

125
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,291
Even if it is not true.

126
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,795
Could you please say that you like me?

127
00:13:19,129 --> 00:13:20,213
Like you?

128
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:28,346
You lie down first.

129
00:13:29,931 --> 00:13:33,977
Your fever was just brought down.
Take a rest first.

130
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,152
Don't go.

131
00:13:46,197 --> 00:13:48,616
I am going to buy something,
would be right back.

132
00:13:49,993 --> 00:13:51,578
Do you want anything to eat?

133
00:13:55,832 --> 00:13:56,958
I want to eat fish.

134
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:57,792
Um

135
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,980
Be careful, it is hot.

136
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:36,790
Good?

137
00:14:37,832 --> 00:14:39,042
Yummy

138
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:04,359
Section chief, I just got your message.

139
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:06,319
I don't understand what you mean.

140
00:15:06,528 --> 00:15:10,365
We decide to give you a couple days off,
take a good rest.

141
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:13,284
Rest? No I don't need days off.

142
00:15:14,994 --> 00:15:17,580
I have followed this case for the longest time.

143
00:15:17,747 --> 00:15:19,290
You don't need to follow up anymore.

144
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:22,210
Supervisor Wang will take care of it instead.

145
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:25,338
The suspect has remembered you.

146
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:27,215
So it's better not to join this case anymore.

147
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:28,550
Section chief

148
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:31,302
Shut up, just do what I say.

149
00:15:32,637 --> 00:15:36,433
Don't just try to take all the credit,
you need to look at the bigger picture.

150
00:15:38,685 --> 00:15:40,311
Yes, section chief.

151
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:49,237
Welcome

152
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:50,155
Ma'am

153
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,657
Why are you here again?

154
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:54,909
I’m bringing him here to make a suit.

155
00:15:55,243 --> 00:15:56,703
Hi ma'am

156
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:58,037
Light

157
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,581
You have such a good figure

158
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,458
You definitely look good in suits.

159
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:04,127
Shuo, you know what to do,
come and measure it.

160
00:16:08,756 --> 00:16:12,010
These fabrics are all nice,
see which one you like.

161
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:21,102
How about this one?

162
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:24,522
Um, it suits you well.

163
00:16:24,647 --> 00:16:26,733
Take off the jacket,
I will do your measurements.

164
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,485
Oh ok.

165
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,851
Is it painful?

166
00:17:03,728 --> 00:17:04,687
That's ok.

167
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:06,856
I will be gentle

168
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:26,292
Light, come have some Maogu tangerines.

169
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:27,293
It is sweet.

170
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:28,294
Ok

171
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:30,672
Sit here, take away your clothes.

172
00:17:31,548 --> 00:17:32,423
I am so sorry.

173
00:17:32,507 --> 00:17:33,758
It's ok.

174
00:17:33,758 --> 00:17:35,093
Are you all right?

175
00:17:38,221 --> 00:17:39,472
I have to listen to this message.

176
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:50,733
Where have you been?
You haven't been back for so many days.

177
00:17:51,401 --> 00:17:53,486
Come back and give me the money now!

178
00:17:53,486 --> 00:17:55,321
If you don't do what I say,

179
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,907
I will ask people to find you and kill you.

180
00:18:02,912 --> 00:18:04,122
Raise your hands higher.

181
00:18:04,706 --> 00:18:06,499
Your wound will rot if it gets wet.

182
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,253
You wrapped it so tightly,
there is no way it would get rotten.

183
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,422
Ok, don't move.

184
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:14,215
Ouch!

185
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:45,288
You are hard.

186
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:56,090
You actually want it as well, don’t you?

187
00:22:43,526 --> 00:22:47,238
Shuo, you used to be a policeman?

188
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,995
Where did you get this?

189
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:58,082
You are no longer a policeman, right?

190
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,083
Um?

191
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:04,130
I am just taking a break.

192
00:23:05,464 --> 00:23:06,966
What do you mean?

193
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,676
I don't understand.

194
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,435
Be good, don't go to the alley
and do stupid things.

195
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,227
Um?

196
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:41,042
What else can I do though?

197
00:25:32,194 --> 00:25:33,529
What are you doing?

198
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:37,616
Ridiculous, get dressed now.

199
00:25:37,992 --> 00:25:39,410
Come out, both of you.

200
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:42,913
Hurry up.

201
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:03,601
Shuo

202
00:26:03,851 --> 00:26:04,977
What happened?

203
00:26:05,061 --> 00:26:07,938
He was reported for engaging in prostitution
in the public toilet.

204
00:26:08,189 --> 00:26:09,190
It is outrageous!

205
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:57,530
Thanks for bailing me out.

206
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:03,619
Why did you do that?

207
00:27:06,288 --> 00:27:09,667
I will pay you back the money.

208
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:13,838
How?

209
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:18,259
Do you know what you were doing?

210
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:23,973
How many times did I tell you not to do this again?

211
00:27:24,306 --> 00:27:25,891
Why do you keep doing it?

212
00:27:35,484 --> 00:27:37,153
You don't wanna do it with me.

213
00:27:37,444 --> 00:27:39,989
But you won’t let me do it with others neither.

214
00:27:41,073 --> 00:27:43,701
You are not my man.

215
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:46,662
It is illegal to do prostitution.

216
00:27:48,122 --> 00:27:49,373
Yes

217
00:27:49,915 --> 00:27:53,210
To you, it is illegal.

218
00:27:54,003 --> 00:27:55,546
But I have my own problems to solve

219
00:27:55,671 --> 00:27:57,214
I need to make money.

220
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:01,552
And...

221
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:04,263
I’m trying to earn money with my own labor.

222
00:28:05,055 --> 00:28:07,725
I don't steal or rob.

223
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:10,936
Why is it breaking any law?

224
00:28:27,203 --> 00:28:28,412
I think

225
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:31,290
You want me to leave, don’t you?

226
00:30:14,935 --> 00:30:16,562
Don't leave me.

227
00:30:17,521 --> 00:30:20,774
Don't worry, I am here.

228
00:30:24,611 --> 00:30:26,613
Get some more sleep.

229
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,239
Um

230
00:30:45,257 --> 00:30:48,635
Give this money to your stepfather.

231
00:30:49,636 --> 00:30:50,846
I can't take your money.

232
00:30:51,138 --> 00:30:53,223
It's ok.

233
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:56,101
You can pay me back later.

234
00:31:00,397 --> 00:31:04,109
If you have any problem and trouble,
just let me know.

235
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,618
You play guitar?

236
00:31:14,703 --> 00:31:17,414
I used to play it,
but haven't touched it for a while.

237
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,876
I want to listen to you play.

238
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:22,419
Ok

239
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:00,893
You are back.

240
00:33:04,146 --> 00:33:05,397
Finally! so you know it is time to come back.

241
00:33:10,736 --> 00:33:11,487
Here is the money.

242
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:14,198
Just leave me alone

243
00:33:15,157 --> 00:33:16,074
Where are you going?

244
00:33:16,283 --> 00:33:17,075
Uh?

245
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:18,869
Where are you going?

246
00:33:30,506 --> 00:33:31,131
Light

247
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:33,842
How are things going?

248
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:37,721
Let go off me.

249
00:33:39,056 --> 00:33:40,557
Are you trying to hide from me? Is it?

250
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,268
No

251
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:45,187
I texted you, but you never replied.

252
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,689
I was busy.

253
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,650
Don't be so mad.

254
00:33:50,317 --> 00:33:51,485
You want money, right?

255
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:53,445
10000 dollars.

256
00:33:54,154 --> 00:33:54,988
Suck my dick.

257
00:34:57,884 --> 00:34:58,635
You are back.

258
00:34:58,844 --> 00:34:59,886
I cook your favorite fish soup.

259
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:01,305
Can you help me serve it?

260
00:35:04,182 --> 00:35:04,808
Are you ok?

261
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,603
Shuo

262
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:10,022
It’s ok, don't worry.

263
00:35:12,899 --> 00:35:14,234
Have you got beaten by your stepfather?

264
00:35:16,987 --> 00:35:18,405
Not him.

265
00:35:19,906 --> 00:35:21,033
Ok, it is ok..

266
00:35:21,074 --> 00:35:21,700
Let me have a look.

267
00:35:24,286 --> 00:35:24,870
Don't cry.

268
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,956
Where did you go?

269
00:35:29,082 --> 00:35:29,833
What happened?

270
00:35:38,467 --> 00:35:39,509
Where did you go?

271
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,683
Tell me where you went.

272
00:35:47,643 --> 00:35:49,519
What's on your neck?

273
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:53,982
You wouldn't want to know.

274
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,363
Tell me where you went.

275
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,869
You promised me that
you won't go there anymore.

276
00:36:07,245 --> 00:36:08,455
How come you still went there?

277
00:36:09,414 --> 00:36:10,123
I didn't.

278
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:12,501
I did not do it.

279
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,796
I didn't want to do so, he made me.

280
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:16,421
And you’re still lying to me.

281
00:36:16,421 --> 00:36:17,506
He made me!

282
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:18,715
Who can make you do things?

283
00:36:19,508 --> 00:36:20,592
You are a man with good arm sand good legs

284
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:23,512
Why don't you make money in the right way?

285
00:36:24,054 --> 00:36:26,306
No, I didn't.

286
00:36:26,348 --> 00:36:28,058
Don't throw me away.

287
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:30,560
You are the only one I got.

288
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,233
You really disappointed me.

289
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:41,571
Shuo

290
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:13,937
Thanks for taking care of me.

291
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:16,273
I am so sorry.

292
00:37:17,023 --> 00:37:19,276
I will pay you the money back later.

293
00:37:24,114 --> 00:37:25,532
It's good that you are back.

294
00:37:25,532 --> 00:37:27,534
We were so busy.

295
00:37:32,497 --> 00:37:33,582
Shuo.

296
00:37:34,124 --> 00:37:35,083
Chen

297
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:36,501
Do you need help?

298
00:37:37,294 --> 00:37:41,339
Do you remember a guy
who you bailed out called Light?

299
00:37:41,882 --> 00:37:44,384
You said he is your neighbor.

300
00:37:46,011 --> 00:37:46,970
What happened?

301
00:37:47,262 --> 00:37:48,180
The thing is

302
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:49,723
He came to report a case last month.

303
00:37:49,806 --> 00:37:52,142
Now we got the suspect,
we need him to identify.

304
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,853
But we can't reach him
At the number he gave us.

305
00:37:55,061 --> 00:37:56,104
Can you find him?

306
00:37:56,396 --> 00:37:56,980
Report a case?

307
00:37:57,063 --> 00:37:57,355
Um

308
00:37:57,856 --> 00:37:58,899
Why?

309
00:37:59,065 --> 00:38:01,735
He was beaten, then he...

310
00:38:02,444 --> 00:38:03,111
Er

311
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:05,030
I’d rather not talk about it here...

312
00:38:05,989 --> 00:38:07,824
So he was beaten

313
00:38:07,949 --> 00:38:10,118
And he was also...

314
00:38:10,452 --> 00:38:11,453
That is

315
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:13,121
Rape

316
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:13,580
Um

317
00:38:15,499 --> 00:38:18,877
Sorry, the number you have dialed does not exist.

318
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:21,463
Please check it again, thank you.

319
00:38:21,588 --> 00:38:22,964
This number...

320
00:38:29,095 --> 00:38:29,721
Auntie

321
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,765
Did you see Light?

322
00:38:31,848 --> 00:38:32,724
No

323
00:38:33,016 --> 00:38:34,059
No, I didn't see him.

324
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,946
Light

325
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:32,951
Please come home with me.

326
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:58,184
Light

327
00:40:03,607 --> 00:40:04,441
I am sorry.

328
00:40:49,277 --> 00:40:50,403
This is mine

329
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:55,659
You are also mine.

330
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:35,000
(Stay put and watch the official music video!)

331
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:34,992
Pressing on with leaden feet

332
00:44:35,952 --> 00:44:41,457
Shackled, like how lovers are

333
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:46,837
Waiting for those helping hands

334
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:53,928
but inevitably, the tears come falling down

335
00:44:55,012 --> 00:45:07,108
la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom

336
00:45:07,108 --> 00:45:18,619
la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am

337
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:24,500
If only I could run away from it all

338
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:30,381
and fly towards the light

339
00:45:30,381 --> 00:45:36,262
How do you mend a broken heart

340
00:45:36,304 --> 00:45:42,643
with no difference between night and day

341
00:45:42,643 --> 00:45:45,271
My eyes are shut

342
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:48,941
as I gently call out

343
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:50,484
who are you

344
00:45:50,484 --> 00:46:02,580
la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom

345
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:14,091
la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am

346
00:46:14,592 --> 00:46:19,055
A pair of eyes taken by darkness

347
00:46:20,848 --> 00:46:25,686
A pair of hands never to be held

348
00:46:27,271 --> 00:46:31,275
I’m black and blue, defined by insignificance

349
00:46:31,984 --> 00:46:37,948
I’m a mere speck of dust, so why me

350
00:46:38,407 --> 00:46:44,372
If only I can run away from it all

351
00:46:44,872 --> 00:46:49,835
and fly towards the light

352
00:46:50,586 --> 00:46:56,133
How do you mend a broken heart

353
00:46:56,467 --> 00:47:02,973
with no difference between night and day

354
00:47:03,307 --> 00:47:08,771
If only I can run away from this wasteland

355
00:47:08,813 --> 00:47:14,944
and fly high towards the light

356
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:20,741
It is as if I’m stuck between the light and dark

357
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:27,289
waiting to be seen, to be known

358
00:47:27,289 --> 00:47:33,546
until you came along and showed me

359
00:47:33,838 --> 00:47:34,922
who I am

360
00:47:35,214 --> 00:47:47,309
la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom

361
00:47:47,309 --> 00:47:58,821
la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am

362
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:11,709
la, la, la, la, la, I long for freedom

363
00:48:11,709 --> 00:48:23,220
la, la, la, la, la, as broken as I am
