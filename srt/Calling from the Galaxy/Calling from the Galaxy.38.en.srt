[Episode 38]

27
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,840
All the way here,

28
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,590
how many things have you hidden from me?

29
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,950
All for those treasures,

30
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,230
I've almost lost my life.

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,310
Now even my father
has been seriously injured.

32
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,560
Is this what you want?

33
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,040
Sorry.

34
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,760
Sorry?

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:05,350
Yes, I do like you.

36
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,840
But now it seems

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,750
I am just a pawn after all.

38
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,430
You never really trust me.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,630
You've always hid

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,430
something from me.

41
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,750
All these are just excuses.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,430
You've never

43
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,910
considered me a friend.

44
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,030
So from now on,

45
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,680
I don't need friends like you anymore.

46
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,150
So I am that despicable in your eyes.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,310
Yes, I admit.

48
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,240
I do indeed keep something from you,

49
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,120
but I just don't want

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,190
to tell you all this

51
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,400
and worry you.

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,960
I'm sorry for

53
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,960
involving you and your father in danger.

54
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,360
But that is not my intention.

55
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,430
Let me ask you.

56
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,840
If you have so many secrets,

57
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:11,870
will you leave me without saying a word?

58
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,190
It doesn't matter anymore.

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,080
- My lady.
- My lady.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,190
My lady.

61
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,470
Xuan really has a temper.

62
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,960
I think she had endured too much
in the Immortal Realm before.

63
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,030
Nonsense.

64
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,960
I was wrong.

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,430
I will never say that again.

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,390
However,

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,510
why do we always come back here?

68
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,120
Is

69
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,830
the Tianyang Orb right here?

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,270
Do you mean

71
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,680
the Tianyang Orb
is beneath the Lingxi Pavilion?

72
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:38,390
We've tried so many times.

73
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,480
This is the only reason
that makes sense.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,430
However,

75
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,360
I can't be sure.

76
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,720
There is a surge
of spiritual power down here,

77
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,190
filled with a powerful force.

78
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,750
The Tianyang Orb should be right below.

79
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,310
Do you mean

80
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,040
the Tianyang Orb
is beneath the Lingxi Pavilion?

81
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,600
It's right here.

82
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,160
Then we might as well...

83
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,800
Only Xuan can obtain the Tianyang Orb.

84
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,950

85
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:13,630

86
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,630
I am your past life.

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
This is my messages for you.

88
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,360
Who are you?

89
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,480
Come out.

90
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,120
You can't see me.

91
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
W-Why?

92
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,270
Because I am you.

93
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,870
Me?

94
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,830
Come out!

95
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,750
Otherwise, I'll call for help.

96
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,360
At this critical moment,

97
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,920
I have a quick word with you.

98
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,190
What is it?

99
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,190
It concerns you, Bu Suichen,

100
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,630
and Hong Luan.

101
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,920
Indeed, mortals are bothersome.

102
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,000
But you are no ordinary mortal.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,070
Then who am I?

104
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:15,160
You are Xuan from the Heavenly Realm.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,040
You bear a more important
identity and mission.

106
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,390
What identity? What mission?

107
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,120
Listen to me.

108
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,870
Tonight's moon is so full.

109
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,480
Is Chang'e really on the moon?

110
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:19,800
What?

111
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,430
Aren't you an immortal?

112
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,000
Don't you know this?

113
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
Chang'e really exists,

114
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,240
but she's not on the moon,

115
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:33,670
instead, in the Heaven.

116
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,200
Isn't the moon in the Heaven?

117
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,120
It's all the same.

118
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,670
When you were in the Heavenly Realm,

119
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,720
you especially wanted to meet Chang'e.

120
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,390
I didn't expect you to think the same
when you are in the Mortal Realm.

121
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,870
What?

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,630
You were a Xuan Orb.

123
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,720
Later, Father gave you to me.

124
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,200
After you transformed into a human,

125
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:02,630
I then named you Xuan.

126
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,240
What?

127
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,120
I was an orb?

128
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,630
Impossible. Don't fool me.

129
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:12,910
Look at me now.

130
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,150
I look nothing like an immortal.

131
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:16,320
What should an immortal look like?

132
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,630
Someone like you.

133
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Gu Ci is also an immortal.

134
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,240
Is the threshold
to become an immortal so low?

135
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,120
Xinglan, I'm not joking.

136
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,790
Xuan is my good helper.

137
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:39,360
Back then, she would go
to Secluded Forbidden Area every day

138
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:41,790
to help me purify resentful spirits.

139
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,320
Xuan's favorite food
is White Cream Cakes.

140
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,200
She liked to pick peach blossoms
and put them in a basket,

141
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
then scattered them over me.

142
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,790
She said it made me look like

143
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,600
the immortal from the tales
in the Mortal Realm.

144
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,910
Xuan particularly yearned
for the Mortal Realm.

145
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,480
The love stories,

146
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,080
the delicacies

147
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,480
and the interesting tales

148
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,480
were all things Xuan
longed for greatly.

149
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,480
Really?

150
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,790
Peach blossoms, tales,
and White Cream Cakes.

151
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,750
Well, these hobbies
really are similar to mine.

152
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,320
You are Xuan.

153
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:39,630
Close your eyes.

154
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,720
Is everything you said true?

155
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,150
That day, Southern Dipper
made a bet with me

156
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,750
to have you descend to the Mortal Realm

157
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,320
to experience love.

158
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,910
In fact, it was to have you
collect all the ancient divine treasures

159
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,120
to resolve the Heavenly Tribulation.

160
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,870
Now seeing you in such pain,

161
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,720
I really regret it.

162
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,240
Xuan, I am sorry.

163
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,960
Wait.

164
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:42,510
Then when did you...?

165
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,150
Wait.

166
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,000
So do you like Xuan,

167
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,960
or me?

168
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,480
You are Xuan.

169
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,870
Back then, in the Immortal Realm,

170
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,150
because of my status,

171
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,080
I've kept my love for you hidden.

172
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,390
Until one day,

173
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,870
I saw the letter you wrote to me.

174
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,120
Only then I realized

175
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:12,720
how much I wanted to be with you.

176
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,550
I fell for you over and over again.

177
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,080
Whether in Heavenly Realm
or in the Mortal Realm,

178
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,000
whether you're Yu Xinglan or Xuan.

179
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:24,960
You once asked me

180
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,630
if I would ever leave you.

181
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,000
I can answer you now.

182
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,120
No.

183
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,320
Never.

184
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,360
If one day,

185
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,630
we have to part ways for some reason,

186
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,870
I will still fall for you
over and over again.

187
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,360
Come on.

188
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,670
We won't part way.

189
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,240
Never.

190
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,120
You go down there

191
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,480
to destroy the Tianyang Orb

192
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,600
and kill her.

193
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,150
She is still not coming.

194
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,150
Good buddy, true to your word.

195
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,790
Good besties.

196
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,150
However,

197
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,550
why are you carrying such a bag?

198
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,720
We're not going far today.

199
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,000
We always go far.

200
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:25,910
Right.

201
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,270
Inside here is my unique weapon.

202
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,360
We don't need it today.

203
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,960
The Tianyang Orb is right here.

204
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,390
Right here?

205
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:36,670
Yes.

206
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,150
Beneath the Lingxi Pavilion,

207
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,550
we found immense spiritual power.

208
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,960
Right there.

209
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,960
No wonder we kept being teleported back.

210
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,510
You didn't expect

211
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,200
that you would
end up in my hands, right?

212
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,200
Should I call you Miss Gu,

213
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:06,670
or the Bahuang Corps?

214
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,550
As you wish.

215
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,320
Who sent you here?

216
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,750
What exactly do you want to do?

217
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:25,000
You are so foolish.

218
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:28,000
Apart from your aunt,

219
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,000
who else could command me?

220
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,030
Your aunt really loves you.

221
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:35,200
Stop trying to sow discord.

222
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
As the daughter of the Kunlun Goddess,

223
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:39,720
from beginning to end,

224
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,750
you have been played like a pawn.

225
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,320
When meeting the beloved one,

226
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,240
you could only step aside
and be sidelined.

227
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,440
Why are you putting on
this act of nobility?

228
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,240
You useless thing!

229
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,750
Yes.

230
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,960
Compared to me,

231
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,200
you disregard others and seize at will,

232
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,240
quite in a style of a heroine.

233
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,510
You!

234
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,080
Shut up!

235
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,550
I truly pity you.

236
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,630
Do you think obsession is love?

237
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,550
Do you think
by killing everyone around him

238
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,670
will make him love you?

239
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,720
You are in no position to say that.

240
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,360
Kill me then.

241
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,150
Kill me then.

242
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,840
Who's there?

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,120
We are here
by the order of Heavenly Emperor

244
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,150
to take Fairy Hong Luan back
to the Immortal Realm to get married.

245
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,440
To marry whom?

246
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,320
How dare you!

247
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,750
B-Bahuang Corps?

248
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm asking you who she is to marry.

249
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,400
Northern Dipper Lord.
