00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,270
then take it.

191
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,440
But even if you take it, it's useless.

192
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,030
Why?

193
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,630
I was a white camellia.

194
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,630
For some reason, this lantern

195
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,440
was forgotten here.

196
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,840
This lantern had illuminated me
for hundreds of years

197
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,910
to transform me into a human form.

198
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,870
Except me,

199
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,840
no one can light this lantern.

200
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,080
For such a person,

201
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,720
you have harmed so many innocent lives.

202
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,630
Do you think it's worth it?

203
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,360
Thinking about it now,

204
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:52,150
I have spent my lifetime

205
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,870
all on resenting him,

206
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,510
it's truly not worth it.

207
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,440
You are so silly.

208
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:01,550
Silly?

209
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,880
Perhaps.

210
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,110
But Miss Yu,

211
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:08,000
do you know?

212
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,720
Men

213
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,200
always make many promises
at the beginning.

214
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,200
Those promises

215
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,480
sound sweet at the start.

216
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,110
But very soon, they'll forget them.

217
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:29,240
Don't trust men.
