Who are you?

28
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,910
Why are you being all mysterious here?

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,520
We have been imprisoned here
by eight demons.

30
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,870
They drain our vitality day and night.

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,240
You have made it here.

32
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,910
You must be extraordinarily skilled.

33
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
I wonder if you can

34
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,000

Li, let it be.

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,430
There's no way out.

52
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,680
This must be the end of the cave.

53

Everyone, be careful.

Bu,

61
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:31,120
how is this place so different
from the outside?

62
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,360
It's so gruesome.

63
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,830
I'm exhausted.

64
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,270
Having walked for so long,

65
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,560
we haven't seen a single living thing.

66
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,680

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,390

Everyone, don't struggle.

76
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:53,360
The more you struggle,
the tighter it gets.

77

Bu.

78
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,390
Stop fooling around.

You're quite capable.

For the first time in all these years,

81
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,920
someone has broken

82
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,630
through the numerous obstacles
I set and get here.

83
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,360

86
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,360
If you dare, come out and talk.

87
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,120
You've trespassed into my territory.

I'm in charge here.

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,190
But don't be afraid.

answer my questions,

your ridiculous questions!

00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,070
This must be a trick.

96
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,310
We will.

97
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,240
We'll answer.

98
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,430
Good.

99
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't be nervous.

100
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,000
The first question is very simple.

101
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,680
Who is the person you dislike
the most among the five of you?

102
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,600
What a stupid question!

103
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,270
Do you think you're playing
Truth or Dare?

104
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,070
Can't you ask something useful?

105
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,270
For example,

106
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,680
how much property someone has.

107
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,120
I will ask whatever I love to.

108
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,600
Answer quickly.

109
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,120
No lying allowed.

110
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:12,950
Don't answer.

111
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,190
She's trying to sow discord among us.

112
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,390
Do your relationships need me
to sow discord?

113
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,750
Answer quickly.

114
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,510
Can I choose more than one?

115
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:29,560
You can only choose one.

116
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,720
Then I choose her.

117
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,510
What about the rest of you?

118
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,240
I choose him.

119
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,150
Bu Suichen, you heartless man!

120
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,510
Then I choose Bu Suichen.

121
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Vixen, you haven't answered yet.

122
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,840
I don't dislike anyone.

123
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,270
Everyone must answer.

124
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:54,320
I hate myself.

125
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,390
Stop being hypocritical.

126
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,790
You're lying.

127
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,390
It seems none of you have

128
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,000
taken my question seriously.

129
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,270
Please understand, this is not a game.

130
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,030
How do you know our answers
are true or false?

131
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,910
I listen to the prayers
of the world here every day.

132
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,200
I can tell just by listening.

133
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,510
These vines are highly toxic.

134
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,870
If not resolved within half an hour,

135
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,790
it will penetrate
into your bones and blood.

136
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,150
It won't be long

137
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,720
before you all die of bodily decay.

138
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,670
As long as one person lies,

139
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,000
all five of you will have to die.

140
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,390
I don't want to die yet.

141
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,080
Even in death, I want to be beautiful.

142
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,910
Ice pop, think of a solution quickly.

143
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,960
Let's not lie about this question.

144
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,360
You all look exceptional.

145
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:46,750
You probably don't want to die here.

146
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,440
What she's saying must be true.

147
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,000
These are not ordinary vines.

148
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,000
What should we do then?

149
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,440
Let's just answer her questions for now.

150
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Now listen to my question.

151
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,390
Have you ever kissed
one of the five people?

152
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,440
No.

153
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,720
What about the rest of you?

154
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,750
Answer quickly.

155
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,200
Otherwise, I will activate the poison.

156
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,910
I'll give you ten seconds.

157
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,870
Who? Who hasn't answered yet?

158
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,000
Vixen, is it you?

159
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,240
It's not me.

160
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,000
I think it's you who are flustered.

161
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,030
You don't dare to answer, do you?

162
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,720
Who's flustered? It's clearly you.

163
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,870
It's you.

164
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,440
Yes.

165
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,150
Very good.

166
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,440
Doesn't it feel good to tell the truth?

167
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,790
Being a man,

168
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,790
it's so much better to be sincere.

169
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,840
Isn't it tiring to live in lies all day?

170
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,790
Bu, who actually kissed you?

171
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,910
Were you forced?

172
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,390
Vixen, is it you?

173
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,630
I don't know.

174
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,550
You ask him yourself.

175
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:04,720
It was me.

176
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,440
What?

177
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,550
Why?

178
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:13,790
Even you are competing with me
for a man.

179
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,080
No, Li.

180
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,320
It's not what you think.

181
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,390
Don't quibble.

182
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:21,670
You won't be my brother anymore.

183
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,360
It was like this.

184
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,270
I fell down accidentally last time

185
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,240
and we just touched each other.

186
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,270
Yes, that's right.

187
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,790
He just brushed my face with his lips.

188
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,670
He didn't touch my mouth.

189
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,870
So

190
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,870
don't imagine things,
don't talk nonsense.

191
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,600
Bu, is it true?

192
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,440
I believe you.

193
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,550
Li, I am your own brother.

194
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,840
You believe him but not me.

195
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,910
You little ones are really interesting.

196
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,360
What a lively drama this is!

197
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,750
I enjoyed watching it.

198
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,510
Then let us go.

199
00:11:58,510 --> 00:11:59,600
Why don't you let us out?

200
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,720
Soon.

201
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,510
There's one last question.

202
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,390
What question?

203
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,390
If you could only take one person
away from here,

204
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,480
whom would you choose to take with you?

205
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,200
Didn't you say

206
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,840
that as long as we answered
the questions truthfully,

207
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,960
you would let us go?

208
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,000
When did I ever say that?

209
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,510
I only said

210
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,630
that lying might lead to death.

211
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:21,600
You, shameless!

212
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,670
Of course I'd choose Bu.

213
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,960
Li, I am your own brother.

214
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,270
Choose me.

215
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:31,550
You can get out by yourself.

216
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,720
I'll choose you next time.

217
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,550
There is a next time?

218
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,910
I choose myself.

219
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,150
I...

220
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,960
Bu,

221
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:45,440
would you choose me?

222
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,630
You wouldn't choose my brother,
would you?

223
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,630
Hurry up and leave this place.

224
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,670
You finally arrived.

225
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:31,670
[Jiumi]
Why are you all so nervous?

226
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,320
I just wanted to have a chat with you.

227
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:42,270
We have no other intentions.

228
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,000
We just want to take
the ancient divine treasures.

229
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,390
Guarding the ancient divine treasures
is my mission.

230
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,030
If it's given to you,

231
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,510
what am I to do now?

232
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,840
We won't take your divine treasures
for nothing.

233
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,200
If we give you money,

234
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,390
I suppose you won't want it.

235
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:05,630
Well,

236
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,480
in the Mortal Realm,

237
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,200
I will set up a market

238
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:09,840
exactly like this one for you.

239
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,600
It will have a much higher foot traffic
than just five people.

240
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,910
You're sure to make a good profit.

241
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,870
Consider this: Fifty wen a day.

242
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:19,840
What about a month?

243
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,030
That would be
one thousand five hundred wen.

244
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:25,030
In a year, it's a whole lot of money.

245
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,320
Do you think this is good?

246
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:29,910
Little girl,

247
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,240
do you think I would care about this?

248
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,150
You are Chen?

249
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,600
Do you know each other?

250
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,510
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

251
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,150
You vixen,

252
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,720
are you also from Yuluo House?

253
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,870
Why do you...?

254
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,720
Li, shut up.

255
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,960
Impossible, I have not mistaken.

256
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
You clearly know what I'm talking about.

257
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,270
How is your mother now?

258
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,120
Why do you ask about my mother?

259
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:17,360
Who are you, really?

260
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:21,550
I am the fairy fox
who was by your mother's side.

261
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,440
Bu.

262
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,840
Bu, are you alright?

263
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,550
I can't believe
I've met a real fox spirit.

264
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,870
She has nine tails.

265
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,200
How old are you?

266
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,750
Your mother?

267
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,030
The fairy fox?

268
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,790
Why has my Mother never mentioned her?

269
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,910
What's your name?

270
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,150
Jiumi.

271
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,000
Chiu mi...

272
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,080
Someone, take her away quickly.

273
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,550
If you are the fairy fox
that was by my mother's side,

274
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,790
why are you guarding the treasures here?

275
00:16:58,630 --> 00:16:59,790
I encountered a mishap

276
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,120
and was banished to the Mortal Realm.

277
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,160
Then I took on the mission
to guard the divine treasures here.

278
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,590
What on earth are they
talking about over there?

279
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,070
The Mortal Realm?

280
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,350
Where was she before?

281
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:11,680
In Heaven?

282
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:16,750
There are mosquitoes.

283
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,030
Seven, eight.

284
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,240
There's something wrong with her.

285
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,920
She actually only has eight tails.
