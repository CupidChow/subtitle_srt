[Episode 20]

27
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:43,400
These days away from Heavenly Palace,

28
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,710
who will take care of
the Secluded Forbidden Area?

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,870
Every day, immortals go
to purify resentful spirits.

30
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,790
Then, who is conducting the training
for newcomers on my behalf?

31
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,710
Immortal Puti.

32
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,310
Immortal Puti?

33
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,870
Let's hope he doesn't turn
all newcomers into drunkards.

34
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,400
That won't happen.

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,430
Is there someone cleaning
the Southern Dipper Mansion?

36
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,200
Make a guess.

37
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,630
Well,

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,750
who's this Jiumi?

39
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,800
According to her,

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,800
she is a fairy pet
by the Heavenly Empress.

41
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,430
Muchen, haven't you heard of it?

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,630
No, it's a bit suspicious.

43
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,910
Anyway,

44
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,680
she didn't hurt us

45
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,280
and gave us all the treasures.

46
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,630
There's no need for her to lie.

47
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,310
Perhaps.

48
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,800
Well, she's really benevolent.

49
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,120
Want to cultivate to become an immortal,

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
one must be benevolent.

51
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,400
It should be more so
after being immortals.

52
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,030
That being said,

53
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,360
it's difficult to do so.

54
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,840
Hold on.

55
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,630
What do you mean?

56
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,560
Are you saying I'm not benevolent?

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,680
No, you're overthinking it.

58
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,120
Yes.

59
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,240
It's easy to fulfill oneself,

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,000
but it's difficult to fulfil others.

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,150
Perhaps it's always hard
for one to fulfill themselves.

62
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,430
Bu.

63
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,190
It smells so good.

64
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,190
With so much good food.

65
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,910

67
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,000
Alright.

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,840
Bu.

69
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:42,800
Come on, Manman.

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,680
Have you secured the treasure?

71
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,870
Come on.

72
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:48,840
So many dishes.

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,520
Come on.

00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,430
Manman, you sit here.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
My bestie Gongsun Manman

76
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,470
is treating us this meal.

77
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,030
Enjoy, everyone.

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,000

Cheers!

80
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,840
Cheers!

81
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,360
This tastes really good.

82
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,400
Bu.

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,630
Guess which dishes I ordered.

84
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,600
These vegetarian dishes, right?

85
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,830
Bu, you know me so well.

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,870
Eating vegetarian is healthy.

87
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Not like that money grubber,

88
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,920
always eating those greasy foods.

89
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:39,160
Bu, which dishes do you like most?

90
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,270
Dongpo pork.

91
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,800
But you don't like to eat meat.

92
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,240
I like it now.

93
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,390
Manman, let me tell you.

94
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,600
This treasure hunting

95
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,070
was much more interesting
than the first one.

96
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,720
We even met

97
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,680
an Immortal Fox named Jiumi.

98
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,040
Choo.

99
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
She even gave us two treasures.

100
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,430
That amazing?

101
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
So when do you plan

102
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,720
to look for the third treasure?

103
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,720
We shall set off tomorrow.

104
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,950
Why the rush?

105
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,390
However,

106
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
I still haven't figured out the question

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,070
she asked.

108
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,680
You were all so strange.

109
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,240
Ci.

110
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,870
Did Bu really kiss you?

111
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,680
Actually...

112
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,190
Yes, yes.

113
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,190
But,

114
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,390
I don't know whether
he secretly kissed someone else

115
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,310
behind my back.

116
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,390
Bu might kiss me

117
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,480
when I was sleeping.

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,510
Miss Gu, you're overthinking it.

119
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,310
Li.

120
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,480
Sit back down, don't embarrass yourself.

121
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,360
Let's eat.

122
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,830
It can't be either of them.

123
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,040
Alright, the dishes are getting cold.

124
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,870
Let's eat.

125
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,680
This fine wine is top-notch.

126
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,070
Cheers!

127
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,560
Cheers!

128
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,310
Cheers!

129
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:58,920
Everyone, tell me
who the greatest contributor is

130
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,240
to this treasure hunting.

131
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,190
Who is it?

132
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:11,830
Who?

133
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,560
What are you doing?

134
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,190
What's wrong?

135
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,510
It's really a waste

136
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,750
to let you have such fine wine.

137
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,680
I'm going to drink my fill today.

138
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:33,600
Miss Yu, this cup is Mr. Bu's.

139
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,480
Well, did anyone

140
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,680
listen to what I said?

141
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,510
No.

142
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,510
Bring me another pot of wine.

143
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,000
Miss Yu, you've drunk.

144
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,040
Time to rest.

145
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,750
I haven't.

146
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,800
I don't want to listen to you.

147
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,360
Xinglan, take it slow.

148
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,270
Serve the wine.

149
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,680
Let's drink.

150
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,000
Serve the wine.

151
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,270
I want to drink.

152
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:12,360
Alright.

153
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:17,630
I want to drink.

154
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,950
Let's drink.

155
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,390
You are Chen?

156
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,790
Do you know each other?

157
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,600
I think you've mistaken me
for someone else.

158
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,270
You vixen,

159
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,910
are you also from Yuluo House?

160
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,080
Why do you...?

161
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,000
Li, shut up.

162
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,150
Impossible, I have not mistaken.

163
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
You clearly know what I'm talking about.

164
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,440
How is your mother now?

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,270
Why do you ask about my mother?

166
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,550
Who are you, really?

167
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,440
I am the fairy fox
who was by your mother's side.

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,480
I have never heard Mother
mention the nine-tailed fox.

169
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,720
I must go back and ask her.

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,750
Greetings, Mother.

171
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,600
Chen.

172
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,150
Why didn't you tell me in advance
when you returned?

173
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,320
Come sit down and talk.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,320
Are you doing well recently?

175
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,240
What could be wrong with me?

176
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,200
I often miss you.

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,670
Chen, during your time
in the Mortal Realm,

178
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,390
why have you become thinner?

179
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,270
It is my fault
for not coming back to see you often,

180
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,670
which has made you worried.

181
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,440
Have you gotten used to life
in the Mortal Realm?

182
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,320
The environment of the Mortal Realm
is not like that of the Immortal Realm.

183
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,240
Do you often feel

184
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,030
that your spiritual power
is somewhat obstructed?

185
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,750
Indeed.

186
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
But I am lucky

187
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,870
that I haven't encountered
anything perilous.

188
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,440
That's good then.

189
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,910
Then I am at ease.

190
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,960
Come on, tell me

191
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,750
if you met anything interesting
in the Mortal Realm.

192
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,670
Maybe later.

193
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,320
I come back this time

194
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,270
to ask you something.

195
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,120
Has the Immortal Realm
ever had the fairy fox?

196
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,030
The fairy fox?

197
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:01,000
The Immortal Realm
has never had the fairy fox.

198
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,150
Why do you ask such a question?

199
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,960
During my treasure hunting,

200
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,440
I encountered a Demon Fox,

201
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,030
who claims to be your fairy fox.

202
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,750
My fairy fox?

203
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,440
I remember now.

204
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,080
Many years ago,

205
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,790
I indeed had a fairy fox.

206
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,870
But she was too mischievous,

207
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,510
and sneaked down there
without permission.

208
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:33,670
This Demon Fox was so mischievous,

209
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,870
why would you still entrust

210
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:36,840
her the Silver Leaf Jade Flower

211
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,080
and Dutian Seal?

212
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,030
So you have already obtained
these two divine treasures?

213
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,550
That is great.

214
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,320
But you must be careful

215
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,080
and guard
these two divine treasures well.

216
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,390
Be alert.

217
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,670
I understand.

218
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,150
Besides,

219
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,960
you and Ming should come back

220
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,080
once you've done your affairs.

221
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,360
Thank you for your concern.
I understand.

222
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,720
Good, then you go get busy.

223
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,790
I also need to rest.

224
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:10,910
Mother.

225
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,270
I still have a question.

226
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,510
Chen, what is it?

227
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,840
When did you have this fairy fox?

228
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,750
When?

229
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,840
Probably before you were born.

230
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,080
Then why haven't I
ever heard you mention it?

231
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,720
This fairy fox was really mischievous.

232
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,750
Ever since she ran away,

233
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,360
I didn't want to mention her again.

234
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,720
Chen, do you have any other questions?

235
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,320
Might as well ask them all at once.

236
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,440
Then, I shall take my leave for today.

237
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,630
I didn't expect you would be like this
in the Mortal Realm.

238
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:13,670
Why are you here?

239
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,910
You are here too.

240
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:25,670
You will still go
to the Mortal Realm, right?

241
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,840
Indeed, the Mortal Realm is interesting.

242
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,750
Do you also like the Mortal Realm?

243
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,790
The women of the Mortal Realm
are interesting,

244
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,390
not like the people
of the Immortal Realm,

245
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,270
so bound by rules and propriety.

246
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,870
Indeed.

247
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,120
I really envy them.

248
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,600
If I were a woman of the Mortal Realm,

249
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,870
I wonder if I could live just like them.

250
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,480
Fairy Hong Luan.

251
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,910
Whether in the Immortal Realm
or the Mortal Realm,

252
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,510
people are different from each other.

253
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,910
Just be yourself,

254
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,870
and don't mind others.
