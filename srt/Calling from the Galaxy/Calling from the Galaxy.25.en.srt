I'm afraid the road ahead
will be even more perilous.

193
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,910
Bu, don't worry.

194
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,440
As long as you're with me,

195
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,550
I won't let anyone hurt you.

196
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,840
Let's not linger here, shall we?

197
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,440
Let's find a place to live in.

198
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,150
Stop bossing us around.

199
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,510
Come on!

200
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,320
Let's go.

201
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,720
Bu, be careful.

202
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,030
Bahuang Corps.

203
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,240
Yes?

204
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,550
Apparently, I underestimated them.

205
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,840
Even the Liangyi Formation
didn't trap them.

206
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,200
You go to the Mortal Realm at once

207
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:56,870
and prevent them
from gathering the treasures.

208
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,080
Yes.
