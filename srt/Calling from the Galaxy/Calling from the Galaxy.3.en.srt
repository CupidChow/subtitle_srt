Is it fun?

28
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,310
In the storybooks of the Mortal Realm,

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,520
it's all written like this.

Just thinking about it feels
so romantic and moving.

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,000
All day long, you talk
about the Mortal Realm.

You might just go there.

It hurts when the fruit hits me.

to do with His Highness,

Is there something bothering you?

I remember

157

it was here that you

158
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,200
fished me out.

In the blink of an eye,

160
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,390
I have accompanied you
for so many years.

00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,670
It only seems so.

177
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:43,550
Of course not.

178

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,670
how much Xuan likes those

189
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,080
love stories from the Mortal Realm.

190
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,720
Whether it's you, me or Xuan,

191
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:10,630
we do not need mortal love.

192
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,870
So please

193
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,510
do not show her those

194
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,600
vulgar things anymore.

195
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,120
You simply don't understand her.

196
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,390
Xuan belongs to me.

197
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,120
She will surely not fall into love.

198
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,270
Fine.

199
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,720
Do you dare to go ask her with me?

200
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,910
Why wouldn't I dare?

201
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,000
Alright, let's make a bet.

202
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,600
If you lose,

203
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,150
you have to give me your Cosmos Pendant.

204
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,960
I won't lose.

205
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,510
Xuan.

206
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,440
What's up?

207
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,550
Your Highness,

208
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,360
have you brought a new storybook?

209
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,200
I made a bet
with the Northern Dipper Lord.

210
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,150
What bet?

211
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:11,440
I also want to make a bet.

212
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,000
Should we give Xuan a chance

213
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,150
and let her descend to the Mortal Realm

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,440
to see if she will have
true feelings there?

215
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,790
Great.

216
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,270
Great, Your Highness.

217
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,360
Nonsense.

218
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,870
Your Highness,

219
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,750
I know

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,200
you don't like me reading
those mortal storybooks.

221
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,550
But

222
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,630
the stories of gifted scholars
and beautiful ladies in those books

223
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,120
are just too romantic, too touching.

224
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,150
I really wish to go
to the Mortal Realm just once.

225
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,120
Perhaps,

226
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,910
there will be a tall, mighty,

227
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,240
graceful, and suave gentleman

228
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,670
who will fall in love with me.

229
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,320
Then there will be

230
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:59,360
a grand wedding
like those in the Mortal Realm.

231
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,600
The Mortal Realm is not as you imagine.

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,840
It's dangerous there, and human hearts
are unpredictable.

233
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,320
You will encounter danger.

234
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,670
How would you know?

235
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,510
Have you been there?

236
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,150
Is there anything in the six realms
that I don't know about?

237
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,840
It's not so.

238
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,670
The storybooks all say

239
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,360
that birth, aging, sickness,
and death of humans

240
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,270
are all predestined.

241
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,960
Even if it's as you say,

242
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,000
I am willing to accept my own fate.

243
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
If you go to the Mortal Realm,

244
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,670
who will purify the resentful spirits
in the Secluded Forbidden Area?

245
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,910
Who will tend to the flowers
and plants in this courtyard?

246
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:37,870
I will.

247
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,080
Leave all of it to me.

248
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,750
Thank you, Your Highness.

249
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,870
Your Highness, please give me a chance.

250
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,000
Okay?

251
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,720
Even if things don't go as desired,

252
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,360
I will never regret it.

253
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,790
Your Highness.

254
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,910
Your Highness, is that okay?

255
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,510
I can't beat you in chess.

256
00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:01,240
But I'm certain to win this bet.

257
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:22,510
Your Highness,

258
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,840
I'm going to the Mortal Realm
that I most long for.

259
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,550
Forgive me for leaving
without saying goodbye.

260
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,510
But I'm afraid
I can't bear to leave you.

261
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,150
You won't be angry, right?

262
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,510
With this farewell,

263
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,840
it might be a very long time
before we see each other again.

264
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:51,360
Or perhaps we'll never meet again.

265
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,480
Therefore,

266
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,510
I've left this letter.

267
00:15:57,870 --> 00:15:59,790
In it, I've written words

268
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,630
I didn't dare to say to your face.

269
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:06,320
Actually, since the day
I took human form,

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,790
I've loved everything
about the Heavenly Realm.

271
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:12,790
I've even found purifying
resentful spirits enjoyable.

272
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,840
I often

273
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,360
imagine myself becoming a fairy,

274
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,870
standing proudly by your side.

275
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,200
But all this is just too beautiful.

276
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,510
So beautiful that

277
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:33,510
it's not something
a mere bead like me should yearn for.

278
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:39,150
So I want to forget everything,

279
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:42,910
go to the Mortal Realm,
be an ordinary woman

280
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,360
and live an ordinary and happy life

281
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:47,510
with an ordinary man

282
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
who loves me the most.

283
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,270
Rest assured.

284
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,750
He will also buy me White Cream Cakes.

285
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,200
Bracelets, dressing tables,
and everything.

286
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,870
I will have them all.

287
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,360
I will surely be very happy
in the Mortal Realm.

288
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,480
You and Fairy Hong Luan
must also be happy.

289
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,310
This should be the first time
I've defied you.

290
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,440
Let me be rebellious this once.

291
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,440
Just this once.

292
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,590
If there is a next time,

293
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,960
I will surely obediently follow
your wishes.

294
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,310
By Xuan.

295
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
18 years ago,
Mrs. Yu had a difficult labor.

296
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,440
Suddenly, an omen appeared in the sky.

297
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,350
Mrs. Yu had her final moment of clarity

298
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,000
and gave birth to a baby girl
before she died,

299
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,350
who became the eldest daughter
of the Yu family

300
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,110
and the eighth-generation successor
of Lingxi Pavilion.

301
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,680
Excuse me.

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,160
Take a look at the floral umbrella.

♪The screen is covered
