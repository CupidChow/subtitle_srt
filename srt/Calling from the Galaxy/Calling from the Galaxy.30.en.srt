Didn't you realize it?

Be quiet. Just a piece of jade.

00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,430

00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,080
Don't talk nonsense.

44

Okay, let's be serious.

When will you turn me back?

62
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm dying of boredom.

63
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,400
You always silence my voice.

64
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,080
My spiritual power is limited
in the Mortal Realm.

65
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,910
Once I return to the Immortal Realm,

66
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,470
I will naturally turn you back.

67
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,470
Then hurry up with it.

68
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:14,080
Why wait any longer?

69

You can't leave Xuan
and return to the Immortal Realm?

70
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,400
Please, it won't take much time.

- So annoying.

00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,910
cultivation is much easier.

79

It's a secret. Sorry, I can't tell you.

80
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,920
You're not cooking for me, are you?

81
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,720
No, I'm not.

82
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,430

No.

89
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:35,480

00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,270

Okay.

103
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,950
Then you treat.

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll order many dishes.

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,160
Okay.

106
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,630
No problem.

107
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:02,160
Let's go.

108
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,120
Let's go.

109
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,870

115
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,510
We met again.

116
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,040
I'm sorry about before.

117

There are new products today.

118
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Take a look.

119
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,120
This cinnabar color suits you well.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,430

Why are you staring at me?

127
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,630
Is it fun to watch me eat?

128
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:51,750
Why aren't you speaking?

129
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,480
No talk at meals.

130
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:02,950
Try this.

131
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,720

Alright.

135
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,560
Why is your face red?

136
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,430
Boring.

137
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,240
Madam, please add more for us.

138
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,120
Why can't I get what I want?

139
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,830
Yet she gets it so easily.

140
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,870

141
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,120
Yes.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,510
But now, they're not here.

143
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,680
Only the two of us are left.

144
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,070
If it comes to a fight...

145
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,670
Leave it to me.

You look suspicious.

On the street,

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,200
did you see the little rouge box
from the vendor?

155
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,670
Why do you suddenly bring this up?

156
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,080
Are you using rouge?

157
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,200
The rouge box looks pretty nice.

158
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,240
How about I buy it for your home?

159
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,790
You're so cruel.

160
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:15,550
How could you heartlessly

161
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:17,390
lock me up in a little box?

162
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,840
If you hate it, then shut up.

163

Can't you chat with me? Don't be petty.

164

Look, you two have held hands,

169
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,030

Yes.

179

I have something to tell you.
