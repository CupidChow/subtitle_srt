[Episode 39]

27
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:40,510
Then let's go.

28
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:42,230
Wait.

29
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,840
Father, why are you here?

30
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,840
Y-You can't go in there!

31
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:52,400
Father, why is there such a place

32
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,430
beneath the Lingxi Pavilion?

33
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,040
You've always known it, right?

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,280
You must have a lot of doubts.

35
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:01,200
That's right.

36
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,760
The Tianyang Orb is indeed in there,

37
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,790
but it seals

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,310
the ancient demon beast, Chishan.

39
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:12,630
Lingxi Pavilion gathers
the treasures of the six realms.

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,310
The purpose is to reinforce the seal

41
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,430
with their immortal aura.

42
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:20,560
The Heavenly Tribulation is imminent.

43
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,470
If we can't obtain the Tianyang Orb,

44
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,870
I'm afraid the six realms
will face even more tribulations.

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,430
Master Yu, rest assured.

46
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,630
Such a minor demon, Chishan,

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,560
the two of us

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
can easily take it down.

49
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,520
But Chishan

50
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,080
is not that easily defeated.

51
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:40,000
Master Yu, sorry.

52
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,840
We will definitely take Chishan down.

53
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,520
Father, just trust them.

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,910
Moreover,

55
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,240
I've brought
our family's secret weapons.

56
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,190
We can beat Chishan up.

57
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,800
Let's go.

58
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,560
Let's go.

59
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,360
Can't believe the underground
of Lingxi Pavilion is so deep.

60
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,240
Be careful.

61
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,560
Bu, I want to be led by the hand too.

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,870
I'm about to throw up my breakfast.

63
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,470
"I'm about to throw up my breakfast."

64
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:25,870
We are almost there.

65
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,960
Don't be afraid, I'm here.

66
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm not afraid at all.

67
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,520
Be careful.

68
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,360
Looks like we're getting closer
to the Tianyang Orb.

69
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,430
The Tianyang Orb
is an ancient divine treasure.

70
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,480
But this place is surging
with a strong demonic aura.

71
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,870
It seems that Chishan
is pretty powerful.

72
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,160
What? Are you scared?

73
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,800
I am scared.

74
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,190
You hold my hand.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,680
Then I have to agree to your request.

76
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,040
This is Xuanyang Cave.

77
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,830
Leave this place.

79
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,390
An ancient demon beast is sealed here.

00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,430
No trespassing is allowed.

81
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,600
What?

82
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,040
Do you know who I am?

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,750
I am the Southern Dipper Lord.

84
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,070
I don't know you.

85
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
This is the Northern Dipper Lord.

86
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,920
Cut the crap and leave now.

87
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,160
Today I shall let you know us.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,870
Unfortunately,

89
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,190
you have no chance to know us anymore.

90
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,310
Maybe in your next lives.

91
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,190
I will restrain Chishan with Gu Ci.

92
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,680
Then you'd seize the chance
to take the Tianyang Orb.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,680
Okay.

94
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,360
All you need to do is
to take the Tianyang Orb.

95
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,120
I'll take care of the rest.

96
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,480
I trust you.

97
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,630
It's been a long time
since anyone has visited me.

98
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,560
He is really ugly.

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,750
Two immortals and one orb.

100
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:43,390
Funny.

101
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,270
Unexpectedly, there are people
in the Immortal Realm who remember me.

102
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,390
What an honor!

103
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,310
You are old,
but the eyesight is still not bad.

104
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,720
Resemble her... Really.

105
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,510
What do you mean?

106
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,720
I didn't expect

107
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,750
to see the son
of an old acquaintance here.

108
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,360
Is despicable Ziguang,
your mother, still well?

109
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,040
Shut up!

110
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,870
I am sealed here,

111
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,360
spending a thousand years
in this dark place.

112
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,720
All thanks to your mother.

113
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,150
Today,

114
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:46,030
are you here to atone for Ziguang

115
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,630
and let me go?

116
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,910
You have done many evil things
for the six realms.

117
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,630
She sealed you here

118
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,200
to uphold justice.

119
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,960
Great!

120
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,870
You ugly, what are you laughing at?

121
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,790
You are here

122
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,360
for the Tianyang Orb, right?

123
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,390
Your mother sealed me in this place,

124
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,910
yet, you are here
to try to break the seal.

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
Heaven is really wise.

126
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,200
My mother was kind-hearted,

127
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,510
and allowed you to live until this day.

128
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,750
I am determined
to obtain the Tianyang Orb.

129
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,240
And I have to take your life too.

130
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Ignorant!

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,320
Once the Tianyang Orb stirs,

132
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,120
the changes in the world
are beyond anyone's prediction.

133
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:37,840
Then let's give it a try.

134
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:58,080
This demon is really powerful.

135
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Xinglan, get the orb.

136
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,630
Okay.

137
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,480
Xinglan, don't be afraid.

138
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,840
It's been a thousand years.

139
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,270
What happened to Master Yu?

140
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,440
I wonder how the lady
and the others are going.

141
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,080
If this continues,

142
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,600
what about our salary this month?

143
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,200
Do you think Master Yu can't hear you?

144
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,000
Master Yu.

145
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,670
Master Yu.

146
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
Master Yu, you are amazing.

147
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,440
Master Yu, impressive.

148
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:44,440
You two stay here.

149
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,440
Stop.

150
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,840
Girl, are you scared?

151
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,030
What?

152
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,440
I don't know what's scare.

153
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,600
How arrogant!

154
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,320
Back then, many immortals
descended from the Heaven

155
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,440
were crushed to dust by me.

156
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,440
Only that despicable Ziguang

157
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,080
used the orb to seal me in here.

158
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,480
If I want to pinch you to death today,

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,750
just like pinching an ant to death.

160
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,080
I-I admit you are formidable.

161
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,080
But...

162
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,600
But the Lingxi Pavilion
is full of treasures.

163
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:50,360
And you absolutely can't withstand

164
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,120
my three heirloom treasures.

165
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,720
Heirloom treasures?

166
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,670
You're picking up trash atop my head.

167
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,630
What treasures could you possibly have?

168
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,390
Don't rush.

169
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,670
I'll show you.

170
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,000
This is it.

171
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,960
What are you laughing at?

172
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,750
I have other treasures.

173
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,120
Ignorant!

174
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,630
I really want to see
what else treasures you have.

175
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,750
What is she doing?

176
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,200
Buying us time.

177
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,080
Then let's hurry up and heal.

178
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,790
This whip is called Ruthless,

179
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:57,120
used to belong to Zhou Zhiqiang,
the eighth-generation leader

180
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,030
of the Emei Sect of Mount Shu.

181
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,960
As she was betrayed
by the Dark Sect leader, Zhang Youji,

182
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,320
so she bestowed
all her martial prowess into this whip.

183
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,440
It punishes the people
indulging in stupid romance.

184
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,630
Who is Zhou Zhiquiang?

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,630
I've always been ruthless.
