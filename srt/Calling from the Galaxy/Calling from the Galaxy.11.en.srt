191
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,480
The price just now

192
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,320
was already the best discount.

193
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,080
It really can't be any cheaper.

194
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,790
I can't take it anymore.

195
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,080
You just want me to release you.

196
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,550
I will do it then.

197
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,910
I don't know.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:11,960
I don't see anything.

199
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:14,750
Don't worry.

200
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,390
My lady.

201
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:16,600
I will not tell anyone

202
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,720
that you opened this cell door.

203
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,720
In business, we must value integrity.

204
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,600
Otherwise, it won't last long.

205
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Stop it.

206
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,750
You just said to release me.

207
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,240
I've never said that.

208
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,360
Chase her!

209
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:41,560
[Peony Villa]

210
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,670
Flowers. There are flowers!

211
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:02,960
Flowers.

212
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:11,550
We've arrived Peony Villa.

213
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,790
Why are you shouting so loudly?

214
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,240
You scared me.

215
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,750
Sorry, sorry.

216
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,120
I was too excited.

217
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,240
I didn't expect Peony Villa
to be so mysterious.

218
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,320
The place is filled with demonic aura.

219
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,670
Be careful.

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,270
I think you're the one
with the most demonic aura here.

221
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,910
Where have you two been?

222
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,840
Suan, Tian.

223
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,480
Why are you here?

224
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:30,960
Step back.

225
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,510
Bu.

226
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,510
Don't hit me.

227
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:44,320
Help!

228
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,630
Bu Suichen.

229
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,120
Apart from Northern Dipper Lord
of the Immortal Realm,

230
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
who else can pick up
the stars in the sky?

231
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,550
I saved your life,
so how will you repay me?

232
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,870
I'll save yours in the future.

233
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,480
You two!

234
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,480
Let go of me.

235
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,550
Bu, save me.

236
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,030
Are you alright?

237
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,360
Bu.

238
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,910
Are you okay?

239
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,630
They are alright,

240
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,320
but need some time to wake up.

241
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,030
Someone used the sorcery on them.

242
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:10,640
Let's go.
