Four thousand taels.

189
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,870
It's four thousand taels now.

190
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,360
Anyone want to raise the price?

191
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,270
Sir, look.

192
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,000
So many people are eager to have them.

193
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,150
If you think
they're not worth the money,

194
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,910
better to sell them to someone
who appreciates their value.

195
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,550
Exactly.

196
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,000
You'll not only find a good buyer
for the treasure

197
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,080
but can also make some money.

198
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,360
Of course.

199
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,480
Since you're selling them
at my Lingxi Pavilion,

200
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,320
I must take a commission.

201
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,390
Are you selling them or not?

202
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,240
Exactly.

203
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,510
Yeah, are you selling them or not?

204
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,440
Are you selling them?

205
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,390
Are you selling them?

206
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,480
Dawdling.

207
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,840
Mere two thousand taels

208
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:27,000
are not worth mentioning to me.

209
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,200
But these walnuts

210
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,600
are naturally not for sale.

211
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,480
Not for sale.

212
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,480
Worth a fortune.

213
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,790
May I know your name?

214
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,960
I am Gu Ci,
the eldest son of the Gu family.

215
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,440
So he's the big spender
of the Gu family.

216
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:09,550
I have long admired your reputation.

217
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,240
Our store now has a lot of new items.

218
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,550
Would you like to come in
and have a look?

219
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,790
No need.

220
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,200
Today, I am preoccupied
with some matters.

221
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,670
I will visit you another day.

222
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,240
He left just like that?

223
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,440
Let's continue looking.

224
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,960
Wait.

225
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,840
My walnuts.

226
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,720
Come on, let's continue.

227
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,080
So many treasures, so much money.

228
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
My lady.

229
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,360
Bad news, my lady!

230
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,150
So flustered, what a sight!

231
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,390
- What a sight!
- What a sight!

232
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,080
My lady, I have heard...

233
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:50,790
I heard our master...

234
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,630
What happened to my father?

235
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,720
Our master was robbed by bandits

236
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,030
and was killed.

237
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,910
What?

238
00:11:59,030 --> 00:11:59,870
My lady!
