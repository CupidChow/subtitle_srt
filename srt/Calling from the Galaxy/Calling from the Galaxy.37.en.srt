00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,400
Mr. Bu.

28
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,840
Yesterday, my lady was lost in thought
holding this wooden hairpin.

29
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,080
Later, we somehow fell asleep.

30
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,190
When we woke up,
my lady and Master Yu were missing.

31
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,310
We've searched everywhere.

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,590
I hope they are not in trouble.

33
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,470
Does your lady have any enemies?

34
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,400
To keep the two of them safe,

35
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,710
come to the pine bamboo forest
with the treasure at midnight to exchange.

36
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,280
There's demonic aura.

37
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,560
Gu Li?

38
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:16,910
The aura is similar,

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,750
but the scent is different.

40
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,680
Impressive.

41
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,680
Did you bring the thing?

42
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,680
Where are they?

44
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:53,750
Mr. Bu.

45
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,720
It seems he can't hear us.

46
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,830
Hand over the thing.

47
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,240
You can have the treasure,

48
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,240
but let them go first.

49
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,190
You put the treasure
on the ground first.

50
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,070
Step back.

51
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,430
Father.

52

Father, what's wrong?

53

Xinglan, are you alright?

54
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,360
It's none of your business.

55
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,040
It's all because of
those treasures again.

This time, even my father
got dragged into this.

Go away!

Father.

62
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,600
It took no effort.

Father, how are you?

Xinglan.

67
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,920
I've been asking you

68
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,310
to take on the family mission

69
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,430
to search for
the five ancient divine treasures.

70
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,040
From now on,

71
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,870
this mission has nothing to do with you.

72
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,040
Why?

73
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:58,830
Father.

74
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
Now,
only the last divine treasure is left.

75
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,270
And once I find it,

76
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,270
then all will be gathered.

77
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:10,680
Xinglan, those are
all external possessions.

78
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,070
My only hope

79
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:16,510
is for you to live

80
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,750
a peaceful and happy life.

81
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,270
I'm getting old

82
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,510
and can no longer take care of you.

83
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,270
But to me,

84
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,790
you are my greatest concern.

85
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,320

86
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,000
You can be with me for a very long time.

87
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,550
Don't think wild.

88
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
Okay.

89
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,000
But, Father,

90
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,750
I would still search for

91
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,510
the ancient divine treasures.

92
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,440
But I assure you

93
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,360
I will definitely return safely.

94
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,550
By then,

95
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,630

Xinglan.

97
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,840
I-I didn't want to tell you this.

98
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
Searching for
the ancient divine treasures

99
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,870
is just a cover story.

100
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,720
The Yu family's true task

101
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,720
is to protect the Lingxi Pavilion.

102

103
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,200

Let's set off.

Inside the Cosmos Pendant,
there's only chaos.

00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,390
The Tianyang Orb is mysterious,

112
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,080
and no one knows where it is.

113
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,670
It seems this is true.

114
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,790
Don't mind it.

115
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,630
Let's just follow the guidance
of the Cosmos Pendant.

116
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,030
Xinglan, let's go.

117
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,910
Bu Suichen, for you,

118
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,390
is finding treasures that important?

119
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,360
Xinglan, do you want
to trust me once more?

120
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,000
Alright, I'll trust you once more.

121
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,120
Take good care of father.

123
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,910
I'll be back shortly.

124
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,790
My lady, you are back so quickly.

125
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,030
My lady, it's good you're safe.

126
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,240
I think I made a mistake in positioning.

127
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,600
Let's try again.

128
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,870
Try again.

129
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,360
What are they doing?

130
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,870
I don't understand it either.

131
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,510
My lady, I miss you

132
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,790
so much.

133
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,550
My lady, I miss you the most.

134
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,150
I miss you so much

135
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,960
that I can't sleep
for three days and nights.

136
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,910
Three days and nights?

137
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,910
Have we gone for three days and nights?

138
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,320
No, my lady.

139
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:10,840
This is just a figure of speech.

140
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
It represents I really

141
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,750
miss you.

142
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,270
This...

143
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,080
It's none of my business.

144
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:20,630
Good things come through hardship.

145
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:24,080
Miss Yu, after you.

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,960
Don't try to compete with me
for my lady's favor.

148
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,910
Look at yourself.

149
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:47,270
How dare you!

150
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,440
Suan, right here,

151
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:51,440
it's only I who competes with you.

152
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,480
Either in the past, in the present,

153
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,200
or in the future.

154
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,440
- My lady.
- My lady.

155
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,670
I miss you again.

156
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,000
Let go.

157
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:15,790
It should not be so.

158
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,200
Could it be...?

159
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,120
What does this mean?

160
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:23,480
I don't want to go anymore.

161
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,630
If you want to go, go by yourselves.

162
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,440
Let me go.

Don't lose your temper.

165
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
Maybe there's something wrong
with the Lingxi Portal.

166
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,630
You're good at

167
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,000
talking nonsenses.

168
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,600
The Lingxi Portal

169
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,870
has always been operating normally

170
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,000
from my ancestors.

171
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,630
You said there's something wrong
with the Lingxi Portal.

172
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,750
I think
there's something wrong with you.

173
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,550
If it weren't for the fact
that only you can obtain the treasure,

174
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,150
we wouldn't beg you to go.

175
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,670
What did you say?

176
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,720
Nothing, nothing at all.

177
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,920
So you've been using me all along.

178
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,270
Xinglan.

179
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,720
Indeed, only you could have obtained
the Tianyang Orb,

180
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,640
but we didn't use you at all.

181
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,030
Mr. Bu.

182
00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:16,160
Can you stop treating me like a fool?

183
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,070
All the way here,

184
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,830
how many things have you hidden from me?

185
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,200
All for those treasures,

186
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,480
I've almost lost my life.

187
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,550
Now even my father
has been seriously injured.

188
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,790
Is this what you want?

189
