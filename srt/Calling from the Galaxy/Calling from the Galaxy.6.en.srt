00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:32,840
Whose father are you?

192
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,630
Mr. Bu.

193
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,480
Huang, wait for me.

194
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,840
Okay, you watch out too.

195
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,600
This way.

196
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,960
Mr. Bu, this treasure is...

197
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,270
These are called Heel Boots,

198
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,080
worn by a first-rank imperial noblewoman
from the previous dynasty.

199
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,550
They look quite ordinary on the outside,

200
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,320
but hold great secrets.

201
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Wearing these boots,

202
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,390
in a second, one can stand out
and outshine all the others.

203
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,080
Nice.

204
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,360
Mr. Bu, this way please.

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
Do you think only me

206
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,000
can deserve such treasured boots?

207
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,670
That's right.

208
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,550
Short ones aspire to stand out,

209
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,550
so they naturally have to wear stilts.

210
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,670
Someone like me doesn't need to.

211
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,870
Right, Huang?

212
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,480
This whip is called Ruthless,

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,120
used to belong to Zhou Zhiqiang,
the eighth-generation leader

214
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,440
of the Emei Sect of Mount Shu.

215
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,790
As she was betrayed
by the Dark Sect leader, Zhang Youji,

216
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,960
she imbued her life's resentment
into this whip.

217
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,390
It punishes the people
indulging in stupid romance.

218
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,870
Those hit by this whip

219
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
will become ruthless
and lonely for life,

220
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,910
with no offspring.

221
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,720
You're just guessing by luck.

222
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,440
I don't believe

223
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,360
you could recognize this third treasure.

224
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,390
This jade is called Butterfly,

225
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,390
the personal jade ornament
of the Fairy Caiyi.

226
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,910
Used in battle,

227
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:06,120
one can transform into a butterfly
and soar to the sky

228
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,910
to perish together with the enemy.

229
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,720
He knows a lot.

230
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,790
Mr. Bu, you truly are knowledgeable.

231
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,720
I admire you, really.

232
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,630
Mr. Bu, I want you to take a look at

233
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,200
a treasure.

234
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,480
Father, you...

235
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,910
Alright.

236
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,750
This way please.

237
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,600
Mr. Bu, look.

238
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:38,200
[Five Ancient Divine Treasures]

239
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,080
My lady, we've never seen this scroll.

240
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,550
Exactly.

241
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:45,510
Why did our master...?

242
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,150
What was he thinking?

243
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,600
Why?

244
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,960
Stop it.

245
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He could be poisoned.

246
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:56,200
I wonder if you recognize
these five divine treasures.

247
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,390
These five are all
ancient divine treasures.

248
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,080
I have heard of them,

249
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,910
but I think no one's ever seen them.

250
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,030
Mr. Bu.

251
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,200
The Lingxi Pavilion has almost

252
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,840
collected all the treasures
in the world.

253
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,670
Except for these five divine treasures,

254
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,910
I've yet to see them.

255
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,790
Master Yu, don't be obsessed.

256
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,910
Perhaps it's just a legend.

257
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
Mr. Bu, let me tell you.

258
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,840
Our Yu family for generations

259
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,270
have devoted their lives
to finding these five divine treasures.

260
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,320
When I was young, I believed

261
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,200
that I could make it done.

262
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,790
Sadly, so much time has passed.

263
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,480
I haven't seen one yet.

264
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,270
It might be as you said,

265
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,600
just a legend.

266
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,000
Yu Xinglan, where are you?

267
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,360
Come out, Yu Xinglan.

268
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,600
Yu Xinglan.

269
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,840
Yu Xinglan, come out!

270
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,270
Yu Xinglan.

271
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,790
Mr. Gu.

272
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,670
It's an honor to have you here.

273
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,200
Our store

274
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,390
has brought in
quite a few new items lately.

275
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,150
All are rare treasures
from the Immortal Realm.

276
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,960
Someone discerning like you,

277
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,200
will surely
have a fruitful return today.

278
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:15,670
This Lingxi Pavilion indeed
has countless treasures.

279
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
What's more important is

280
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:19,440
having someone like you,

281
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:21,120
a smart and capable boss.

282
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,360
However,

283
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:27,960
there is a bit of regret.

284
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,670
Regret?

285
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,240
What is it?

286
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:36,030
Am I not beautiful enough?

287
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,150
Then there are two regrets.

288
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,120
What did you say?

289
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,240
If our lady isn't beautiful enough,

290
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:45,790
then there won't be any beauty
in this world, okay?

291
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,080
The more important regret is...

292
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,390
Miss Yu, you're short of a helper,

293
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,630
who can help you strategize

294
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:00,200
and secure victories
from a thousand miles away.

295
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,550
That's right.

296
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,870
Then who is this helper?

297
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,080
Where is he?

298
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,910
Who is it?

299
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:09,790
Who is it?

300
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:10,600
Who?

301
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,630
Of course, it's the handsome, dashing,

302
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,910
suave, debonair,

303
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,150
and wealthy gentleman like me.

304
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,840
I-I think it's wasting your talent.

305
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,750
Not at all.

306
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,030
Mr. Gu.

307
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,510
For a rich and noble young master
like you,

308
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,120
I don't think it's appropriate.

309
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,550
This is too appropriate.

310
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,630
Let me tell you.

311
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:35,200
Our Lingxi Pavilion
has strict rules and regulations.

312
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,120
Don't dream about pulling strings.

313
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,200
Fine.

314
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
If you want to apply,

315
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,240
first go to the reception to register.

316
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,320
I don't bother
with such trivial matters.

317
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,360
Suan, Tian, lead him.

318
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,030
Come on.

319
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,000
Let me introduce you.

320
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,030
You just need to take a written exam,

321
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,720
first interview, second interview,
and third interview.

322
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,670
Then you can become
a member of Lingxi Pavilion.

323
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,870
What I want to say is

324
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,390
[Increase in Prosperity]
that I want to become a shareholder.

325
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,440
You?

326
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,480
What?

327
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,000
Am I not wealthy enough?

328
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,870
Mr. Gu.

329
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,960
Lingxi Pavilion is my ancestor's
property passing down.

330
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,120
Not just anyone can be a shareholder.

331

332
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,550
Why are you here?

333
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,840
You must have mistaken someone else.

334
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,870
Drop the act.

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120

Mr. Bu.

338
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:03,960
You are knowledgeable
and highly capable.

339
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,910
I really admire you.

340
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,790
I wonder if you are interested in

341
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,360
being a shareholder
of the Lingxi Pavilion.

342
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,550
Father, wake up.

343
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,910
Are you still dreaming?

344
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,750
Him?

345
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,360
Isn't he an outsider as well?

346
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,750
Why could he a shareholder?

347
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,000
Why not me?

348
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,910
Mr. Gu, let me tell you.

349
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,150
Mr. Bu

350
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,240
is the life-saver
of both my daughter and me,

351
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,360
so he's not an outsider in any way.

352
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:35,870
Therefore, Mr. Bu becoming
a shareholder of the Lingxi Pavilion

353
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,720
is only natural.

This one.

00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,360
I doubt he can afford

361
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,550
the price.
