00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,200
had to follow us.

189
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,600
So shameless.

190
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,120
You!

191
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,000
Forget it.

192
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,120
Forget it, Li.

193
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,870
Find Peony Villa as soon as possible.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,360
I have no time to dally with you.

195
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,870
Forget it.

196
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:08,600
Forget it, Li.

197
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,910
This way, please.

198
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,440
What are you standing there for?

199
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,480
There's something strange.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,910
Be careful.

201
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,150
I don't know if it's strange,

202
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,030
but it really is quite run-down.

203
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,750
If you had found Peony Villa earlier,

204
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,510
I wouldn't have to stay here.

205
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,840
Sorry, Miss Yu.

206
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,270
Just make do with staying here tonight.

207
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,270
This is more like it.

208
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,790
Miss Yu, I'll stay in the next room.

209
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
If you need any help,

210
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,120
find me at any time.

211
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,600
What?

212
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
I'm not dumb, okay?

213
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:44,970
[Fenglai Inn]

214
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,630
Miss, dinner is served.

215
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,080
I am tired and I won't eat.

216
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,200
Bu, I also want a deluxe room.

217
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,910
Bu.

218
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,320
She wants me to stay in the latrine.

219
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,910
Can't believe it!

220
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,790
Why did you say I'm capricious?

221
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,000
I think you're capricious.

222
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:17,200
Weird.

223
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,030
It's this troublemaker
who has a bad temper.

224
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,600
Why do I feel so upset about it?

225
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,390
Ci.

226
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,120
Didn't you call me over for dinner?

227
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,440
Where are my bowl and chopsticks?

228
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,440
There's no place for you.

229
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,550
No place for me?

230
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,120
Then, give your place to me.

231
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,910
Why?

232
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,030
I am sitting here.

233
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:00,840
You!

234
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,670
Alright.

235
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,510
Come on.

236
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,480
Sit here.

237
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
Sit here.

238
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,870
Owner, please give us
a bowl and chopsticks.

239
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,600
Coming.

240
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,240
Bu.

241
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,080
Let's eat.

242
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:20,960
Thank you.

243
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,480
Ci.

244
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:23,870
Come on.

245
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,840
Let's eat.

246
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,390
Bu.

247
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,360
You've been working hard
these days. Eat more.

248
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,320
Mr. Bu

249
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,030
has been working hard
to take care of someone shameless.

250
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,200
Indeed, he needs to replenish.

251
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,270
Bu, don't eat what she gave you.

252
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,120
Eat mine.

253
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,480
Eat mine.

254
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,150
Eat mine.

255
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,080
Eat mine.

256
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,720
Eat mine.

257
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,240
- Eat mine.
- Eat mine.

258
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,390
- What are you doing?
- Why are you targeting me?

259
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:56,120
It's because someone
did something guilty.

260
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,030
What?

261
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:57,960
Who are you talking about?

262
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,750
You.

263
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,030
You've done something guilty.

264
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,670
To make money,

265
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,270
you've dragged all of us here to suffer.

266
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,510
Had I known, I would not have come.

267
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,600
As the shopkeeper
of the Lingxi Pavilion,

268
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,150
why should I endure this?

269
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,200
The more I think about it,
the angrier I get.
