I went fishing with Mr. Gu.

191
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,630
Mr. Gu?

192
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,510
So you've become friends
with Mr. Gu now?

193
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,000
Wait.

194
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,790
If you're friends with Mr. Gu,

195
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,240
why did you come to the Yu Residence?

196
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,600
Why don't you stay at Gu Residence then?

197
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,630
Your father

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,670
asked me to stay here.

199
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,870
I don't care what you are up to.

200
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:48,870
Leave now.

201
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,630
Otherwise,
don't blame me for being rude.

202
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,440
Miss Yu, I am not...

203
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:58,030
up to no good.

204
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,190
[Paradise House]

205
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,360
Master Yu, why are you alone?

206
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:30,960
Let me call a few girls over.

207
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,390
Manman.

208
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:36,390
I am not in a good mood today.

209
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,870
Have a seat.

210
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,910
Do you have something on your mind?

211
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,510
Why not tell me about it?

212
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:45,240
Okay.

213
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:51,630
A few days ago, I met a young master.

214
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,000
He

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,480
is so handsome
that he looks like an immortal.

216
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,870
Young master?

217
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,150
Right.

218
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,870
Let me tell you.

219
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,510
He is truly graceful, impressive,

220
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,390
tall, dashing and elegant.

221
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,960
What a perfect man!

222
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,270
This is difficult.

223
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,480
Master Yu.

224
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,510
Love cannot be forced.

225
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,030
Besides,
there are plenty of fish in the sea.

226
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,360
Maybe you could wait a bit more.

227
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,000
I'll open a Men's House for you.

228
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,750
Miss Manman, I am just in a bad mood.

229
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,120
My preference hasn't changed.

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,390
I'm now worried about my silly girl.

231
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Then I'm relieved.

232
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,440
This young master

233
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,080
is so nice,

234
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,600
but why does my silly girl

235
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,120
refuse to accept him?

236
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,150
Tell me what she's thinking.

237
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,720
Don't you understand your own daughter?

238
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,390
In her eyes,

239
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,120
there's only one thing,

240
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,630
money.

241
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:18,960
That's true.

242
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:21,960
How about this?

243
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,720
You get along well with her.

244
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,390
Please talk some sense into her.

245
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,390
Master Yu, rest assured.

246
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:31,080
I'll go to Lingxi Pavilion
to find her tomorrow

247
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,270
and have a good chat with her.

248
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,080
I understand what women think.

249
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,150
Then thank you, Miss Manman.

250
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,600
Thank you.

251
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:12,790
How come you have no strength?

252
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:13,440
Haven't you eaten?

253
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:14,750
Mr. Bu.

254
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,670
I've been massaging for six hours.

255
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,000
I've been persistent enough.

256
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,000
So what reward would you like?

257
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,080
The Xuantian Lantern Fair
is about to start tonight.

258
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,440
Can I have a packet of spicy strips?

259
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,360
What are spicy strips?

260
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,150
It's a kind of snack

261
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,960
sold only during the lantern fair.

262
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,550
Alright.
