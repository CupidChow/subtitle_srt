00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,200
Don't try to argue.

188
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,720
Everyone is watching.

189
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,750
The owner of the Lingxi Pavilion
refused to pay debts.

190
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,550
You would become a joke
if people find out.

191
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,320
Exactly.

192
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,030
Right?

193
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,840
- Exactly.
- Yes.

194
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,480
Exactly.

195
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:11,750
Alright.

196
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
If you don't have that much money,

197
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,910
then mortgage the Lingxi Pavilion to me.

198
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
That will also do.

199
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Impossible!

200
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,670
Xinglan.

201
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,270
Hand over the Lingxi Pavilion to us.

202
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,480
Then we will pay for you

203
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,550
the eight million taels.

204
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,790
Yes.

205
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,270
You want the Lingxi Pavilion?

206
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,870
Over my dead body!

207
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,600
Calm down.

208
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,080
Young lady.

209
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,510
You are so pretty.

210
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,000
It would be such a pity if you died.

211
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,670
Why don't you come back with me

212
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,390
to be my wife?

213
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:47,750
I guarantee you'll live a wonderful

214
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,910
and carefree life.

215
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,200
Get lost!

216
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,320
Don't come any closer!

217
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,120
Think carefully.

218
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,910
What are you waiting for? Beat her!

219
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,410
[Bu Suichen]

220
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,720
So handsome.

221
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,480
Help me up.

222
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,510
Who are you?

223
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,910
I am Bu Suichen.

224
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,910
Bu Suichen?

225
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,390
Beat him!

226
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,000
Get lost!

227
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,270
We are not done!

228
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:55,360
Let's go!

229
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,870
Hurry.

230
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,510
Young master.

231
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:06,390
[Luo Huang]
Young master.

232
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,080
You can't just leave me behind.

233
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,600
I can't keep up with you.

234
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,630
Where is Master Yu?

235
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,550
He'll be here soon.

236
00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:14,120
[Yu Liang]

237
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,840
Xinglan.

238
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,750
Father, you're still alive!

239
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,080
Or what else?

240
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,550
Come on.

241
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,320
Thank Heaven.

242
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,120
Xinglan.

243
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,120
I want to introduce you
to a super handsome man.

244
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,390
This is Young Master Bu Suichen.

245
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,390
A few days ago, I was being hunted
by over a dozen killers.

246
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,750
Thanks to him,

247
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,390
he took them down with just one move.

248
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:32,510
Father.

249
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,360
Can you not be so exaggerating?

250
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,080
It's true.

251
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,390
Since you are safe and sound,

252
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,600
we'll not disturb any further.

253
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,080
Let's go.

254
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,600
Xinglan.

255
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,000
Bu Suichen is not yet married.

256
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,480
Mr. Bu, thank you

257
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,960
for saving my father from the killers

258
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,720
and saving me from many villains.

259
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,670
It was my honor.

260
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,390
If you don't mind,

261
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,150
you may take away a treasure

262
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,320
from our Lingxi Pavilion.

263
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,510
We don't owe anyone favors.

264
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,790
Xinglan, how could you say that?

265
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,670
Mr. Bu is our friend, right?

266
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,670
Mr. Bu, it's getting late today.

267
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,030
How about you stay the night?

268
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,000
Tomorrow

269
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,750
I will show you the treasures.

270
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,630
Father, he might have
important matters to do.

271
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,120
You are wasting his time.

272
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,030
I am not busy.

273
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:31,630
Then, thank you for your kindness.

274
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,870
See?

275
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:35,960
How courteous Mr. Bu is!

276
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,270
He's growing on me.

277
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,000
Servants!

278
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,080
Arrange a luxury room for Mr. Bu!

279
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,030
Father.

280
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,390
Alright.

281
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,030
Look at this flower, look!

282
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,030
Our residence is up ahead.

283
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,080
I'll show you around.

284
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,630
This one. That one too.

285
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:54,790
Look!

286
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,480
It's quite big.

287
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,030
So many fun places.

288
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:57,720
Exactly.

289
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,320
You can stay at our residence
for a few more days.

290
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,030
Right.

291
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:01,550
We can play games in the courtyard then.

292
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,630
Let's go.

293
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,510
Please, this way.

294
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,510
Master Yu.

295
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,870
Hello.

296
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,480
Look, Huang.

297
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,030
Mr. Bu, this is our courtyard.

298
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:16,390
You see.

299
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:20,910
It's the largest mansion on the street.

300
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,080
Our home, the Yu Residence.

301
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,270
Look, isn't it very pretty?

302
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,320
All thanks to my daughter.

303
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,910
Speaking of her,

304
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,750
she is very good–tempered.

305
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,960
She's also gentle, virtuous,
dignified, and graceful.

306
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,390
My daughter can be said

307
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,750
to be a great cook

308
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,510
and a capable wife material.

309
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,480
She regards money as nothing

310
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,080
and fame and gain as nothing.

311
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,390
Most importantly,

312
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
my daughter

313
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,750
is proficient in zither,
chess, calligraphy,

314
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,750
painting, poetry, and essay writing.

315
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,150
You can't find a more
perfect wife than her.

316
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,840
Mr. Bu, do you agree?

317
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,670
I think so.

318
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,630
Xinglan.

319
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,200
Mr. Bu is quite good.

320
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,000
There's a Fox Immortal Temple
in the suburbs.

321
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,790
It's a place effective
for praying for a marriage match.

322
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,720
Take Mr. Bu there to pray for it.

323
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,440
Father, I don't want to get married yet.

324
00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:22,510
Do you want to drive me crazy?

325
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,000
He is such a good man.

326
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,150
What are you waiting for?

327
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,030
Go.

328
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,200
Mr. Bu.

329
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,960
Please rest here today.

330
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,080
Your room is at this side.

331
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,000
And this is my daughter Xinglan's room.

332
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,840
You just live across.

333
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:39,510
Father.

334
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,200
Master Yu, that's too kind of you.

335
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,670
My young master still has things
to take care of.

336
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:44,510
We can't stay for long.

337
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,120
That's the least I can do.

338
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,270
I have things to do too.

339
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,360
I will return to the Lingxi Pavilion.

340
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,480
Xinglan.

341
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,600
Take Mr. Bu for a good tour
around our residence

342
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,000
and give a proper introduction.

343
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,600
Make the guest happy.

344
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,600
Mr. Bu, I will take my leave.

345
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,720
I wish you success.

346
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,870
Goodbye, master.

347
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,080
Goodbye.

348
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,320
If you don't have other matters,

349
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:17,670
please rest early.

350
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,150
My lady!

351
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:27,150
My lady!

352
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,440
Why are you standing there? Help me up!

353
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,150
Alright.

354
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,720
Don't help me up.
Pick up the money first.

355
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,440
Quick.

356
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,000
Hurry, help me up.

357
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,350
Mr. Bu, please rest early.

358
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,240
Go.

359
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,480
