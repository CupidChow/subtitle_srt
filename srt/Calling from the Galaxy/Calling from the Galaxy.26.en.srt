That vixen hit me.

140
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,550
You have to stand up for me.

145
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840

I know you've decided to leave.

151

I can't force you to stay.

152

Are you alright?

155
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,550
Maybe I should have stopped her
from descending to the Mortal Realm.

156
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,360
There's no going back.

157
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,240
Women are troublesome.

158
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,960
Then why do you always read storybooks?

159
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:16,080
Do you know why I tried

160
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,550
to let Xuan reincarnate
and descend to the Mortal Realm?

161
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,550
It's related
to the Heavenly Tribulation.

162
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:21,630
What?

163
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,030
How much exactly do you know?

164
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,600
I know
the Heavenly Tribulation is imminent.

165
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,510
But I do not know

166
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,910
why Xuan is involved.

167
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,910
The secrets can't be revealed,

168
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,390
but I don't care.

169
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,240
Aside from confronting
the Heavenly Tribulation,

170
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,000
there might be a silver lining.

171
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,790
A silver lining?

172
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:47,840
Is it related to Xuan?

173
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,360

entered a forbidden area.

[When the Heavenly Tribulation appears,

175
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:07,630
May I ask

176
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,630
what it is?

177
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,080
I don't understand

178
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,440
how Xuan is relevant
to the Heavenly Tribulation.

179
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,670
You will know at the right time.

180
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,630
Aren't you curious

181
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,320
about the woman in the forbidden area

182
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:28,870
who called your name?

183
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,000
I think we should find a time

184
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,080
to check out the forbidden area.

185
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,080
But then again,

186
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,120
Fairy Hong Luan looked beautiful
even when she was angry.

187
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,200
It's good to leave her alone.

188
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,120
I have to say

189
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,750
my sister is trouble.

190
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,480
I will talk to her later.

191
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,390
Don't you think

192
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,630
Xinglan is getting more temperamental?

193
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:06,840
I'm off.

194
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,030
I am spoiled.

195
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,870
I am arrogant.

196
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,000
I am a good-for-nothing.

197
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,600
I can't help you with anything.

198
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,720
But I don't want to be like this.

199
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,720
Why do you treat me like this?

200
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,080
Gu Li.

201
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,790
Who? Who's calling me?

202
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,320
Who is calling me?

203
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:51,630
Gu Li.

204
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,670
Gu Li.

205
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,030
Who exactly are you?

206
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:03,870
Gu Li.

207
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,630
Come out.

208
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,030
Who are you?

209
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,790
Don't scare me.
