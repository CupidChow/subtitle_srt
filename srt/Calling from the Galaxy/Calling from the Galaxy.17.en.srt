It's better for us to stick together.

192
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,150
Exactly.

193
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,720
I don't want to be apart from Bu.

194
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,910
Then let's stay together
and play the riddles.

195
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,440
Alright.

196
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,510
What are the rules?

197
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,550
If I guess
more than half the riddles correctly,

198
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,320
then the treasure will be mine.

199
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,200
Exactly.

200
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,960
If you fail,

201
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,480
then I will take

202
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,630
something from you.

203
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,960
Bu, you must protect me.

204
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,360
Alright, what's the first riddle?

205
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,790
I went fishing today.

206
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,320
Girl, guess what kind of fish I caught.

207
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,790
What fish?

208
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,320
Think!

209
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,790
What if I guess it right,

210
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:32,080
then you don't acknowledge it?

211
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,080
Yes.

212
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,600
I am a person of my words.

213
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,870
I will definitely prove it to you.

214
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,030
So, crucian carp, bass, pomfret, dorado,

215
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,600
grass carp, catfish, and bighead carp.

216
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,440
I must get it.

217
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,750
You are wrong.

218
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:52,360
What is it then?

219
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,600
The Big Fish.

220
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,150
We're guessing riddles.

221
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,630
Don't touch me.

222
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,960
I admit defeat on this one.

223
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,480
Next one.

224
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,320
I went to till the land.

225
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,150
Girl, guess what kind of land I farmed.

226
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,120
What land?

227
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,320
What land?

228
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,720
Definitely not something decent.

229
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:25,870
What land?

230
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,000
Three.

231
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,320
What land?

232
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,120
What land?

233
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:29,720
Two.

234
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,550
Land on your feet.

235
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,200
Wrong.

236
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,240
The land on your mind.

237
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:48,870
My turn now.

238
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:54,030
I want to drink something right now.

239
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,320
Girl, guess what I want to drink.

240
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,320
Anything but water.

241
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,200
Is that your answer?

242
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,600
Wait.

243
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,720
These people are just like fools,

244
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,480
completely useless.

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,870
You want to drink
the dew of everlasting youth.

246
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,630
Dear, I drink in you.

247
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,360
Bu Suichen, you!

248
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,840
You!

249
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,960
If you

250
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:46,320
fail to answer my question,

251
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,200
then you will have to accept punishment.

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,870
Go on.

253
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:01,000
What's the best noodle in the world?

254
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:06,960
- Noodle.
- Noodle.

255
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,630
The Immortal Fox temple
is a place to pray for love.

256
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,270
All the answers are related to it.

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,790
So, I know it.

258
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:24,200
What?

259
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:25,870
Tell me.

260
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,870
A love

261
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,480
noodle.

262
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,960
You teased me just now.

263
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,000
It's right.

264
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,000
You said that if we guessed right,
you'd give us the treasure.

265
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,840
Give me the treasure.

266
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:52,630
Right.

267
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,750
This young master is truly brilliant.

268
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,630
But I promised=

269
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,440
to give you the treasure
if you guessed it right.

270
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,030
So it doesn't count.

271
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,670
In that case,

272
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,120
you just got four wrong in a row.

273
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,080
You have already lost.

274
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,080
You!

275
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,790
You are scheming against me.

276
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,030
I said

277
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,480
I need to take something from you,

278
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,200
then it is your youthful visage.

279
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,600
Are you alright, Li?

280
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Bu, you...

281
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,750
Thank you.

282
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,320
Alright, stop it.

283
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,840
This place is dangerous.

284
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,150
Let's hurry up and leave.

285
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,120
Bu.

286
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,760

287
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,320
