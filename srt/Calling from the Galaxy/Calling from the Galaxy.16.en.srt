to the Qingcheng Cave.

190
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,120
Bu, we haven't finished praying.

191
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,910
Li, you are still young,

192
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,790
can you stop thinking wild?

193
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,870
But we've searched everywhere,

194
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:27,200
yet haven't seen any entrance.

195
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,030
Is the location accurate?

196
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:31,120
The entrance to the Qingcheng Cave
is right here.

197
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,960
Anyway, Bu must be right.

198
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,840
Where exactly is the mechanism?

199
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:52,150
Don't stay up there.

200
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,440
Hurry up and find the entrance!

201
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,870
Is the entrance really in this temple?

202
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,360
This material...

203
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,550
By the same master of art props,

204
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,870
why is this craftsmanship so rough?

205
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,670
Well...

206
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,550
This must be the entrance
to the Qingcheng Cave.

207
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,600
Thank you, Miss Yu.

208
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:09,000
Bu, I thought of it long ago.

209
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,750
Stop it.

210
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Let's go.

211
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,480
Be careful.

212
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,000
Back off.

213
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:18,870
Li.

214
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,150
Are you all okay?

215
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
Bu.

216
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,480
I was so scared.

217
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,150
She's fine. I blocked it all.

218
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,200
Be careful.
