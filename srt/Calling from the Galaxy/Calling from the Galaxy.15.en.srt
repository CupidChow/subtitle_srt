Huang, hold me.

190
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,030
Hold me.

191
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,600
I think maybe I should go.

192
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,550
Don't even think about it.

193
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,750
Even in the Mortal Realm,
you still worry me.

194
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,030
What am I supposed to do with you?

195
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,630
Are you okay?

196
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,600
How do you drive like this?

Well, it's been so long.

201
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,200
Why hasn't he come out yet?

202
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,870
How come there's no sound at all?

203
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,630
What do you think they're doing?

204
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,240

please just show some mercy
and let me go.

If the young master finds out,

207
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,720
I'm surely done for.

208
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:31,870
You're not allowed to leave.

209
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,870
What exactly is their relationship?

210
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,200
I have a way.

211
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:42,910
Come.
