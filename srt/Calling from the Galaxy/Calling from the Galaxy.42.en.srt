[Episode 42]

27
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,590
If I had known...

28
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,560
If I had known earlier
that my father would end up like this,

29
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,590
no matter how hard it was
when I was a kid,

30
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,790
I would have mastered swordsmanship.

31
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,350
I'll practice with you in the future.

32
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,070
You know what?

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,950
Actually, my father
doesn't like spicy food,

34
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,200
but to accommodate me,

35
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,800
he would have the kitchen

36
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,680
make the dishes very spicy.

37
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,360
I know all this.

38
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,030
But I just like seeing him

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,840
full of snot and tears
by the spicy food,

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
so I always say it's delicious,

41
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,680
then he would do it again the next time.

42
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,240
Am I bad?

43
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,630
Your father doted on you.

44
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:50,000
My father was the person
who loved me the most in the world.

45
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,400
Yesterday, he even told me...

46
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,430
Yesterday, he even told me to live well,

47
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,710
n-not to be bound
by the Lingxi Pavilion,

48
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,360
and I can do whatever I wish to do.

49
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,000
I can no longer see him.

50
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,870
I can no longer see him.

51
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,120
I miss him so much, really.

52
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,910
Li.

53
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,360
You must get better.

54
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,910
Once you're better,

55
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,630
I will buy you lots of tasty treats.

56
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,280
And the Yuluo House you long for,

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,080
I'll definitely take you there.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,190
But you have to promise me

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,190
not to go there alone.

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,720
It's dangerous to go there alone.

61
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,680
You know that?

62
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,120
After all, you are the young lady
of the Gu family.

63
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,390
You're the only sister I got.

64
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,830

65
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,120
Would you like to fly a kite?

66

If you want to,

67
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,950
I'll make a kite with you.

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,870
On a sunny day,

69
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,480
without Bu Suichen,

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,310
just you and me go fly it.

71
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,160
Li, you must get better.

72
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I don't want you to die.

73
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,190
I don't want you to die.

74
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,040
I won't let you die.

75
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,070
I won't let you die.

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,040
Ci, I'm sorry.

77
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,040
My lady.

78
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,600
My lady, are you better now?

79
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,870
My lady, you're alright now.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,360
I am so happy.

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
My lady, you must not get into trouble.

82
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,070
If anything happens to you,

83
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,680
I don't want to live alone.

84
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,830
What are you saying?

85
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,750
My lady is so clever,

86
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,800
of course,
nothing bad will happen to her.

87
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,040
You are such a sweet talker.

88
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,600
Go ask the kitchen
to prepare some food for me.

89
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,360
I'm hungry.

90
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

91
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,870
My lady, please wait.

92
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:48,950
That's great.

93
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,870
You rest well.

94
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,950
Are you feeling better?

95
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,630
Is Gu Li awake?

96
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,240
She's hanging on there.

97
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,190
Bu.

98
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,830
Muchen, may I ask you for a favor?

99
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,870
Don't be polite.

100
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,360
Go ahead.

101
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:30,630
Can you see her one last time?

102
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,800
After all, she is my sister.

103
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:45,190
Okay, I promise you.

104
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,920
Once we resolve
the Heavenly Tribulation,

105
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,040
I'll go see her.

106
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:52,920
Thank you.

107
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,680
The treasures have been all collected.

108
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,800
Let's resolve the Heavenly Tribulation.

109
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,800
Don't celebrate too soon.

110
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,240
Today, I'll make you all die here.

111
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,200
Gu Li, kill them.

112
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,960
I want you to kill them.

00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:10,270
Suichen.

114
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,960
Muchen, are you okay?

115
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,150
Li.

116
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Gu Ci.

117
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,960
Today, I'll make you all die here.

118
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,550
Don't!

119
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:14,080

120
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:14,910

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,480
I am Gu Li.

Li.

125
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,550
Don't come closer.

126
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,120
Gu Li, kill them.

127
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,630
Kill them.

128
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,480
No. Ci.

129
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,150
Don't!

130
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,870
Kill them.

131
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,670
Don't.

132
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,240
Don't come over.

133
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,790
I have

134
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,870
made too many mistakes.

135
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,870
This time,

136
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,630
it's my turn to protect you.

137
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,030
Don't.

138
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:07,960
Don't!

139
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,870
Li.

140
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,200
Why are you so foolish?

141
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,080
Ci.

142
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,120
I'm here.

143
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,270
Don't blame me.

144
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:12,630
I don't blame you.

145
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,150
I have made too many mistakes
in my life.

146
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,670
But in the next life,

147
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,390
I still want to be your sister.

148
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,440
What are you saying?

149
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,510
You will be fine.

150
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,630
You will be fine.

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,150
Bu.

152
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,200
I thought

153
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,480
as long as I work hard,

154
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,840
you would be moved by me.

155
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:04,120
But the fate is out of our control.

156
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,630
My name so short,

157
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,080
but it's difficult

158
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,360
to be kept inside your mind.

159
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,000
Li.

160
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,910
Li.

161
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,120
Muchen.

162
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,910
Don't blame her.

163
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,840
I've always treated her as my sister.

164
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,440
Why would I blame her?

165
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,550
It's difficult to help others
get away from sorrow.

166
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,030
Only Gu Li herself

167
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,790
can resolve her own sorrow.

168
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,670
Troublemaker.

169
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,030
We won't quarrel anymore.

170
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,000
