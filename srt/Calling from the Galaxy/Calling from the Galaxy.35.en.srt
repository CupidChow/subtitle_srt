Thank you.

The person who can truly
protect you is already here.

You're not bad either.

You're like a wildflower
by the roadside,

Then do you know the way
to resolve the Heavenly Tribulation?

100
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,670
No.

101
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,910
There are two ways
to resolve the Heavenly Tribulation.

102
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,240
One,

103
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,790
collect all the ancient treasures.

104
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:35,270
Two...

105
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,510
Two...

106
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,840
Two, I marry you,

107
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,150
to create the trend of Hong Luan
moving towards Northern Dipper,

108
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:01,600
but the tribulation
will move to the Southern Dipper.

109
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,510
Then you'd better
find the fifth treasure.

110
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,390
What about you?

111
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,440
Don't worry about me.

112
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,870
I won't let anyone
from Heavenly Realm find me.

114
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:45,910
What?

115
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,870

116
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,790
What?

118
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,750
What?

119
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,000
If you don't come help,

120
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
you won't have anything
to eat until dark.

121
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,120

122
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,000

131
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
Jealous.

132
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:56,840

134
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,510
Then,

135
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,030
will you still be late
when I'm in danger?

136
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:09,910
You have so many secrets.

137
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,510
