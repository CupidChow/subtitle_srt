You can't die.

191
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,270
You won't die.

192
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,270
It's not up to you.

193
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,910
It's up to me.

194
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,630
Chen, run!

195
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,790
I had enough of

196
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,840
this loving drama.

197
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,480
It should come to an end.

198
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,240
Ziguang.

199
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,440
Rest in peace.

200
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,360
Stop.

201
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:55,240
You!

202
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:19,510
Hit me.
