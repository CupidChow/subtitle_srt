Money is a good thing.

190
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,120
Otherwise, why would
Miss Yu like it so much?

191
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,030
Here.

192
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,510
Thank you.

193
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,440
I'll go prepare the finest Longjing tea.

194
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,960
You!

195
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,120
Move.

196
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,670
What are you doing?

197
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,390
I'll share half with you, okay?

198
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,510
Bu, they are bullying me.

199
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,440
What happened?

200
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,270
There's a demonic aura. Look out!

201
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,480
Don't touch me.

202
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,600
Hand over the Silver Leaf Jade Flower.

203
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,720
Who sent you here?

204
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,910
A bunch of losers!

205
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,320
Who sent you here?

206
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,910
It's none of your business.

207
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:11,510
Wait, why are you so stubborn?

208
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,480
Look out!

209
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,440
My teeth. My teeth are gone.

210
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,000
How dare you hurt my friend!

211
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,000
My teeth are gone.

212
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,480
Bu, are you okay?

213
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,200
I'm fine.

214
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,870
Li, check on me, alright?

215
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,150
I lost my teeth.

216
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,030
They are back.

217
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:38,440
These demons

218
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,630
are all here to snatch
the Silver Leaf Jade Flower?

219
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,840
It seems so.

220
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,480
We'll know it next time.

221
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,320
Next time?

222
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,270
Again?

223
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,870
Everyone, let's go.

224
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,670
So scary.

225
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,440
Hmph.

226
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,550
What?

227
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,240
I'll walk by myself.

228
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:04,510
No one can stop me.
