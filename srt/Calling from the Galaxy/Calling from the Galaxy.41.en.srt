Father, I want
to be your daughter in the next life.

Do it!

You used half of your qi power just now,

33

are you crazy?

34
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,870
As long as I am here,

Do you really love her that much?

Yes.

The reason I've kept you until now

96
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,550
is all because of the affection
we shared as husband and wife.

Don't challenge me.

When have you and I ever
shared the affection?

Since you are still obsessed,

101
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,910
reflect yourself in here.

102
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,030

Excuse me, where is this?

115
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,000
Why are you so rude?

116
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:18,240
May I ask if this is your residence?

117
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,960
Madam, the Yu family's
eighth generation only daughter,

118
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,910
the heiress of the Lingxi Pavilion,
has come into the world today.

119
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,080
Hope you could bless her

120
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,270
- and bestow a name to her.
- Father?

121
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,080
This girl was born at dawn,

122
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,630
at the time
when the stars started to fade out.

123
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,240
Then just call her Xinglan.

124
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,150
Xinglan?

125
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,240
Is that me?

126
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,510

127
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,870
Li.

Li.

129
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,840
You get some good sleep.

130
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,670
I will definitely
find a way to save you.

131
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,270
You have to hang on.

132
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:13,600
Do you hear me?

133
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,630
Is it okay?

134
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,960
Why aren't they done yet?

135
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,270
Then how about we find a doctor?

136
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,840
As the saying goes,
every trade has its master.

137
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,480
Mr. Bu doesn't seem to learn medicine.

138
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,840
Can he cure our lady?

139
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,030
It's hard to tell.

140
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:40,440
No, we must always be prepared.

141
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,550
Let's find a doctor.

142
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,000
Alright.

143
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,630
Xinglan, how are you?

144
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,550
Suichen, my father...

145
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,390
My father hasn't taught me
all of his swordsmanship yet.

146
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,910
My swordsmanship is so poor.

147
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,840
He must be worried about me
managing the Lingxi Pavilion.

148
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,750
If...

149
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
If I had known...

150
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,440
If I had known earlier
that my father would end up like this,

151
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,480
no matter how hard it was
when I was a kid,

152
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,670
I would have mastered swordsmanship.

153
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,240
I'll practice with you in the future.
