Someone.

Go get Muchen and Xuanming.

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,640
No need.

30
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,150
Well...

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,430
How dare you to come!

32
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,310
How dare you not pay respects
to the Heavenly Emperor and Empress.

33
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:37,870
How dare you!

34
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,800
You disregard the Heavenly laws
and are unfilial to us.

35
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,470
You have let me down.

36
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,560
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

37
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,800
The Northern Dipper Lord made a mistake,

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:52,150
but he's already collected
all the ancient divine treasures,

39
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,910
the Heavenly Tribulation
should be resolved smoothly.

40
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,400
Your Majesty, please calm your anger.

41
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,680
Once the Heavenly Tribulation is resolved,
I will settle accounts with you.

42
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,190
Settle accounts?

43
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:14,520
Some accounts should
indeed be well settled.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,400
As your father, I did not want

45
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,840
to involve you in the grudges
of the previous generation.

46
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,030
You hypocrite!

47
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,430
You're colluded with
the Heavenly Empress.

48
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,240
Last time, the Heavenly Empress
burned my mother, Lady Ziguang, to death.

49
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,470
Do you know that good and evil
will eventually be repaid?

50

From now on, our ties are severed.

Life is governed by the Southern Dipper,

for taking the Heavenly Tribulation.

Fujin.

61
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:22,120
You conspired with the Bahuang Corps
to kill Xuan.

62
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,680
Do you have any conscience?

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,040
You burned my mother, Lady Ziguang,
to death with Heavenly Fire,

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,430
aren't you afraid of being punished?

65

Don't think to slander me here.

How dare you!

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,950
Are you afraid of dying?

76
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:29,360
Never.

77
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:30,870
You unfilial child!

78
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,040
Let's see where you could possibly run.

79
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,600
Since I have come today,

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,310
I have no plans to leave alive.

81
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,480
Don't worry about me, you leave.

Nonsense, I won't let you die.

84
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,870
It seems
you are determined to take their lives.

85
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,310
Isn't this situation
exactly what you want?

86
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,870
The greatest mistake I made

87
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:35,870
was to let that despicable Ziguang

88
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,950
give birth to you.

89
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,950
How dare you insult my mother! I...

90
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,560
I treated your mother as a best friend,

91
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,870
yet, she took away
the person I loved most.

92
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,870
Doesn't she deserve to die for that?

93
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,600
You're the one who deserves to die.

94
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,190
Chen, I've raised you for years.

95
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,750
Was it all for today,

96
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,750
to be questioned by the son I raised?

97
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm not your son.

98
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,190
Enough.

99
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
I know

100
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,430
you hate her
for burning your birth mother to death.

101
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,310
But after all,
she is the Heavenly Empress.

102
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,040
She is not your birth mother,

103
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,680
yet for so many years,

104
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,920
she has raised you

105
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,240
and cared for you.

106
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,720
Even she is not your birth mother,

107
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,430
she has put effort
in raising you, right?

108
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,440
If you weren't the son of us,
the Heavenly Emperor and Empress,

109
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,840
how could you possibly

110
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,960
have become the Northern Dipper Lord?

111
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
Heavenly Emperor, Heavenly Empress.

112
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,550
Northern Dipper Lord.

113
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,630
I am not like you.

114
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,750
You can resort to any means
for your position,

115
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,750
but I am different.

116
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,200
I can abandon

117
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,750
this position anytime.

118
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,960
