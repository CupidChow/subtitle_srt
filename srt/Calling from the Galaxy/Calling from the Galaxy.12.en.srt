I went through great pains to find this.

137

All these years were just
to wait for the day it blooms.

After all these years,
did it ever bloom?

141

If you had listened to me back then

142
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,750
instead of believing
that I killed your people

143
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,750
and disfiguring me,

144
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,510

not daring to see anyone?

00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,630
I wronged you back then.

I am determined to
restore your appearance.

take this flower away

How come you're so weak?

Back then, to steal this flower,

166
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:06,200
I exhausted all my true essence.

167
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,870
It's just a pity

168
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:14,510
that in the end, the flower
still hasn't bloomed.

I won't be able to see
the face I remember.

170

I didn't truly wish for your death.

00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:36,790
I have waited for this day
for a very long time.

172

I have no regrets dying at your hands.

173
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:47,240
I just regret not confessing
my love to you.

174
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,960
If I hadn't cared

175
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,080
so much about pride back then,

176
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,480
could it have been possible for us

177
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
to be like an ordinary couple,

179
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,510
an ordinary life?

180
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,750
You clearly didn't have to die.

181
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,750
Is it worth it?

182
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,480
She is where my heart resides.

183
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:21,840
I'd do anything for her.

184
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,000
How can you be so foolish?

00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:57,030
Are you alright?

186
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,000
For you and me,

187
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:19,360
living is more painful than death.

188
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,200
After all these years,

189
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,200
do you still not understand me?

190
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,910
I don't want any flower at all.

191
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,200
Nor do I care
about becoming an immortal.

192
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,670
I just want to be
an ordinary couple with you.

193
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,550
It's just fate's tricks.

194
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,750
We can never go back again.

195
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,390
Can't go back anymore.

196
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:14,320
Look.

197
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,480
I should leave now.

198
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,550
I want to go home

199
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,360
and tell my people

200
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I want to be with you.

201
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,080
Young master, Miss Yuyan is inside.

202
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:20,630
Set the fire.

203
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,000
My wife was caught for theft

204
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,670
by Yucang Clan.

205
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,870
I lied for revenge, young master.

206
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,440
Yan, please kill me.

207
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,670
I just want you to regret it

208
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:42,240
and remember me
for the rest of your life.
