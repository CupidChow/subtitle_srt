Alright, I'll treat you to Dongpo pork.

187
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,050
[Yu Residence]

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,320
Mr. Bu, you are here.

189
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,440
You are in a good mood.

190
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,120
So I come over
and share some of your good mood.

191
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:28,840
Aren't you in a good mood?

192
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,270
I think you look you are.

193
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,390
I'm in a good mood because I see you.

194
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,390
Why are you so sweet-talking today?

195
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,510
Reach out your hand.

196
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,550
Reach out your hand.

197
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,790
First, tell me what it is.

198
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,840
Is it a bug?

199
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,550
Hand.

200
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:20,360
W-What do you mean?

201
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,270
I believe

202
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,030
this time you'll surely
take good care of it.

203
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,360
C-Can I?

204
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,440
Of course.

205
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,360
If you lose it,

206
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:38,360
then we'll just have to find it again.

207
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,150
What?

208
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,720
I will definitely keep a close watch
on the divine treasures.

209
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,440
That's good.

210
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,360
I will definitely do it.

211
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,550
If it exists, I exist.

212
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,270
If it perishes, I perish too.

213
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,720
That won't be necessary.

214
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,150
Your safety is still more important.

215
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,630
Watch your step.

216
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,000
Don't spill it.

217
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,910
Steps here, be careful.

218
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,960
Manman.

219
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,240
Xinglan.

220
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,790
Why are you here?

221
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:30,960
Miss Gongsun.

222
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,240
Sorry, Mr. Bu.

223
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,550
Paradise House is really full today,

224
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:36,600
so I had to set up a banquet
at Yu Residence.

225
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,480
However, the dishes

226
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:42,480
were all selected
by Miss Gu and Xinglan.

227
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,670
See if you like them.

228
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,510
Manman, you're so nice.

229
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,480
Thank you for your hospitality,
Miss Gongsun.

230
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,390
I'll go call them to eat.

231
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,390
Come on.

232
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,150
Manman.

233
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,390
I have a surprise for you.

234
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,790
What surprise?

235
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,320
Don't hide it.

236
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,480
I've found a real treasure this time.

237
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,360
Is it the treasure you found last time?

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,150
Even better than that one.

239
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:25,120
Much better.

240
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,200
Show it to me.

241
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,320
Can't wait, right?

242
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,550
Beautiful, isn't it?

243
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,390
Manman, let me tell you.

244
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,390
When I first saw this hairpin,

245
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:43,080
I knew that it's no ordinary item.

246
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,960
You truly deserve
to be the Lingxi Pavilion's owner.

247
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,550
You are so discerning.

248
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,720
It's really beautiful.

249
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,720
Do you like it?

250
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,360
Yes.

251
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,030
Put it on me.

252
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,670
Alright.

253
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,720
Come on, let me see.

254
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,480
It's really beautiful.

255
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,390
Who picked this? With such good taste.

256
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,440
Don't flatter yourself.

257
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,320
Manman.

258
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,240
We are besties, right?

259
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,840
Of course.

260
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,840
After we came back
from treasure hunting last time,

261
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,000
you were the one who treated.

262
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,080
I

263
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,600
really feel embarrassed
always taking advantage of you.

264
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,480
But you don't want me
to pay for it either.

265
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,750
So,

266
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,150
I'm giving you this treasure.

267
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,750
Consider it as covering
the money for these two meals.

268
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,000
Between us,

269
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,670
there's no need to be so polite.

270
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,440
Let's eat.

271
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,000
Alright.

272
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:29,910
Let's go.

273
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,030
What a crappy thing!

274
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,240
Manman.

275
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,360
Keep it safe, don't lose it.

276
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:44,390
Come on.

277
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,670
Why don't you carry a bag?

278
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,270
Here.
