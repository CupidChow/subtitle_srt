I-It was the Bahuang Corps
who descended to the Mortal Realm

64
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,750
and hindered us.

It's a metaphor, meaning I feel at ease.

74
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,190
She was glaring at us.

75
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,430
What brought you here?

76
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,950
I have indulged you too much
over these years.

77
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,870
You burned Ziguang to death before,

78
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,270
and now, you've even
sent the Bahuang Corps to hurt my son.

79
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,920
Do you think
I don't know what you've done?

80
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,510
So what?

81
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,560
Don't you feel any guilty?

82
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,720
Guilty?

83
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,270
What right do you have to question me?

84
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,680
Have you ever felt guilty towards me?

85
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,310
A person like you,

86
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,870
no one would feel guilty towards you.

87
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,000
I'm afraid

88
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,000
you would even feel guilty

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,070
towards Ziguang.

90
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,270
Alright then.

91
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,560

92
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,560
towards you.

93
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,630

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,750
Yes, I have gone mad.

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,560
Because I like you,

105
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,510
I have gone mad many times.

106
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,160
It's the Heavenly Empress
who sent you, right?

107
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,830
Heavenly Empress?

108
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,830
I don't care about her.

00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,830

117
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,920
When was the last time we played a game?

118
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,630
Thinking of the past,

119
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,720
I really missed it.

120
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:00,510

I'm really curious

124
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,120
which one you'll choose.

125
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,190

Kill me and let her go.

130
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You have saved me before,

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,600
today I should pay you back.

132
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,950
I do not want to owe anyone any favors.

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,430
You are really disgusting.

134
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,430
At this point,

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,070

Bu.

137
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,920
Can't you make a choice?

138
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:25,480
Muchen, do something to save her.

139
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,750
Mr. Bu, you promised me

140
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,600
to protect Xinglan.

141
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,960
You must choose her.

142
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,840
Bu.

143
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,480
How about I choose for you?

144
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,630
I want Xinglan.

145
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
Father.

leaving here alive today.

His demonic power has become stronger.

148
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,510
And we have all been seriously injured.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,120
I'm afraid we can't fight him.

150
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,000

155
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,390
Tianyang Orb.

156
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,440
This orb

157
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,550
shouldn't exist in this world at all.

158
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:07,550
Li.

159
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:10,320
You can't let go of him, can you?

160
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,510
Come back.

161
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:17,270
Can I still go back?

162
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,080
All this love and affection,

163
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,960
are you immortals in the Heaven

164
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,750
also trapped by love?

165
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,790

Father.

170
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,080

179
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,910
Xinglan, for the six realms,

180
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,150
the Yu family

181
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:14,790
vows to protect the Tianyang Orb

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,630
and Lingxi Pavilion.

183
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,360
No way, I can't do it.

184
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,360
We must not let Chishan
escape from the Lingxi Pavilion.

185
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,670
Hurry up, kill me.

186
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,390
Father, I can't do it.

187
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,030
Hurry up and save him.

188
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,750
Save him.

189
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,750
Bu Suichen, please save him.

190
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:36,480
Don't hesitate anymore.

191
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,320
Father.

192
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,720
If this continues, they will all die.

193
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,120
S-So will you.

194
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,670
Everyone in the world will die.

195
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,000
I am scared, Father.

196
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:59,440
Don't make me fail our ancestors.

197
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,360
Xinglan, don't be afraid.

198
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:36,630
Father gave me life,
and mother nurtured me.

199
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:42,120
- Patted me, raised me, helped me grow, nurtured me...
- Cared for me,

200
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,510
and carried me in and out.

201
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,000
Wishing to repay their kindness.

202
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,240
[Little Yu Xinglan]
The winter is so cold, whistling the fury of the wind.

203
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,120
The people all thrive,
why should I alone suffer?

204
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,240
The south mountains are high,
and the wind is trembling.

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,910
The people all thrive,
why should I alone suffer?

206
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:13,200
Father gave me life,
and mother nurtured me.

207
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,120
Patted me, raised me,
helped me grow, nurtured me,

208
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:27,360
cared for me, and carried me in and out.

209
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,270
Xinglan, this is the heirloom
of our Yu family.

210
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,910
I entrust it to you today.

211
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:52,200
Xinglan, you are not agile.

212
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,720
Your hands lack flexibility,

213
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,120
and your waist and back are weak.

214
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,000
And your eye lack luster.

215
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,630
But Father, I am so tired.

216
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,600
Xinglan, you still
have a long way to go.

217
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,080
But other girls
don't practice swordsmanship.

218
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,790
Why do I have to practice it?

219
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,320
Because you are my daughter.

220
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,080
When other girls come of age,

221
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,510
they are soon to be married off.

222
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,120
But you have to
inherit the Lingxi Pavilion.

223
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,390
I want to play. I don't want
to inherit the Lingxi Pavilion.

224
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,600
Xinglan, with this attitude,

225
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:31,150
how can I entrust
the Lingxi Pavilion to you?

226
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:37,030
Cared for me, carried me in and out.

227
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,670
Wishing to repay the kindness,
but the kindness of parents is great.

228
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,720
Father, how's it?

229
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,000
Not very good.

230
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,150
Father, do you think
I can inherit the Lingxi Pavilion?

231
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,960
Xinglan.

232
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,910
Just go do whatever you wish to do.

233
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,960
I don't expect you
to inherit the Lingxi Pavilion.

234
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,510
No, I have to inherit
the Lingxi Pavilion,

235
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,750
and I will make it bigger.

236
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,270
Father, I want
to be your daughter in the next life.

237
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,000
Do it!
