Don't worry.

With me here, no one can kill you.

96
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,870
I'll help you kill him.

97

Don't think I don't know your scheme.

98
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,870
You want to use me to kill him.

99
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,120
I'm really unlucky

100
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,040
to possess you.

101
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,310
Did you notice anything?

102
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,040
Why can't I see anything?

103
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,480
Is this mirror broken?

104
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,390
Hong Luan and Northern Dipper combine,
resolving the Heavenly Tribulation.

105
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,840
The tribulation goes to Southern Dipper.

106
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,390
Well...

107
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,120
If you two got married,

108
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,510
the Heavenly Tribulation
could be resolved?

109
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,270
I will not marry Hong Luan.

110
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Then why would I die?

111
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,960
But even if I die,

112
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,670
there is no loss to the Immortal Realm.

113
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,270
I was just a

114
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,480
common fish.

115
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,270
There are a lot in the Heavenly Pond.

116
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,440
Who would care about me?

117
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,550
Why do I always suffer?

118
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,670
Why are you looking at me?

119
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,440
Don't worry. I won't let you die.

120
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,750
Muchen, I didn't expect you...

121
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,270
Stop.

122
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:34,720
Why don't you go marry Hong Luan?

123
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:35,790
I have thought it over.

124
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,390
I've lived enough.

125
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,200
As long as I find the Tianyang Orb,

126
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,670
then the Heavenly Tribulation
can be resolved.

127
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,120
Be confident in me.

128
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,960
Wait.

129
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,320
You don't want me to die,

130
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:49,440
or you don't want to marry Hong Luan?

131
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,270
You don't want me to die,

132
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,360
right?

133
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,030
If you say so, then be it.

134
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,840
I was just a fish
in the Celestial River,

135
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,080
being free, carefree,

136
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:04,270
and weak.

137
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,360
If you hadn't fished me out back then,

138
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,320
I wouldn't have been
put into the Heavenly Pond

139
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,030
to absorb the essence
of the sun and moon.

140
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,550
If I didn't absorb the essence
of the sun and moon,

141
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,200
then I wouldn't have become
the Southern Dipper Lord.

142
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,750
If I weren't the Southern Dipper Lord,

143
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,790
then I wouldn't...

144
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:21,270
I need to return to the Heavenly Realm.

145
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,600
What for?

146
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:27,000
Do you finally want to change me back?

147
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,720
There's something I need to figure out.

148
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,790
Does it still hurt?

149
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,910
Yes.

150
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,910
But it doesn't hurt as much now.

151
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,270
What's wrong?

152
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,960
Gu Li must be seriously injured.

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,440
Well,

154
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,240
is it because I treated her poorly

155
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,750
that she wanted to kill me?

156
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,840
It's not your fault.

157
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,360
What?

158
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,670
Pretty.

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,670
Ugly.

160
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,630
Xinglan.

161
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,200
I have an urgent matter to deal with.

162
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,440
We might need
to be apart for a few days.

163
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,910
What's so urgent?

164
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,200
Can you take me with you?

165
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,870
I don't want to be apart from you.

166
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,480
Wait for me here.

167
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,200
I will be back in a few days.

168
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,200
Bu Suichen.

169
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,960
Sometimes I really feel

170
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,910
that you are so far away from me.

171
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,720
I've been trying so hard
to get close to you,

172
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,840
but you're always distancing me.

173
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,720
Xinglan, trust me.

174
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,200
I won't lie to you.

175
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,080
When I come back,

176
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,630
I will tell you

177
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,440
everything.

178
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,870
Xinglan.

179
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,200
Close your eyes.

180
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:11,630
Bu.

181
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,440
Don't look at

182
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
such a tacky thing.

183
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,480
Let's go.

184
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,670
Considering you

185
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,150
bribe me,

186
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,840
I'll wait for you.

187
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,630
Xinglan, wear it.

188
