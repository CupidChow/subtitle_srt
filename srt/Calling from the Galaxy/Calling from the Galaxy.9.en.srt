No more buts.

189
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,550
Hurry up and go look for them.

190
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,080
When we make our fortune,

191
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm counting on you
for the rest of my life.

192
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,320
Of course.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,150
If I make money,

194
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,510
I'll invest in your Paradise House.

195
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,870
Let's open a branch.

196
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,550
Open a branch.

197
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,640
[Lingxi Pavilion]

198
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,910
Why have you brought us here?

199
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,000
People only know

200
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,750
Lingxi Pavilion is a place
that gathers the world's treasures.

201
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,630
But do you know

202
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,320
why it's called Lingxi?

203
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,750
I don't know.

204
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,150
Lingxi Pavilion has a secret,

205
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,750
the Lingxi Portal.

206
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,480
It can send us anywhere we want.

207
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,360
However,

208
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,200
you can't return through it.

209
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:16,320
The creator of this was somewhat dumb.

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
This is the greatest secret
of Lingxi Pavilion.

211
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,840
I consider you as friends.

212
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,790
That's why I'm sharing this with you.

213
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,360
Don't spread the word, okay?

214
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,000
Are you ready?

215
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,910
There's another world
within Lingxi Pavilion.

216
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,670
Let's go.

217
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,670
This is the Lingxi Portal.

218
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Don't act like you've never
seen the world before.

219
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,910
- Exactly.
- Exactly.

220
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,550
Miss Yu, can we set off now?

221
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,670
It's your turn.

222
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,440
This is the place.

223
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,030
What are we waiting for? Let's go.

224
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,320
I have three rules.

225
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,600
First,

226
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,630
everyone must listen to me.

227
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,360
No acting on your own.

228
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:10,960
Second,

229
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,390
everyone pays for their
own food and accommodation.

230
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,000
I am not responsible for any expenses.

231
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,320
Third...

232
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,120
I haven't decided yet.

233
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,000
I'll tell you when I've made up my mind.

234
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,480
My lady,

235
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,840
do we have to take care of
our own food and accommodation as well?

236
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,440
What do you think?

237
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,000
Haven't I paid you your salary?

238
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,550
Wait for me.

239
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,320
Step aside.

240
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,550
Bu.

241
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,270
How did you get in?

242
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,870
This is quite a mission.

243
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,240
Of course, I followed my brother

244
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,000
and sneaked in.

245
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,120
What are you here for?

246
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,240
Don't cause trouble and go home quickly.

247
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,240
What if Bu gets hurt?

248
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,080
Are you here to protect him?

249
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,240
Whether you come is none of my concern,

250
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,440
but you'll have to cover
your own expenses.

251
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,600
You must behave.

252
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:56,790
Mind your own business.

253
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,440
I always behave myself.

254
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,510
Right, Bu?

255
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,550
Bu...
