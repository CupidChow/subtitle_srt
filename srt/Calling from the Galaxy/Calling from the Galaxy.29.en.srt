You can't die.

31

Are you really an immortal?

I've seen you somewhere before?

Your Majesty.

A strange vision happened.

64
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,560
I'm afraid the Heavenly Tribulation
will come soon.

65
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,360
It will happen one day.

I hope they'll
gather the ancient divine treasures.

68
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,950
Perhaps there is a way
to resolve the Heavenly Tribulation.

69
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,510
What way? Tell me.

and the Northern Dipper Star turns.

What does this mean?

00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,360
If the Hong Luan Star aligns
with the Northern Dipper Star,

75
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,560
it will be a good sign.

76

The Heavenly Tribulation
will be immediately resolved.

77
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,040

to set up the two of them.

from returning to the Immortal Realm.

112

Yes.

113
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,360
Second,

114
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,120
I want you to spare no cost

115
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,960
to destroy the ancient divine treasures

116
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:46,240
that can
resolve the Heavenly Tribulation.

117
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,870
Yes, Your Highness.

You go first.

124
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:03,320
You...

125
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,150
Are you asking me

126
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:05,440
why I am in your bed?

127
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,150
Last night,

128
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,480
you felt cold.

129
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,720
I was afraid you would freeze to death.

130
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,840
You should be grateful to me.

131
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,960
Thank you, Xinglan.

132
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,320
What can I do to repay you?

133
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,870
Repay me?

134
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,120
Give yourself to me.

135
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,200
Okay.

136
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,720
Do you feel better?

137
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,240
Yes, no need to worry.

138
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,840
I'm not worried about you.

139
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:49,750
I fear if you don't recover,

140
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,360
we won't leave for the Wuxiang Temple

141
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,320
to find the Linghua Mirror
as soon as possible.

142
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,240
My time is precious.

143
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,720
I can't waste it on you.

144
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,030
I understand.

145
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,360
I doubt it.

146
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,080
