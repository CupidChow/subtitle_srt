Did you know

62
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,360
this woman was a fraud

63
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,400
and came to fool us around
from the beginning?

64
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,400
I believe
she is not that kind of person.

00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,910

is much more useful than me.

Although I don't admit it,

101
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,270
I know

102
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,430
I am just a burden.

103
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,720
I don't even match

104
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,870

105
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,360
Why do you

106
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,510
consider yourself a burden?

107
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,310
I know.
Looking for treasures is important,

108
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:40,800
but what's more important

109
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,560
is to be with you.

110
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,950

111
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,560

112
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,480

114
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,750
you weren't like this.

Northern Dipper Lord,

118
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,510
you are going to lose to me.

119
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,430
Do you really think
that all love in this world is illusory?

120
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,000
Only the common folk

121
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,560

122
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:21,480
You and I needn't care
about these things.

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680

124
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,360

125
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,360
You have no idea

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,120

128
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,160
Whether it's you, me or Xuan,

129
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,040
we do not need mortal love.

130
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,160
So please, don't show her those

131
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,000
vulgar things anymore.

132
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,390
You simply don't understand her.

133
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:40,160
Xuan belongs to me.

134
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,720
She will surely not fall into love.

135
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,120
Do you dare to go ask her with me?

136
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,240
Why wouldn't I dare?

137
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,190
Without me,

138
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,000
you two wouldn't be like this today.

139
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
Lunatic!

140
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,390

Miss Yu, would you like to pick

While I'm gone,

152
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,360
you must keep your temper in check.

Don't haggle over every penny
when doing business.

154

Manage this place well for me.

157
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,910
I have no other friends here.

What does this mean?

168
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,200
The gentleman outside
said to exchange this for you.

Muchen.

173
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,510
I'm worried about Li.

174
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,080
Rest assured.

175
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,870
We will find a way to restore her.

176
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,030
When I came to the Mortal Realm,

177
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,360
I just wanted to live a carefree life,

178
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,120
so I chose Gu Ci.

179
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,790
Who would have thought
he had a little sister to take care of?

180
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
She's willful

181
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,080
and especially delicate.

182
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,080
At first, I really hated her.

183
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,840
But later I found out
she was just talking mean.

184
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,320
She is the one
who cares about me the most

185
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,360
in this world.

186
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,870
Back when in Heaven,

187
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,150
I cared about you a lot too.

188
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,630
Northern Dipper, it is different.

189
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,120
She would care about me

190
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:13,320
whether I wear a matching pair
of socks every day.

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,840
Because of it,

192
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:17,630
I won't get blisters when wearing boots.

193
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,750
She also cares if I'm constipated,

194
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,440
so she can have the kitchen
arrange the dishes for the next day.

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,720
Don't you think it's vulgar and funny?

196
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,000
You're drunk.

197
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,440
I am drunk.

198
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,480
I'm so drunk that I'm starting
to not want to leave the Mortal Realm.

199
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,720
I really can't figure it out

200
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,670
why the Bahuang Corps chose her.

201
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:52,000
Then you have to ask

202
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,200
the person behind them.

203
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,720
Who?

204
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,790
In the Heavenly Realm,

205
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,200
can't you guess who could manipulate

206
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,480
the Bahuang Corps?

207
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,870
Heavenly Empress?

208
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,150
- Mr. Bu.
- Mr. Bu.

209
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,270
- Terrible.
- Terrible.

210
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,390
How are you two here? Where's Xinglan?

211
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,790
- My lady and Master Yu...
- My lady and Master Yu...
