Why is it so cold?

28
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,310
Li, are you cold?

29
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,040
With you here,

30
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
I feel so warm inside and out.

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,910
Once I have collected all the treasures,

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:13,120
I will buy you lots of tasty treats.

After I take you back,

00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,520
I have to go find your Bu.

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,280
Ci, I can't walk anymore.

37
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,280
I told you

38
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,910
not to come,
but you just wouldn't listen.

39
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,360
Someone like you who have been pampered,

40
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,910
how can you endure such hardships?

Can't you stop loving that Bu Suichen?

51
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,520
I don't want to love him either,

to possess you,

55
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,360
because you seemed to be foolish.

56

to be so stubborn.

Even now, I can't control you.

58
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,870
Then you should control someone else.

You think possession is so easy?

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,430
I possessed you,

62
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,680
then you should be controlled by me.

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,510
Why are you so disobedient?

64
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,750
Then you'd be controlled by me.

129
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,630
I just don't want you to hurt Xinglan.

130
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,630
Okay.

131
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,440
Are you okay?

132
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:57,870
I'm fine.

What about you? Are you okay?

135
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,360
That's good then.

136

Suichen, are you alright?

139
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,910
Suichen, Suichen.

140
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:31,550
I have to pick up firewood

141
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,270
and light the fire.

142
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,600
Do you really treat me like a maid?

143
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,240
You should be taking care of me.

144
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,510
Now,

145
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,390
I'm the one taking care of you.

146

147
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,750
What was that again?

148
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,790
How great would it be
if I had that skill?

149
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,360
If anyone dares to bully me,

150
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,480

155
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,270
Why did that Gu Li

156
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,550
suddenly become so powerful?

157
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,840
With me here, you don't need to worry.

158
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:51,080
I thought about it.

159
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,120
Maybe we should go back.

160
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,390
My life

161
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,720
