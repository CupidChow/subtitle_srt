of the Crystal Jade Dew
of Fairy Hong Luan?

191
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,270
that would be so great.

192
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,870
Crystal Jade Dew?

193
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,790
I heard it from the operas.

194
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,000
Kunlun Goddess loves to drink it.

195
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:40,840
What does Fairy Hong Luan have
to do with it?

196
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,510
She has a lot to do with it.

197
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,270
Who exactly is Fairy Hong Luan?

198
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,870
Were you three well-acquainted?

199
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,550
Don't you think

200
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,630
it's a bit late to ask now?

201
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,030
Forget it.

202
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,630
Who knows if you're bragging?

203
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,870
Teahouse.

204
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,600
Let's take a break.

205
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,200
Sir, a pot of tea, please.

206
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,360
Alrighty.

207
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,270
Please have a seat here.

208
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,120
Thank you.

209
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,150
Here.

210
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,000
Please have your tea.

211
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,080
This place is quite empty.

212
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
May I ask why you open a teahouse here?

213
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,840
My father said

214
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,720
when my great-grandfather went
into the mountains,

215
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,910
he accidentally broke his leg

216
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,480
and was saved
by a scholar taking a rest here.

217
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,910
After he recovered,

218
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:36,440
he opened a teahouse here.

219
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,790
So, travelers could rest here.

220
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,150
Are you two heading to the exam?

221
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,200
I hear the scenery here is wonderful.

222
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,390
We're here only to enjoy the scenery.

223
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,790
You've come to the right place.

224
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,030
There is a great place.

225
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,480
What place...?

226
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:55,440
It's in that direction.

227
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,790
Go up the hill and you'll find it.

228
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,200
It's okay when you feel tired.

229
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,000
There is a household

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,200
with hanging red lanterns.

231
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,870
You can stay for the night
in that house.

232
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:03,910
The head of that household is kind.

233
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,720
He often provides shelter to travelers.

234
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:07,630
Thank you.

235
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,120
We'll set off after tea.

236
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,840
Alright, take your time.

237
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,440
A household adorned with red lanterns?

238
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,390
Could the Fireheart Lantern

239
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,270
be in that place?

240
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,270
There's something strange
about that family.

241
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,600
You're getting clever on this trip.

242
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:31,080
Tell me about it.

243
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,630
What's wrong?

244
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,360
He...

245
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,670
He needs to relieve himself.
