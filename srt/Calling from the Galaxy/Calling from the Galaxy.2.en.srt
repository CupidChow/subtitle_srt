You little slicker.

192
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,150
I've finished it up.

193
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,270
Come on.

194
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,360
Leave some for me.

195
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,840
Leave some.

196
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,200
Look up.

197
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,360

Greetings, Your Majesty.

204
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,790
Rise.

205
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:48,870
Thank you, Your Majesty.

206
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,360
There are 72 palaces and 36 seats
in the Immortal Realm.

207
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,200
May I ask where you'll place Hong Luan?

208
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,630
Northern Dipper Mansion, of course.

209
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,510
I'm afraid that's improper.

210
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,960
Why not?

211
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,120
A handsome god and a beautiful fairy.

212
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,390
They are a perfect match.

213
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,390
Hong Luan is the right woman for Chen.

214
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,750
In my opinion,

215
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,480
they treat each other like siblings.

216
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,080
I'm afraid you got the wrong idea.

217
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,390
I think

218
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,360
Hong Luan doesn't treat Chen

219
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,670
like an elder brother.

220
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:38,600
Moreover,

221
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,600
without romantic feelings,

222
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,910
they can't get married?

223
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,750
Good liquor.

224
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,150
Old man.

225
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,200
You can't drink much.

226
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,270
Old man, wake up.

227
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,750
Wake up.

228
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,630
Old man.

229
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,080
Old man.

230
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,080
You got yourself drunk.

231
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,080
Don't blame me.

232
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,550
If it's discovered,

233
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,000
I'll be doomed.

234
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,000
Amitabha.

235
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,150
Forgive me.

236
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,240
Forgive me.

237
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,320
Old man, you should drink less.

238
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,320
Chen.

239
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,790
Chen.

240
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,440
Chen.

241
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,270
Your Majesty.

242
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,030
I'm afraid Chen won't think

243
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,200
the same way as you.

244
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,080
They're perfect for each other.

245
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,600
If they get married,

246
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,080
it will be a happy thing
in the Heavenly Realm.

247
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,870
Love is uncontrollable.

248
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,150
No matter what,

249
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,600
you can't force two people

250
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,550
to be together.

251
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,720
How do you know without trying?

252
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,080
If it goes against fate,

253
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,000
it will end up being a dream,

254
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,720
with nothing left.

255
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,600
I'm busy.

256
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,510
You may leave.

257
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,600
I have important things to discuss.

258
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,910
Today in the court...

259
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:33,390
They've already reported

260
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,720
that vision is related
to the Heavenly Tribulation.

261
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,150
Heavenly Tribulation again?

262
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,390
Chen.

263
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,030
You...

264
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,240
Chen.

265
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,440
Are you calling Northern Dipper Lord?

266
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:51,120
I'll deal with the Heavenly Tribulation.

267
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,720
Do not interfere.

268
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,910
May I ask how you will deal with it?

269
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:56,750
Chen.

270
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,030
Chen.

271
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,320
None of your concern.

272
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,840
Just mind your own business.

273
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,200
Why is it not my business?

274
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,440
I am the Heavenly Empress.

275
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,870
This matter is closely related
to everyone in the Immortal Realm.

276
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,120
Remember, do not spread any word of it

277
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,790
to avoid causing panic.

278
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,720
For the record,

279
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,630
the mission of those
who undergo the tribulation

280
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
is to die for the sake of all beings.

281
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,120
If you always stop it
with the power of divine objects,

282
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,440
it'll cause the Heavenly Tribulation

283
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,910
to come endlessly.

284
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,440
It is purely unfounded speculation.

285
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,030
I know

286
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,510
what you're up to.

287
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,150
Let's wait and see.

288
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:45,200
Fujin.

289
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,840
When did you become like this?

290
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,790
You're busy, aren't you?

291
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,670
I'll leave you alone.

292
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,670
I'll take my leave.

293
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:04,270
Chen.

294
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,160
You...

295
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,830
You're speaking?

296
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,830
When the Heavenly Tribulation appears,
the six realms perish.

297
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,680
As Northern Dipper falls,
all things come to life.
