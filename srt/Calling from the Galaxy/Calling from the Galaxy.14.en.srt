In that case,

108
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,000
should I consider

109
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,120
where to open

113
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,870
on this journey, did you and Mr. Bu

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,430
have any sparks of love?

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:08,870
Why do you ask that?

116
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,870
Just look at you now.

117
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,040
Your face is glowing.

118
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,390
That's not true. I am not.

119
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,560
Don't talk nonsense.

120
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,270
So what kind of man do you like?

121
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,950
Let me help you figure it out.

122
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:29,720
I like men who are tall, dashing,

123
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,310
and elegant,

124
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:33,120
like an immortal.

125
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,800
A bit abstract.

126
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,040
Can you be more specific?

127
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,800
He must know how to play chess.

128
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,800
While he is playing chess,

129
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,160
it's as if even the surroundings
have quieted down

130
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,920
and everything else
has nothing to do with him.

131
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,430
He must be smart.

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Right, peach blossoms.

133
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
Peach blossoms seem
to always be chasing him.

134
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,510
Wherever he is,

135
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,360
there will always be pink peach blossoms
fluttering through the sky.

136
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,630
He'd better

137
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,510
have some petals on his shoulders.

138
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:09,270
He must also like plants.

139
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,480
It's so difficult.

140
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,630
He must also be able to pick stars.

141
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,950
All the stars are at his command.

142
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,600
Hold on.

143
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,480
Speak a bit slower.

144
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,600
I can't remember it all.

145
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,360
Why bother?

146
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,920
I might be able

147
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,310
to set you up with someone.

148

Push me up there.

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,600
I'll carry you.

153

163

170
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,240
during your treasure hunt?

171
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,670
A lot.

172
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,720
Let me tell you.

173
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,630
Thanks to me,

174
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
or your bestie wouldn't
have made it back.

175

Look at you.

176

All thanks to my wits,

177
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,270
right? Tell me.

178
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,080
Wits?

179
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,670
Right?

180
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,000
Right.

181
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,270
Why isn't Miss Gu here today?

182
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,080
She is only sixteen,

183
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,480
so she can't come to this kind of place.

184
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
She's just being delicate.

185
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,670
Let's not talk about that troublemaker.

186
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,270
Don't invite her
for the next treasure hunt, okay?

187
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:08,320
Whenever I see her, I...

188
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,080
The two of you are about the same, okay?

189
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,440
I'll toast to you once more.

190
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,120
Do you have any plans?

191
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,320
Manman, let me tell you.

192
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:22,750
We'll...

193
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,390
Well,

194
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,480
we are going to send Miss Yu back,

195

Xinglan.

197
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,200
Is there something going on with you?

198
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,870
I'm fine.

199
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,150
What's wrong with you?

200
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:35,630
Nothing's wrong.

201
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,960
It's you.

202
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,910
What's wrong with me?

203
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,630
Xinglan, if there's
something wrong with you,

204
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,720
you must tell me.

205
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,240
I-I'm fine.

206
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:48,720
I'll toast to you once more.

207
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,790
When going out,

208
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,910
please

209
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,910
take care of Xinglan.

[Yu Residence]

211
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Why are you imitating me?

212
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,550
Why are you imitating me?

213
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,240
Hand it over.

214
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,790
What?

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
Stop pretending. You know it.

216
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,670
I don't know.

218
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,150
What is the Silver Leaf Jade Flower?

219
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,550
Is it this one?

220
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,120
This is more like it.

221
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:01,480
Rest early.

222
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,720
Xinglan, great news.

223
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:16,840

Xinglan.

225
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,390
Are you still sleeping in?

226
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,320
I have great news.

227
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,600
Xinglan, listen to me.

228
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:30,870
Let me tell you.

229
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,150
These past few days,

230
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,840
I have indeed been racking my brains.

231
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,840
From nine years old to ninety years old,

232
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,120
from Donghuamen to Xihuamen,

233

I have selected

234

Don't you want to go take a look?

236
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,200
Come on.

237
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,000
Father, I've told you
I don't want to get married.

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,240
I just want to manage
Lingxi Pavilion well.

239
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,910
You can do both.

240
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,840
You want to manage Lingxi Pavilion well,

241
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,270
then you need a helper, right?

242
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,200
Xinglan, they are all waiting.

243
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,790

Mr. Bu, good morning.

247
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,240
Mr. Bu.

248
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,910
I am taking Xinglan to meet suitors.

249
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,360
Would you like to come?

250
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,600
What for?

251
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,360
Let me tell you.

252
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:46,600
Only men understand men, right?

253
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,630
Mr. Bu

254
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,910
can help you keep an eye out.

255
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:49,960
It'd be better.

256
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,390
Okay.

257
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,720
Mr. Bu deals with many things every day.

258
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
I'm afraid he might not be available.

259
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,440
Fortunately, I happen
to be available today.

260
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,870
See, what a coincidence.

261
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,840
Let's go together.

262
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
Hurry, let's go.

Why isn't it open today?

267
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,480
Xinglan, don't rush.

268
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,030
I'll tell you why later.

269

Welcome back, Miss Yu.

273
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,030
Xinglan, how is it?

274

I know you.

all your requirements, right?

277
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:20,320
Xinglan, tell me
once you've made your choice.

00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:37,200
Miss Yu, you are truly fortunate.

279
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,870
Then I'll share it with you.

280

Miss Yu, please don't.

281
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,910
My lady, I think
they are all quite nice.

282
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,390
Any man could charm you,

283
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
right?

284
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,390
What?

285
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,630

you must tell me in advance.

Don't hide it.
