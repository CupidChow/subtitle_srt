00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,920
Here is my plan.

7
00:00:55,259 --> 00:00:57,319
As soon as the wedding ends, I will settle my business...

8
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,990
and leave for the Ming.

9
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:00,759
This is insane.

10
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:03,899
Did you just say that to me?

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,640
No, I said it to myself.

12
00:01:12,569 --> 00:01:16,140
How was this an idea that came from the smartest scholar in Joseon?

13
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,949
We do not even speak their language. How can we live in the Ming?

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,050
I speak their language.

15
00:01:22,419 --> 00:01:24,649
People in the Ming would also need a matchmaker.

16
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,318
- I'm an Agent of Love! - But still...

17
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:30,690
Love is everywhere, and it is the beginning of everything.

18
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,058
The power of love...

19
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,899
Why can you not think of a way to be together here in Joseon?

20
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,100
But how?

21
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,369
Do you think this family will let you go that easily?

22
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,809
I wonder.

23
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,850
But there would be a way, right?

24
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,890
I will find a way...

25
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,419
to be with you in this land.

26
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,059
Please do not worry.

27
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,199
All right.

30
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:33,220
Lady Jo will not return no matter how much you wait.

31
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,590
The family will be in an uproar today.

32
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,489
Darn it. Perhaps I should just stay out.

33
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,900
What? Lady Jo?

34
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,639
My goodness, Lady Jo.

35
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,880
Lady Jo, why are you so late?

36
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:56,680
My dear, let us go inside.

37
00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,549
"My dear?" Lady Park would be furious if she found out!

38
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,819
I would not have returned if it had not been for him.

39
00:03:05,989 --> 00:03:06,989
(Two hours ago)

40
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,789
Let us hide out at Sunhwa Temple tonight.

41
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:10,859
I have a plan.

42
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:13,060
I did not show up at the wedding today,

43
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,228
so all of Hanyang will hear about my broken marriage.

44
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,660
I will never get another proposal,

45
00:03:17,229 --> 00:03:19,069
so she will let you live with me.

46
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:26,269
No, I cannot let people say such things about you.

47
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,780
Who cares about others?

48
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,839
All I want is to live with you.

49
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,880
I cannot condone it.

50
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,449
You must always remain honorable.

51
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,359
Let us go back to your home.

52
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,630
I am not going back. I will live with you.

53
00:03:51,729 --> 00:03:53,530
I will ask your mother...

54
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:54,939
for your hand.

55
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,100
If we go now,

56
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,769
you may get beaten up to death.

57
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,780
You even ran away on the day of your wedding.

58
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,479
There is nothing I cannot do.

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,220
It will be okay, right?

60
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,960
I will do anything it takes to live with you.

61
00:04:27,739 --> 00:04:29,069
Your family is in an uproar.

62
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,799
Why are you adding to this trouble?

63
00:04:31,239 --> 00:04:33,640
You need to save my life and go inside alone.

64
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,379
- Goodness. - No...

65
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,749
That is enough.

66
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,749
Lady Jo and I will meet her mother together.

67
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,390
Move aside.

68
00:04:47,489 --> 00:04:48,689
He just told you to move aside.

69
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,390
Lady Park told me...

70
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:52,929
to bring both of them.

71
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:54,559
She did?

72
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,660
Yes.

73
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,070
Really?

(The quirk of fate to marry)

75
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,539
This must be the room.

76
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Open it.

77
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,510
Please walk away from the door for a moment.

78
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,450
What are you doing right now?

79
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,359
For what reason...

80
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:29,160
do you dare to insolently open the room of the newlyweds?

81
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:31,900
Well, it is...

82
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,239
There is something I must check.

83
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:58,390
Did my mother really say she wanted to see him too?

84
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:02,129
Well, it was not Lady Park, but Lady Jung.

85
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,030
Soon Duk?

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,700
The chief magistrate must have noticed.

87
00:06:10,939 --> 00:06:12,010
Let us run away.

88
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,109
If we got caught looking like this, that would be the end of us.

89
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,669
Ye Jin, why are you so late?

90
00:06:40,429 --> 00:06:42,999
Why are you two dressed in wedding gowns?

91
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:45,269
Why do you think?

92
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,070
It is to let you two be together.

93
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,939
The chief magistrate is going around checking the groom's face,

94
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,809
so show his face when the door opens and make this final.

95
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,820
What?

96
00:06:57,379 --> 00:06:59,749
I received a report that this was a faked marriage.

97
00:07:03,419 --> 00:07:05,189
This is my daughter's room.

98
00:07:05,989 --> 00:07:07,260
That could not have happened.

99
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,330
Please return.

100
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:13,600
I just have to see the groom's face.

101
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:15,340
Why do you stop me?

102
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:19,570
There must be a problem, right?

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,280
How dare you?

104
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,679
We have no time to stand here. We must leave now.

105
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,619
Lady Park!

106
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:39,330
Turn your face.

107
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
Oh, my!

108
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:47,669
This cannot be true.

109
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,350
Leave my home immediately.

110
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,350
I will never forget this!

111
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,090
This is weird.

112
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:12,129
Why is Lord Sim not here?

113
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,830
- My gosh. - He is coming out.

114
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:16,229
- Goodness. - Hurry.

115
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:18,799
My goodness!

116
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:25,070
The bride was the daughter of the left state councilor,

117
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:27,309
but the groom was not the son of the Minister of Defense.

118
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:30,139
I already told you that the Minister of Defense's son...

119
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,580
already married the second daughter of Erudite Maeng.

120
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,450
The lady of this house...

121
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,419
always had someone she was to marry.

122
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,219
That is not something you should be confused about. You are impossible.

123
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,220
Goodness, no way.

124
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:44,259
Then who did I make that match for?

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,059
It is time to go.

126
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,059
Go. Go now.

127
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,129
My gosh.

128
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:52,029
Go now.

129
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,950
Mother, I can explain everything.

130
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,389
What do you think you are doing?

131
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,159
Take your hands off him!

132
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,369
Mother, Soon Duk did everything because of me, so please calm down.

133
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,499
I am utterly disappointed in you.

134
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,739
Did you coax...

135
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:41,420
that naive Ye Jin to marry the son of the Minister of Defense...

136
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:44,279
to one of those old ladies?

137
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,349
I told you time and time again about the importance...

138
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,659
of her marriage with the son of the Minister of Defense!

139
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:51,460
How can you do this to me?

140
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,359
Ye Jin's feelings were...

141
00:09:54,489 --> 00:09:55,758
more important to me.

142
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:57,199
Who cares about feelings?

143
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,029
Mother, please stop.

144
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,009
It was not because of Soon Duk. This was my choice.

145
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:15,979
Please allow me to marry Lady Ye Jin.

146
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:18,889
I may not be much now,

147
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,659
but I will do my best to be worthy of this family.

148
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:27,460
No matter how hard you try,

149
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,700
you can never be enough for our family.

150
00:10:31,729 --> 00:10:33,129
Leave my home now!

151
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:35,570
If that is what you have to say,

152
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,710
I will leave this home with my husband.

153
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,040
Let us go, my dear.

154
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,879
Ye Jin.

155
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:45,509
You cannot do this to your mother.

156
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:50,219
How... How dare you two do this?

157
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,249
Lady Park.

158
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,649
This wedding was already held.

159
00:10:55,859 --> 00:10:58,190
Did you wish to let everyone know that your daughter...

160
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,729
ran away before the wedding?

161
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,229
Were you...

162
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,529
in this scheme together?

163
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:10,200
I had the order from His Majesty to hold these marriages.

164
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,070
I should do my best to the end.

165
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,749
Is your way of life ruining the future...

166
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,749
of my daughter...

167
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,850
and my family by partnering with another man?

168
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,659
You would surely be punished...

169
00:11:32,989 --> 00:11:34,629
for what you have done.

170
00:11:55,379 --> 00:11:57,748
I am quite late, am I not? Give me a moment.

171
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:00,590
I brought some food from the party, so I just have to cook some rice.

172
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:02,590
I have...

173
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,460
already made rice.

174
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,499
You made rice?

175
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,430
It does not look so great,

176
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:14,229
but it should be edible.

177
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:17,940
And this.

178
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,159
Will you...

179
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,470
marry me?

180
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:33,810
Are you all right?

181
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,850
Lady Jung.

182
00:13:39,989 --> 00:13:41,619
Leave with me now.

183
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:45,659
Now?

184
00:13:47,129 --> 00:13:48,259
No.

185
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:50,830
You said you would do as I said after the wedding.

186
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,269
I asked you to give me some time.

187
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,840
Why are you in such a hurry?

188
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,070
We do not know how you will suffer if you stay here.

189
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,739
My brother is here too.

190
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,249
Do not worry.

191
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:09,820
Then, I will...

192
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,019
also stay here tonight.

193
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:16,159
Things would be worse...

194
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:18,830
if you stayed here.

195
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:21,259
I will reach out to you.

196
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,129
Please return tonight.

197
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:28,440
You have to reach out tomorrow.

198
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,639
All right.

199
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,259
You did this because of me,

200
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,028
but Mother saw you and Lord Sim in wedding garments,

201
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,999
so she must have been surprised.

202
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:00,200
That is why she is furious.

203
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,170
Please try to understand.

204
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:09,909
Ye Jin.

205
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:17,979
I like Lord Gyeongunjae.

206
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,489
What do you mean?

207
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:29,859
I am sorry.

208
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,470
I cannot take your side on this matter.

209
00:15:43,479 --> 00:15:46,310
However, in two days...

210
00:15:48,249 --> 00:15:49,879
No, in just one day,

211
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,950
I will take your side again.

212
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,389
Because you were always on my side too.

213
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:03,359
Ye Jin.

214
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,970
But for tonight, just discuss my marriage.

215
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,670
If you bring up your story, she may really collapse.

216
00:16:23,749 --> 00:16:24,749
Mother.

217
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,220
It is I, Soon Duk.

218
00:16:28,859 --> 00:16:29,859
Go back.

219
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,090
I do not wish to see you.

220
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:36,830
I said, I did not wish to see you!

221
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,329
I even killed my husband and brother...

222
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:40,800
to keep this family together.

223
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:42,239
But you ruined everything!

224
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,379
You...

225
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,310
did it?

226
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:02,389
Ye Jin...

227
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,639
Let us go to your place immediately.

228
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,679
If we leave like this,

229
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,480
what about Geun Seok and Lady Jung?

230
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:32,550
She tried the hardest to let us be together.

231
00:17:32,889 --> 00:17:34,350
It is our turn to help.

232
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,260
Bu Kyum...

233
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,129
Let us resolve...

234
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,060
this family affair together.

235
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:47,070
I want to do my best to become a man...

236
00:17:47,469 --> 00:17:48,500
your family will desire,

237
00:17:49,439 --> 00:17:50,740
just for you, Ye Jin.

238
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:55,898
The Crown Prince told me...

239
00:18:55,899 --> 00:18:58,369
the wedding for the old ladies were quite eventful.

240
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,669
I apologize.

241
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,379
No, I was not blaming you.

242
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,709
It was a compliment.

243
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:10,549
It would not do me any good if that family married...

244
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,649
the Minister of Defense's family.

245
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,459
The Crown Prince's determination throughout his marriage...

246
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,530
helped vanish many concerns of my royal subjects.

247
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,928
Jung Woo, it seems like...

248
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:30,739
you have an excellent knack for matchmaking.

249
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,109
You should take that up as your career from now on.

250
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,779
- I was joking. - Right.

251
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,080
You looked so shocked that your eyes could pop out.

252
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:47,250
Your Letter of Appeal will be processed soon.

253
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,629
Think of something you wish to do.

254
00:19:57,459 --> 00:19:59,529
I had begun to hold a grudge...

255
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,929
when I heard you eloped...

256
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,570
before the wedding was over.

257
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,439
I am sorry.

258
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,379
This is out of order,

259
00:20:14,449 --> 00:20:16,320
but this is the birth date and hour of your daughter-in-law.

260
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,320
The order of events isn't important.

261
00:20:20,689 --> 00:20:23,060
It is much better to marry the family of the Crown Princess...

262
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:26,189
than the ruined family of the left state councilor.

263
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,780
I have something to say to you.

264
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,889
Take off your lowly garment and wait for me.

265
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,699
My lord!

266
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:10,500
This is an urgent letter from the left state councilor's family.

267
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:17,409
Teacher.

268
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:20,609
I must speak to you urgently regarding my mother.

269
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,379
Please come to my place.

270
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,429
The young master is inside.

271
00:21:42,199 --> 00:21:44,570
Lady Jung, are you all right?

272
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,340
What brings you here?

273
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,840
Geun Seok sent me a letter saying this was urgent.

274
00:21:52,609 --> 00:21:53,649
Sorry?

275
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,389
You cannot escape, so do not even try.

276
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,070
Lord Sim, I have reported you for violating my daughter-in-law.

277
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,639
The Department of Justice will be here soon to arrest you.

278
00:22:16,939 --> 00:22:19,540
Mother, please do not do this.

279
00:22:20,409 --> 00:22:21,740
You do not have to feel aggrieved.

280
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,540
This is the result of your choice.

281
00:22:25,209 --> 00:22:26,709
Accept it as your fate.

282
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,980
I have put you in this danger.

283
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,879
I have acted too rashly.

284
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,149
It is not your fault.

285
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,090
No.

286
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,389
Everything seems like my fault.

287
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,800
I should not have fallen for you...

288
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,100
at the book rental shop.

289
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,000
You said you had not fallen for me there,

290
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,139
but you had fallen for me then.

291
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,379
How can you make jokes in this situation?

292
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,080
I should have followed you...

293
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,290
when you asked me to elope.

294
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:49,699
But still, you should deny this until the very end.

295
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,770
I shall remain the only one who had feelings for you.

296
00:23:57,399 --> 00:23:58,699
I cannot do that.

297
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:01,709
I like you too much.

298
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,439
If you suffer alone,

299
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,520
I am afraid you will end up regretting...

300
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,119
our encounter altogether.

301
00:24:28,199 --> 00:24:29,240
Do you know...

302
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,139
why my heart is racing?

303
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,510
Because you are afraid.

304
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:39,209
No.

305
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:43,080
Because I am in love with you.

306
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:50,419
So, I will not regret...

307
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,060
our encounter.

308
00:24:54,429 --> 00:24:55,459
Never.

309
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,350
What was Lord Gyeongunjae accused of?

310
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,289
He was accused of violating...

311
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,520
the daughter of the late left state councilor.

312
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,159
"Violating?"

313
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:00,959
Lord Gyeongunjae?

314
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,560
What is this nonsense?

315
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,300
I also thought it was nonsense.

316
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:10,070
But he was caught in the same room as Lady Jung.

317
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,100
It must be true.

318
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,240
I will not believe this until I hear this from him.

319
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:33,760
What in the world happened?

320
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,000
Were you trapped into this?

321
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,159
No.

322
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,330
Then what?

323
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,939
Did you really...

324
00:26:45,909 --> 00:26:48,040
try to violate that woman?

325
00:26:50,439 --> 00:26:51,439
Yes.

326
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,080
I insisted on this relationship because only I had feelings for her.

327
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,579
Please do not let that lady suffer.

328
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,649
Is that...

329
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,050
all you have to say to me right now?

330
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,399
I must have had...

331
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:17,000
the wrong idea about you.

332
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:30,679
My sister got involved in a scandalous matter...

333
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,050
and caused trouble for your family.

334
00:27:33,949 --> 00:27:35,149
My father and I thought...

335
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,889
we should take her back to our family.

336
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:41,429
What do you mean, trouble?

337
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:44,659
Soon Duk was not at fault.

338
00:27:45,399 --> 00:27:47,030
- But... - She has married into our family,

339
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,199
so she is one of us now.

340
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,139
No matter what happened to her,

341
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,270
it is only proper for her to spend the rest of her life here.

342
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,980
May I meet her?

343
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:03,449
She probably does not wish to meet anyone right now.

344
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,820
I will make sure...

345
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:09,419
she does not suffer from people's humiliation.

346
00:28:10,419 --> 00:28:11,990
Please do not worry so much.

347
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,879
I need to meet...

348
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:40,149
my mother-in-law.

349
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,740
If you took my advice,

350
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,280
you could have started a career after your appeal was processed...

351
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:11,719
and would have become the leader of Dongro Faction.

352
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,350
But you have fallen to this rock bottom...

353
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,719
because of your fleeting feelings.

354
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:23,230
You are the one who is at rock bottom, not me.

355
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,629
How can you say that in this situation you are in?

356
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:35,169
Golden silkworm poison, the poison you used eight years ago.

357
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:37,240
Do you know what it does?

358
00:29:38,909 --> 00:29:41,579
According to old books, those who use golden silkworm poison...

359
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,719
become prosperous...

360
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,020
and reach high honors.

361
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:47,389
However, in the end,

362
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,020
it also destroys the one who used that poison.

363
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,530
That poison killed your son,

364
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,300
your younger brother, and your husband.

365
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:04,439
The curse must have been true.

366
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,979
If some legend in an old book can become your comfort,

367
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,510
feel free to think as you like.

368
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:16,750
However, it is evident that you are the one...

369
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:18,679
who is about to face his demise.

370
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,060
We shall see.

371
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,540
(Rescue Operation for the Widowed Son-in-law of the King)

372
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,739
My husband is doing his best...

373
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,209
to bring Soon Duk back home.

374
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,810
We should wait a little longer.

375
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,980
The problem is Lord Sim.

376
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,189
What if we dug up a tunnel under the prison cell...

377
00:30:55,719 --> 00:30:57,219
and rescue him?

378
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,290
How long do you think that is going to take?

379
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,628
We can make the guards drunk...

380
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:03,899
and pull him out.

381
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,468
Why are you adding to this too?

382
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:09,540
The prison is not as lax as you see in some novels.

383
00:31:11,199 --> 00:31:13,168
Are you belittling novels?

384
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,240
No, I am not.

385
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,550
Tonight,

386
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,080
Lord Sim will receive poison as his death penalty.

387
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,159
Receive the royal command as a criminal.

388
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:39,000
Stop the punishment!

389
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,330
Sim Jung Woo.

390
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:51,939
It is not too late...

391
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:56,310
to admit that you have fallen into Lady Park's trap.

392
00:32:58,379 --> 00:33:02,350
She shall be punished brutally for daring to frame...

393
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,619
someone of the royal family.

394
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,590
And you may return to your life...

395
00:33:08,219 --> 00:33:10,560
as the son-in-law of the King.

396
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,290
However, if you continue to insist...

397
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,260
you did it because of your feelings for Lady Jung, her daughter-in-law,

398
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,570
I have no choice...

399
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,600
but to give you the death penalty.

400
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,439
I will...

401
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,980
admit to my crime...

402
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:42,090
and receive the death penalty.

403
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,989
You have betrayed my son...

404
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,860
and ruined my family, so I cannot leave you like this.

405
00:34:26,029 --> 00:34:27,670
This is the last bit of concern...

406
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:31,469
I can show you for old times' sake.

407
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:36,810
I hear the Department of Justice...

408
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,810
will execute Lord Gyeongunjae's death penalty today.

409
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:45,850
He is no longer of this world.

410
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:58,659
I am telling you so that it is easier for you to decide.

411
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,319
Lord Jo's daughter-in-law took her own life?

412
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,618
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:02,548
That is why the Jo family...

414
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:05,060
requested a memorial for her.

415
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,460
You can review it.

416
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,360
Yes, Your Majesty.

417
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,549
Even if...

418
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:37,589
we can never meet again,

419
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,360
please live on beautifully...

420
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:48,330
as the person I fell in love with no matter what happens.

421
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,770
That way, I will not regret meeting you.

422
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:56,779
We will...

423
00:37:59,409 --> 00:38:01,909
definitely meet again.

424
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:09,350
That is...

425
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,130
the fate we share.

426
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,350
Have you come to your senses?

427
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:57,770
Lord Sim.

428
00:38:58,869 --> 00:38:59,969
My lord.

429
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:02,869
My lord.

430
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,219
Are you awake?

431
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:13,520
He is alive.

432
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:21,989
You were unconscious for ten days.

433
00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:24,400
I was terrified that you were dead.

434
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:29,500
Do you have that little faith in me as a physician?

435
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,440
What is going on?

436
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:35,869
His Majesty...

437
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:38,739
secretly ordered me to save you.

438
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,179
I did not know either until Physician Yu told me.

439
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,759
You must not get out of bed yet.

440
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,230
Although the dose was small, you had poison.

441
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:56,330
You must stay in bed and receive treatment for now.

442
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,400
I must see Lady Jung who must be worried for me.

443
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:09,540
What is the matter?

444
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,210
Well...

445
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,650
After...

446
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:19,049
you drank the poison,

447
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:22,219
she took her own life.

448
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,759
That is impossible.

449
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:31,699
I must see her myself...

450
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,170
- My lord. - Oh, dear.

451
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,969
- My lord! - Lord Sim!

452
00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:42,709
Silla people called Agents of Love...

453
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,509
"lonely souls."

454
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,408
That is because he who marries an agent...

455
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:50,319
is fated to die young.

456
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,618
Learning without thought is futile,

457
00:40:56,619 --> 00:40:58,388
thinking without learning is fatal.

458
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,658
(A month later)

459
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:02,130
If you study without reflecting on your own,

460
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:05,330
knowledge will only be an empty shell.

461
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,040
A scholar must always guard against dogmatism.

462
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,440
Understood?

463
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,270
Yes. I will keep that in mind, Uncle.

464
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:16,839
How is home tutoring?

465
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,779
Uncle is a better teacher than mine at school.

466
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:24,819
Uncle, will you be taking the upcoming state exam?

467
00:41:25,779 --> 00:41:28,048
No, he has to farm.

468
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:29,520
He will not have the time.

469
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,719
I thought you wanted to be the wife of an official.

470
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:36,330
For that to happen, Uncle needs to be a first rank official.

471
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,360
I have a new dream.

472
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:40,929
The wife of a rich man.

473
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,069
So my husband just needs to pass the basic exam.

474
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,069
How can dreams change?

475
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,509
Technically, my dream is still the same.

476
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,480
Know the term "wealth and honor?"

477
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:57,980
With wealth and rank, one will be treated with honor...

478
00:41:58,219 --> 00:42:01,790
and the world shall know their name and face, right?

479
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,360
In that case, do you know why "wealth" comes before "honor?"

480
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:09,330
When you are wealthy, honor comes naturally.

481
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,330
When my husband becomes rich,

482
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,670
people will treat me with dignity, do you not think?

483
00:42:15,569 --> 00:42:18,569
You are starting to take after my mother, Aunt.

484
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,139
Is that so?

485
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,810
That is great then.

486
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,440
What is it?

487
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:54,909
Feeling stuck with your novel?

488
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:58,380
They say...

489
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:04,179
a writer can only write well when they are starving.

490
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,190
That saying must be true.

491
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,429
Thanks to you, I am well-provided for.

492
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,730
So I keep wanting to be lazy and loaf around.

493
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,500
I cannot tell if you are praising or blaming me.

494
00:43:24,969 --> 00:43:25,969
Where is it?

495
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,810
Which part are you stuck at?

496
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:34,779
Well...

497
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,920
That is...

498
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,920
While on the run, the lady happens to fall in love.

499
00:43:44,759 --> 00:43:49,259
But how can she have feelings in such a tense situation?

500
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:52,799
That is my concern.

501
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:05,509
We shall find out.

502
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:09,649
But it is still bright out.

503
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,750
I thought your deadline was tomorrow.

504
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:14,790
- We do not have time. - That is true, but...

505
00:44:19,159 --> 00:44:22,829
("The Last Agent of Love of Joseon")

506
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:26,299
The agent of love in the novel is amazing, do you not think?

507
00:44:27,069 --> 00:44:29,600
He had a bright future with his state exam scores,

508
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,299
but he gave everything up for love.

509
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,110
It was moving that he investigated the princess' death for a decade.

510
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:40,449
But he even drank poison to save the lady he loved.

511
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:45,619
Is he not the embodiment of love itself?

512
00:44:47,589 --> 00:44:48,619
But...

513
00:44:49,150 --> 00:44:50,920
the lady still died in the end.

514
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,929
The novel says she took her own life.

515
00:44:55,389 --> 00:44:57,759
Did her mother-in-law really kill her?

516
00:44:58,659 --> 00:44:59,830
Most likely.

517
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,400
The Jo family house has bad mojo.

518
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:06,238
It is just a made-up story.

519
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:07,310
Who says?

520
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,868
This is definitely the love story of the late Gyeongunjae...

521
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:11,778
and Lord Jo's daughter-in-law.

522
00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:14,150
Love story? As if. It is an affair.

523
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,580
How is it an affair? They were both widowed.

524
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,580
It is definitely...

525
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:22,250
love. It is love.

526
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,830
What are you saying?

527
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:40,139
Is it not tiring?

528
00:45:40,969 --> 00:45:42,009
It feels heavy.

529
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,750
Wait. You mean your stomach?

530
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,480
What the... It has only been a month.

531
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,319
I meant that your head was heavy.

532
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,619
My dear.

533
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,259
Are you tired of me already?

534
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,060
Of course not.

535
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,230
I had to focus on my needlework.

536
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:10,368
Is the needlework more important to you...

537
00:46:10,369 --> 00:46:12,339
than me?

538
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:16,170
You crazy...

539
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,040
The baby will hear.

540
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,750
I wonder who is the baby here.

541
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,960
Are you heading to the pharmacy?

542
00:46:40,469 --> 00:46:41,600
Let me bring you there.

543
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:45,040
It is all right. You should stay by Doo Ri's side.

544
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,569
But...

545
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:50,239
Mother, I can...

546
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,679
Have a safe trip.

547
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,259
Do you like me that much?

548
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:05,560
Yes.

549
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:08,190
Others will call you a henpecked.

550
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,860
Then let them. I am not afraid.

551
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,869
I was the one who switched my bride on my wedding.

552
00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:19,900
I am all right as long as I am not chided by you.

553
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,739
I miss Lady Yeoju.

554
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:31,250
Do you think...

555
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,020
these two should never have met?

556
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:38,060
They were fated to be with other partners after all.

557
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,988
As our forefathers said...

558
00:47:40,989 --> 00:47:42,859
Since their discussion just started,

559
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,929
they will be up all night again.

560
00:47:45,429 --> 00:47:46,928
I guess...

561
00:47:46,929 --> 00:47:48,900
we can forget about sleeping too.

562
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,670
I think they have every right to be together.

563
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:54,468
("The Last Agent of Love of Joseon")

564
00:47:54,469 --> 00:47:56,369
This is such a cruel story.

565
00:47:57,239 --> 00:47:58,940
How can they both die?

566
00:48:00,779 --> 00:48:03,718
It is natural for novels to have sad endings...

567
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:05,619
so that they linger in people's hearts.

568
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,819
Still, I prefer happy endings.

569
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:11,659
Me too.

570
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:16,830
By the way, do you think they have met?

571
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,460
I hope so.

572
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:33,610
("The Last Agent of Love of Joseon")

573
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:38,218
Someone has already reserved that book.

574
00:48:38,219 --> 00:48:39,650
Please put it down.

575
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:42,989
"At the lady's sudden touch..."

576
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,799
Ridiculous fiction like this must be popular these days.

577
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:54,730
The servant?

578
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,029
What brings you here?

579
00:48:57,699 --> 00:48:58,699
You see...

580
00:49:00,369 --> 00:49:02,669
I am here to meet the bookworm...

581
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:04,310
that is holed up in here reading all day.

582
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,040
This way, please.

583
00:49:08,049 --> 00:49:09,210
Take these.

584
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:33,639
Here.

585
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,068
- What? - Please watch your head.

586
00:49:35,069 --> 00:49:36,170
Which way?

587
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,779
This place is...

588
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:41,750
My lord.

589
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:43,480
Please hurry over.

590
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,679
You have an important guest.

591
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,049
How can you stay in this illegal space?

592
00:50:02,429 --> 00:50:04,500
What brings you to this humble place?

593
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:09,110
I feel offended having to look up at you.

594
00:50:09,569 --> 00:50:11,909
- Sit down. - Yes, Your Majesty.

595
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:18,020
According to Physician Yu,

596
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:21,619
you have completely recovered.

597
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,860
Do you not think you should get back to work?

598
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,759
I am still hurting emotionally.

599
00:50:30,429 --> 00:50:34,529
Everyone has wounds in their hearts, do you not agree?

600
00:50:34,869 --> 00:50:35,900
That is right.

601
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:44,580
Since you are dead on the records,

602
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,549
I prepared a new identity for you.

603
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:49,279
Park Moon Soo?

604
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:52,080
He was the previous secret inspector.

605
00:50:52,650 --> 00:50:55,949
But he died unexpectedly after meeting a mountain tiger.

606
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:58,290
- He died unexpectedly? - Yes.

607
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:01,360
Am I really the first one taking over this name?

608
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:04,258
Yes, pretty much.

609
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:05,730
Maybe 1 or 2 others.

610
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:08,270
He is the fifth one.

611
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,639
What are you doing?

612
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:15,539
Anyway, not all of the previous men are dead.

613
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,610
Do not worry.

614
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,750
Besides, you will not be dealing with corrupt officials.

615
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:27,750
Your task...

616
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,689
will be to go around Joseon...

617
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:33,719
and round up all the old bachelors and spinsters.

618
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:38,159
They are not bandits.

619
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:39,799
Do not say "round up!"

620
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,029
I am sorry.

621
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,469
How dare you glare at me?

622
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:50,270
Did you forget? I am the king!

623
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:53,809
Take it.

624
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:56,380
- Goodness. - But I am still...

625
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,479
Shut your mouth about your emotional hurt and whatnot.

626
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,549
I am your ex-father-in-law.

627
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,560
Set out by tomorrow.

628
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:09,460
Go. I have found a matchmaker.

629
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,500
Go and meet her right now.

630
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:17,339
She must have waited for a long time since you were sick.

631
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:21,770
Jung Woo.

632
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,040
Have a good life.

633
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:28,179
Goodness.

634
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,619
How do I get out?

635
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:15,259
This place is...

636
00:53:20,730 --> 00:53:22,170
It used to be my house.

637
00:53:23,299 --> 00:53:25,239
I stayed here since I was 7 till I was 18.

638
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:30,980
What a great day to air my heart.

639
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:18,589
My lord.

640
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:24,489
My dear...

641
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:28,060
What took you so long?

642
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:35,400
This must be a dream.

643
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:43,639
If it is a dream,

644
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,940
I do not want to wake up.

645
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:03,060
My lord.

646
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,699
This is not a dream.

647
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,540
But...

648
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:49,969
it feels way too real.

649
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,810
You were alive?

650
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
I have...

651
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:08,690
missed you dearly.

652
00:57:24,170 --> 00:57:26,679
Did you know everything?

653
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:32,279
His Majesty told me to keep it a secret.

654
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:35,750
But since he said we would meet soon,

655
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:37,889
I waited patiently.

656
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:44,960
So it was not a dream when I saw you at the physician's.

657
00:57:47,259 --> 00:57:49,369
I was worried, and I missed you...

658
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,439
so I went there secretly.

659
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:52,440
By the way,

660
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,069
were you also saved by His Majesty?

661
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,810
Maybe only partly.

662
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:04,250
I hear the Department of Justice...

663
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,750
will execute Lord Gyeongunjae's death penalty today.

664
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:11,589
He is no longer of this world.

665
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,190
I am telling you so that it is easier for you to decide.

666
00:58:22,529 --> 00:58:23,600
Mother.

667
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,810
I will not die.

668
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,080
You betrayed my son...

669
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:36,250
and gave your heart to another man. But in the face of death,

670
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:39,119
you are easily throwing that love away.

671
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,449
Love...

672
00:58:43,290 --> 00:58:45,489
is not proven with death.

673
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:51,230
I have lived as the person my husband loved me...

674
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:54,259
and will continue to do so.

675
00:58:55,529 --> 00:58:56,600
So,

676
00:58:57,670 --> 00:58:59,600
simply because I like another man...

677
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:03,710
does not mean my love for my husband will change.

678
00:59:05,639 --> 00:59:08,380
Who do you think will understand that?

679
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:11,420
For the rest of your life,

680
00:59:12,179 --> 00:59:15,089
people will point fingers at you for being a tarnished woman.

681
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:18,520
Even if you smile, they will speak ill of you.

682
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:20,360
And if you go outside,

683
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,889
they will gossip about you for knowing no shame.

684
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:28,299
Rather than such a life,

685
00:59:30,469 --> 00:59:32,839
is it not better to die with honor?

686
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,440
I do not care...

687
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,310
how people see me or what they talk about me.

688
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:45,549
For the sake of Geun Seok,

689
00:59:46,219 --> 00:59:48,049
my husband, and...

690
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:50,949
Lord Gyeongunjae,

691
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,190
I must live.

692
00:59:57,060 --> 00:59:58,799
I knew you were daring.

693
00:59:59,630 --> 01:00:01,670
But little did I know how shameless you were.

694
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,639
Say that you live such a pathetic life.

695
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:06,170
But what did Geun Seok do?

696
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:09,909
He will live with his mother's scandal his entire life.

697
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:15,069
I will die as the daughter-in-law of the Jo family.

698
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,480
However, Jung Soon Duk...

699
01:01:27,179 --> 01:01:29,750
will never die because of her family.

700
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:39,460
If I take my life here, everyone will believe you killed me.

701
01:01:40,259 --> 01:01:42,428
He may be young, but Geun Seok knows about everything.

702
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:44,400
Ye Jin does too.

703
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,369
I cannot...

704
01:01:47,569 --> 01:01:51,069
let them live a painful life of resenting their family.

705
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,049
That includes you, Mother.

706
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,100
However, I heard later that...

707
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,869
His Majesty sent a warrior...

708
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:24,408
to protect me under the Crown Prince's request...

709
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:26,080
that night.

710
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:28,580
Hence, the twenty percent.

711
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,779
But I was told your funeral was held.

712
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:35,389
How did you fool everyone?

713
01:02:37,589 --> 01:02:39,219
I used a trick.

714
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:41,489
"A trick?"

715
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,440
Mother.

716
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,339
Yes, come in.

717
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:07,920
Grandmother told me I would no longer be able to see you.

718
01:03:08,150 --> 01:03:09,350
Is that true?

719
01:03:11,759 --> 01:03:12,819
No.

720
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:15,560
Your mother is alive.

721
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,060
We can meet any time.

722
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:21,199
I knew it.

723
01:03:23,270 --> 01:03:24,699
Because of me,

724
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,869
you are going through a lot.

725
01:03:28,170 --> 01:03:29,239
No.

726
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:33,839
I am happy for you. It is like you have found your winged clothes.

727
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,710
So do not worry about me.

728
01:03:37,009 --> 01:03:39,819
Please find good matches for people.

729
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,159
Thank you.

730
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:52,360
My son.

731
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:58,799
When did you grow up so much?

732
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:14,419
Does that mean Geun Seok is at home alone?

733
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:15,449
No.

734
01:04:16,449 --> 01:04:17,989
Geun Seok is at his aunt's place.

735
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,060
He visits me here from time to time.

736
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,600
The one alone in that house...

737
01:04:30,029 --> 01:04:31,270
is my mother-in-law.

738
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,830
I was not wrong.

739
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:14,779
(List of Spinsters and Old Bachelors in the 8 Provinces)

740
01:05:19,380 --> 01:05:22,049
We will travel around the eight provinces to find matches.

741
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:25,560
I am already excited.

742
01:05:28,360 --> 01:05:31,400
But there is something much more important before that.

743
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,699
What is it?

744
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:39,500
When should we get married?

745
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:48,210
Is the Lord Inspector currently teasing a windowed peddler?

746
01:05:50,509 --> 01:05:51,949
Concentrate on your work.

747
01:05:53,779 --> 01:05:56,949
I cannot because of the thought of our marriage.

748
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,319
Then...

749
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,230
before our marriage,

750
01:06:04,659 --> 01:06:06,860
how about having a romantic relationship?

751
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:09,029
"A romantic relationship?"

752
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:11,298
It is said that a foolish person,

753
01:06:11,299 --> 01:06:14,170
who cannot control their feelings, has a romantic relationship...

754
01:06:15,369 --> 01:06:16,639
In this Joseon,

755
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,279
is there anyone more foolish than us?

756
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:28,790
So,

757
01:06:29,150 --> 01:06:32,190
let us start with the heart-pounding romantic relationship in novels.

758
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:35,259
That is while finding good matches for people.

759
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,469
A heart-pounding romantic relationship?

760
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,139
That sounds nice.

761
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:55,169
