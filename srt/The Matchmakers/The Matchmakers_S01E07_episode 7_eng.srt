1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:10,280

2
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:21,370

3
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,380

4
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,880

5
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,830

I have special family relationships.

6
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:04,210

So it will be harder for me to marry than most people.

7
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:06,770
Is it because of my half-brother, Prince Jin Seong?

8
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,560
Not at all. The reason why it is hard for me to marry is

9
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,200
because I have four nooeys above me. 
  (Older sisters)

10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,880
Who would ever want to marry into a family with four sisters-in-law?

11
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,360

There is not much I want in a husband.

12
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,850

His family must be at least a senior fifth rank, but not below that.

13
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,550
He should be between 5.5 cheok and six cheok. 
  (1 cheok=1.094 ft)

14
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,320
Being too tall does not provide much substance.

15
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,920
His looks only need to be manly.

16
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,370
No.

17
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,010
I waited this long.

18
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:59,820
I will not marry if even one condition is not met.

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,990
I will state the most important condition.

20
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,550
He must be someone I can respect.

21
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,200

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,900
This is different from what I was told!

23
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,960
You said you would only punish the culprit without harming others. How could you...

24
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,370
make Lady Sam Soon do such a terrible thing?

25
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:25,130
P-Please d-do not yell...

26
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:27,450
Do not yell...

27
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,630
M-My... my h-heart...

28
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,800
Your Excellency!

29
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,130
Please wake up!

30
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,700
Your Excellency, please wake up.

31
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,070
Keep your eyes on me.

32
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,920
Your Excellency, please get on my back.

33
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,390
I will bring you to Baekchobang.

34
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:09,260
My horse is outside, so come to the front of the inn.

35
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,360
It is fine. I am okay now.

36
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,210
You passed out. How can you be okay?

37
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,970
We must go to Physician Yoo right away.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,780
Do not make a scene.

39
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,300
I know my body the best.

40
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,370
Explain the next step.

41
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,890
Time is of the essence.

42
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,650
Goodness.

43
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:55,360
 A deja vu! This is not the first time.

44
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,520
Lady Sam Soon, go stand by that wall.

45
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,580
Sorry?

46
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,980
H-Hurry up, now!

47
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:28,760
You go stand next to Lady Sam Soon now, Officer.

48
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,850
P-Please, I ask of you. Quickly.

49
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,680
 This was it? The cause of my chest pain?

50
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,390
Officer, take at least two steps away from Lady Sam Soon.

51
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:58,470
Right now, quickly! Now!

52
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,570
  Oh, does it hurt again?

53
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,260
From now on,

54
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:22,650
Lady Sam Soon and Officer are always to stay two steps apart.

55
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,310
For what reason?

56
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,970
My chest feels pain when two unmarried men and women are inappropriately close.

57
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,050
In the Book of Rites' Domestic Rules chapter,

58
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:42,910
it says boys and girls are to be set apart starting at the age of seven.

59
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,850
So, just consider that you are conforming to the rites.

60
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,580
Why are you laughing?

61
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:58,250
In my opinion, it is not because we violated the rites.

62
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,790
It is because Your Excellency has not experienced it nor has any chance at an experience.

63
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,510
I think your chest rushes in anger from just the sight of

64
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:08,430
unmarried man and woman close together.

65
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,760
Even your chest follows Confucius's teachings.

66
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,240
You are the paragon of a just scholar without error.

67
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:27,340
What is it this time?

68
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:32,320
Officer, are you still unmarried?

69
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,390
Get away from each other!

70
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,370
- Get away. 
 - G-Get away.

71
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,840
Get away from each other.

72
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,580
You are unmarried?

73
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,580
That is correct.

74
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,390
Yes!

75
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,120
Goodness!

76
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,880
I always lose her around here.

77
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,620

78
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,270
To start with the conclusion, the one who killed Lee Cho Ok is...

79
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,560
inferred to be the Defense Minister.

80
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,070
Defense Minister's birthday banquet was held the day Lee Cho Ok disappeared.

81
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,260

82
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:54,560
 Lee Cho Ok went to help out at the banquet for the Defense Minister.

83
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,690
 But she never came back.

84
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:00,310
The investigation journal did not mention Lee Cho Ok went to

85
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,390
Defense Minister's home at all.

86
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,530
In the early stages of the investigation,

87
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:06,540
many witnesses said they saw Lee Cho Ok at the Defense Minister's home

88
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,610
or saw him take her into his room.

89
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:11,920
But they all denied seeing her overnight.

90
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,760
They must have been silenced with money.

91
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:20,400
Everyone knew the Defense Minister kept hitting on Cho Ok when she was alive.

92
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,090
In this situation,

93
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:26,970
there is no reason Lee Cho Ok should work at the Defense Minister's home, is there?

94
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,080
She must have borrowed money from the Defense Minister during the last poor harvest.

95
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,200
He probably lured her in, saying he would forgive some interest if she worked at the banquet.

96
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,690
Looks like you know well how things work since you are a merchant.

97
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,240
Thank you.

98
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,260
I am quite keen, you see.

99
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,550
Unlike somebody.

100
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:51,580
Stop the side talk and continue explaining.

101
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,180
That is what I want to say.

102
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:01,470
After that, Lee Cho Ok was found as a corpse by the river.

103
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,870
According to the Defense Minister's butler's testimony that

104
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,300
she walked into the river on her own the day before,

105
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,770
the case was closed as suicide.

106
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:11,520
The fact that the witness is the Defense Minister's person

107
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,000
tells me the Defense Minister is the culprit.

108
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,010
I have a question.

109
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,520
How did I become the murderer of Cho Ok, then?

110
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,490
Because many of Hwa Rok's erotica novels were found in Lee Cho Ok's room.

111
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:31,680
It was concluded she took her own life due to her pessimistic view of being an old maiden

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,880
for being intoxicated by far-fetched novels, unable to tell reality from her imagination.

113
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,550
Hanseongbu wants to wrap up this case by

114
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,480
finding Hwa Rok guilty for writing psychoactive novels

115
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,000
that negatively affect women.

116
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,350
Gosh! Those stubborn officials always get needlessly imaginative at times like this.

117
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,150
Except you, Officer.

118
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:10,820
They have a rental bookstore in here, too?

119
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:23,250

Huh? I think I saw this book from somewhere.

120
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,670
- Huh? 
 - Two nyang for three days.

121
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:30,450
- Sorry? 
 - It is the hottest seller right now, so it is a bit expensive.

122
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,710
I was only taking a look.

123
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,310
I will now explain Operation Another Rumor

124
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,680
where we stop a rumor with another rumor.

125
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,330
We will judge the Defense Minister using public opinion, not the laws.

126
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,480
I shall change false rumors about Lady Ha Na into a commendable story.

127
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:57,560
How, you may ask? With an extremely interesting story.

128
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,950
Who, you may ask? Writer Hwa Rok, the most popular one right now.

129
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:06,060
I completely understood the plan.

130
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,890
Influence the public opinion, huh?

131
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:13,760
It is not the most just way, but it looks like the false rumor about the eldest will be taken care of.

132
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,320
Let us chant the operation's name to wish for success.

133
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,910
The contract does say I will follow Yeojudaek's matchmaking method, so...

134
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,550
You should also join, Officer.

135
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:50,010
Officer needs to keep a distance from Lady Sam Soon, so you should stay out of the hand overlap.

136
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,210
Put your hand on top.

137
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,120
O-Oh, okay.

138
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,390
All right. Stopping a rumor with another rumor!

139
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,330
-  Operation Another Rumor!  
 - Whoa!

140
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,970
L-Let us go now!

141
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,070
We are off to a great start.

142
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,700
Today is the day to enter the palace. We must hurry.

143
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,500
O-Oh, okay.

144
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,880
It was because I am a member of the Royal Family.

145
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,530
What was?

146
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,550
The reason Yeojudaek is distancing herself from me suddenly.

147
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,780
How burdensome must it be for a merchant to work with a Royal Family member?

148
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,870
Do you really think that is the reason?

149
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,590
How should I explain that I am very open in that sense?

150
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,340
You are open, huh? I was the only one unaware.

151
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,600
Gosh, let's hurry up and go!

152
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,410
Shouldn't you know it the best?

153
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:52,580
I am very open-minded in those regards.

154
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,560
Yes, of course.

155
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,870
I do not have any bias or stereotypes regarding matters of difference in class.

156
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,750
What did you want to tell me?

157
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:07,920
Please change my spouse to Officer instead of Scholar Number 23.

158
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,620
Let us not decide right now and take our time to think it over.

159
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:18,510
Why? Am I lacking to become Officer's partner?

160
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,490
No, that is not the case.

161
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,560
According to my intel, Officer is anti-marriage.

162
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,240
I was worried you might get hurt.

163
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,740
I was also anti-marriage once.

164
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,630
However, people's hearts are subject to change, are they not?

165
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:40,770
In my opinion, I think Officer also likes me.

166
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,440
You said you would let me choose the person I want.

167
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,800
Please help me.

168
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,270
 If it is Lady Sam Soon who is honest to herself and brave,

169
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,520
 she might be his real fate who can convince my stubborn Orabeoni.

170
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:07,420
All right, let us make it work.

171
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,110
A nuptial tie with Officer.

172
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,190
Thank you.

173
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,280
Do you remember the case of Lee Cho Ok, who died about six months ago?

174
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,100
Of course, I remember.

175
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,550
Is she not the woman who was pessimistic about being an old maiden and took her own life?

176
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:34,240
There was a story about her resentful ghost haunting virgins who were of age to marry.

177
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,480
That story was one of the reasons for stopping the crown prince's marriage.

178
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,090
So how could I forget?

179
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:44,300
That ghost story is tied to Master Maeng's three daughters' marriages and

180
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,950
I am working to resolve the issue with the matchmaker right now.

181
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,500
Okay, I am counting on you.

182
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,990
By the way,

183
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:02,290
the Left State Minister has no idea. Right?

184
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,890
Yes.

185
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:14,850
Actually, Left State Minister's wife seems to be suspicious of me. So, to cover it up,

186
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,030
I agreed to tutor the Left State Minister's grandson.

187
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:21,190
I got it for now.

188
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:41,890
Lady Sam Soon!

189
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,760
Did you stay up all night?

190
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,500
Hey, let us go to the merchants' inn quickly.

191
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,940
Sorry? Wait.

192
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,980
You are going to go like that?

193
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,030
I do not need to disguise as a man anymore.

194
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,820
Officer is off duty today, so he is coming to the merchants' inn to help transcribe.

195
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,220
Wait! Why are you telling me this now?

196
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,420
That is why I came here.

197
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:13,200
Hurry up and change your clothes first.

198
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,350
Let's make you a bit more beautiful.

199
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,900
Oh, Officer!

200
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,160
Lady, have you forgotten? Excessive expression of interest is taboo.

201
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,310
I only stood up. Is this also a taboo?

202
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,910
Officer is the type to run away when a woman approaches him too much.

203
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,100
So you will succeed only if you make him approach you on his own.

204
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,740
Okay, I got it.

205
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,500
Officer, you can take...

206
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,270
that seat over there and transcribe.

207
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:48,430
Gosh, I knew we could not hire transcribers for security reasons.

208
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:52,360
But why do I have to go around in this flippant attire?

209
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,080
It is to make people remember Hwa Rok as a scholar in a green robe.

210
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:00,250
When you leave, your butler will wear it and go all the way to the mill.

211
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,890
Oh, yes.

212
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,820
Testimonies about Hwa Rok will all talk about the green robe instead of physical traits.

213
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:10,710
So it will be convenient to evade the government troops.

214
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:13,550
As expected, your brain is very swift, Officer.

215
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,220
I was also aware of that much already.

216
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:35,490
 Yeojudaek, take note of this.

217
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,380
 Thank you for working hard for this matchmaking.

218
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:42,900
 Therefore, I will withdraw my order, telling you to stay three steps away.

219
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,760
 Also, do not be too wary of me for the convenience of our operations.

220
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,920
Story of Lady Cho Hui.

221
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,040
I cannot agree with the contents of the novel.

222
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,000
You can ask me about the contents.

223
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,610
Yes. If Cho Ok's ghost has a grudge,

224
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,130
she should appear in front of the magistrate to resolve her grudge.

225
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,680
How come she appears in front of virgins?

226
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,830
It lacks verisimilitude. 
  (Plausibility or credibility)

227
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,410
I do not really know what verisimilitude is,

228
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:48,570
but for Cho Ok's ghost, the one who killed her is the Defense Minister.

229
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,660
And the magistrate and officials are close friends of the Defense Minister.

230
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:54,720
Would she appear in front of the magistrate unless she is a fool?

231
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,320
She appeared in front of virgins because she thought women help other women.

232
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,730
Lady Sam Soon is correct.

233
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:08,250
I think this story has more than enough verisimilitude.

234
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,740
I also think Officer is righteous, unlike most government officials.

235
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,870
Goodness, why is it so hot suddenly? Is it just me?

236
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,220
I also do not think the contents are weird.

237
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,940
If everyone thinks so, then...

238
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,460
 I also get unprovoked palpitations when I have questions unanswered.

239
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,440
 So please reply to my opinion.

240
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,030
Lady!

241
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,970
You go back inside the bookstore and walk five times around before leaving.

242
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,450
I cannot go with the Officer if I do that.

243
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,740
That is exactly the point.

244
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,230
I will be taking my leave now.

245
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:29,070
 I am sad without limits if you are asking because you do not know my feelings.

246
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,070
No need to get sad now.

247
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,160
 Once you see this letter,

248
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:37,690
 please tell your feelings to the trees or the sky.

249
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:42,810
 I want to hear your words through the winds if I can.

250
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:46,960
 Cho Hui wrote the letter with a sincere heart for her fiancé.

251
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,190
Cho Hui?

252
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,070
Who is Cho Hui?

253
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,850
 I will take care of it. From Yeojudaek.

254
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:04,540
Wait! She wrote just one sentence on the back of a used paper?

255
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:08,970
She could have just told me this in person.

256
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:13,080
Why make me hopeful for no reason by handing it to me?

257
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,460
Even the paper has a scent.

258
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,420
 I also get unprovoked palpitations when I have questions unanswered.

259
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:36,430
 So please reply to my opinion.

260
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,870
And Confucius spoke.

261
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:33,130
How is it not joyful to learn and practice regularly?

262
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:36,700
Even if people do not recognize him, he is not upset.

263
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,860
So, how can he not be called a virtuous man?

264
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,140
Crown Prince, the queen wants you to enter the palace quickly.

265
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,470
Right now?

266
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,130
They considered it to be a beauty, so they sought harmony in all things, big and small.

267
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,140
But some matters still did not go as they wished.

268
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,250
There are no mountains on the way to the palace.

269
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,870
Stop the palanquin.

270
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,220
What is the matter?

271
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,300
I must pee right now.

272
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,260
But there is nothing in the palanquin.

273
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,030
It is embarrassing, so take three steps and turn around to stand guard.

274
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:38,170
Yes, I understand.

275
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,950
Sister!

276
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:54,860
You need to rub it to get the stains out!

277
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,410
I get eczema just from washing my hands.

278
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,840
- Please go easy on me. 
 - Go easy on you for what?

279
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,910
You are practicing because I cannot do it for you once you get married.

280
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,840
Fine.

281
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,830
You will do it for life once you get married, so forget the practice.

282
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,430
You just go catch pheasants as you always have.

283
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:17,000
I cannot bear to watch you.

284
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,110
Should I? It is better to do what each one is good at.

285
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,030
I will be back.

286
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:28,680
Be careful!

287
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,980
He ran away!

288
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:16,700
There he is!

289
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,690
It is that way.

290
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:46,700
A-Are you okay?

291
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,080
I will be once you get off.

292
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:02,300
You saved me with your slingshot, huh?

293
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,430
Sister.

294
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,110
Who is he?

295
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,510
He seems to be lost.

296
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,630
Hey, kiddo, where is your home?

297
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,480
I cannot answer that question.

298
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:35,910
I did not really want to know, either.

299
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:38,520
- Let's hurry up and go. 
 - Yes.

300
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,380
One second!

301
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,420
You saved me, so take responsibility to the end.

302
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,080
Take responsibility?

303
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:20,000
Hey, Oh Bong, straighten your back!

304
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,890
Gosh, your handwriting is...

305
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,090
Oh, I dozed off.

306
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,130
Your Excellency, there is no time for breaks right now.

307
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,980
I will be there.

308
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,990
They say a filled seat is unseen, but an empty seat is noticeable.

309
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,100
Not having Officer really slowed down our speed.

310
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,340
I am also powerless because Officer is not here.

311
00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:44,860
Are you writing with your mouth?

312
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,900
The distribution is in two days, so speed it up a bit, everyone.

313
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:51,610
Stop right there.

314
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,060
You said everyone needs to stay up all night at the inn because tomorrow is the first reveal.

315
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,930
But where are you going right now?

316
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:03,860
I am going to do a final review at Honorable Lady Sook's house, where the first reveal will be happening.

317
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,360
Now, then. I will see you later.

318
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,040
Wait— H-Hey.

319
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,430
Crown Prince was—

320
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,760
Young Master escaped? What does that mean?

321
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,770
He ran away because he was keen enough to catch on.

322
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:23,590
I am sure he is still inside the capital.

323
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:26,750
How many troops do we have available in Hanseongbu?

324
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,000
It is a late hour, but we have about 30 people.

325
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,810
I will gather them right now.

326
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:33,480
You cannot do that.

327
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,320
Using Hanseongbu's troops will provide an excuse later on

328
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,140
because there are too many people watching.

329
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:43,120
Are you saying we should just sit still and watch, then?

330
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,550
I ordered a merchant I know to look for Young Master in secret.

331
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:54,910
Therefore, our utmost priority is silencing the crown prince's bodyguard.

332
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:57,760
I will take care of that.

333
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:07,840
Mayor, you should go back to Hanseongbu right now.

334
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:12,650
If the crown prince went to the village, people might take him to the government office.

335
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,990
I understand.

336
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:24,270
I will also go take a look at how Sam Wol's mother is doing.

337
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:25,970
You do that—

338
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:34,120
I told her to go look for him.

339
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,160
Mother, did you want to see me?

340
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,810
I am quite tired today, so there is no need for evening greetings.

341
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,900
You can put Geun Seok to sleep early, too.

342
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,700
You are not feeling very ill or anything. Right?

343
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,930
It is just a light fatigue, so do not worry.

344
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,190
Little kid, this place is not it, either?

345
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:20,000
My name is not Little Kid.

346
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,900
It is Lee Jae.

347
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:27,230
You say your name so well, but why do you not know where your house is?

348
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,130
This is the first time—

349
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,510
I'm at my grandfather's house, and I have a hard time recognizing it since it is night.

350
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,400
It is almost curfew, so I will take you to Hanseongbu.

351
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,010
Let us go.

352
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,830
How could you bring the kid home!

353
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:14,910
If the kid is stupid and does not know where his house is, you should have taken him to Hanseongbu!

354
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:17,940
You dare call me stupid?

355
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:21,120
We did go to Hanseongbu.

356
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,250
The Defense Minister was at Hanseongbu.

357
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,140
He has bad feelings toward me because I struck Sinmungo,

358
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,710
so if I bring a random kid there...

359
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,640
He would spread rumors that he is your child out of wedlock.

360
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,230
What nonsense!

361
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,580
Do you know who my parents are?

362
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:36,330
Who are your parents?

363
00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:38,980
Why can you not find your own house? You are all grown up!

364
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,000
D-Did you just yell at me?

365
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,850
You started yelling first!

366
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,650
Both of you, stop!

367
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,740
I have no choice because it is curfew.

368
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,190
He will sleep here just for the night.

369
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,920
I am done.

370
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,990
Great work, Lady.

371
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:21,630
Come outside for a moment.

372
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:24,800
We are almost done here. Where are we going?

373
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,140
I think Lady Sam Soon is a naturally gifted storyteller.

374
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:11,630
What is your name?

375
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,050
Do you not want to tell me?

376
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,360
By chance, do you not have a name?

377
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:31,480
You are the first one to ever ask my name since I started working as a peddler.

378
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,970
Think of it as an honor.

379
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:39,940
I will ask you one more time. What is your name?

380
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,190
My name is...

381
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:50,660
Soon Deok.

382
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,450
Soon Deok...

383
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,480
It is a pretty name.

384
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,910
And your age?

385
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:01,030
I am two years older than you, Your Excellency.

386
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:04,150
Twenty-seven...

387
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,220
But how did you know my age?

388
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,360
Were you not born in the year of the black monkey?

389
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,860
You are a famous celebrity in Hanyang.

390
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,830
What, as the Resentful Man?

391
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:19,790
This is not fair.

392
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,570
I must know about you as well.

393
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:24,770
Like what?

394
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:28,740
All of it.

395
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,530
For what?

396
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:59,280
Once this matchmaking ends, we will never see each other again.

397
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:31,060
I am going on a night stroll. Do you want to go with me?

398
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,600

399
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:45,320
Is this not a place designated by the nation as a no-entry zone?

400
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,680
Since nobody is here, it is the perfect place for a night stroll.

401
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,710

402
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,720

403
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:06,260
Do you think the king knows that this place is designated as a no-entry zone?

404
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,080
What do you mean by that?

405
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,660
If this place is blocked off, people have to go a long way around it.

406
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:18,320
If he did so knowing that, he did not think about public sentiment.

407
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,350
And if he does not know about this, he is incompetent.

408
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:33,500
I like watching the night view from here at this hour.

409
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:39,890
The palace looks quite peaceful from here.

410
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,610

411
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,570
So?

412
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:58,170
Madam Seo's servant came by.

413
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:02,460
But they have not found the crown prince yet.

414
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:07,000
This will not do.

415
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,390
I must tell His Majesty.

416
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,840
Did you say the crown prince got kidnapped from his private residence?

417
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,850
It is my fault.

418
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:17,630
If something happens to the crown prince...

419
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:21,380
Have the Chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau come in!

420
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,530
 Yes, Your Majesty.

421
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,360

422
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:57,020
Now is the time to send the private mercenaries.

423
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:00,290
Now? When the Royal Investigation Bureau soldiers are everywhere in the city?

424
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,760
The one who secretly sent the crown prince to his private residence was the queen.

425
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:08,610
So even if something happens to the crown prince, the queen would be responsible.

426
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,220
That house at the end over there is your house?

427
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:00,050
He is over there! Catch him!

428
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:01,910
Hurry!

429
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,200
If something were to happen to the crown prince...

430
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:20,800
Two ladies have come to see you.

431
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,880
Mother!

432
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,130
Goodness!

433
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:32,360
What is this? Child, what happened?

434
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:34,400
How is it that...

435
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,560
I had him sleep at my house because it was a curfew,

436
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,100
but he did not get much sleep because of unfamiliarity. He is probably tired.

437
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,680
Thank you for saving my child.

438
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,420
Which family are you from?

439
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,310
I am Ha Na, of the Maeng family from Namsan Village.

440
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:05,670
You are the eldest of the old maidens?

441
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:09,050
You are the brave woman who went up against the Defense Minister and struck Sinmungo.

442
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:11,710
I wanted to meet you.

443
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:17,360
But how did you think to dress my son in a dress?

444
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,630
Before I answer you, let me ask you a question first.

445
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:24,840
He seems like the son of a high-ranking family,

446
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:28,930
so what is the reason that people are after him?

447
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:36,380
I am worried that I may be helping an insurrectionist.

448
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,940
You do not need to worry about that.

449
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,760
He is the firstborn son, born to us at an old age.

450
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,940
A mistress and his grown-up half-brother plotted together to harm him...

451
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:50,220
to obtain the family fortune.

452
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,680
I dressed him in disguise in case the assassin who chased your son yesterday

453
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,510
might still be around.

454
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:02,480
The crown prince may have returned safely,

455
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,570
but how could you tell me not to investigate this when there was a kidnapping attempt?

456
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:10,810
Are you in your right mind, Chief Royal Secretary?

457
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,850
If the king tries to discuss the crown prince's kidnapping publicly,

458
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:16,600
that would be an opportunity for us.

459
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:20,340
We can use that as an excuse to depose the queen.

460
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:23,140
If you publicly discuss this, the Left State Minister

461
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,450
will hold the queen responsible for sending the

462
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,350
crown prince to his private residence without permission,

463
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:31,360
and talk of deposing the queen.

464
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,740
If the queen is deposed,

465
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:37,570
there will no longer be anyone to protect the young crown prince in the palace.

466
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,500
Thus, it will not be a disadvantageous situation for us.

467
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,000
How could I, the king of a nation, not even search for the ones who kidnapped my son?

468
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,150
And the whereabouts of the missing bodyguard of the crown prince?

469
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:52,990
We are doing our best to find out.

470
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,320
We have to find someone who can act as corroborative evidence.

471
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,570
I heard the palace maid in the Eastern Palace is also getting worse, like the dead princess...

472
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:06,830
That palace maid seems to be a key piece to solving this case,

473
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:11,530
so I will look into a way to cure the palace maid.

474
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,530
Welcome.

475
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:18,460
Yes, please head inside.

476
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,840
- Yes. Yes. 
 - I am so happy.

477
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,650
Welcome.

478
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:32,080
Welcome. Please head inside.

479
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:38,980
Your Excellency.

480
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:42,400
We will have the blinds down, but you may get nervous when you see many madams,

481
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,260
so do not look forward and just read from the book.

482
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:47,820
It looks like you are more nervous than I am.

483
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:50,770
I am ready so we can get started.

484
00:45:50,770 --> 00:45:52,210
Okay.

485
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,610
Just a moment.

486
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,330
Your gat is a bit tilted.

487
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:20,110
It is fixed now.

488
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,980
Madams who came here for the first reveal of The Madam's Private Life, Vol. 3,

489
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,650
thank you for coming.

490
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:47,760
And thank you for providing this space for us, Honorable Lady Sook.

491
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,480
 Thank you, Honorable Lady Sook.

492
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,130
Today, Hwa Rok, who has been maintaining mysticism

493
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,740
came here to read the book for us personally.

494
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,790
 Really? Hwa Rok really came here?

495
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,350
This will be conducted with the blinds down to protect his identity.

496
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:07,170
Please take care not to move from your seats.

497
00:47:07,170 --> 00:47:09,460
 Oh, of course.

498
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,490
Then, we will get started.

499
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,750
 Oh my goodness!

500
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:27,520
 Oh my!

501
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,160
The Madam's Private Life, Vol. 3, which tells the story of Lady Cho Hui,

502
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,200
is not fictional but is based on a true story.

503
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:42,830
He is the Hwa Rok that I imagined.

504
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:47,670
That day was a dark night with no moonlight.

505
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:18,150
After more than five maidens fell ill with a mysterious illness right before their weddings,

506
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,300
the villagers performed exorcisms and offered devotions.

507
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,520
However, the bad events did not stop,

508
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:31,640
and in the end, families began to delay their weddings one by one.

509
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:33,280
 You look so pretty.

510
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,390
 You have to visit often, even when you get married. Okay?

511
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:40,660
 Of course.

512
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:43,540
 When did you prepare all of this, my Dool Soon?

513
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,380
 I cannot believe she is getting married.

514
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,590
 I guess she is not afraid of the maiden ghost.

515
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:51,500
But Heo Na of Namsan Village did not delay her wedding and decided to go through with it.

516
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:53,300
And a bad rumor began to spread among the villagers

517
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:59,600
that Heo Na could not delay her wedding because she got pregnant.

518
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:30,940
Heo Na instinctively knew that the maiden ghost was her dead friend, Cho Hui,

519
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,800
and did not delay her wedding. Instead, she asked my madam for help

520
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:39,940
and had been waiting for the ghost with her.

521
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:42,360

522
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:02,530

523
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:06,380
A rumor has spread that the murderer in this novel is Orabeoni?

524
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,370
It appears the rumors started because the younger sister of the politician

525
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:11,450
in the novel was the Royal Consort Sukbin.

526
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:14,620
Why is a false rumor going around at such a chaotic time as this?

527
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:16,490
I personally heard it.

528
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,150
The Defense Minister tried to make Maeng Ha Na his mistress

529
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:22,690
by spreading rumors that she was possessed by a maiden ghost and coming onto men.

530
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:24,090
That is crazy.

531
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:28,580
Supposedly, the reason Hwa Rok dresses in green was in remembrance of Lady Cho Ok.

532
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:32,250
Is it true that Hwa Rok will stop writing after this novel?

533
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,750
He is the son of a royal kin family, and

534
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,610
he cannot write anymore since he was appointed to a government position.

535
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:40,910
You have to wait about eight days because you are 28th on the waitlist.

536
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,690

537
00:50:42,690 --> 00:50:45,520
It will be even more fun if you reread the first two volumes.

538
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,130
So, to summarize everything,

539
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:52,610
Lady Cho Ok was waiting for her fiancé to finish his three-year mourning for his father,

540
00:50:52,610 --> 00:50:56,080
but the Defense Minister tried to do something with her and killed her?

541
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,040

Do you remember the content of the first two volumes?

542
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,330

543
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,330
I recommend that you reread them.

544
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:18,640
I want to read The Madam's Private Life, Vol. 3.

545
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,260
There are many people who are waiting in line, so you will have to wait.

546
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,040
How much will it take

547
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,800
to purchase every copy of that book released in this city?

548
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,900
The bad rumors about my eldest sister have almost disappeared completely.

549
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:35,720
Everyone is busy criticizing the Defense Minister.

550
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,230
Thanks, Yeojudaek.

551
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:41,130
Thank you, everyone.

552
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,210
We succeeded in replacing one rumor with another rumor,

553
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,880
but it would seem difficult to punish the Defense Minister, as you have said.

554
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,700
It is okay.

555
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,540
Everyone now knows that the Defense Minister is the murderer.

556
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:58,150
A man who has sinned should be punished.

557
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:00,660
I will submit a complaint based on the Officer's investigation—

558
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,460
You cannot do that!

559
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,240
If you do,

560
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,250
would not Officer face trouble?

561
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:19,690
Everyone, do not worry.

562
00:52:19,690 --> 00:52:23,220
I know of a way to punish the Defense Minister.

563
00:52:35,050 --> 00:52:37,510

564
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:42,270
I thought you should know what rumors are on the streets.

565
00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,330
Most rumors are false.

566
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,970
You need not believe all the rumors.

567
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,850
I know that.

568
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,550
However, I saw it myself.

569
00:52:52,550 --> 00:52:58,690
I saw Uncle dragging the dead Lady Cho Ok to his room during Maternal Uncle's birthday.

570
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,940
There is a difference between ignoring a rumor

571
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:06,240
and pretending not to know something you know, Mother!

572
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:21,850
Madam, Defense Minister is here.

573
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,620
 My wise Mother should be able to punish Uncle.

574
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:42,890
Sister, why did you call me here at this time of night?

575
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:49,630
What have you been doing that rumors like these are spreading?

576
00:53:49,630 --> 00:53:52,160
I told you to watch yourself after the Sinmungo incident.

577
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,560
Especially at such a critical point as this!

578
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,030
Gosh, what is it that you are being like this?

579
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:59,710
The Madam's...

580
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,130

581
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:10,590
How did they know...

582
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:17,510
Resign immediately from the Ministry of Defense.

583
00:54:17,510 --> 00:54:20,030
Sister, how could you say that?

584
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:23,090
Wait, I... well... I will take care of this situation myself!

585
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:25,440
Sister... Sister!

586
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,980
Writing erotica novels is an embarrassing thing for scholars,

587
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,760
so they do not use their actual names, and I do not ask them for it.

588
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:47,160
I really do not know who Hwa Rok is!

589
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,530
You think your crime will disappear if you say you do not know it?

590
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,750
What do you mean by crime? This is so unfair!

591
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:59,190
All we did was rent the novels as per the request of the officer from Hanseongbu,

592
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:02,360
who was determined to catch Hwa Rok!

593
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,660
The officer from Hanseongbu?

594
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:05,540
Yes!

595
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,550
Then wouldn't Officer be in danger?

596
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:11,510
That will never happen.

597
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:15,560
Because I have the perfect follow-up plan.

598
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:19,990
Officer, you should report your findings before the Defense Minister finds you.

599
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,620

600
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:38,380
Oh, what brings you here at this hour, Defense Minister?

601
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:42,850
Are you the officer who has been secretly meeting with Hwa Rok?

602
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:48,020
I will meet Hwa Rok at a storage hut for funeral trappings near Mist Cliff and arrest him.

603
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:50,640
Why are you arresting him tomorrow instead of today?

604
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,250
Hwa Rok is very cautious of others,

605
00:55:53,250 --> 00:55:58,390
so he may grow suspicious and not show up at all if I suddenly change the date.

606
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:02,970
Well, this is a case that His Majesty personally ordered for his arrest,

607
00:56:02,970 --> 00:56:07,470
so we at Hanseongbu are doing our best for this, so do not worry.

608
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,610
Even His Majesty knows about this?

609
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,070
 Hwa Rok?

610
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,710
 Yes, I am Hwa Rok.

611
00:56:36,710 --> 00:56:39,900
 I am arresting you under charges of causing Lee Cho Ok's death by breaking the law.

612
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,900
 Damn it!

613
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,330
 Wait! Stop right there.

614
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:53,980
It is too dangerous for Lady Sam Soon to do this.

615
00:56:54,830 --> 00:57:01,750
If it were with Officer, I could do anything.

616
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:06,170
I cannot stand it here because their gazes for each other are so passionate.

617
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,890
It is so blatant.

618
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:11,150
It is dangerous because this case is a high priority for the royal court

619
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:13,830
and I will not be moving alone.

620
00:57:16,540 --> 00:57:18,160
 Hwa Rok?

621
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:21,730
Do not worry.

622
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:26,870
I will be playing the role of Hwa Rok that day.

623
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:38,460
 Hwa Rok?

624
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,600
I, who can run faster than anyone, will run away

625
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,380
through the back door and escape to Mist Cliff.

626
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,160
 When I arrive at Mist Cliff,

627
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:28,290
 Officer will shout out that there is nowhere else to run and that I should surrender.

628
00:58:28,290 --> 00:58:31,300
 With that signal, I will jump into the river below.

629
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:32,220

630
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:38,180
There is nowhere else for you to run!

631
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,530
Surrender.

632
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:47,460
 Wait! You cannot do that!

633
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,170
What is the problem now?

634
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:57,700
I mean, well...

635
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,830
w-will that not be...

636
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:02,510
a-a bit dangerous for Yeojudaek as well?

637
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:06,430
This is pretty much a grand operation of love, excluding myself.

638
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:08,410
Officer, you should do—

639
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,250
Do not worry.

640
00:59:10,250 --> 00:59:13,150
I am as good at swimming as running.

641
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:18,150
Is there anyone else here who can swim apart from Officer?

642
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,010
How did you know that I know how to swim?

643
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,950
That is because I know Orabeo—

644
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:31,160
Because I have such a good eye that I can tell from your broad shoulders.

645
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:35,920
I mean, our shoulders do not seem that diff— I guess, they are different.

646
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:40,800
Since you have to chase Hwa Rok, Officer, I need to be jumping off.

647
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:45,450
Also, if you throw the body you have prepared into the river at that moment,

648
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:48,570
then the operation will be complete.

649
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:51,190
Is the body ready?

650
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:53,930
Yes, I received the body of a drifter who died

651
00:59:53,930 --> 00:59:56,790
in a foreign land from the funeral monk Yeojudaek told me about.

652
00:59:56,790 --> 01:00:00,920
I am planning on dressing it in green clothes and moving it to the river tomorrow.

653
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,640
Everyone, do not get nervous,

654
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,470
and let us all do well in our respective places.

655
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:46,810
There is nowhere else to run!

656
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,610
Surrender!

657
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:20,400
I will kill you for good this time.

658
01:02:26,290 --> 01:02:28,790
 When I think about it now,

659
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,100
 I think I already made up my mind then...

660
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:37,100
 that I should...

661
01:02:37,100 --> 01:02:39,410
 marry Yeojudaek.

662
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:50,680

663
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:03,220
♫  After a long day  ♫

664
01:03:04,260 --> 01:03:10,080
♫  The night sky after the sunset  ♫

665
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,970
  Your Excellency Gyeongwoonjae, do you like Yeojudaek?

666
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:15,340
  - I do not! 
 - Have you gone mad?

667
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:19,180
  I am glad I got hurt... instead of you.

668
01:03:19,180 --> 01:03:20,630
  Is your injured arm okay?

669
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,500
  I-It is nothing to me.

670
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,960
  The princess' symptom eight years ago...

671
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:31,360
  I need conclusive corroborative evidence instead of a hunch.

672
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:32,900
  Mother found out?

673
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,490
  You know so much about romance,

674
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,470
  so why are you living as a widow?

675
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:39,280
  It was a wanted notice.

676
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,420
  Yeojudaek is supposedly the murderer.

677
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:45,820
♫  Because it bloomed and remained there  ♫

678
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:50,140
♫  I am afraid I will end up loving you  ♫

679
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:59,020

680
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:02,020
