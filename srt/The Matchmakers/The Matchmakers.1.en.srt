(The Matchmakers)

6
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:57,701
One in 10,000 humans are born...

7
00:00:57,702 --> 00:01:00,162
with the ability to identify one's soulmate,

8
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:03,001
and people with that special ability...

9
00:01:03,702 --> 00:01:05,272
existed in every era.

10
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,081
In ancient times, they were chief priests.

11
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:16,081
In Silla times, they were called Agent of Love...

12
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:20,622
and enjoyed great power and riches.

13
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:34,102
The Heritage of the Three States appendix on agents says...

14
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:39,102
most influential Agents of Love until the Goryeo era were women,

15
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,611
and as Joseon was a nation built on Confucianism,

16
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:43,641
they slowly disappeared.

17
00:01:44,982 --> 00:01:46,880
There is no record to show...

18
00:01:46,881 --> 00:01:48,511
how they recognized one's soulmate.

19
00:01:48,512 --> 00:01:49,751
(Soulmate)

20
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:31,991
Agents of Love with a heightened level of skill...

21
00:02:32,591 --> 00:02:35,491
are said to bring couples together without knowing themselves.

22
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:43,101
Silla people called Agents of Love...

23
00:02:43,102 --> 00:02:44,841
"lonely souls."

24
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:47,912
That is because...

25
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,741
he who marries an agent is fated to die young.

26
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:56,912
That is why many agents are widows.

27
00:03:04,422 --> 00:03:06,620
Couples I bring together...

28
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,391
live happily and are quite fertile,

29
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,930
so most of my clients are parents with daughters.

30
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,502
(Jung Soon Duk, Left Councillor’s second daughter-in-law and peddler)

31
00:03:12,961 --> 00:03:14,202
I can tell...

32
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:16,771
if they are a match or not.

33
00:03:17,602 --> 00:03:20,801
You could say I was born with the ability to tell their fate.

34
00:03:24,241 --> 00:03:28,711
(Episode 1: I Have Not Fallen for You)

35
00:03:46,532 --> 00:03:49,370
The first-place winner of this year's state exam,

36
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,771
is Sim Jung Woo.

37
00:03:56,472 --> 00:03:57,472
Goodness.

38
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:03,151
The youngest to place first since Joseon was established...

39
00:04:03,711 --> 00:04:06,222
happens to be handsome as well.

40
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:08,291
Yes.

41
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,422
He scored much higher than the man who came second,

42
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,991
and all ministers who graded the papers were astounded.

43
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:14,931
Is that so?

44
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,701
Sim Jung Woo came first, and he will...

45
00:04:21,102 --> 00:04:22,370
take the currently vacant...

46
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,431
Deputy Administrator of Pyeongyang position.

47
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:27,342
Apply your youthful and new ideas...

48
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,542
and assist your superior well.

49
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:32,441
Your Majesty.

50
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:35,911
This is too unconventional an appointment that I think...

51
00:04:35,912 --> 00:04:37,181
I will uphold your command,

52
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:40,021
and with my clever mind and quick thinking,

53
00:04:40,022 --> 00:04:41,620
I will clear...

54
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:44,661
the corruption in Pyeongyang and restore order,

55
00:04:44,662 --> 00:04:45,792
Your Majesty.

56
00:04:49,462 --> 00:04:50,462
You do that.

57
00:04:50,463 --> 00:04:52,761
Kids these days are unlike us.

58
00:04:52,931 --> 00:04:54,431
They care not for humility.

59
00:04:54,801 --> 00:04:55,801
Oh, dear...

60
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,561
It is said...

61
00:05:26,402 --> 00:05:28,631
the greatest of the three misfortunes...

62
00:05:29,032 --> 00:05:30,931
is for a young man to gain a lofty title.

63
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:33,371
Watch your language...

64
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:35,511
and stay out of trouble.

65
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:38,380
Rather than place far behind the winner...

66
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,042
in 3rd place well into one's 40s,

67
00:05:40,842 --> 00:05:42,151
living an unfortunate life...

68
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:44,681
as a successful young man does not seem too bad.

69
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:48,592
Do I not know what I am saying because I am too young?

70
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:16,982
Your Highness, you cannot be out here.

71
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:18,722
Princess.

72
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:20,922
Your Highness.

73
00:06:21,922 --> 00:06:24,092
Why should I marry the princess?

74
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:27,792
His Majesty sent me to Pyeongyang, and I leave tomorrow.

75
00:06:28,361 --> 00:06:30,631
The King's son-in-law cannot take a government post.

76
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:31,931
That position...

77
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,631
was reassigned to Min Hyun.

78
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,800
His Majesty gifted you...

79
00:06:37,801 --> 00:06:39,941
a great house in Bukchon as a wedding present...

80
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:42,811
and will bestow your older brother with a title as well.

81
00:06:42,972 --> 00:06:45,610
It is a great opportunity for you and your family.

82
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:48,451
If you were to become a member of the royal family,

83
00:06:48,611 --> 00:06:51,051
it would be a great benefit to our faction.

84
00:06:51,951 --> 00:06:53,120
It would.

85
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,121
This is all thanks to your effort, my lord.

86
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,522
If it is that great an opportunity,

87
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:01,260
your second son In Guk who is still single...

88
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:03,232
could marry the princess.

89
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:07,061
The princess wishes to marry you.

90
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:11,032
The Classic of Rites states...

91
00:07:11,402 --> 00:07:14,401
a marriage is bringing together the good of both genders...

92
00:07:14,402 --> 00:07:16,070
to honour and serve the family...

93
00:07:16,071 --> 00:07:19,010
and bear descendants to carry on the name.

94
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:21,681
This means a marriage involves two families.

95
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,151
How could the princess name a spouse...

96
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,652
based just on her preference?

97
00:07:25,922 --> 00:07:27,451
That goes against our rites.

98
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:28,652
That is enough.

99
00:07:29,251 --> 00:07:32,662
It is my wish that you marry the princess.

100
00:07:33,022 --> 00:07:34,860
So comply and do not complain.

101
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:35,931
Father.

102
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:38,701
You know my dream is to become Premier.

103
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,871
I will not marry the princess if that stops me from taking office!

104
00:07:49,972 --> 00:07:53,482
Are you pleased you sold your son for a large house in Bukchon?

105
00:07:54,511 --> 00:07:56,380
How dare you speak to Father like that?

106
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:58,651
You are dull-witted and greedy,

107
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:00,722
and very likely to become a corrupt official.

108
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:02,621
What did you say?

109
00:08:02,922 --> 00:08:04,292
Heed my advice...

110
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:06,722
if you wish to keep the position...

111
00:08:06,962 --> 00:08:09,061
you got from selling your brother.

112
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:18,542
Take two bows.

113
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:22,311
Bride, two bows to the right.

114
00:08:43,632 --> 00:08:47,132
Groom, one bow in response.

115
00:09:02,112 --> 00:09:03,611
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

116
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:06,122
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

117
00:09:06,522 --> 00:09:08,951
Your Highness.

118
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:35,981
She has...

119
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,752
passed.

120
00:09:58,301 --> 00:10:00,800
The princess died before we even put up...

121
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:02,111
the sign the King sent.

122
00:10:02,112 --> 00:10:03,711
What should we do now?

123
00:10:04,012 --> 00:10:05,581
She died during the wedding.

124
00:10:05,882 --> 00:10:08,111
Did he not get to consummate the marriage, then?

125
00:10:08,112 --> 00:10:09,381
Of course not.

126
00:10:09,382 --> 00:10:11,782
He's a widowed son-in-law of the King.

127
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:15,022
Kings' sons-in-law cannot remarry or have a concubine.

128
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:18,190
What good is a house this big?

129
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:19,191
Oh, dear.

130
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:46,252
(8 years later)

131
00:10:57,561 --> 00:10:59,662
It is so pretty even on the outside.

132
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,902
How pretty must it be inside?

133
00:11:47,382 --> 00:11:48,711
What do you think?

134
00:12:03,262 --> 00:12:04,291
Hey.

135
00:12:04,292 --> 00:12:06,031
- It suits you. - Goodness.

136
00:12:06,032 --> 00:12:07,830
- You are here. - You made it.

137
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:09,032
- Hello. - Hi.

138
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:11,742
I am almost sure...

139
00:12:12,172 --> 00:12:14,441
a Marriage Ban will be issued next month.

140
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:16,142
It is all about speed.

141
00:12:16,772 --> 00:12:17,911
Remember that.

142
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:20,411
If you have any information,

143
00:12:20,412 --> 00:12:21,850
we should share it.

144
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:24,651
Do not keep it to yourself and mess things up like before.

145
00:12:24,652 --> 00:12:26,081
Okay, fine!

146
00:12:26,351 --> 00:12:27,851
Will you stop saying that?

147
00:12:28,721 --> 00:12:32,061
I thought Marriage Bans are lifted after a month or so.

148
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:34,422
- Why are you... - Making a fuss?

149
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:37,391
While the Marriage Ban is issued, most families with a daughter...

150
00:12:37,392 --> 00:12:39,100
must submit the Virgin Note.

151
00:12:39,101 --> 00:12:40,502
I know that much.

152
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:43,001
But Marriage Bans are not enforced too long,

153
00:12:43,002 --> 00:12:45,042
and it is a good thing to marry the crown prince.

154
00:12:46,341 --> 00:12:49,071
Are you from a distant countryside?

155
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,142
People say "NK Jin."

156
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:53,142
"NK Jin?"

157
00:12:55,252 --> 00:12:57,152
The next king...

158
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:00,652
will be Prince Jinsung, the nephew of the left state councillor’s wife.

159
00:13:00,882 --> 00:13:02,090
I see.

160
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:06,022
Whoever were to marry the young, sickly crown prince...

161
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:08,991
is bound to end up a poor widow.

162
00:13:08,992 --> 00:13:11,531
Who would want their daughter to suffer that fate?

163
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:13,960
So people with daughters of marriageable age...

164
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,600
go crazy for matchmakers to get them engaged...

165
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:18,132
before the Marriage Ban is issued.

166
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:22,112
All we have to do is reap the benefits while the tide is in.

167
00:13:25,382 --> 00:13:27,142
There will be no Marriage Ban this year.

168
00:13:27,612 --> 00:13:29,011
What are you saying?

169
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:30,981
A court maid I know was adamant.

170
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:33,820
My sources say...

171
00:13:33,821 --> 00:13:36,091
there will be no Marriage Ban this year.

172
00:13:36,252 --> 00:13:38,151
Do not humiliate yourselves using that...

173
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:39,821
as an excuse to arrange marriages.

174
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:45,601
How cool is she?

175
00:13:45,862 --> 00:13:47,101
Who was that?

176
00:13:47,362 --> 00:13:48,701
She is not cool at all.

177
00:13:49,532 --> 00:13:52,071
If Lady Yeoju said there will be no Marriage Ban,

178
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:54,242
- I doubt there will be one. - Right?

179
00:13:54,742 --> 00:13:56,512
Lady Yeoju is never wrong.

180
00:13:57,042 --> 00:13:58,142
"Lady Yeoju?"

181
00:13:58,941 --> 00:14:01,711
The master of matchmaking that does business only with...

182
00:14:01,981 --> 00:14:03,412
the rich and famous?

183
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,711
She is no master.

184
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:08,951
Where are you going?

185
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:10,551
She said no Ban.

186
00:14:10,792 --> 00:14:12,992
I am off to sell my wares. Get out of the way.

187
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,831
Do we all have to listen to Lady Yeoju...

188
00:14:17,132 --> 00:14:18,801
Wait for me!

189
00:14:26,571 --> 00:14:28,711
Postpone the crown prince's wedding...

190
00:14:29,112 --> 00:14:31,211
because of a rumour of a female ghost?

191
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:33,042
Your Majesty.

192
00:14:33,341 --> 00:14:36,210
The number of spinsters and bachelors in the Capital...

193
00:14:36,211 --> 00:14:37,711
are at an all-time high.

194
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:40,581
What?

195
00:14:40,681 --> 00:14:42,951
The rumour of the female ghost surfaced...

196
00:14:43,152 --> 00:14:45,591
after a depressed spinster took her life.

197
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:49,632
We are concerned her grudge will harm the future of our nation.

198
00:14:50,461 --> 00:14:52,031
The untimely drought also...

199
00:14:52,032 --> 00:14:54,930
What about the drought? Are you saying the darned woman...

200
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,132
caused the drought also?

201
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:57,801
Well...

202
00:14:58,772 --> 00:14:59,801
Well...

203
00:15:02,242 --> 00:15:06,611
The heavens' intentions are beyond our understanding, so...

204
00:15:06,612 --> 00:15:08,550
What is your point, Minister of Defence?

205
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:09,581
Pardon?

206
00:15:10,782 --> 00:15:12,782
Right. My point...

207
00:15:15,152 --> 00:15:17,850
So, the nation...

208
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,422
I mean...

209
00:15:19,821 --> 00:15:22,830
A couple and the nation's energy...

210
00:15:22,831 --> 00:15:24,492
- What are you saying? - Your Majesty.

211
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,201
The previous kings urged people to marry young...

212
00:15:27,502 --> 00:15:29,930
because people who were allowed to stay single for too long...

213
00:15:29,931 --> 00:15:31,671
caused disharmony of yin and yang...

214
00:15:31,672 --> 00:15:33,772
and brought on us natural disasters.

215
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:35,912
We cannot say for sure...

216
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:38,211
the drought was not caused by the lack of marriages.

217
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:41,181
You might be right, Lord Jo.

218
00:15:41,412 --> 00:15:44,211
But spinsters and bachelors have always posed a problem.

219
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,251
Right now, we are discussing the crown prince's marriage.

220
00:15:47,252 --> 00:15:49,091
Which is why I offer you such counsel.

221
00:15:49,492 --> 00:15:53,122
With rumours spreading of a woman who died because she could not wed,

222
00:15:53,362 --> 00:15:55,161
if we were to issue a Marriage Ban to find...

223
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,591
a bride for the young crown prince,

224
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:59,731
women within the Capital cannot marry even if they wish to.

225
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,700
It is just a short...

226
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:02,902
The Marriage Ban...

227
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:04,872
might be temporary.

228
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,142
Yes.

229
00:16:06,872 --> 00:16:08,941
But it has a significant meaning.

230
00:16:10,311 --> 00:16:12,810
We need as many people as possible to marry,

231
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:14,782
not issue a ban on marriages.

232
00:16:14,941 --> 00:16:17,412
A Marriage Ban would be against all reason.

233
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,950
Please accept our counsel.

234
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:22,892
- Please accept our counsel. - Please accept our counsel.

235
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:38,601
Last year, they postponed marriage because my son was unwell.

236
00:16:39,642 --> 00:16:42,672
This year, they complain about the age-old spinster issue.

237
00:16:44,841 --> 00:16:46,112
The unworthy fools.

238
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:50,551
Lord Jo is stalling in Prince Jinsung's favour,

239
00:16:50,681 --> 00:16:54,021
but I believe we cannot marry off the crown prince this year.

240
00:16:54,022 --> 00:16:55,051
No!

241
00:16:55,792 --> 00:16:59,460
I will marry him off before June, as planned,

242
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:01,220
and send envoys to Ming in August...

243
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:03,730
to bring back the Letter of Investiture.

244
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:04,830
- But... - Do you think...

245
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:07,731
they will let the crown prince marry next year?

246
00:17:08,132 --> 00:17:09,531
I cannot put it off any longer.

247
00:17:10,102 --> 00:17:13,541
Bring me an excuse to marry off the crown prince before June.

248
00:17:14,672 --> 00:17:15,672
At all costs.

249
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:20,741
He will be hard-pressed to find an excuse.

250
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,710
Even his late father...

251
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:25,321
could not solve the spinster and bachelor problem.

252
00:17:25,322 --> 00:17:26,821
(Park Bok Ki, Minister of Defence)

253
00:17:26,822 --> 00:17:28,422
(Kim Moon Gun, Chief Magistrate, Capital District Office)

254
00:17:29,092 --> 00:17:31,220
It is not over yet.

255
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,821
There is no way the crown prince can marry now.

256
00:17:33,822 --> 00:17:35,760
We cannot use the same spinster excuse...

257
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:37,961
to postpone his marriage next year.

258
00:17:39,231 --> 00:17:41,000
If the crown prince...

259
00:17:41,001 --> 00:17:42,902
were to marry and have a son,

260
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:45,802
it will be even harder to enthrone Prince Jinsung.

261
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:49,642
We must eliminate the root of our troubles this year.

262
00:17:50,642 --> 00:17:52,112
You mean kill the crown prince?

263
00:17:52,912 --> 00:17:54,842
Hush, Lord Park.

264
00:17:55,511 --> 00:17:57,412
Watch what you say.

265
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,092
I am King,

266
00:18:03,852 --> 00:18:06,461
and yet I cannot marry off my own son.

267
00:18:07,491 --> 00:18:09,791
I am too ashamed to face you.

268
00:18:13,731 --> 00:18:16,572
I did not ask to see you for an apology.

269
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:19,402
I believe...

270
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:23,241
I have found the person who can get...

271
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:25,541
the crown prince married.

272
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,011
What?

273
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,652
Who is it?

274
00:18:30,312 --> 00:18:32,751
"Man of Anger."

275
00:18:33,382 --> 00:18:34,552
"Man of Anger?"

276
00:18:34,951 --> 00:18:37,791
Court Lady Choi told me about him recently.

277
00:19:38,582 --> 00:19:41,122
Do you even know who that man was?

278
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:43,622
You should not stand and stare at him.

279
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:45,922
I could not help it. He was so handsome.

280
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:48,662
Who is he?

281
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:17,892
He is Lord Gyeongunjae, the man with the most anger...

282
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,092
in all of Joseon.

283
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,831
The man who spent eight years in celibacy...

284
00:20:23,832 --> 00:20:25,832
since his bride died during the wedding?

285
00:20:26,132 --> 00:20:29,332
The man who lives like a monk apart from the fact he eats meat?

286
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:41,812
Letter of Appeals.

287
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,822
What is marriage?

288
00:20:47,882 --> 00:20:49,491
Based on the Chinese characters,

289
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:52,961
it means the groom spends the evening at the bride's,

290
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:54,592
and also...

291
00:20:54,991 --> 00:20:57,761
that the bride follows her groom to live with her in-laws.

292
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:01,302
Eight years ago, in the Year of the Rat,

293
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,971
I, Sim Jung Woo, came to the palace to marry the princess.

294
00:21:04,672 --> 00:21:08,201
But the princess did not follow me to her in-laws.

295
00:21:10,372 --> 00:21:11,771
Considering the situation,

296
00:21:12,281 --> 00:21:14,312
for me to be the King's son-in-law...

297
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:17,152
and enjoy luxuries paid for with taxes...

298
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:19,681
is not right, and I do not merit the treatment.

299
00:21:20,251 --> 00:21:21,852
To correct the wrong,

300
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:26,721
I submit an appeal to annul my marriage with the princess.

301
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:31,261
You have been doing this without fail for eight years.

302
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:42,071
However long it takes,

303
00:21:42,072 --> 00:21:45,741
it is a scholar's duty to correct what is wrong.

304
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:47,582
You are right.

305
00:21:48,112 --> 00:21:50,211
I was out of line.

306
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:52,781
Bring me a brush and paper.

307
00:21:54,622 --> 00:21:56,321
What for?

308
00:21:56,322 --> 00:21:57,921
Forget the appeal I brought.

309
00:21:57,922 --> 00:22:00,892
My report on your neglect of duty is a more pressing matter.

310
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,290
I must write about it now.

311
00:22:02,291 --> 00:22:05,290
A slip of the tongue is not neglect of duty.

312
00:22:05,291 --> 00:22:06,302
Enough!

313
00:22:06,602 --> 00:22:08,561
Do you think I am picking on you...

314
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:11,431
because of what you said, like some close-minded fool?

315
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:13,571
No, but...

316
00:22:13,572 --> 00:22:15,771
That is worth considering.

317
00:22:16,372 --> 00:22:19,082
Look at your appearance. Your official cap is crooked,

318
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:22,411
you dare use a jade ornament allowed to Junior Third Rank and above.

319
00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:25,511
Your belt must hang three inches below your navel,

320
00:22:25,622 --> 00:22:27,720
but yours almost reaches your knees.

321
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,750
Your robe must always be clean,

322
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:31,852
but there is dried ink on your sleeve.

323
00:22:33,122 --> 00:22:35,662
How can I ignore such a disaster?

324
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,491
Bring me a brush...

325
00:22:38,731 --> 00:22:39,761
and paper.

326
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:43,431
He knows every rule and regulation,

327
00:22:43,771 --> 00:22:45,200
and if he is in a foul mood,

328
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:47,141
just because you looked at him,

329
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:49,612
he can have you banished from the Palace.

330
00:22:50,511 --> 00:22:53,842
He is a walking lump of pent-up frustration.

331
00:22:54,382 --> 00:22:55,412
So it is best...

332
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:59,322
to stay out of Lord Gyeongunjae's sight.

333
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:04,322
That is what I warned a little girl...

334
00:23:04,721 --> 00:23:06,691
who recently joined the Palace staff.

335
00:23:07,961 --> 00:23:08,961
Frustration?

336
00:23:12,162 --> 00:23:13,201
My goodness.

337
00:23:13,961 --> 00:23:17,871
That description suits the man who married into our family.

338
00:23:17,872 --> 00:23:19,771
(A royal in-law)

339
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:23,541
There is nothing he does not know.

340
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:25,941
Could he not come up with a pretext...

341
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:28,741
to marry the crown prince?

342
00:23:31,251 --> 00:23:32,281
Yes.

343
00:23:35,322 --> 00:23:38,690
How concerned must she be for my politically clueless wife...

344
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:41,362
to suggest I consult Lord Gyeongunjae?

345
00:23:42,431 --> 00:23:43,461
Your Majesty.

346
00:23:45,832 --> 00:23:48,562
I believe the Queen had a brilliant idea.

347
00:23:48,731 --> 00:23:50,402
Are you acting out as well now?

348
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,540
Lord Gyeongunjae is a core member...

349
00:23:53,541 --> 00:23:55,671
of Lord Jo's Dongro Faction.

350
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:56,710
He is.

351
00:23:56,711 --> 00:23:58,540
But from what I heard, the spinster excuse...

352
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:01,211
Lord Jo came up with to postpone the crown prince's marriage...

353
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,612
was Lord Gyeongunjae's idea.

354
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:04,951
What?

355
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,520
That is why his older brother Sim Myung Woo...

356
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:13,691
was on Lord Jo's list for a spring promotion.

357
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,030
That punk. Bring him...

358
00:24:16,031 --> 00:24:18,691
That is what makes him the ideal man.

359
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,662
If the well-educated Lord Gyeongunjae...

360
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,531
were to do as the Queen said,

361
00:24:23,771 --> 00:24:27,271
he should come up with a pretext for the crown prince's marriage.

362
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:29,271
Even if he were to fail,

363
00:24:29,741 --> 00:24:32,142
you can name his leader Lord Jo responsible.

364
00:24:32,382 --> 00:24:35,912
Would that not shake the Dongro Faction to their core?

365
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:44,822
Yes.

366
00:24:52,902 --> 00:24:54,862
Why is my ear so itchy?

367
00:25:03,971 --> 00:25:04,971
My goodness.

368
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,112
O Bong.

369
00:25:11,382 --> 00:25:13,221
Oh, you are late today.

370
00:25:13,422 --> 00:25:15,892
An incompetent official delayed me.

371
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:17,652
Take me to the inn.

372
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:21,261
My lady, the female peddler is here.

373
00:25:24,092 --> 00:25:25,092
Now we are in-laws...

374
00:25:25,562 --> 00:25:27,902
with the Sungkyunkwan headmaster.

375
00:25:28,302 --> 00:25:29,601
I can demoralize...

376
00:25:29,602 --> 00:25:32,872
women from lofty Goryeo families...

377
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:35,402
who have no money and only honour.

378
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:39,781
I am in a good mood.

379
00:25:39,981 --> 00:25:43,211
I will buy all the cosmetics you brought.

380
00:25:45,412 --> 00:25:46,451
Thank you.

381
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:49,122
Where is your daughter?

382
00:25:49,251 --> 00:25:52,052
I called her. She will join us soon.

383
00:25:54,862 --> 00:25:55,862
There you are.

384
00:26:04,832 --> 00:26:05,971
Oh, dear.

385
00:26:06,541 --> 00:26:09,171
To form connections so her only son can be successful,

386
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:10,470
she wants to...

387
00:26:10,471 --> 00:26:12,882
sacrifice her daughter to marry into a good family.

388
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:17,152
But the young lady meets her lover at the water mill.

389
00:26:19,422 --> 00:26:22,052
That is why she looks grumpy when she is engaged.

390
00:26:23,552 --> 00:26:27,592
If she is timid enough to wear the tacky ribbon her mother chose,

391
00:26:28,162 --> 00:26:30,991
she could not tell her mother she does not want to marry him.

392
00:26:31,562 --> 00:26:33,760
I have everything set up.

393
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,902
You just have to be the messenger.

394
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:38,102
Please do what you do best.

395
00:26:40,372 --> 00:26:42,812
I do not think I can be the messenger.

396
00:26:49,211 --> 00:26:50,211
So,

397
00:26:50,212 --> 00:26:53,081
do you have Official Song's daughter's date and time of birth?

398
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:55,281
(Date and time of one's birth was used to tell fortunes.)

399
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,862
Before I give you the note,

400
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,771
may I see your son?

401
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:13,540
I heard the rumour...

402
00:27:13,541 --> 00:27:16,041
that you match couples based on their appearance.

403
00:27:16,211 --> 00:27:19,010
But this engagement was agreed on by both families,

404
00:27:19,011 --> 00:27:20,642
and you are just for show.

405
00:27:21,011 --> 00:27:23,152
You can skip that step.

406
00:27:23,852 --> 00:27:24,882
I know...

407
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,551
you want Song's daughter...

408
00:27:27,552 --> 00:27:29,391
because her family is nouveau riche.

409
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:32,691
But I do not match couples based just on backgrounds.

410
00:27:34,221 --> 00:27:35,790
On my way in,

411
00:27:35,791 --> 00:27:38,531
I saw your husband as he was leaving and I was surprised.

412
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:43,102
I could see his nature, as frail as thin porcelain.

413
00:27:44,501 --> 00:27:48,271
I wondered how he managed to become Sungkyunkwan headmaster.

414
00:27:49,312 --> 00:27:51,471
What made him successful...

415
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:53,741
was your steely...

416
00:27:56,281 --> 00:27:59,382
It was due to your wisdom and support.

417
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:01,451
You have no idea.

418
00:28:01,951 --> 00:28:04,251
What man is so timid and frail?

419
00:28:04,491 --> 00:28:06,490
Just one scathing comment...

420
00:28:06,491 --> 00:28:08,461
shreds him like wet paper.

421
00:28:08,622 --> 00:28:11,562
Dragging him all the way until he became headmaster...

422
00:28:12,132 --> 00:28:13,201
was really...

423
00:28:14,662 --> 00:28:17,931
You must have been through...

424
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:19,602
so much, my lady.

425
00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:23,812
You saw through me just like that.

426
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:26,142
You wish to see my son?

427
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:28,342
Is anyone there?

428
00:28:45,132 --> 00:28:47,001
Stand right where you are.

429
00:28:53,741 --> 00:28:55,071
He is handsome enough,

430
00:28:55,072 --> 00:28:56,841
and he got into Sungkyunkwan at 19,

431
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:58,041
so he is smart.

432
00:28:58,342 --> 00:29:01,241
He definitely is the greatest catch in Hanyang.

433
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:06,721
Mother, why...

434
00:29:12,892 --> 00:29:13,922
This marriage...

435
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:15,662
is not to be.

436
00:29:17,261 --> 00:29:18,290
What do you mean?

437
00:29:18,291 --> 00:29:20,531
I spent a fortune on this engagement!

438
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:23,501
My lady. The headmaster's son is a typical young boy...

439
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:25,730
swaddled in his mother's skirt.

440
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:28,270
(A boy in his mother's skirt is usually a mother's boy.)

441
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:29,342
Is it serious?

442
00:29:29,572 --> 00:29:30,612
Very.

443
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:32,240
If your daughter were to marry him,

444
00:29:32,241 --> 00:29:34,082
he will drain your family's coffers,

445
00:29:34,181 --> 00:29:37,681
but he will do nothing to assist your son's success.

446
00:29:40,981 --> 00:29:42,082
That is a lie.

447
00:29:45,552 --> 00:29:46,822
What I do know for sure...

448
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:49,791
is that if a couple marry and their mothers are controlling,

449
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:51,662
they will be miserable.

450
00:29:52,902 --> 00:29:54,601
I told the whole family...

451
00:29:54,602 --> 00:29:56,302
we would become in-laws with the headmaster.

452
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:59,441
Breaking things off now is as good as an annulment.

453
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:02,471
Most crucially, if your daughter were to marry into that family,

454
00:30:03,771 --> 00:30:06,312
she will not bear any children.

455
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,981
I cannot allow that. No.

456
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:13,422
Noblewomen believe such lies?

457
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,822
How can they not when I am as good as a mind-reader?

458
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:20,761
My lady.

459
00:30:21,291 --> 00:30:24,431
Put that down as you talk or you will break it again.

460
00:30:27,302 --> 00:30:28,302
Okay.

461
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:33,571
You said it was an arranged marriage...

462
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:35,642
and your services were just for show.

463
00:30:36,511 --> 00:30:37,540
Yes.

464
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:41,082
I thought I could make an easy profit from my reputation.

465
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:42,382
But...

466
00:30:42,582 --> 00:30:45,382
Officer Song's daughter was seeing someone in secret.

467
00:30:46,181 --> 00:30:47,921
Once I noticed that,

468
00:30:47,922 --> 00:30:50,721
how could I set her up with a man...

469
00:30:51,122 --> 00:30:52,422
she does not love who is not...

470
00:30:53,021 --> 00:30:54,592
a good match for her?

471
00:30:55,491 --> 00:30:57,491
Love does not put food on the table.

472
00:30:57,991 --> 00:30:59,501
Everything is arranged these days.

473
00:31:01,332 --> 00:31:02,332
Bok Hee.

474
00:31:02,333 --> 00:31:05,402
Will you marry any man from a rich family?

475
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,342
Why would I when I am not of noble blood?

476
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:10,941
Smart girl.

477
00:31:23,751 --> 00:31:24,751
Oh, dear.

478
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,961
Does your chest hurt again?

479
00:31:29,791 --> 00:31:31,132
I will be fine once they are out of sight.

480
00:31:31,731 --> 00:31:33,131
Get me away from here.

481
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,162
Yes, my lord.

482
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:35,562
Goodness.

483
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:37,731
Come along now.

484
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:47,402
Did this woman...

485
00:32:48,041 --> 00:32:49,812
just rescue me?

486
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,412
You almost bumped into the crate.

487
00:33:01,352 --> 00:33:02,382
Goodbye.

488
00:33:17,602 --> 00:33:19,132
- Well done. - Sure.

489
00:33:19,842 --> 00:33:21,041
Take care.

490
00:33:26,312 --> 00:33:27,612
Welcome.

491
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:30,352
What book do you want this time?

492
00:33:30,912 --> 00:33:32,511
I do not want a book this time.

493
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:41,491
"Golden silkworm poison."

494
00:33:41,662 --> 00:33:43,491
What is this?

495
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,290
A poison mentioned...

496
00:33:45,291 --> 00:33:47,531
in the Yuan Dynasty book on medicine you got me.

497
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:49,832
Oh, in that case...

498
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:52,771
I do not deal in poisons.

499
00:33:53,701 --> 00:33:56,842
Did you not say you can get anything from Ming?

500
00:33:57,441 --> 00:33:59,440
I do not care how much it costs.

501
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:01,711
Find out if you can procure it.

502
00:34:03,152 --> 00:34:04,681
"Golden silkworm poison."

503
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:15,862
("The Lady's Private Life")

504
00:34:22,331 --> 00:34:23,331
("The Lady's Private Life")

505
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:25,432
"The Lady's Private Life?"

506
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:30,041
("The Lady's Private Life")

507
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:33,481
"Written by Hwa Rok."

508
00:34:35,012 --> 00:34:36,041
"Spotted deer?"

509
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:37,811
Gosh.

510
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:42,121
What an immature and lowly pen name.

511
00:34:51,331 --> 00:34:53,560
"The lady who was looking at the flower in the garden..."

512
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:54,902
"let out a low sigh."

513
00:34:55,661 --> 00:34:58,001
"Hanyang was upside-down due to the revolt,"

514
00:34:58,172 --> 00:35:00,241
"and she felt sorry for herself..."

515
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:02,842
"as she had to stay indoors with an assumed identity."

516
00:35:05,411 --> 00:35:07,881
"The fragrance wafted through her clothes,"

517
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:09,781
"enveloping her, and in a strong embrace..."

518
00:35:09,782 --> 00:35:12,011
"Low moans filled the yard,"

519
00:35:12,012 --> 00:35:17,152
"then subsided at the same time."

520
00:35:20,691 --> 00:35:21,722
Oh, goodness.

521
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:43,981
Excuse me. Could I...

522
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,722
Honey?

523
00:36:17,911 --> 00:36:21,722
Faint moans echoed throughout the garden.

524
00:36:54,481 --> 00:36:55,621
Oh, gosh.

525
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,291
Why are you reading this?

526
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:02,261
What is that book?

527
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:05,591
It is a clumsily written erotic romance novel that women read.

528
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,532
I must find out who wrote this book.

529
00:37:08,932 --> 00:37:10,001
By any chance,

530
00:37:10,501 --> 00:37:13,541
did you like this erotic romance novel?

531
00:37:13,802 --> 00:37:15,541
What? Such insolence!

532
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:20,611
Based on what he is wearing,

533
00:37:20,612 --> 00:37:22,210
he must be a senior fifth-rank officer.

534
00:37:22,211 --> 00:37:23,350
He is neglecting his duty,

535
00:37:23,351 --> 00:37:25,210
visiting this woman first thing in the morning.

536
00:37:25,211 --> 00:37:26,821
Clearly, the author wrote this novel...

537
00:37:26,822 --> 00:37:28,821
to ridicule the scholar-officials.

538
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:31,390
I must report this to the local office and punish the author.

539
00:37:31,391 --> 00:37:34,591
My lord, this book is not worth the trouble.

540
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,992
I will have to finish reading the book to decide that myself.

541
00:37:38,932 --> 00:37:40,601
What does that mean?

542
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:43,770
If what I have read so far turns out to be a foolish woman's dream,

543
00:37:43,771 --> 00:37:45,301
I cannot report the author.

544
00:37:45,302 --> 00:37:46,640
Oh, please. Hand it over.

545
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:49,440
That story is a fiction.

546
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,441
Are you gullible enough to believe that it is a true story?

547
00:38:03,751 --> 00:38:04,951
Also, how could you be sure...

548
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:06,922
that it was morning based on the illustration alone?

549
00:38:08,722 --> 00:38:11,362
That book... I mean...

550
00:38:12,691 --> 00:38:15,460
The morning glories in the illustration are in full bloom,

551
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:16,972
so I am certain that it was before 9am.

552
00:38:17,202 --> 00:38:19,100
Perhaps, they are convolvulus flowers?

553
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:21,940
Such insolence. Their leaves look completely different.

554
00:38:21,941 --> 00:38:23,342
It would be hard to be mistaken!

555
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:29,481
You have a sharp eye.

556
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:33,080
Such erotic novels are often exaggerated.

557
00:38:33,081 --> 00:38:36,481
So please think that the illustrations were exaggerated too.

558
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:42,461
Every fiction is inspired by true events.

559
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:45,532
I must look into this and find out the author's true intentions.

560
00:38:48,362 --> 00:38:50,432
Darn, this fudging idiot.

561
00:38:52,032 --> 00:38:54,802
What? Come again?

562
00:38:58,242 --> 00:39:00,742
I said you were way too serious for your own good.

563
00:39:05,581 --> 00:39:07,951
So you must be a peddler. Which inn do you work for?

564
00:39:07,952 --> 00:39:09,222
Tell me your name and age.

565
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,152
You must be a high-and-mighty nobleman, seeing how you are...

566
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:16,391
looking for a source and meaning behind a completely fictional story.

567
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:21,202
Why are you...

568
00:39:22,702 --> 00:39:23,771
approaching me like this?

569
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:30,711
I am a peddler, a married one. Why are you hitting on me?

570
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:33,981
Hitting on you?

571
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,612
You got the wrong idea. Do you even know who I am?

572
00:39:37,081 --> 00:39:38,980
I do not know who you are,

573
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,951
but you asked for my name and age...

574
00:39:40,952 --> 00:39:42,751
when I did not write this book.

575
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:46,351
So naturally, I am wondering if you have fallen for me.

576
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:50,932
Fallen for you?

577
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:53,902
My gosh.

578
00:39:54,731 --> 00:39:56,132
You are getting hiccups. So it is true?

579
00:39:56,501 --> 00:39:57,702
I suppose I was not mistaken after all.

580
00:39:58,632 --> 00:39:59,632
How obscene.

581
00:40:00,342 --> 00:40:01,342
No.

582
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,911
He has never even dated. How dare he think he can beat me?

583
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,112
He is cute.

584
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,652
No, you got the wrong idea. Wait.

585
00:40:19,621 --> 00:40:21,922
The peddler who left just now. Did you see which way she went?

586
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:26,831
O Bong!

587
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:31,701
You will head home now, right?

588
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:34,571
What do you do at night these days that you keep dozing off?

589
00:40:34,572 --> 00:40:37,512
I got married recently, you know. Please understand.

590
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:40,511
What does being married have to do...

591
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:42,112
with dozing off all the time?

592
00:40:44,751 --> 00:40:46,612
Right, you have no idea.

593
00:40:47,452 --> 00:40:48,452
What are you doing?

594
00:40:48,952 --> 00:40:51,422
Those dirty eyes...

595
00:40:54,222 --> 00:40:55,521
Is your chest hurting again?

596
00:40:57,032 --> 00:40:59,632
Let us hurry home.

597
00:41:00,331 --> 00:41:01,831
I must rest.

598
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:02,932
Yes, my lord.

599
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:06,702
Who made you so upset?

600
00:41:07,371 --> 00:41:08,402
Oh, dear.

601
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:13,981
("The Lady's Private Life")

602
00:41:19,311 --> 00:41:21,182
I could not eat...

603
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,592
or sleep well for days,

604
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:27,161
but ever since I started reading this illustrated novel by Hwa Rok,

605
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:29,092
my condition has greatly improved.

606
00:41:31,191 --> 00:41:32,561
I am truly glad to hear that.

607
00:41:33,731 --> 00:41:34,831
By any chance,

608
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:37,472
have you met Hwa Rok in person?

609
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,242
I do not mean to brag,

610
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:43,371
but I practically raised Hwa Rok.

611
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:46,210
In fact, I was the one who came up with the pen name, Hwa Rok.

612
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:47,311
I see.

613
00:41:47,581 --> 00:41:50,211
What kind of scholar is he?

614
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,081
Clearly, he understands what women want.

615
00:41:53,452 --> 00:41:55,052
He must be a sensitive...

616
00:41:55,322 --> 00:41:57,021
and graceful man.

617
00:42:05,492 --> 00:42:06,561
Darn it.

618
00:42:12,402 --> 00:42:14,301
His name...

619
00:42:14,302 --> 00:42:17,371
"Graceful?"

620
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:20,411
"Mysterious" would be a better word to describe him.

621
00:42:21,282 --> 00:42:22,441
I see, a mysterious man.

622
00:42:23,452 --> 00:42:25,081
I will visit you again in five days.

623
00:42:25,682 --> 00:42:29,052
Oh, please try the cosmetic products I brought for you.

624
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:33,021
For whom should I adorn myself?

625
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:40,501
Do it for yourself.

626
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:52,842
My lady.

627
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:55,141
Kim's family brought some barley.

628
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:56,910
Could you please open the shed?

629
00:42:56,911 --> 00:42:58,211
One moment.

630
00:42:58,811 --> 00:42:59,811
Yes, my lady.

631
00:43:12,661 --> 00:43:13,661
Come along.

632
00:43:13,662 --> 00:43:15,302
Forget her husband who is never home.

633
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:17,601
Those two would make a better couple.

634
00:43:18,731 --> 00:43:20,401
If there is indeed a next life,

635
00:43:20,402 --> 00:43:22,871
I hope they are born into the same status and fall in love.

636
00:43:28,612 --> 00:43:29,882
How beautiful.

637
00:43:33,621 --> 00:43:36,581
Oh, no.

638
00:43:36,891 --> 00:43:38,052
Darn, I am late.

639
00:44:15,492 --> 00:44:16,961
Here, you can check.

640
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:18,862
Also,

641
00:44:19,061 --> 00:44:21,661
you need to give me more time for such urgent orders.

642
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:24,331
Of course, I want to give you more time.

643
00:44:24,932 --> 00:44:27,601
The lady who dropped this off is extremely busy.

644
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:29,441
Oh, there she is.

645
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:33,910
Is the thing I dropped off in the morning ready now?

646
00:44:33,911 --> 00:44:35,141
Please check.

647
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:37,851
I am sure you did a good job. I am busy, so I have to go.

648
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:40,521
Wait.

649
00:44:41,021 --> 00:44:42,322
Which family is she from?

650
00:44:53,601 --> 00:44:55,362
I have seen it many times before.

651
00:44:56,132 --> 00:44:58,902
I was not sure whether or not I should tell you.

652
00:44:59,702 --> 00:45:00,941
Do not worry though.

653
00:45:01,342 --> 00:45:03,541
Gosh, what should I do?

654
00:45:03,941 --> 00:45:05,471
Chun Sam's father said...

655
00:45:05,472 --> 00:45:08,211
he saw her near Unjongga.

656
00:45:08,481 --> 00:45:09,811
Please be careful, my lady.

657
00:45:12,411 --> 00:45:14,421
I am sure he was mistaken.

658
00:45:14,422 --> 00:45:16,580
She sews all day in the annex.

659
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,052
Why would she be seen near Unjongga?

660
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:27,500
Lady Ye Jin, I thought he was mistaken too.

661
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:30,001
But she did not come to the kitchen once today.

662
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:33,971
I am worried she might be slipping back into her old habits.

663
00:45:33,972 --> 00:45:35,342
Call her.

664
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:36,441
Yes, my lady.

665
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:39,842
Lady Jung, Lady Park is here!

666
00:45:42,941 --> 00:45:45,981
Oh, no. Was Chun Sam's father telling the truth?

667
00:45:46,682 --> 00:45:48,422
Why is she not answering?

668
00:45:49,081 --> 00:45:51,751
Lady Jung!

669
00:45:52,621 --> 00:45:53,722
We shall go inside.

670
00:45:57,262 --> 00:45:59,762
How come she is all quiet?

671
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:10,572
She thought she caught a cold. She fell asleep as she is not well.

672
00:46:10,972 --> 00:46:12,641
Mother, let us go.

673
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:16,842
My goodness. Lady Ye Jin, you are so gullible.

674
00:46:17,081 --> 00:46:19,251
At a quick glance,

675
00:46:19,682 --> 00:46:21,751
I can tell that it is just a crumpled blanket.

676
00:46:23,452 --> 00:46:25,592
Go move the blanket.

677
00:46:25,822 --> 00:46:26,891
Yes, my lady.

678
00:46:37,132 --> 00:46:39,501
Oh, Mother.

679
00:46:42,441 --> 00:46:43,941
When did you get here?

680
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:46,012
Why are you here?

681
00:46:47,411 --> 00:46:50,311
Are you talking to me?

682
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:55,250
Well... Why were you lying there quietly,

683
00:46:55,251 --> 00:46:57,021
looking like a crumpled blanket?

684
00:47:00,092 --> 00:47:02,391
Why did you not answer when we called you?

685
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:05,061
What happened was...

686
00:47:06,762 --> 00:47:08,961
I have a bad cold,

687
00:47:09,132 --> 00:47:11,001
but I forced myself to stay up to finish the clothes...

688
00:47:11,672 --> 00:47:14,101
for Father and Geun Seok and fainted.

689
00:47:33,222 --> 00:47:36,021
Very well. You should go back to bed.

690
00:47:37,021 --> 00:47:39,831
You need not come to my chamber to greet me in the morning. Rest up.

691
00:47:42,101 --> 00:47:43,262
Wait, Mother.

692
00:47:45,371 --> 00:47:48,842
Why did you come all the way to the annex at this hour?

693
00:47:54,641 --> 00:47:58,411
Knowing my mother-in-law, there is no way she came here voluntarily.

694
00:47:58,581 --> 00:47:59,811
Sam Wol's mother must be the culprit.

695
00:48:00,722 --> 00:48:03,120
I must make sure she would never egg Mother on again...

696
00:48:03,121 --> 00:48:04,351
to come here.

697
00:48:04,922 --> 00:48:07,052
Well, the third solar term has begun.

698
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:11,231
We should change all the beddings, so I came to consult you.

699
00:48:11,592 --> 00:48:14,431
However, you are not feeling well. Rest up for the next few days.

700
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:17,402
Just make sure you change all the beddings by the 20th.

701
00:48:18,472 --> 00:48:19,472
Pardon me?

702
00:48:21,972 --> 00:48:23,572
By the 20th of this month?

703
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,672
Get some rest.

704
00:48:36,722 --> 00:48:38,652
The 20th?

705
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:42,691
That is in eight days.

706
00:48:44,762 --> 00:48:47,432
Me and my mouth. I brought this upon myself.

707
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:51,302
From now on, only tell me what you know for certain.

708
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:56,001
You are home.

709
00:48:57,572 --> 00:49:00,512
I need to speak with you in regard to Ye Jin's marriage.

710
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:02,682
Let us talk inside.

711
00:49:21,632 --> 00:49:23,001
What a thrilling day.

712
00:49:24,202 --> 00:49:25,632
It was a good call to stay up all night.

713
00:49:27,101 --> 00:49:30,811
I should organize these now.

714
00:49:32,612 --> 00:49:33,882
Oh, boy.

715
00:49:41,081 --> 00:49:44,391
Chun Sam's father was not lying when he said he saw you near Unjongga.

716
00:49:47,152 --> 00:49:48,291
Thank goodness it is you.

717
00:49:52,561 --> 00:49:53,731
Ye Jin.

718
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:56,262
You should have made sure Mother would not come to the annex.

719
00:49:58,001 --> 00:50:00,432
Sam Wol's mother kept going on about it, saying she was convinced.

720
00:50:01,342 --> 00:50:04,371
I will come up with an excuse to scold Sam Wol's mother.

721
00:50:05,541 --> 00:50:06,811
Do not scold her.

722
00:50:07,742 --> 00:50:10,952
She probably did that to win points with Mother.

723
00:50:11,052 --> 00:50:12,512
I will be more careful from now on.

724
00:50:12,851 --> 00:50:13,851
Goodness.

725
00:50:14,882 --> 00:50:17,791
You are too understanding when you do not even need to be.

726
00:50:21,121 --> 00:50:23,690
Why must you work as a matchmaker when you always...

727
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,492
have to be anxious about getting caught?

728
00:50:26,961 --> 00:50:28,501
Well...

729
00:50:31,072 --> 00:50:32,072
Because it makes my heart flutter.

730
00:50:33,371 --> 00:50:36,141
My heart will never flutter again for I am a widow.

731
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:38,112
I should not let it flutter.

732
00:50:40,981 --> 00:50:42,112
But you see,

733
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:45,012
when I match a lovely couple,

734
00:50:45,152 --> 00:50:48,521
I can picture the happy life they will build together.

735
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:52,021
It makes my heart flutter and gives me joy.

736
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:55,422
And most importantly, I can earn money this way.

737
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:59,092
There are so many talented seamstresses.

738
00:50:59,231 --> 00:51:02,131
My sewing skills will not improve no matter how much I practice,

739
00:51:02,132 --> 00:51:04,531
so it would be much wiser to earn money...

740
00:51:04,532 --> 00:51:05,871
and hire a good seamstress to do the job.

741
00:51:08,541 --> 00:51:09,572
My gosh.

742
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:15,512
Do not act like you are here to help me. Just say it already.

743
00:51:16,742 --> 00:51:19,581
Seriously, you are awfully quick-witted.

744
00:51:21,222 --> 00:51:22,222
What?

745
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:25,521
You want me to make sure the marriage talks would fall through?

746
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:28,391
Yes. I heard he was the Deputy Minister's son,

747
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:30,391
but I cannot stand men like him.

748
00:51:31,432 --> 00:51:33,191
The Deputy Minister's son?

749
00:51:33,932 --> 00:51:36,331
I did hear you would always find him at courtesan houses.

750
00:51:38,302 --> 00:51:40,302
But how did you know you would not like him?

751
00:51:41,342 --> 00:51:44,370
Do not tell me you lurked around the Deputy Minister's house...

752
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:45,571
to see his face.

753
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:46,711
Have you lost your mind?

754
00:51:47,072 --> 00:51:50,141
If the word were to spread, you would really have to marry him.

755
00:51:51,182 --> 00:51:52,682
I am not crazy.

756
00:51:52,851 --> 00:51:55,621
I heard it from Gae Dong.

757
00:51:57,621 --> 00:51:58,851
Are you telling me the truth?

758
00:51:59,322 --> 00:52:01,961
Like Mother, I will go on to marry a first-rank officer.

759
00:52:02,391 --> 00:52:05,532
Such a philanderer... I do not wish to marry him.

760
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:06,932
My gosh.

761
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,831
But even so...

762
00:52:10,871 --> 00:52:14,072
How could I make the marriage talks fall through altogether?

763
00:52:15,072 --> 00:52:16,501
Well...

764
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:19,641
I do not know how you would do that,

765
00:52:20,271 --> 00:52:22,682
but the master matchmaker, Lady Yeoju, would know.

766
00:52:24,382 --> 00:52:25,382
What?

767
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:27,850
If you do not help me,

768
00:52:27,851 --> 00:52:30,922
I will tell Mother all about your matchmaking gig.

769
00:52:31,152 --> 00:52:34,021
Let me remind you that I am your sister-in-law after all.

770
00:52:39,331 --> 00:52:40,592
That is truly scary.

771
00:52:51,072 --> 00:52:54,341
Obscene books ridiculing noblemen such as "The Lady's Private Life..."

772
00:52:54,342 --> 00:52:57,782
are being widely circulated.

773
00:52:58,682 --> 00:53:02,581
What is the Capital District Office doing? They should ban such books.

774
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,262
Yes!

775
00:53:14,302 --> 00:53:16,461
This is how a married couple should be.

776
00:53:34,012 --> 00:53:36,421
A novel written to bring disgrace on government officials...

777
00:53:36,422 --> 00:53:38,722
is widely circulating among women, so I am writing...

778
00:53:38,891 --> 00:53:41,691
to report the Capital District Office for dereliction of duty.

779
00:53:41,822 --> 00:53:45,091
In addition, the peddler should also be punished for selling the book...

780
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,461
So naturally, I am wondering...

781
00:53:47,331 --> 00:53:48,661
if you have fallen for me.

782
00:54:03,242 --> 00:54:04,311
What is wrong with me?

783
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:16,422
I must report the Capital District Office for dereliction of duty.

784
00:54:16,592 --> 00:54:17,761
In addition, the peddler should also...

785
00:54:17,762 --> 00:54:18,831
Have you fallen for me?

786
00:54:22,202 --> 00:54:23,831
In addition, the peddler should also...

787
00:54:54,561 --> 00:54:55,862
My goodness.

788
00:54:56,362 --> 00:54:58,402
Did you stay up all night trying to write another petition?

789
00:55:00,941 --> 00:55:01,941
Goodness.

790
00:55:02,141 --> 00:55:04,101
This chest pain I have never experienced before...

791
00:55:04,572 --> 00:55:06,541
kept me up all night.

792
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:10,141
Oh, dear.

793
00:55:10,811 --> 00:55:13,382
(Physician's Office)

794
00:55:21,791 --> 00:55:23,922
I have had chest pain all my life,

795
00:55:24,932 --> 00:55:27,561
but I have never felt such pain with no one else around.

796
00:55:28,762 --> 00:55:30,762
Did you notice anything else that was unusual?

797
00:55:31,601 --> 00:55:32,902
Did I notice anything else?

798
00:55:35,101 --> 00:55:36,141
Oh, yes.

799
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:39,071
Every time I think of what happened at 6pm yesterday,

800
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:41,411
the chest pain arises.

801
00:55:42,211 --> 00:55:45,311
At 6pm? You were at the inn.

802
00:55:45,882 --> 00:55:47,282
What happened there?

803
00:55:49,222 --> 00:55:52,251
I do not even want to talk about it. It was despicable...

804
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,521
and unfair.

805
00:55:55,621 --> 00:55:57,390
This is different from the chest pain...

806
00:55:57,391 --> 00:56:00,932
you normally get. I believe it was caused by Suduraesu.

807
00:56:01,702 --> 00:56:05,132
"Suduraesu?" I have never heard of such an ailment before.

808
00:56:05,731 --> 00:56:06,830
Suduraesu.

809
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:08,540
"Su" as in "anxiety," "Du" as in "smallpox,"

810
00:56:08,541 --> 00:56:10,242
"Rae" as in "cause," "Su" as in "head."

811
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:12,140
Living in this complicated world,

812
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:15,480
when your beliefs do not match what you have experienced,

813
00:56:15,481 --> 00:56:17,140
your anxiety...

814
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:19,881
manifests as physical symptoms and pain.

815
00:56:19,882 --> 00:56:21,152
This newly recognized ailment...

816
00:56:21,282 --> 00:56:23,651
- is caused by your bad temper. - My goodness.

817
00:56:23,652 --> 00:56:25,890
See? This, right here.

818
00:56:25,891 --> 00:56:29,922
Such chest pain and headaches are the most common symptoms.

819
00:56:31,432 --> 00:56:32,461
I see.

820
00:56:33,632 --> 00:56:36,902
So it is a psychogenic ailment caused by cognitive dissonance.

821
00:56:37,672 --> 00:56:39,672
Then I think I know how to treat it.

822
00:56:39,831 --> 00:56:42,441
O Bong, we will go to the inn now.

823
00:56:42,771 --> 00:56:43,771
Yes, my lord.

824
00:56:44,472 --> 00:56:45,472
Thank you.

825
00:56:46,541 --> 00:56:47,572
Goodness.

826
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,492
("The Lady's Private Life")

827
00:57:04,222 --> 00:57:06,592
Why? Do you not like it?

828
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:09,402
No, do not say it.

829
00:57:09,961 --> 00:57:11,371
I will revise it and have you read it again.

830
00:57:11,702 --> 00:57:14,541
Goodness. You need not revise it.

831
00:57:15,441 --> 00:57:17,441
Volume One was good,

832
00:57:18,842 --> 00:57:20,211
and Volume Two is even better.

833
00:57:20,512 --> 00:57:22,242
You are a genius, are you not?

834
00:57:22,581 --> 00:57:25,012
Oh, please. I am not a genius.

835
00:57:26,952 --> 00:57:27,981
Well...

836
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:31,722
What was your favourite part?

837
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:34,762
Well, I enjoyed every page but...

838
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:38,661
Right. The part where she escapes from the Department of Justice...

839
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:39,961
Oh, I see.

840
00:57:40,492 --> 00:57:41,802
Lady Yeoju?

841
00:57:43,362 --> 00:57:45,231
I do not know when she will be here.

842
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:48,101
Why are you looking...

843
00:57:49,242 --> 00:57:51,041
for Lady Yeoju?

844
00:57:51,472 --> 00:57:52,512
What is with you?

845
00:57:53,211 --> 00:57:54,742
Lower your voice.

846
00:57:54,981 --> 00:57:56,341
My ears hurt.

847
00:57:56,342 --> 00:57:57,411
Oh, my apologies.

848
00:58:00,251 --> 00:58:02,351
I must talk to the peddler about something.

849
00:58:02,882 --> 00:58:04,051
You can tell me.

850
00:58:04,052 --> 00:58:07,021
I will be sure to relay your message to her.

851
00:58:08,362 --> 00:58:10,992
This all began with a foolish misunderstanding,

852
00:58:11,161 --> 00:58:13,891
so having someone relay my words could cause more misunderstanding.

853
00:58:14,092 --> 00:58:15,802
Hence, I must...

854
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:18,101
speak with her in person.

855
00:58:19,572 --> 00:58:20,871
You wish to see her?

856
00:58:21,742 --> 00:58:23,771
Why? Can I not see her?

857
00:58:24,242 --> 00:58:25,311
It is not that.

858
00:58:25,771 --> 00:58:28,440
I have never seen you picking fights with someone other than noblemen.

859
00:58:28,441 --> 00:58:30,081
When did I pick fights with anyone?

860
00:58:35,422 --> 00:58:36,422
In any case,

861
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:39,791
I will wait here until she comes back.

862
00:58:40,992 --> 00:58:42,691
She might not be back today.

863
00:58:44,161 --> 00:58:45,161
Sir.

864
00:58:47,032 --> 00:58:48,362
Please excuse me, my lord.

865
00:58:48,702 --> 00:58:50,061
Chief, let us talk.

866
00:59:03,911 --> 00:59:07,051
It seems like you do not know who my lord is...

867
00:59:07,052 --> 00:59:09,250
since he always buys medical books.

868
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:11,321
If he does not meet the peddler today,

869
00:59:11,322 --> 00:59:14,322
I shudder to think what will happen to you.

870
00:59:14,461 --> 00:59:15,491
What will happen?

871
00:59:15,492 --> 00:59:17,390
He will report to the officials...

872
00:59:17,391 --> 00:59:19,230
that there is an inn renting out novels...

873
00:59:19,231 --> 00:59:20,531
aimed at mocking the gentry.

874
00:59:20,532 --> 00:59:22,762
That will get you 20 flogs to begin with.

875
00:59:23,331 --> 00:59:24,402
It is the law.

876
00:59:24,771 --> 00:59:27,701
So if the peddler is not coming,

877
00:59:27,702 --> 00:59:29,641
you better get her right now.

878
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,251
He is way more obnoxious than I thought.

879
00:59:41,121 --> 00:59:42,152
Do you know him?

880
00:59:43,481 --> 00:59:44,921
I told you about him.

881
00:59:44,922 --> 00:59:46,951
The petty fellow who wanted to report the book...

882
00:59:46,952 --> 00:59:48,291
for mocking nobles.

883
00:59:48,691 --> 00:59:51,361
Does that mean he is here to report me?

884
00:59:51,362 --> 00:59:52,532
Do not worry.

885
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:55,660
He would have gone to the officials if he wanted to.

886
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:58,201
Why would he come here for me, going as far to threaten Chief?

887
00:59:58,202 --> 01:00:00,632
I see. But why is he here?

888
01:00:02,172 --> 01:00:03,342
I think...

889
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,270
My lord, this book is not worth the trouble.

890
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:09,941
I will have to finish reading the book to decide that myself.

891
01:00:10,512 --> 01:00:12,181
What does that mean?

892
01:00:12,182 --> 01:00:15,321
If what I have read so far turns out to be a foolish woman's dream,

893
01:00:15,322 --> 01:00:16,952
I cannot report the author.

894
01:00:17,382 --> 01:00:20,822
He must be curious about the ending of Volume One.

895
01:00:21,322 --> 01:00:23,492
Everything will be settled if he gets that book.

896
01:00:25,262 --> 01:00:26,291
("The Lady's Private Life")

897
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:29,501
- Really? - Just count on me.

898
01:00:32,501 --> 01:00:33,601
Meow.

899
01:00:36,702 --> 01:00:38,972
Oh, my. Come to think of it,

900
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:42,911
Lady Yeoju will come here to return the books.

901
01:00:43,012 --> 01:00:44,341
Yes, she is on her way.

902
01:00:44,342 --> 01:00:45,452
I heard him too.

903
01:00:46,652 --> 01:00:48,322
There she comes!

904
01:01:00,661 --> 01:01:01,731
She is not there.

905
01:01:05,302 --> 01:01:06,632
- Goodness! - My gosh.

906
01:01:09,601 --> 01:01:10,941
Are you looking for me?

907
01:01:12,172 --> 01:01:14,141
Where did you come from?

908
01:01:15,811 --> 01:01:18,581
I heard that you had something to tell me.

909
01:01:21,652 --> 01:01:22,822
Please excuse us.

910
01:01:23,751 --> 01:01:25,821
- Sorry? - Please do.

911
01:01:25,822 --> 01:01:28,691
O Bong, you too. Wait outside.

912
01:01:29,661 --> 01:01:30,992
- Me too? - Quick!

913
01:01:32,161 --> 01:01:34,262
But I... Goodness.

914
01:01:46,541 --> 01:01:47,641
Please speak.

915
01:02:00,222 --> 01:02:02,322
I have something for you too.

916
01:02:03,161 --> 01:02:04,161
I...

917
01:02:07,492 --> 01:02:08,501
I...

918
01:02:19,842 --> 01:02:21,382
I have fallen for you.

919
01:02:25,811 --> 01:02:26,811
My gosh.

920
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:29,081
That is nuts.

921
01:02:29,621 --> 01:02:31,452
- Did he just confess? - Yes.

922
01:02:33,452 --> 01:02:34,621
("The Lady's Private Life")

923
01:02:51,842 --> 01:02:55,342
What... What did I just say?

924
01:02:58,081 --> 01:03:00,652
You said you have fallen for me.

925
01:03:02,952 --> 01:03:05,290
I misspoke because I am unwell. Forget it.

926
01:03:05,291 --> 01:03:06,891
What I want to say is...

927
01:03:07,291 --> 01:03:08,291
I...

928
01:03:09,322 --> 01:03:10,862
have not fallen for you.

929
01:03:12,762 --> 01:03:13,831
I see.

930
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:15,460
What is he saying?

931
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:16,461
What?

932
01:03:17,061 --> 01:03:19,701
Why are you stating the obvious?

933
01:03:19,702 --> 01:03:21,741
When we were here yesterday,

934
01:03:21,742 --> 01:03:23,902
did you not suppose that I had fallen for you?

935
01:03:24,172 --> 01:03:25,242
Pardon?

936
01:03:25,911 --> 01:03:27,741
But you asked for my name and age...

937
01:03:27,742 --> 01:03:29,411
when I did not write this book.

938
01:03:29,612 --> 01:03:32,452
So naturally, I am wondering if you have fallen for me.

939
01:03:32,981 --> 01:03:34,052
Right.

940
01:03:34,682 --> 01:03:37,520
You came all the way here just to rectify that?

941
01:03:37,521 --> 01:03:39,951
Correcting that ridiculous misunderstanding...

942
01:03:39,952 --> 01:03:42,091
is extremely important for me.

943
01:03:42,092 --> 01:03:45,661
I thought he was an obnoxious jerk. Turns out, he is a total freak.

944
01:03:46,532 --> 01:03:48,032
I should not interact any further.

945
01:03:48,231 --> 01:03:50,531
I need to be polite and apologize quickly.

946
01:03:50,532 --> 01:03:52,830
That day, I was in a hurry and misunderstood.

947
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,702
I apologize for the inconvenience caused.

948
01:03:55,141 --> 01:03:57,000
I shall set this straight and take that...

949
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:58,572
you did not fall for me.

950
01:04:01,012 --> 01:04:02,041
All right.

951
01:04:02,411 --> 01:04:04,410
To make up for it,

952
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:07,011
I will make sure to stay out of your sight.

953
01:04:07,012 --> 01:04:08,081
Excuse me, then.

954
01:04:26,831 --> 01:04:29,040
Is that really necessary?

955
01:04:29,041 --> 01:04:30,901
Does your chest still ache?

956
01:04:30,902 --> 01:04:31,972
No.

957
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:34,410
I just fixed the misunderstanding.

958
01:04:34,411 --> 01:04:35,581
It will not ache anymore.

959
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:38,652
- I do not think it is fixed. - Why, you...

960
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:43,350
Why are you...

961
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:44,922
The traitor is here.

962
01:04:45,691 --> 01:04:46,691
Arrest him!

963
01:04:47,621 --> 01:04:50,262
Lords, there must be a misunderstanding...

964
01:04:50,862 --> 01:04:51,862
Why, you...

965
01:04:52,961 --> 01:04:54,561
Goodness. How insolent!

966
01:04:54,862 --> 01:04:56,060
If you knew who I was,

967
01:04:56,061 --> 01:04:58,730
you would realize how impudent...

968
01:04:58,731 --> 01:05:00,302
you were being.

969
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:03,371
My lord is in a foul mood right now.

970
01:05:03,501 --> 01:05:05,311
Someone will lose their title today.

971
01:05:06,242 --> 01:05:08,611
You must be an investigator from the Department of Justice.

972
01:05:08,612 --> 01:05:10,710
Seeing how you only brought your henchmen,

973
01:05:10,711 --> 01:05:12,181
it must be a secret mission.

974
01:05:12,182 --> 01:05:15,080
Your failure to recognize people shows your incompetency.

975
01:05:15,081 --> 01:05:16,851
What a shame.

976
01:05:16,981 --> 01:05:18,951
While you were here wasting time with me,

977
01:05:18,952 --> 01:05:20,790
your suspect would have fled already.

978
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:21,922
Your crime is...

979
01:05:32,771 --> 01:05:36,402
My lord!

980
01:05:37,072 --> 01:05:40,411
Wake up!

981
01:06:06,831 --> 01:06:09,842
You are not a lowly thug. How can an investigator...

982
01:06:10,402 --> 01:06:12,241
go against the manual?

983
01:06:12,242 --> 01:06:14,770
How dare you act so impudently?

984
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:16,181
Do you know who I am?

985
01:06:16,182 --> 01:06:18,141
Are you not Lord Gyeongunjae?

986
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:22,080
Despite knowing my identity, you acted rashly.

987
01:06:22,081 --> 01:06:24,080
That is an act of contempt against the throne.

988
01:06:24,081 --> 01:06:26,621
Who is the one belittling the throne?

989
01:06:27,521 --> 01:06:29,922
And who are you? Look...

990
01:06:39,731 --> 01:06:44,742
Oh, Your... Your Majesty.

991
01:06:47,472 --> 01:06:49,480
Because you belittled the throne...

992
01:06:49,481 --> 01:06:51,511
and deceived me,

993
01:06:51,512 --> 01:06:53,411
I ordered him to arrest you.

994
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:58,052
Your Majesty, that is absolutely illogical...

995
01:07:01,722 --> 01:07:03,361
Since the establishment of Joseon,

996
01:07:03,362 --> 01:07:06,431
no son-in-law of the king has been allowed to remarry.

997
01:07:06,432 --> 01:07:08,330
Yet, you blatantly wrote appeals.

998
01:07:08,331 --> 01:07:10,402
Is that not contempt against the throne?

999
01:07:11,771 --> 01:07:13,931
Well, that was an appropriate appeal...

1000
01:07:13,932 --> 01:07:16,041
- Sim Jung Woo. - Yes?

1001
01:07:17,472 --> 01:07:19,140
When you married my daughter,

1002
01:07:19,141 --> 01:07:21,211
you should have been ready for this.

1003
01:07:22,981 --> 01:07:25,651
Even wives keep their chastity easily.

1004
01:07:25,652 --> 01:07:27,381
How dare you write appeals about it?

1005
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:30,052
Pardon my impudence, but that appeal...

1006
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:33,052
was not a request for permission to remarry.

1007
01:07:33,492 --> 01:07:36,020
As per the recommendation by the royal family,

1008
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:38,592
I wanted you to annul my marriage to the princess.

1009
01:07:38,831 --> 01:07:42,461
Did you perhaps think they were the same thing...

1010
01:07:42,661 --> 01:07:46,202
or was that not the case?

1011
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:48,672
What?

1012
01:07:52,512 --> 01:07:54,512
I never realized.

1013
01:07:55,512 --> 01:07:57,581
You are the type that asks to be punished.

1014
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:00,882
Bring it here.

1015
01:08:01,652 --> 01:08:02,682
Yes, Your Majesty.

1016
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:05,691
Chief Royal Secretary...

1017
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:19,702
Your Majesty.

1018
01:08:20,232 --> 01:08:23,201
This is not the right sentence by law.

1019
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:28,012
Please give me a fair sentence later and...

1020
01:08:31,812 --> 01:08:33,751
Do not try to buy time.

1021
01:08:35,352 --> 01:08:38,650
I know you will rack your sly brain...

1022
01:08:38,651 --> 01:08:41,451
and get away with a wonderful excuse again.

1023
01:08:42,722 --> 01:08:44,320
Just like how you stopped...

1024
01:08:44,321 --> 01:08:46,531
the crown prince's marriage with the spinster-bachelor problem.

1025
01:08:47,762 --> 01:08:49,401
How did you know that?

1026
01:08:50,562 --> 01:08:54,171
I knew it. So you were the one who gave the left state councillor...

1027
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:56,541
an excuse to stop the crown prince's marriage.

1028
01:08:59,312 --> 01:09:02,812
Serve this traitor the poison at once!

1029
01:09:03,081 --> 01:09:04,142
Yes, Your Majesty.

1031
01:09:27,201 --> 01:09:28,672
(We thank actress Jang Hye Jin for her special appearance.)

1032
01:09:43,052 --> 01:09:44,780
They named you a traitor?

1033
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:46,320
How can this be?

1034
01:09:46,321 --> 01:09:48,421
I am finally going into government.

1035
01:09:48,422 --> 01:09:50,091
Have you heard of the old ladies?

1036
01:09:50,092 --> 01:09:52,530
It is not that we cannot wed, but we refuse to.

1037
01:09:52,531 --> 01:09:54,261
What is wrong with that old fossil?

1038
01:09:54,262 --> 01:09:56,200
I will attempt to marry off Lord Maeng's three girls...

1039
01:09:56,201 --> 01:09:57,530
in two months.

1040
01:09:57,531 --> 01:09:59,570
I will never accept matchmaking requests...

1041
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:01,231
from people like you.

1042
01:10:01,232 --> 01:10:02,941
Why is everyone doing this to me?

1043
01:10:02,942 --> 01:10:05,370
Can you pretend to be Lady Yeoju this once?

1044
01:10:05,371 --> 01:10:07,370
You will not leave easily today.

1045
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,740
You will regret it.

1046
01:10:08,741 --> 01:10:11,410
Lady Bang only has her husband.

1047
01:10:11,411 --> 01:10:13,281
I miss you, my dear.
