1
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,400

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,570

3
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:47,100

4
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,580
This is my plan.

5
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:01,880
As soon as the wedding is over, I will put my affairs in order and leave for the Ming Dynasty.

6
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,180
This is crazy.

7
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,470
Did you say that to me just now?

8
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,060
No, I was saying it to myself.

9
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:19,080
Is this the method thought up by Joseon's smartest scholar?

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,560
How will we live in the Ming Dynasty when we do not even speak their language?

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,630
I can speak the Ming Dynasty's language.

12
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,230
Does the Ming Dynasty have no need for matchmakers?

13
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,650
I am a Ssangyeonsulsa!

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,630
But still...

15
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:33,330
Love is everywhere, and it is the beginning of everything.

16
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,360
With the power of love...

17
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:38,250
Why are you not thinking of living in Joseon together?

18
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,790
How can we do that?

19
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,770
Will this family let go of you so easily?

20
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,040
That is true.

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,130
But there must be a way. Right?

22
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:05,280
I will find a way to be with you in Joseon without fail.

23
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,700
So do not worry.

24
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,760
I understand.

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,520

26
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,940

27
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,780

28
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,560
You can wait all night, but the Young Lady will not come.

29
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:40,680
The entire house will be turned upside down tonight.

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,970
Gosh, should I just not go back inside?

31
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,420
Huh? Y-Young Lady?

32
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,950
- Gosh! 
 - Goodness, Young Lady!

33
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,340
Young Lady, why did you come so late?

34
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,950
Dear Husband, let us hurry inside.

35
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,900
"Dear Husband"? Madam will be furious if she finds out!

36
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,200
I would not have come back if it were not for my husband.

37
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:11,670

Let's hide at Temple Seonhwa tonight.

38
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:13,510
I have a plan.

39
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,570
Since I did not show up at the wedding today,

40
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:19,470
the entire Hanyang will know my marriage was broken off, and I will never get a marriage offer again.

41
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,470
Would she not let me live with you, then?

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,220
No, I will not let people say such things about you.

43
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,200
Why do other people matter?

44
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,160
I only need to live with you, Orabeoni.

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,170
It matters to me.

46
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,870
You have to stay a valuable person always.

47
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,170
Let us go to your house.

48
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,940
I am not going. I am going to live with you.

49
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,110
I will tell your mother that I will marry you.

50
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:03,190
If we go now, you might get beaten to death.

51
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:08,860
You ran away on the day of your wedding. There is nothing I cannot do.

52
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,480
It will be okay. Right?

53
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,500
If I can live with you, I will do anything.

54
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,510
 So much is going on at home already. Why are you adding to it, Young Lady?

55
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:37,010
Consider you are saving my life and go in alone, Young Lady.

56
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,990
- Gosh, gosh! 
 - Let go.

57
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,960
That is enough.

58
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,520
I am going to go meet Mother with Maiden Ye Jin.

59
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,590
So move aside.

60
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,590
He told you to move aside.

61
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:55,710
M-Madam said to bring both of them to her.

62
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,910
Madam did?

63
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:59,610
Yes.

64
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,350
Really?

65
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:09,830

66
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,560
They must be in this room.

67
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,390
Just open it.

68
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,800
Move away from the door for a moment.

69
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,260

70
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:20,970
What are you doing right now?

71
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,310

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,300
Why are you being rude and trying to open this newlywed room door?

73
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,210
T-The thing is...

74
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,700
B-Because I must c-check something!

75
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,150
Are you sure Mother said to bring Orabeoni also?

76
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:05,300
Well, it was Young Madam who said it, not Madam Park.

77
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Sister-in-law did?

78
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,260
It looks like the Mayor caught on.

79
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,370
Let us run away.

80
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,590
If we get caught here like this, we are both done for.

81
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,070
Ye Jin, why did you come so late?

82
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,560
Why are you two wearing wedding attires?

83
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,130
Why else but to get you and the Scholar together?

84
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:53,420
The mayor is going around checking grooms' faces.

85
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:57,100
When the door opens, show them Scholar's face and settle it once and for all.

86
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,640
Sorry?

87
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,230
I was informed there was a fraudulent wedding.

88
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,250
This room is my daughter's room.

89
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,530
Such a thing would not happen.

90
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,600
Go back now.

91
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,830
I only need to see the groom's face, so why are you stopping me?

92
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:22,430
Is there really something wrong?

93
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,400
How dare—

94
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,290
There is no time for this. We have to go now.

95
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:37,660
Madam!

96
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,770
Orabeoni, turn your face!

97
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,940
There is no way!

98
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,210
Get out of my house right now.

99
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,920
I will never forget what happened today!

100
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,910
T-This is weird.

101
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,720
W-Why was Gyeongwoonjae not in there?

102
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,320
Hurry, get up! They're coming!

103
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,580
The bride was the Left State Minister's daughter, but the groom was not the Defense Minister's son!

104
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,030
I told you the Defense Minister's son married Master Maeng's second daughter!

105
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,810
This family's young lady already had a fiancé chosen by her family since she was young.

106
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,390
Hyungnim, you cannot get these things confused. You are impossible!

107
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,180
Goodness, I know it is not!

108
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,270
 Who on Earth did I match-make, then? Gosh, seriously...

109
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,530
 Go back now.

110
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,560
Go, go, go!

111
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,980
 Go!

112
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,330
Mother, I will explain everything.

113
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:20,000
What do you think you are doing right now!

114
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,560
Take your hand off right now!

115
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,090
Mother, Sister-in-law did it all for me, so please do not be angry.

116
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,970
I am greatly disappointed in you.

117
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,410
Did you lure in naïve Ye Jin in the first place so you can get

118
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,290
the Defense Minister's son and the old maiden married?

119
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,580
I told you how important the marriage with the Defense Minister's family is!

120
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,090
How can you do this to me?

121
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:58,080
Ye Jin's feelings were more important to me.

122
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,940
- How can mere feelings matter more? 
 - Mother!

123
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,450
Please stop it.

124
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,450
Sister-in-law did not make me do this. It was my decision.

125
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,880
Please allow me to marry Maiden Ye Jin.

126
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,650
I am lacking in many ways,

127
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,030
but I will do my best to become suitable for your family.

128
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,930
No matter how hard you try, you can never be suitable for my family.

129
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:36,170
Get out of my house right now!

130
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,940
If that is your response, Mother,

131
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:42,110
I will also leave this house with my husband.

132
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:44,020
Dear Husband, let us go.

133
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,110
Ye Jin...

134
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,930
you cannot do this to Mother as well.

135
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:52,530
How... How dare you two—

136
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,020
Madam, the wedding has been done already.

137
00:10:58,180 --> 00:11:04,380
Do you really want to let everyone know your daughter ran away before the wedding?

138
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,350
Were you...

139
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:09,930
also a part of this, Your Excellency?

140
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:16,570
It was a wedding ordered by His Majesty, so I must do my best to the end.

141
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,770
Is it your method to have an affair...

142
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:29,430
with another man to ruin my daughter and our family's future?

143
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,900
You will meet the consequences of your doings for sure.

144
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,090
Sorry for coming so late. Please wait a moment.

145
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,780
I brought food from the banquet, so I only need to cook rice.

146
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:08,210
I already cooked the rice.

147
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:11,700
You cooked the rice, Sir?

148
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,610
It did not turn out so well, but I think it is edible.

149
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,270
Oh, and also...

150
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,130
Please...

151
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,950
marry me.

152
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,110
Are you okay?

153
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,230
Madam,

154
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,080
come away with me right now.

155
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,240
Right now?

156
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,610
I cannot.

157
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,360
Did you not say you will do as I say once the wedding is over?

158
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,420
Did I not ask you to wait for me?

159
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,810
Why are you in such a rush?

160
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:02,430
No one knows what will happen to you if you stay here.

161
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,980
My brother is here.

162
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,530
Do not worry.

163
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,300
I will stay here today as well, then.

164
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,340
If you stay here,

165
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,020
things will only get worse.

166
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,430
I will let you know, so go back for today.

167
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,710
You need to let me know first thing tomorrow.

168
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
All right.

169
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,890
Even if it was done for my sake,

170
00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:00,590
Mother must have been shocked because you and His Excellency were wearing wedding attire.

171
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:05,580
That is why she got furious, so please understand her.

172
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,340
Ye Jin...

173
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:21,450
I have feelings for His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

174
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,920
What do you mean by that?

175
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,170
I am sorry.

176
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:41,880
I cannot be on your side for this one.

177
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,530
However, give me two...

178
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,380
No, give me one day, and I will be on your side.

179
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,850
You were always on my side, too.

180
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,710
Ye Jin...

181
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,590
Just talk to Mother about my wedding today.

182
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:17,060
If you talk about your story as well, she might really faint.

183
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:30,670
 Mother, this is Geun Seok's mother.

184
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,960
Go back.

185
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,570
I do not wish to see your face.

186
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:40,090
I said I do not want to see you!

187
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:45,640
I protected this family by killing my husband and my brother, but you ruined it all!

188
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,710
Y-You were the one...

189
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,750
who did it, Mother?

190
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:05,720
Y-Ye Jin—

191
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,090
Let us go to your house right this minute.

192
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,100
If we leave like this,

193
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,760
what about Geun Seok and his mother?

194
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,220
She did the most work to connect us.

195
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,600
It is our turn to help her now.

196
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:40,250
Dear Husband...

197
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,510
You can figure out your family matters with me now.

198
00:17:47,210 --> 00:17:51,720
I want to do my best to become the person your family wants

199
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,240
for your sake, Ye Jin.

200
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,270

201
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:01,830
Crown Prince told me the old maidens' weddings were quite raucous.

202
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,010
I apologize.

203
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,590
I am not reprimanding you.

204
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,620
I am commending you for doing a good job.

205
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,850
There is nothing good for me if their family becomes in-laws with the Defense Minister's family.

206
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,850
It also looks like many officials' concerns are gone...

207
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:26,800
because Crown Prince showed his authority at the wedding.

208
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:33,020
Come to think about it, you seem to have a great talent for matchmaking.

209
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,500
How about you continue doing that from now on?

210
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,090
It was a joke.

211
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,290
Gosh, look at you in shock. Your eyes widened...

212
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,560
Your appeal letter will be accepted soon.

213
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,940
Think about what you want to do after.

214
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:03,460
I heard you ran off at night without even finishing the wedding.

215
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:06,950
I was so resentful and blamed you a lot.

216
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,010
I am sorry.

217
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,800
I know it is out of order in the procedure,

218
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,220
but this is your daughter-in-law's sajudanja. 
  (A traditional letter containing the "Four Pillars": hour, date, month and year of birth written in Chinese characters)

219
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,890
The procedure does not matter at this point.

220
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,720
Crown Princess' family is a hundred times better than

221
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,530
the Left State Minister's family, who is pretty much ruined.

222
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,610
I have something to tell you.

223
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:56,120
So take off your vulgar attire and wait.

224
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,060
 Your Excellency!

225
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,620
H-Here...

226
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,880
An urgent letter came from the Left State Minister's family.

227
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:22,950
 Teacher, I have an urgent matter to discuss with you regarding my mother.

228
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,720
 Please come to my house.

229
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,770
Young Master is inside.

230
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,920
Madam, are you okay?

231
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,890
What brings you here, Your Excellency?

232
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:54,900
Geun Seok sent a letter saying there was an urgent matter.

233
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,480
Pardon?

234
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:10,810
You cannot escape, so do not waste your breath.

235
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,640
I reported that Gyeongwoonjae raped my daughter-in-law.

236
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,210
So the Royal Investigations Bureau will come to arrest you soon.

237
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:22,700
Mother, please do not do this.

238
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,760
 There is no need to be upset.

239
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,370
This is the result of your choice.

240
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,970
So, accept it as a natural course of action.

241
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:45,120

242
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,640
To put you in danger,

243
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,200
I was too rash in my actions.

244
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,280
It is not your fault.

245
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,160
No.

246
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:14,800
I feel like all of this is my fault.

247
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:22,340
I should not have fallen for you at the bookstore back then.

248
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,360
You said you did not fall for me.

249
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,750
But you did fall for me back then.

250
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,680
Is it time to be making jokes?

251
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,740
When you asked me to come away with you,

252
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,620
I should have followed you.

253
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:53,030
But you have to deny it to the end.

254
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,080
I loved you all on my own.

255
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,730
I cannot do that.

256
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,010
You know how much I love you.

257
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:09,170
If you are to suffer alone,

258
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:12,740
I am too afraid you might...

259
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,660
regret meeting me.

260
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,580
Do you know why...

261
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,510
my heart is racing right now?

262
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:38,880
Because you are afraid.

263
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,160
Incorrect.

264
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,460
It is racing because I love you.

265
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:55,510
So I will never regret meeting you.

266
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:58,460
Forever.

267
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,860
What was Prince Gyeongwoonjae accused of?

268
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,400
He was reported for raping Madam Jeong, the late Left State Minister's daughter-in-law.

269
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,500
R-Rape?

270
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,200
Gyeongwoonjae did?

271
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,920
What kind of nonsense is this?

272
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,180
That is also what I thought,

273
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,320
but Gyeongwoonjae and Madam Jeong were in the same room when he was arrested,

274
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,510
so it must be true.

275
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:21,690
I cannot believe this until I hear it from him.

276
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,730
What on Earth happened?

277
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:39,420
Have you fallen into a trap?

278
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,360
No, Sire.

279
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,400
If not,

280
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:51,340
did you really attempt to rape a woman?

281
00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:54,200
I did.

282
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,420
I forced myself upon her because I loved her on my own.

283
00:26:58,030 --> 00:26:59,930
So please make sure the Madam does not suffer.

284
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:01,890
Is that something...

285
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:05,450
you should be telling me right now?

286
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,620
It looks like...

287
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,190
I did not know you very well all this time.

288
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,160
I believe my sister was caught up in an awful rumor and caused your family harm.

289
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:41,210
My father and I will take my sister back to our house.

290
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,280
What harm?

291
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,610
It was not Geun Seok's mother's fault, was it?

292
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:49,760
- But still— 
 - Since she married into our family,

293
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,070
she is our family member now.

294
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:57,660
No matter what happens, it is right for her to spend the rest of her life here.

295
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:03,200
Could I have a moment with my sister?

296
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,580
She probably does not want to see anyone right now.

297
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:12,700
I will make sure people do not point fingers at Geun Seok's mother as she lives.

298
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,370
So please do not worry.

299
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:43,440
I must meet Mother.

300
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,240
If you heeded my advice,

301
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,930
your appeal letter would have been accepted, and you would have taken public office.

302
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:15,000
And even become the leader of the Dongno Party.

303
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,080
You fell into the abyss like this because you could not control yourself for one moment.

304
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:26,620
You are the one who fell into the abyss, not me.

305
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:32,050
Are you saying that when you know the situation you are in right now?

306
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:41,190
Do you know what kind of poison geumjam poison you used eight years ago is?

307
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:48,680
According to ancient literature, users of geumjam poison prosper and elevate in life.

308
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:55,350
However, they say its user is destroyed in the end.

309
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:00,790
Because of that poison, your son died...

310
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:04,960
as well as your brother and husband.

311
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,780
So, I guess the curse was real.

312
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:17,170
If a mere legend from ancient literature consoles your heart, think however you want.

313
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:22,040
However, everyone knows you are the one who will be destroyed soon.

314
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,570
We will see how things turn out.

315
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,050

316
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:49,300
My husband is doing all he can to bring Sister-in-law back to her side of the family.

317
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,260
So I think we will have to wait a bit more.

318
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:55,280
The problem is His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae...

319
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:00,210
What about digging a tunnel under the Royal Investigations Bureau and bringing him out?

320
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,790
That would take forever.

321
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:07,070
Can you get the guard so drunk that he falls asleep and then bring His Excellency out?

322
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:08,760
Why are you doing this, Young Lady?

323
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:12,920
Royal Investigations Bureau's prison is not as shabby as the novels say.

324
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,600
Are you belittling novels right now?

325
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,560
N-No, I was—

326
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,740

327
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,450
I hear His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae will be ordered to die by poison tonight.

328
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:39,430
You shall accept the royal decree!

329
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,320
 Stop the execution!

330
00:32:47,470 --> 00:32:49,610
Shim Jeong Woo...

331
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,730
if you tell me you fell into the trap that Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong set even now,

332
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:07,650
she will be punished severely for daring to frame you, a member of the Royal Family,

333
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:14,190
and I will let you live like you have been as Prince Gyeongwoonjae.

334
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:21,600
However, if you insist you did it out of love for His Excellency Jo's daughter-in-law to the end,

335
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,050
I cannot help but order your death.

336
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:35,540
Your humble servant...

337
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:41,410
will admit to my crime...

338
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:45,540
and accept my sentence.

339
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:28,320
I cannot let you be when you betrayed my son and ruined my family.

340
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,890
This is my last good gesture for you, for old times' sake.

341
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:44,130
The Royal Investigations Bureau will execute Prince Gyeongwoonjae today.

342
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:49,290
So, Gyeongwoonjae will no longer be alive.

343
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,210
 I am telling you so it will be easier for you to make up your mind.

344
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,790
His Excellency Jo's daughter-in-law Jeong committed suicide?

345
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:08,650
Yes. Thus, the Jo family asking for a Virtuous Woman's Memorial Gate has come in.

346
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:12,600
You should look over it, Chief Royal Secretary.

347
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,550
Yes, Sire.

348
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,550
 Even if...

349
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:41,080
 we never get to meet again,

350
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:44,790
 no matter what happens...

351
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:51,710
 stay the same person I fell in love with and live happily.

352
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:57,050
 That way, I will not regret meeting you.

353
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,950
 We will...

354
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:05,190
 definitely meet again.

355
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,500
 We are...

356
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:16,510
 fated to do so.

357
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:42,770
 Are you awake now?

358
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:01,120
Your Excellency...

359
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,310
Your Excellency.

360
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,210
Your Excellency.

361
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:13,560
A-Are you awake now?

362
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,720
He survived.

363
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:27,980
Goodness, you did not wake up for ten days, and I was so worried that you passed away!

364
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,000
How could you have so little faith in me as a physician?

365
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,740
What happened?

366
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,120
His Majesty secretly gave the order to save you.

367
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,710
I only found out after hearing from Physician Yoo.

368
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,880
Goodness!

369
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,430
Gosh, you should not move just yet.

370
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,690
Though it was a small dose, it contained poison,

371
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:00,030
so you must recuperate and get treated.

372
00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:03,760
I must meet with the Madam, who will be worried about me.

373
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,700
What is it?

374
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:15,700
W-Well, the thing is...

375
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:22,320
After you drank the poison,

376
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,770
she supposedly committed suicide.

377
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,400
There is no way.

378
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,600
I must meet her myself and check—

379
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,860
- Gosh. 
 - Your Excellency, goodness!

380
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:40,480
- Gosh, Your Excellency, Your Excellency! 
 - Oh, Your Excellency!

381
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,830
 The people of Silla spoke of Ssangyeonsulsas not as masters of love but as lonely masters.

382
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,900
 It was because anyone who marries them dies young.

383
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,870

It is said if you learn without thinking, you retain nothing. And if you think without learning, it is risky.

384
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,960
If you only focus on learning and do not reflect on yourself,

385
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,140
your knowledge will only be a mere shell.

386
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,650
A scholar must always be careful not to fall into dogmatism.

387
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,980
Do you understand?

388
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:17,640
Yes. I will keep that in mind, Uncle.

389
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,620
How is the home study?

390
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:24,580
Uncle is better at teaching than the schoolmaster.

391
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,960
Uncle, will you take the great state exam this time?

392
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,550
No, he needs to farm. He has no time to study for the great state exam.

393
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:35,380
Is it not your dream to become an Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong, Aunt?

394
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:39,320
Then, Uncle needs to be appointed as a senior first-rank minister.

395
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,840
I changed my dream...

396
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,900
to become a rich man's wife.

397
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,650
So, all my husband has to do is become a jinsa. 
  (Lowest rank for scholars who passed the state exam)

398
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,370
How could your dream change?

399
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:55,300
Technically, my dream did not change.

400
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,170
You heard of the phrase "Wealth and honor," right?

401
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:00,460
Does it not mean you gain much wealth and a high position to become valuable,

402
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,440
so you stand out and your name shines?

403
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,770
Then, do you know why wealth comes before honor?

404
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:12,590
It is because if you are wealthy, honor comes with it.

405
00:42:12,590 --> 00:42:17,850
So, if I became rich, people would honor me. Right?

406
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:21,920
You seem to have become more like Mother, Aunt.

407
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,820
Is that so?

408
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,120
Then that is a good thing.

409
00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:55,770
What is it?

410
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:58,270
Are you having trouble writing?

411
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,920
A writer...

412
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:07,700
supposedly writes well when they are hungry,

413
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,800
but it appears that saying was true.

414
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,290
Because I live a full and content life thanks to you,

415
00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:20,750
I keep wanting to play and am tempted to make excuses.

416
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:24,850
I cannot tell if this is praise or criticism.

417
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,150
Where...

418
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:34,140
Where are you stuck?

419
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,690
Well...

420
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,120
The thing is...

421
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,340
the young madam suddenly fell in love with someone while running away.

422
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,540
But I am wondering how that could be possible...

423
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,160
in such a dire situation.

424
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,380
I see...

425
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:08,750
You will know once you try it.

426
00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:11,970
Gosh, i-in the middle of the day like this?

427
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:14,800
Is not tomorrow the deadline for submitting your novel?

428
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,300
- We have no time to waste. 
 - That is true, but, gosh!

429
00:44:21,570 --> 00:44:25,000

430
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,280
The Ssangyeonsulsa in the novel is so cool, is he not?

431
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,000
He was guaranteed a high position after placing first in the state exam,

432
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,870
but he gave up all that for love.

433
00:44:34,870 --> 00:44:39,330
And it is touching enough that he looked into the death of the princess for 10 years,

434
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,190
but he even drank poison to save the Madam that he loved.

435
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:49,110
Does he not seem like the embodiment of love?

436
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:54,240
But in the end, he was unable to save the Madam.

437
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,640
In the novel, it is said to be a suicide,

438
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,910
but is it true that the mother-in-law killed her?

439
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:02,540
That is probably true.

440
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:06,180
The Left State Minister's estate just has no good energy.

441
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:08,500
That is all a made-up story.

442
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,850
What do you mean?

443
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:14,000
It is obviously the love story between the dead Prince Consort and the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law.

444
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,660
Love, my foot.

445
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:17,620
It is adultery.

446
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:20,530
They were a widower and widow, so how is it adultery?

447
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:22,810
No matter what anyone says,

448
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,620
it is love. Love.

449
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,180
What is that supposed to be?

450
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,390
Are you not tired?

451
00:45:43,390 --> 00:45:45,250
It is heavy.

452
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,730
Wait, your belly?

453
00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:53,790
Are you crazy? It has not even been a month yet!

454
00:45:53,790 --> 00:45:56,750
I am saying your head is heavy.

455
00:45:57,810 --> 00:45:59,950
Dear Wife,

456
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:03,650
are you tired of me now?

457
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,280
Gosh, that is not what I mean.

458
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,980
I was just in the middle of sewing.

459
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:15,730
Is sewing more important, or am I more important?

460
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:18,880
- This moro— 
 - Gosh!

461
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,560
The baby will hear you.

462
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,050
I cannot tell who the baby is.

463
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,720
Are you going to Baekchobang?

464
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,150
I will escort you there.

465
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:48,650
I am fine, so stay with Du Ri.

466
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:50,640
Oh, but still...

467
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,490
Mother, I will...

468
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,070
Mother, have a safe trip.

469
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:06,940
Do you like me that much?

470
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,440
Yeah.

471
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,270
If anyone sees you, they will criticize you for being a simpleton.

472
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,970
Then let them.

473
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:14,790
I am not scared.

474
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,350
I even switched my bride on the wedding day.

475
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,280
I just need to live without being criticized by you, Dear Wife.

476
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:29,980
I miss Yeojudaek.

477
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:37,760
Do you think it was wrong for the two to have met from the start?

478
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,990
Did the two of them not have other people they were meant to be with?

479
00:47:41,990 --> 00:47:43,300
According to the words of virtuous men...

480
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:47,670
Since they just started their debate, I guess they will stay up all night again.

481
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:51,920
We might as well forget about sleeping, too.

482
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,600
I think they are no worse than a match made in heaven.

483
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:56,730

484
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:59,410
I think this story is so cruel.

485
00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,340
I cannot believe both of them died.

486
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:08,080
A novel must have a sad ending to have a lasting impact on people.

487
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:12,080
Still, I like happy endings.

488
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:15,060
Me, too.

489
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:20,620
In any case, do you think the two of them have met yet?

490
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,730
Probably?

491
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:36,060

492
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,490
Someone has already reserved that book.

493
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:42,560
Please put it down.

494
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,260
The Madam's provocative behavior...

495
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:55,940
I guess such absurd novels like this are popular these days.

496
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:57,190
The manservant...

497
00:48:57,190 --> 00:48:59,910
What brings you here?

498
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,800
Well,

499
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,960
I came to meet the bookworm who is stuck in here immersed in books.

500
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,240
I see. Come this way.

501
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,710
Take these.

502
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:37,430
Yes, this way. Please watch your head.

503
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:39,080
Which way do I go?

504
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:41,440
Wow, this is...

505
00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:46,320
Your Excellency, hurry up and come out here.

506
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,600
Someone of high rank is here.

507
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,380
Goodness, you have an illegal space in the back like this...

508
00:50:04,650 --> 00:50:07,850
What brings you to such a lowly place like this?

509
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:11,770
I feel disrespected because I have to look up at you.

510
00:50:11,770 --> 00:50:13,330
Sit down.

511
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,930
Yes.

512
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:20,990
According to Physician Yoo,

513
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:24,950
I heard you are all recovered from your illness.

514
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,090
Should you not start to work now?

515
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:32,700
I still have not fully recovered from my emotional wounds—

516
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:37,150
Everyone lives with an emotional wound or two. Right?

517
00:50:37,150 --> 00:50:39,210
Yes.

518
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,980
Because the world believes you to be dead,

519
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:50,500
I prepared a new identity for you.

520
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,660
Park Moon Soo?

521
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:54,850
He used to be a secret royal inspector,

522
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:58,790
but he met a sudden death after encountering a tiger in the mountains.

523
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,790
- A sudden death? 
 - Yeah.

524
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:04,350
Am I the first person to take Park Moon Soo's identity?

525
00:51:04,350 --> 00:51:08,520
Well, pretty much so. Maybe there were a couple of others...

526
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,730
This is the fifth time.

527
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:13,920
What is with you?

528
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,130
It does not mean that every single one in the past died. So, do not worry.

529
00:51:20,130 --> 00:51:25,210
I mean, it is not like you are going to catch corrupt officials.

530
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,970
Your job is to...

531
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:37,160
go around the eight provinces of Joseon and get rid of old bachelors and old maidens.

532
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:40,950
Are old bachelors and old maidens bandits?

533
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,140
That you would "get rid of them"?

534
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,400
Oh, I am sorry.

535
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,210
How dare you glare at me!

536
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,760
It is me! I am the king!

537
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:56,480
Here!

538
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,910
But I am still...

539
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:06,020
Stop talking about your emotional wound or whatnot in front of your ex-father-in-law.

540
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:08,320
Set off immediately tomorrow.

541
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,160
I even prepared a matchmaker for you,

542
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,770
so go meet with her right away.

543
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,780
She probably waited a long time for you to recover from your illness.

544
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,030
Jeong Woo.

545
00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:29,610
Live a happy life.

546
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,610
This house is...

547
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,500
 This is where I used to live.

548
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,670
 From age 8 to 17.

549
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:34,500
 The weather is perfect for drying out your feelings today.

550
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,040
Your Excellency.

551
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,450
Madam?

552
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,500
What took you so long?

553
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,800
This is probably also a dream. Right?

554
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,760
If this is a dream,

555
00:55:47,670 --> 00:55:50,290
I do not want to wake up.

556
00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:06,380
Your Excellency...

557
00:56:09,330 --> 00:56:12,220
This is not a dream.

558
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,540
This...

559
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:53,440
is too realistic...

560
00:56:57,570 --> 00:57:00,150
Were you alive all this time?

561
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,320
I missed you...

562
00:57:09,320 --> 00:57:12,170
so much.

563
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,060
So, you knew everything, Madam?

564
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,620
His Majesty told me to keep silent.

565
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:41,350
But he told me I would soon be able to see you, so I waited.

566
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:48,590
Then, it was not a dream when I saw you at Baekchobang.

567
00:57:49,510 --> 00:57:53,700
I secretly stopped by because I missed you so much and was worried about you.

568
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:58,320
Wait, then, did His Majesty save you as well?

569
00:58:01,310 --> 00:58:04,190
About 20% of it?

570
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:10,840
 The Royal Investigations Bureau will execute Prince Gyeongwoonjae today.

571
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:15,160
 So, Gyeongwoonjae will no longer be alive.

572
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:20,600
 I am telling you this so it will be easier for you to make up your mind.

573
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:26,810
 Mother.

574
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,160
 I will not die.

575
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:37,640
 You betrayed my son and gave your heart to another man.

576
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,520
 And yet, I see that you easily give up those feelings in the face of death.

577
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,590
 Love is...

578
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:48,960
 not something you prove with your death.

579
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:54,470
 I lived staying true to the person my husband loved,

580
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:57,820
 and I will keep living that way.

581
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:59,960
 So,

582
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:03,160
 just because I like someone else,

583
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:07,220
 that does not mean my love for my husband has changed.

584
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,730
 Who will accept that you think that way?

585
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,870
 Now, you will live with people pointing fingers at you for being a tainted woman.

586
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:21,150
 Even if you smile, people will speak ill of you,

587
00:59:21,150 --> 00:59:26,220
 and if you go around outside, people will mutter how you know no shame.

588
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:31,650
 Rather than living like that,

589
00:59:32,690 --> 00:59:36,250
 would it not be better to die honorably?

590
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:42,250
 I do not care how people look at me

591
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:45,610
 and what they say about me.

592
00:59:46,110 --> 00:59:51,810
 For Geun Seok, for my husband, and...

593
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:54,380
 for His Excellency,

594
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,690
 I must live.

595
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,960
 I knew you were daring,

596
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,930
 but I did not know you were this shameless.

597
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:09,540
 Even if you decide to live such a pathetic life, why should Geun Seok suffer?

598
01:00:09,540 --> 01:00:13,180
 He would live the rest of his life with his mother's scandal following him!

599
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:18,580
 I will die as the daughter-in-law of the Jo family.

600
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:28,850
 However, Jeong Soon Deok...

601
01:01:29,550 --> 01:01:33,340
 will never die because of the family.

602
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:42,560
 If I commit suicide here, it will be clear you killed me here, Mother.

603
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:44,820
 No matter how young, Geun Seok will realize it, too.

604
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:47,560
 And Ye Jin knows everything, too.

605
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,310
 I cannot...

606
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:54,560
 let them live with the pain of hating their family.

607
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:59,460
 The same goes for you, Mother.

608
01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,660
However, I found out later

609
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:29,260
that His Majesty sent a warrior that night to protect me at the earnest request of Crown Prince.

610
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:32,070
And that is why it is about 20%?

611
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:35,230
I heard there was even a funeral.

612
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,720
How did you fool everyone?

613
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,750
I resorted to a makeshift solution.

614
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:44,700
A makeshift solution?

615
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:55,610
 Mother.

616
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:01,650
 Oh, yes.

617
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,400
 Grandmother says I will not be able to see you again.

618
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,660
 Is that true?

619
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:16,170
 It is not.

620
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,650
 Since your mother is alive,

621
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:21,870
 you can see me anytime.

622
01:03:21,870 --> 01:03:24,480
 I knew it.

623
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,700
 Because of your mother,

624
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,490
 you are going through so much, my son.

625
01:03:30,490 --> 01:03:32,400
 That is not true.

626
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:37,030
 I am happy because it feels like you have found your fairy dress with wings, Mother.

627
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:43,240
 So do not worry about me, and help lots of people find their love.

628
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:49,810
 Thank you...

629
01:03:53,570 --> 01:03:55,700
 my son.

630
01:03:58,610 --> 01:04:02,020
 When did you grow up like this?

631
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,660
Then, is Geun Seok at home by himself?

632
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:18,670
No.

633
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:21,430
He is at his aunt's house.

634
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:25,510
And he comes to visit here from time to time.

635
01:04:26,340 --> 01:04:28,960
The only person left in that house alone...

636
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,850
is Mother.

637
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:00,220
I was not wrong.

638
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,350

639
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:25,410
We will now go throughout the eight provinces and find people's matches.

640
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:28,880
I am already getting excited.

641
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,840
Before that, there is something more important.

642
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:37,100
Like what...

643
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:42,850
When shall we get married?

644
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:51,520
Are you hitting on a widowed merchant right now, Royal Inspector?

645
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:55,240
Focus on your work.

646
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,380
I cannot focus on work because I keep thinking about getting married.

647
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:03,400
Then...

648
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,460
before we get married,

649
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:10,230
how about we try courtship?

650
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,240
Courtship?

651
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:17,660
Courtship is what a foolish person who cannot control their own emotions—

652
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:22,680
Do you think anyone in Joseon is more foolish than we are right now?

653
01:06:29,970 --> 01:06:35,440
So, let us try the heart-fluttering romance that we have only read in novels first

654
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,730
