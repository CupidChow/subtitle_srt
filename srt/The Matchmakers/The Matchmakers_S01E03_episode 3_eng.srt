1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,490

2
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,370

3
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:23,360

4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,950

5
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,950

Are there naive people who still believe Joseon is a kingdom?

6
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,080

Joseon is a country of nobles.

7
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:32,790
The reason is that kingship is continued through blood, not competence.

8
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,220
Collective intelligence is the answer to chaotic ages like ours.

9
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,240

10
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,440
Joseon is clearly a country of women.

11
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,540
A clan is like a tree that lasts hundreds of years.

12
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:00,180
So, its roots must be strong in order for it to prosper.

13
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,010
I believe a clan's women are what form the roots hidden underground.

14
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,610
Therefore, no matter the crisis, if a clan's women stand their ground,

15
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:15,760
that clan will never fall.

16
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:23,430
This is why I believe Joseon is a country of women.

17
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,240

(Folktale goddess who recognizes lovers)

18
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,920
Hwa Rok was the youngest of the old maidens? How interesting.

19
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,020
I told Hwa Rok— I mean, Lady Sam Soon not to worry about anything.

20
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,120
But I am worried because I was wayward with that Young Lord last time.

21
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:56,860
They must be the desperate ones since even the Chief Royal Secretary is requesting you.

22
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,530
Right? I am not lacking in any way. Right?

23
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,020
Yes, that is right.

24
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,400
Gosh, it's so hot! You should've told me.

25
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:13,460
 Has a lot of money. All right.

26
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,860
Tell him to come in person and buy them.

27
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,460
You can just hand it over to us.

28
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,960
Oh, this is all for your good.

29
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:25,210
I would be fine, but it might cost your life if you get involved with him.

30
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,720
Nothing good will come out of getting involved with him.

31
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,540
Madam, you should let this matchmaking go.

32
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,750
All the more reason to accept it.

33
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,980
That headstrong and crazy noble is more than likely

34
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,110
to marry them off to any old bachelors by force,

35
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,400
saying it is a royal decree, just like Lady Sam Soon said.

36
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:54,080
It's one thing if I didn't know. But I can't sit back after finding out.

37
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:04,500
I will match the old maidens.

38
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,510
That is the first thing you are going to say.

39
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:10,490
You can do it.

40
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:14,630
No matter how rude he speaks, just focus on Lady Sam Soon's marriage.

41
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,610
It's fine. Right away—

42
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,030
I will apologize first right away. I'm sorry about last time.

43
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,470
I will match the old maidens!

44
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:37,240
- However, I have conditions. 
 - Since you agreed, the conditions—

45
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,600
They actually get along, and it makes me anxious.

46
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,400
You should sit down here and continue.

47
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:56,810
I will state my conditions since you agreed to match them.

48
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,530
The wedding must take place before June, and according to the king's order, you will notify me

49
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,820
the matchmaking process in advance so I can accompany you for each process.

50
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:09,170
Lastly, the partners must be chosen from this list.

51
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:15,320
Out of this outdated list of old bachelors?

52
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,310
Why is everyone saying it is outdated just from looking at the cover?

53
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,420
 Are you saying that an outdated list of old bachelors is a list of good matches?

54
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,740
Hanseongbu stopped keeping track of old bachelors and maidens after the Year of Black Snake.

55
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:34,310
This means this list was created at least two years ago.

56
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:39,960
Yes, right here. Take a look right there.

57
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,240
Kwanhundong's Hyun Bin got married last year. His son's first birthday party was last month.

58
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,740
The mayor pretended to be busy when he did not even update the list of old bachelors.

59
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,360
The moment I get appointed, I will redo the entire system of Hanseongbu!

60
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,760
So the groom just has to be an old bachelor, not necessarily from this list.

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,780
Summarizing the conditions, the timeline is in two months, only the old bachelors are allowed,

62
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,770
and I do every step with you, Sir.

63
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,740
- Is that it? 
 - That is correct.

64
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,830
I will tell you my condition, then.

65
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,340
Since I am the matchmaker, follow my matchmaking method without any objections.

66
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,470
What you are saying is that I have to follow your order. Right?

67
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:26,360
Rather than my order, it means I will lead since I am the expert.

68
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,470
That is the same thing.

69
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,410
Is that so?

70
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,890
He's totally fallen for her.

71
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:41,280
The signing fee is to be paid in advance.

72
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,830
I heard from the Chief Royal Secretary.

73
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,380
One hundred nyang per person, so a total of 300 nyang.

74
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:52,500
Of that, 150 nyang is the signing fee. The rest will be paid on the day of the wedding.

75
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,960
 I meant 100 nyang for all three with Chief Royal Secretary.

76
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,770
 But 100 nyang per person? They are complete fools.

77
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,370
What is it?

78
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,340
Alas!

79
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,280
Sign the papers first!

80
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,830
If all the weddings do not take place by the end of May,

81
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,640
you will have to pay back twice the signing fee you received.

82
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,090
Do you understand?

83
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:29,930
I am Yeojudaek, the goddess of matchmaking.

84
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,550
Failure is not an option for me.

85
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,090
The matchmaking will begin after meeting the maidens in person.

86
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:43,870
So let us make the plans and schedules at the inn after three days.

87
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:46,610
Why is it three days later, not tomorrow?

88
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:50,140
I have a match I need to finish first.

89
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,910
Now, then.

90
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,790
Put this somewhere safe so we don't lose it.

91
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,640
Yes.

92
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,010
You will come to my house tomorrow. Right?

93
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,120
I said I am not coming.

94
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,340
Yeojudaek, you are being really weird.

95
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,590
You went to Madam Kim's house in my place.

96
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,800
Is he the same as her?

97
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,560
Left State Minister's house is off-limits.

98
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,690
Are you scared of my family, by any chance?

99
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,760
Is it the rumor about my mother killing the oldest daughter-in-law, making it into a suicide,

100
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,970
and receiving the Virtuous Woman's Memorial Gate?

101
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,190
You married that family's son knowing all of that?

102
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,500
My goodness, crazy. All of those rumors are lies.

103
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,400
You didn't hear the next rumor?

104
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,010
I did. The scary story of the madam in Left State Minister's annex.

105
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,330

106
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,750
 The madam was possessed by the ghost of the oldest daughter-in-law,

107
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,910
 banging her head against the wall to get out of the annex all day.

108
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,850
So, her forehead bleeds and shows the bone underneath.

109
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,440
Seriously. I am not even shocked anymore.

110
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,300
My forehead is totally fine, as you see.

111
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,300
Rumors are always 99 percent lies.

112
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,870
I need to go on a work trip to Hamgyeongdo's merchant guild soon—

113
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,250
You said that would be next month!

114
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,440
Yeojudaek, do you know how weird you are acting right now?

115
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,010
I don't think this is about the rumors about my family.

116
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,880
There's something, huh?

117
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,490
 Are you mad?

118
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,000
 How could you agree to go there?

119
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,350
 Jo Young Bae—

120
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,910
 I mean, what if you run into the Left State Minister?

121
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,500
 He thinks I died eight years ago, so he would not even recognize me.

122
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,690
 Making a big deal and having our keen Madam find out who I am through her reasoning or whatever...

123
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,930
 That's scarier for me.

124
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,740
 That sure is scary.

125
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:29,010
 I don't even want to think about it.

126
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,180
 Still, be careful!

127
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,540

All right. This thing right here

128
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,200
is worth half a sack of rice.

129
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,280
W-What is that?

130
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:46,310
Do you know what I had to go through to get these foundations?

131
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,280
Whoa, you can tell how valuable they are at one glance.

132
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,310
Hey, hey! Do not touch them.

133
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:54,240
Just look at them. They are so valuable.

134
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,580
- How petty. 
 - What do you mean, petty—

135
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,980
W-What are you doing right now?

136
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,250
Is this woman the one who made this foundation?

137
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,080
I got it from a gramps who makes porcelain in Gojipyeong, so I don't know.

138
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,820
Where is that place?

139
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,880
You were here.

140
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,350
I thought you were not coming, and I was getting worried.

141
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,080
Let's hurry in. Mother is waiting for you.

142
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:58,660
Mother, Peddler Yeojudaek has arrived.

143
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,820
You can go back to the annex now.

144
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,210
Mother, I would also—

145
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,250
If a widow converses with a merchant,

146
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,770
bad rumors spread unnecessarily.

147
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,410
Yes.

148
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,410
Just do as you practiced.

149
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:43,150
If you are a merchant in Hanyang,

150
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,150
you must know my family does not hire matchmakers for marriages.

151
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:52,360
But you insisted on matching for us, so I called you over for your courage.

152
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,390
At least, let me hear you out on which family he is from.

153
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,800
Oh, my goodness!

154
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,270
I asked you to break off the marriage.

155
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:12,570
How could you bring another marriage?

156
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,990
Breaking off a marriage with another one is the basics of matchmaking.

157
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,000
You just don't like the Deputy Minister's son, but you are going to marry someone. Right?

158
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,970
Well, that is true, but...

159
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:31,110
What is this? Is there a young master you are seeing?

160
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,250
What the heck?

161
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,880
Why would I risk ruining my life by engaging in lowly dating?

162
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,250
True. You are at an age where you are torn between

163
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,040
getting married and enjoying your freedom more.

164
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,420
But this young master is really decent. You will regret it if you miss him.

165
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,010
You know I care about looks. Right?

166
00:13:55,010 --> 00:14:00,160
Of course I do. This young master is handsome, even though he is good at studying.

167
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,970
However, he is also surprisingly kind.

168
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,790
This is really difficult to achieve.

169
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,660
Sunkyungkwan's chancellor, His Excellency Lee, wishes to marry his son and your daughter.

170
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,550
Wait, you're supposedly a matchmaker.

171
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:22,780
Don't you even know the chancellor is my family's political enemy?

172
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,590
My mother probably will not accept his son.

173
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,120
It looks like you do not know your mother as much as I do.

174
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,670
She will probably allow it.

175
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,360
Mother has a macroscopic perspective, just like me.

176
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:40,600
I do not think you are unaware that my family and theirs are political enemies.

177
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,220
Are you certain His Excellency Lee's wife was the first one to mention the marriage?

178
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:52,220
This is their son's sajudanja. 
  (A traditional letter containing the "Four Pillars": hour, date, month and year of birth written in Chinese characters)

179
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,490
I can tell why everyone calls you the goddess of matchmaking.

180
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,190
This is my daughter's sajudanja.

181
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,510
Keep it a secret until the day of the wedding and

182
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:13,600
I will give you the date for the wedding after Buddha's Birthday, so stop by then.

183
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,820
I sometimes enjoy my naps out here.

184
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,420
Your father used to join me from time to time.

185
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:40,910
Your father was a difficult subject but a great friend.

186
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,380
Just the way you are right now.

187
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:52,280
You no longer have to worry about

188
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,280
the marriage of old maidens, for I hired a skillful matchmaker.

189
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,140
Worry? Why would I worry?

190
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:03,480
You are the one who has to worry about failing.

191
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,910
I am worried?

192
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:11,290
Worried...

193
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:18,130
 It was decided Ye Jin will marry the oldest son of Sunkyunkwan's chancellor.

194
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:22,920
The chancellor is on the Chief Royal Secretary's side, the Namjang Party. Is he not?

195
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,210
That is true, but he is morally sound and knowledgeable.

196
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:29,950
So a lot of our side's young scholars also respect him.

197
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,140
If such a person was to become a figure on our side,

198
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,880
he will be a great support for Prince Jin Seong.

199
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,660
I am sure you have done a great job already, Sister.

200
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,700
Prince Gyeongwoonjae?

201
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:54,780
Prince Gyeongwoonjae must believe appeals alone are not enough to get out of being a prince.

202
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,330
He seeks His Majesty's presence often these days.

203
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,070
He could have an ulterior motive.

204
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,270
So what, even if he does?

205
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,550
Prince Gyeongwoonjae is definitely on our side.

206
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:15,610
The most definite people will also become our biggest foes if they turn their backs.

207
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:32,460
Sister-in-law, please stop moving around. I am getting dizzy.

208
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,260
You are dizzy from the alcohol, not me. Stop drinking now.

209
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:44,320
She should have mentioned it by now if she is going the day after tomorrow.

210
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,780
Mere rain like this one would not stop her from going. Right?

211
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,330
Which family are you matching this time to be so anxious?

212
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:58,600
Do not be surprised.

213
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,350
I am matching the daughters of Master Maeng from Namsan Village.

214
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,300
The old maidens?

215
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,210
Which one?

216
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:12,190
Don't tell me... Is it the first one who is said to be possessed by a virgin ghost?

217
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,620
No, all three of them.

218
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,400
Wow!

219
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,080
Can you really match all three?

220
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
Of course, I am the goddess of matchmaking.

221
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:27,030
For that to happen, Mother has to go to Temple Seonhwa tomorrow.

222
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:29,830
But why is she still quiet?

223
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,650
O-Oh my goodness.

224
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,960
My, Geun Seok!

225
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,230
What brings you here this late at night?

226
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,540
Could it be you were scared of the thunder when you are 12 years old?

227
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:53,550
You came to protect your mother and aunt, in case we were scared of the thunder. Right?

228
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,790
That is correct.

229
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:59,450
But why are you standing there? Hurry up and come to Mother.

230
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,690
Protect, my foot. He came because he was scared.

231
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:11,740
A scholar does not fear such things as thunder.

232
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,810
It's okay.

233
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,930
Should I tell you an old story?

234
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,980
Yes, please.

235
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,810
Which story should I tell you?

236
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:29,290
I should tell you about the frightening story about the fairy and the woodcutter.

237
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:32,120
How is "The Fairy and The Woodcutter" scary?

238
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,480
They break up in the end.

239
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,270
 Young Madam, Madam asks you to come over!

240
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,700
Yes! I guess she is leaving as planned.

241
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:55,180
A long, long time ago, a woodcutter lived deep in the mountains.

242
00:19:55,180 --> 00:20:00,490
One day, he helped a deer escape a hunter's pursuit.

243
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,180
 Mother, this is Geun Seok's mother.

244
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,280
You may come in.

245
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:29,150
I will be at Temple Seonhwa until Buddha's Birthday to get the date for

246
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,160
Ye Jin's wedding date, starting tomorrow.

247
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:36,480
- Yes, Mother. 
 - On the second day, Kim from Mapo will be here.

248
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,110
Give him a total of eight mals of rice. Seven mals for payment, and one mal for his meal. 
  (1 mal = 8 kg)

249
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:44,340
As for seafood, take in a lot of sea cucumbers and

250
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,990
take in dried abalone, blue mussels, cod roe, and conches.

251
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,590
Take 10 yellow croakers, but check to make sure they are full of roe.

252
00:20:55,590 --> 00:21:03,340
Also, take an ample amount of yeast since we need to brew peach flower liquor.

253
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,160
Take good care of our home while I am gone.

254
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,930
When you come to Temple Seonhwa on

255
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:15,530
Buddha's Birthday, dress Ye Jin and Geun Seok in new clothes.

256
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:17,370
Yes, Mother.

257
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,300
You, too.

258
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,910
I must dive into matchmaking starting tomorrow,

259
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,230
I'll get done with all the chores today.

260
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,890
- Let's go. 
 - Let us.

261
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,320
 Hurry up and do it!

262
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,190
 Gosh.

263
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:50,820
 Hey, why the hell do you do your jobs poorly?

264
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,160
Hurry up and go.

265
00:21:54,850 --> 00:21:58,320
He said it is somewhere around here.

266
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,380
I-Isn't that the place?

267
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,850
I have a terrible feeling about this.

268
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:09,340
Let's hurry up. Quickly.

269
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,720
Innkeeper Hong sent some people here. What should I do?

270
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,700
Tell them to come in.

271
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,920
Does he even know what thegeumjam poison is? 
  (Golden silkworm)

272
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:48,470
Poison that does not leave any trace.

273
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,530
You don't seem to be an interpreter.

274
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,360
You speak the Ming Dynasty's language well.

275
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:58,850
You must have done this work for a long time since you speak Joseon's language well.

276
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,150
And if I have?

277
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,630
I wondered if anyone had looked for geumjam poison in the past.

278
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:10,560
You have a lot of unnecessary questions for a merchant.

279
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,280
Are you going to buy or not?

280
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,500
Even if you are a merchant from the Ming Dynasty, do you know who I am—

281
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,440
We will buy it.

282
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:35,160
Do you want to get hurt here? Let's buy it and leave!

283
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:39,270
This is very tough to obtain.

284
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,770
You are a lucky one.

285
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:57,550
Why did you buy this?

286
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:03,190
The symptoms of the geumjam poison in a medical book from the Ming Dynasty I read recently was

287
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:07,180
way too similar to Princess' symptom eight years ago, so I was looking into it.

288
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:10,650
Since we have it, if we analyze this poison's composition—

289
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:13,390
Your Excellency, please stop this now.

290
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:19,410
Princess was not poisoned to death. She suddenly died from an unknown cause.

291
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,470
As expected, there wasn't much to prepare.

292
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,230
We were right not to prepare too much food. Right?

293
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:36,050
Yes, how did you know our number of guests would go down all of a sudden?

294
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,190
Mother went to the temple.

295
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:41,820
More than half of our guests are staying only because of Mother,

296
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:44,340
so, of course, they would leave.

297
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:47,060
They probably rushed to Temple Seonhwa together,

298
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,460
- wondering which rope to grab. 
 - Gosh.

299
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,370
The nobles' lives are not so easy.

300
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:57,550
If Mother is not here, there are fewer guests and I have less work to do.

301
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,060
Only if all 12 months of a year were like Buddha's Birthday,

302
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,750
being a daughter-in-law would not be so bad.

303
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,170
Oh, right. The Defense Minister is here.

304
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,980
What?

305
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,930
Uncle is here when Mother is not?

306
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:20,670
It was very expensive to get since it has been eight years.

307
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:24,430
Just remember, I am the one who made it possible.

308
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,780
By the way, I heard the queen cooks herself, so will you feed it—

309
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,830
Why do you assume and rush ahead without even knowing better?

310
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,320
What do I not know?

311
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,040
It will be used on Crown Prince—

312
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,100
I was waiting for your talk to be over.

313
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,920
I wanted to ask if Uncle will stay for dinner.

314
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,330
Because Mother is not here.

315
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,060
I will be leaving soon, so I do not need dinner.

316
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:19,140
I understand.

317
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,120
I think she heard our talk. Will it be okay?

318
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,890
It does not matter.

319
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,410
She would not even know what we were talking about.

320
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,020
But still...

321
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,020
You should just worry about yourself.

322
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,570
 Not a single person had a reason to poison Princess.

323
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,550
Sir!

324
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,730
W-Why are you coming from that way?

325
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,210
Does it matter which way I come from?

326
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:03,850
Did you come out alone today without a servant?

327
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:07,850
I have you as my servant.

328
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,670
Why are you laughing?

329
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:18,620
I have only seen young masters and women ride donkeys.

330
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,170
I have never seen a full-grown scholar ride one.

331
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:27,530
My orabeoni— Anyhow, every adult I know rides horses.

332
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,960
That is what is called the error of hasty generalization.

333
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,710
Sorry?

334
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:40,430
Something that comes out of thinking your shallow experience is the universal element...

335
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:46,030
Forget it. I did not expect you to understand, so just lead the way now.

336
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,180
Yes, yes.

337
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,030
You! Are you drunk or something?

338
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,830
He should look ahead when riding a horse.

339
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:24,710
You should get on now. Gosh.

340
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,570
The day is hot. Perhaps we should not have left the donkey behind.

341
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:53,850
I just did not feel like bringing it, so do not worry.

342
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:55,900
Sure, sure.

343
00:29:55,900 --> 00:30:01,020
It was all farmland when I went up to the peak of Mt. Mokmyeok with Orabeoni before,

344
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,290
but they have houses even up to this point now.

345
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,090
This path was so pretty back then.

346
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:12,840
It is because the incompetent mayor thoughtlessly developed random areas.

347
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,570
Is that so?

348
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,360
Shoo, shoo!

349
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,850
Are you scared of puppies?

350
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,830
I am not scared of them!

351
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:47,260
Dogs are instinctively prone to attack when you move more, so I was staying still!

352
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,380
Y-You don't even know anything.

353
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,880
My goodness. You have no idea.

354
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,780
What is he saying?

355
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:03,900
That's a scaredy cat for you.

356
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,910
Slow down a little.

357
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:10,370
How are you so energetic? My gosh...

358
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,190
Do we have anything to drink—

359
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,660
Are you okay?

360
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,090
I am not!

361
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,440
I think my ankle broke!

362
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,620
- Take it off. 
 - W-Wh...

363
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:29,080
T-Take what off?

364
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,390
Your socks. I must look at your ankle.

365
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,570
It's fine.

366
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:38,380
I can just check in with the physician later— What are you doing right now?

367
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:43,090
I don't think it's broken.

368
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,180
I know it, too. My ankle is only sprained.

369
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,940
I will take care of it, so get away from me, please!

370
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,770
I learned how to treat sprained ankles from Orabeoni!

371
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,800
Oh, there.

372
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:07,180
Did it hurt that much?

373
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,000
You will feel better soon.

374
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,970
Do you think I did not know how to do that?

375
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:14,050
I was not even prepared emotionally.

376
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:17,640
How can you be so careless, even if you are an uneducated merchant?

377
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,910
Please get away!

378
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,810
Why are you so angry?

379
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:28,090
You are lashing out without a reason, just like Resentful Man.

380
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:32,410
What did you just say?

381
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,010
Oh, my! Gosh, I am sorry.

382
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:39,280
For comparing you with Resentful Man, Prince Gyeongwoonjae, the scumbag.

383
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,130
S-Scumbag?

384
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:43,980
You haven't even met Prince Gyeongwoonjae, though!

385
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:47,370
Having entered the wedding with Princess means it's been sealed.

386
00:32:47,370 --> 00:32:52,900
Isn't he a scumbag to claim the marriage void like a pathetic man would?

387
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,250
A scumbag. What a word choice.

388
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:01,320
- Sorry? 
 - There is a clear class difference between you and me.

389
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:05,230
So maintain three footsteps of a distance from now on.

390
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,540
Sure, sure.

391
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,260
Do answer only once. It bothers me!

392
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,920
Sure! Hurry up and come.

393
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:32,700
Stop glancing over awkwardly and say what you need to say. It is bothering me a lot.

394
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,240
Setting up three maidens would be possible within two months,

395
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,200
but wouldn't having weddings be too much?

396
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,850
For nobles, it is customary to marry off the next child six months after the older one marries.

397
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:55,710
Did you think I started without knowing that?

398
00:33:55,710 --> 00:34:00,290
I will make all three of them get married on the same day at once.

399
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,870
Joint wedding?

400
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,080
Sounds great. How did you come up with that idea?

401
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:10,280
The old teachings say the oldest child needs to be married first,

402
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,680
but they never said they could not be married simultaneously.

403
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,850
So, it is not against the customs of the nobles.

404
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,440
More importantly, weddings are held at the bride's home.

405
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,920
So, a joint marriage is proper for sisters.

406
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:26,170
You are very clever in many areas, perhaps because you are an inspector.

407
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:30,880
I am a very intelligent and knowledgeable person.

408
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,120
 This guy acts cute sometimes, just like Geun Seok.

409
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:40,390
The marriage pressuring plan you practiced is going smoothly. Right?

410
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:44,060
The third maiden should have left the inn by now.

411
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:46,260
Do not worry.

412
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,830

This is the original copy written by Hwa Rok.

413
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,580
Thank you.

414
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,750
By the way, you promised I would get to meet the author when the second volume is out.

415
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:08,040
Why are you trying to meet the author?

416
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:12,710
Many madams asked to meet with gifts in their hands.

417
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,130
But a scholar is a first.

418
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:19,980
In Hwa Rok's writing, the impossible always happens, contrary to your expectations,

419
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,500
but each one is justified, making you feel excited.

420
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,560
It has relieved me from my real worries,

421
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,080
so I wanted to express my thanks in person.

422
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,540
How great.

423
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,080
Meow!

424
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,320
I see!

425
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:44,160
There he comes, just in time!

426
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,290
Where?

427
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:04,940
You wanted to meet me?

428
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,920
Hwa Rok?

429
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,520
I also wanted to meet you, Scholar.

430
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:18,170
I heard you always buy the original copy of my books at a high price.

431
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:22,570
Could I ask you for an autograph?

432
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,330
Of course.

433
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,830
What is your name, Scholar?

434
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,300
My name is Jeong Soon Goo.

435
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,540

436
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,220
Seeing your handwriting, I can tell you are really Hwa Rok.

437
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,570
I am arresting you for the charges of criminal manslaughter of Lee Cho Ok.

438
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
Oh, boy...

439
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:10,740
The house is too small for three couples to marry at once.

440
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,540
You said it was an important order from the king, but I guess you never came here.

441
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:21,130
That is what you call "Tak Sang Gong Sang," right?

442
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,710
It is not Tak Sang Gong Sang. It is Tak Sang Gong Ron. 
  ("Armchair theorizing" or "empty discussion on the table")

443
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,540
It was "Tak Sang Gong Ron" and not "Tak Sang Gong Sang," I see.

444
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:34,320
Please do not use vocabulary you do not know.

445
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,100
You look so ignorant.

446
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,210
Still, I won't make the same mistake twice.

447
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,620
And do not smile like that. It is quite annoying.

448
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,590
Why is my smiling annoying...

449
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:51,450
And do not mutter, either.

450
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,240
I told you I am not interested in a marriage, so why did you come to my house?

451
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,270
 Judging by her beauty, she must be the firstborn, Lady Ha Na.

452
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:09,890
I want to meet your mother and talk with her, so please let her know.

453
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:12,500
I will let her know.

454
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:19,650
As we have heard, she is firm in her desire not to marry.

455
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:22,300
There are three major lies that have existed for a long time.

456
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,800
That an old man wants to die quickly, that a merchant is selling an item at a loss,

457
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,680
and that an old maiden does not want to marry.

458
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,210
It is not that she does not want to marry,

459
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:34,920
but she was picky, trusting her pretty looks, and missed her chance.

460
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,000
How could someone called the "goddess of matchmaking" not know that?

461
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,340
That seems like a hasty generalization error.

462
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,050
What did you say?

463
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,580
I am good at comprehending things, so I learn and apply things well.

464
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:00,120
She says she will meet with you. Please come in.

465
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,020
Mother, a royal inspector and a matchmaker came together.

466
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,250
I am unable to see.

467
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:28,110
Royal Inspector, you have something to say to me?

468
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,160
I came to help your unmarried daughters get married.

469
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,130
I will take care of preparing their partners and dowry, so you do not have to worry.

470
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,650
You came in vain.

471
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:49,320
My daughters are not interested in marriage

472
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,510
and I do not intend to force them.

473
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:55,760
What nonsense is that?

474
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,870
What does not make sense to you?

475
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:03,090
If a woman does not get married past a certain age, their resentment will lead to plagues.

476
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,700
- For example, the current drought— 
 - It rained two days ago.

477
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,440
It was not enough to end this drought.

478
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:17,810
My daughters personally chose to be unmarried, so they hold no resentment.

479
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:21,800
Thus, they are not responsible for this drought.

480
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:28,760
Madam, it is the natural duty of a woman to marry a husband and have children.

481
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:32,610
May I ask why you are neglecting your daughters?

482
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:37,390
What do you mean, neglecting? I am merely respecting my daughters' wishes.

483
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:43,880
Also, I think it is more dutiful for my daughter to take care of their widowed blind mother,

484
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:49,760
rather than for them to marry and serve a stranger in their in-laws.

485
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,030
Now that you know my daughters do not need matchmaking, please go back.

486
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:56,230
Well, Madam—

487
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,270
Please see the guests out. I am tired.

488
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,060
Yes, Mother.

489
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,080
You should get up.

490
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:24,310
- Gosh, seriously. 
 - I will not follow you out very far.

491
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,420
Did your mother become senile—

492
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:30,140
How could you say such an insult in front of her daughters!

493
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:34,370
You crazy bastard! Did you say my mother is senile?

494
00:42:34,370 --> 00:42:39,010
 The sensational badmouth seamstress, the second daughter, Maeng Du Ri.

495
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:40,920
Crazy bastard?

496
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:45,100
The Bukchon geezer?

497
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,850
"A man and a woman should be separated"?

498
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,550
Lady Sam Soon is coming. Do not misspeak.

499
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,730

500
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:26,160
Hwa Rok is the third of the old maidens?

501
00:43:29,670 --> 00:43:33,190
Goodness, look at the state of our nation, Joseon...

502
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:36,380
It is indecent that a virgin wrote an erotica novel.

503
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,970
But she also pretends to be a man?

504
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:43,790
She had no choice since people would not pay a fair price for a novel written by a woman.

505
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:47,560
A woman should not be writing novels in the first place.

506
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,750
The distinction between men and women! The duties of men and women are distinct!

507
00:43:51,750 --> 00:43:55,230
So, are you saying you cannot do it?

508
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,660
Will you report Lady Sam Soon to Hanseongbu and cancel this wedding?

509
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,950
Forget it.

510
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,780
Marrying off Maiden Sam Soon is the

511
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:15,470
fastest way to restore the Three Bonds and Five Relationships. 
  (Confucianism principles)

512
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:19,440
Tell me the plan you were talking about earlier.

513
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:28,040
As expected of a nobleman, he found a reason pretty quickly.

514
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:36,200
What brings you here, Hwa Rok?

515
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,280
I should be asking you why you are at my house.

516
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,740
Pardon? Only a widow and her daughters live here.

517
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,060
What do you mean by your house, Scholar?

518
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:55,540
Come now! How dare you dress like a man and write a novel that mocks noble class?

519
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:58,750
I will report you to the government office right away!

520
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:08,720
Inspector, sir. It appears she did this to earn money to support her disabled mother.

521
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:12,690
Could you let it slide just this once?

522
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:16,630
If it were to be a good daughter, I would give her a chance.

523
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,730
What do you mean by giving her a chance?

524
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,510
If all three sisters actively cooperate in getting married,

525
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:25,110
I will not report her.

526
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,370
I will actively cooperate.

527
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,990
Me too...

528
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:33,850
Me too.

529
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,410
Great work, everyone.

530
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:39,960
Shall we try it one more time naturally?

531
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,590
Let us do it.

532
00:45:47,550 --> 00:45:50,550
Hwa Rok. What brings you here, Hwa Rok—

533
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:57,480
Why is she not doing as practiced?

534
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,340
I know.

535
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,250
What brings you here?

536
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:20,080
Did not a short scholar with a fair face come running here?

537
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:22,930
I did not see anyone.

538
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,290
You did not see anyone, either, right— Where did she go?

539
00:46:27,090 --> 00:46:29,310
W-Where did she go?

540
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,760
Why did my orabeoni come here?

541
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,660
 I must search inside the house.

542
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,850
Why would he search here?

543
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:44,770
Who's there?

544
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:50,950
Madam, I am the matchmaker who came with Inspector.

545
00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:54,810
I got lost, and I am about to leave now.

546
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,320
 I am screwed.

547
00:47:06,010 --> 00:47:08,500
What is it?

548
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,280
I was looking for the culprit who escaped to this house.

549
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,240
I may be blind, but there is no one else here besides that merchant.

550
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:47,000
W-Well... the thing is...

551
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,260
My apologies.

552
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,590
Did he just...

553
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:02,210
not recognize his own younger sister?

554
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:09,440
Well...

555
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:16,050
Stop this! Only women live here.

556
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:21,830
The way you are suddenly stopping me is suspicious.

557
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:22,810
What are you saying?

558
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:26,870
Even the Bukchon geezer says he did not see a fleeing man.

559
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:33,980
I did not see him either, so you should stop now.

560
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:36,260
Is something the matter?

561
00:48:57,750 --> 00:48:59,950
Who are all these people?

562
00:49:35,010 --> 00:49:39,370
If you want to see it that badly, check quickly and get lost!

563
00:49:51,390 --> 00:49:53,270
I have checked everything I wanted.

564
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:56,520
I will go back for now. I apologize for bothering you.

565
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:09,930
I thought he was different since he was investigating the real murderer of Lee Cho Rok.

566
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:15,700
But he's just a thoughtless cog in the system, I see.

567
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:21,420
You should also stop bothering us and go back, Inspector.

568
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,410
Since all three daughters are here, I have something to say to you.

569
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:36,140
My sisters feel the same way I do, so do not waste your breath.

570
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:39,020
Once you hear what I have to say, you will change your mind.

571
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:46,280
Is that not so, Hwa Rok, the one who was chased by an officer of Hanseongbu?

572
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,550
Damn.

573
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,110
I will go over it again.

574
00:51:13,110 --> 00:51:17,020
All of you must cooperate with me in getting married by May.

575
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:20,180
What will happen if you do not cooperate?

576
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,140
I remember everything I have been told once.

577
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,240
Do not ask again.

578
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:31,680
But, Inspector, what if the wedding plans are screwed even though we cooperate?

579
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,130
That will not be our responsibility. Right?

580
00:51:33,130 --> 00:51:35,600
Screwed...

581
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,430
Using harsh words like that in itself is uncooperative behavior!

582
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,350
You should speak more gently—

583
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,170
Gosh, damn it!

584
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,940
This is who I am! What do you want from me?

585
00:51:57,130 --> 00:51:59,290
Where did everyone go?

586
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,410
 This is who I am! What do you want from me?

587
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,970
What is the matter?

588
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:11,520
Where were you?

589
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,150
I am asking them to cooperate with their wedding.

590
00:52:15,150 --> 00:52:18,400
Cooperate, my foot. This is blackmail.

591
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,480
That is true. To think a scholar would resort to cheap tactics

592
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,870
like blackmailing us to marry against our mother's wishes and incite undutiful behavior.

593
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:28,770
I am so angry and displeased.

594
00:52:28,770 --> 00:52:31,400
Cheap? Incite undutiful behavior?

595
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,770
I received permission from Madam to set you all up.

596
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:45,360
Mother permitted you to set us up?

597
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,850
- No way! 
 - You can confirm with your mother.

598
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:50,670
I will introduce myself first.

599
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:55,720
I am Yeojudaek, who will be responsible for your satisfactory wedding.

600
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:00,860
Right! You are the famous goddess of matchmaking, Yeojudaek.

601
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:04,300
Please take good care of us.

602
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:08,760
What do you mean? It is your fault we ended up in this mess!

603
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,890
 I've confirmed the faces of the firstborn, second, and third daughters.

604
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:18,040
I never thought Lady Sam Soon would come while being chased by an officer.

605
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:22,930
I never thought the three daughters of Master Maeng would be so weird.

606
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:26,490
You did well to threaten the ladies to report Lady Sam Soon

607
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:29,590
as I told you to, though I was not there.

608
00:53:29,590 --> 00:53:32,670
As you can tell by now, I am good at everything.

609
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,380
But are you sure you will be able to marry all of them off?

610
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:37,960
Of course.

611
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:43,370
Since you said you would report Lady Sam Soon, Lady Ha Na and Lady Du Ri will cooperate.

612
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:45,480
It is pretty much a done deal.

613
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,900
Not only that, my orabeoni—

614
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,190
no, I mean...

615
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,320
the officer was chasing Lady Sam Soon...

616
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:56,950
they all believed that you would report her, so things worked out.

617
00:53:56,950 --> 00:54:00,820
You seem so well-versed in such deception.

618
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:05,460
It is more of a matchmaking technique rather than deception.

619
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:08,320
Oh, right.

620
00:54:12,870 --> 00:54:15,640
You said you are very smart. Right?

621
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,320
That is right. I am the smartest man in Joseon.

622
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:23,200
Then, do you know who Ssangyeonsulsa is?

623
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,470
She is a mountain goddess from Goryeo folk tales who is capable of recognizing lovers.

624
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,320
You really know everything, Sir.

625
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,420
If there is anything you do not know from now on, ask me.

626
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:39,110
Then, please find out more about Ssangyeonsulsa in detail.

627
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:41,400
Why?

628
00:54:42,170 --> 00:54:44,190
 My apologies.

629
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,670
 Did he just...

630
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:53,260
 not recognize his own younger sister?

631
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:10,770
 Madam, I am Yeojudaek, who does matchmaking in Hanyang.

632
00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:17,330
 It may seem like I am bragging, but madams in Bukchon call me the goddess of matchmaking.

633
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,870
 When I match up a couple, they love each other deeply and have many children,

634
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,400
 so families with daughters—

635
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,000
 Are you trying to say you are Ssangyeonsulsa or something?

636
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:31,510
 I do not know what Ssangyeonsulsa is,

637
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:36,380
 but I am saying I can find the right partner for your daughters.

638
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:37,890
 Forget it.

639
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,570
 If all my daughters marry, who will take care of me as a blind person?

640
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,990
 Why would you...

641
00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,310
 say something you do not really mean?

642
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:58,530
 What happened five years ago?

643
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:03,200
 Madam, you had wanted your daughters to marry like everyone else.

644
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,800
 What do you know that you dare speak like that?

645
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,730
 Seeing the seal on the wood duck painting hanging there,

646
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,010
 it was painted in the Year of the White Rabbit.

647
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:17,950
 Did you not buy it for your firstborn daughter's wedding five years ago?

648
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:22,580
 Praying your daughter will live a happy wedded life.

649
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:30,710
 The government is undertaking this marriage to eliminate old maidens,

650
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:35,630
 so the longer you hold off, the ladies may end up marrying partners who are not a fit for them.

651
00:56:35,630 --> 00:56:38,210
 I want to prevent that.

652
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:43,480
 By chance, three years ago,

653
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,230
 did you act as a matchmaker between the Ha family and the Ahn family?

654
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,540
 Yes, that is correct. It is one of my most proud matches.

655
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:53,210
 They are of different parties.

656
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,210
 How did you think to match them up?

657
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:02,390
 They were such a good match that I could not help but set them up.

658
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,030
 You may not believe me right away,

659
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:11,700
 but I can see if a couple is a good match or not.

660
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,310
 I will ask you one more thing.

661
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:19,540
 Why are you lying about your identity and doing the lowly work of a matchmaker?

662
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:32,110
 Your silence gave me the answer I wanted.

663
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:42,600
 I leave you in charge of the matchmaking for my daughters.

664
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,070
Ssangyeonsulsa is a figure from folk tales,

665
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,820
so it may not be a real person.

666
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:52,200
But it may also be a real person.

667
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,440
Because I feel like I am Ssangyeonsulsa.

668
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,550
It is an important matter to me, so please find out for me.

669
00:57:57,550 --> 00:58:02,770
Forget it. I have no time for that when I am already busy matchmaking for old maidens.

670
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,630
All right.

671
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:08,650
I will look into it myself once these matches are wed.

672
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:11,330
Then, I will be going first.

673
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:16,860
Wait! You have not told me anything about the matchmaking plan for the old maidens.

674
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:19,330
I will tell you that when we meet in two days.

675
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:24,150
Come to the library in the merchants' inn at the same time as today.

676
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:28,040
Gosh, geez.

677
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,230
She is just a merchant, so why is she always so busy?

678
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:57,100
This is where you were, Ssangyeonsulsa.

679
00:58:58,790 --> 00:59:02,360
I feel like I also saw it in a Goryeo song.

680
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,240
It was here.

681
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,800
My incredible memory...

682
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,760
It has been a while since I have seen you here.

683
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:28,460
Crown Prince, what brings you here at this hour?

684
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,010
This is the library of the East Palace.

685
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,260
What brings you here, Prince Gyeongwoonjae?

686
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:37,950
Did you not read all the books here already?

687
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,300
I had something to research in Goryeo's books.

688
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,230
Ssangyeonsulsa?

689
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:54,460
She is a magician who can recognize lovers and is a godlike figure.

690
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:58,970
It is related to the work His Majesty entrusted me with, so I was gathering info on it.

691
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:02,040
She is quite an interesting goddess.

692
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:06,910
If there is a Ssangyeonsulsa, will she find a match for me, too?

693
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:14,180
The Queen's Palace will decide your wife through a selection process.

694
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:19,060
Ssangyeonsulsa may be a fictional figure made up by ignorant people.

695
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:20,980
What do you mean, ignorant people?

696
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:23,950
The will of the people is said to be the will of Heaven.

697
01:00:23,950 --> 01:00:26,560
Even if marriage is for producing an heir,

698
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:31,670
everyone wants a good spouse, whether it be me or the people.

699
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:42,060
 The Ssangyeonsulsa, who were once very influential until Goryeo, were usually women.

700
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:46,740
 Thus, they started disappearing after entering the Confucian Joseon age.

701
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,360
 One out of every 10,000 people are born with the ability to recognize lovers.

702
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:55,710
 These people who had this special ability existed in every era,

703
01:00:55,710 --> 01:01:00,290
 and they started being called Ssangyeonsulsa since the Silla age.

704
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:14,390
I found out why I keep going around recklessly to find matches for people.

705
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,440
Even before I got married, I helped set up many couples.

706
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,740
Even though I did not see it, I believe you.

707
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:25,940
But even now, I am matching up people despite the risks I take.

708
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,960
You said you do it for money.

709
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,050
No, no.

710
01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:33,940
I must be...

711
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,430
Ssangyeonsulsa.

712
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:38,770
What is that?

713
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:44,210
I will look into it more,

714
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:47,910
but it's supposedly a mountain god who can recognize lovers.

715
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:50,930
It is so cool. Right?

716
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:55,980
That is why I was so hung up over matchmaking. It was my fate.

717
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:02,450
I worried whether I may be abnormal for getting involved in others' romance so much.

718
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:05,880
But that was because I was Ssangyeonsulsa.

719
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:10,950
Ssang-yeon-sul-sa!

720
01:02:10,950 --> 01:02:13,990
Even the name is so cool!

721
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,180
She drinks too much these days.

722
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:26,640
Is she worried about something?

723
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:39,490
 Please watch over my Ye Jin until she gets married.

724
01:03:03,850 --> 01:03:06,820
You watch over her, Dear Husband.

725
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:11,070
Why are you asking me?

726
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:14,350
 Ye Jin likes you.

727
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:23,390
Lady...

728
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:28,290
likes me because she likes you, Dear Husband.

729
01:03:58,830 --> 01:04:02,010
Why did you leave so soon?

730
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:06,540
Why were you in such a rush?

731
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,300
All right. Come this way.

732
01:04:46,570 --> 01:04:48,880
What is all the commotion?

733
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,950
Why are you dropping these off at our house?

734
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:00,010
We are just doing the errands for the matchmaker.

735
01:05:00,010 --> 01:05:02,330
Yeojudaek?

736
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,630
I am sorry I am not Yeojudaek.

737
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:12,210
The Defense Minister says he will take the eldest daughter of this house as a mistress.

738
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:15,350
Did you just say the Defense Minister?

739
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:21,200
Yes. Though it is as a mistress, he hired a matchmaker like me.

740
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:24,480
The newly-wed house is a newly built tile-roofed house in Pil-dong

741
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,930
and he even sent two servants.

742
01:05:26,930 --> 01:05:31,150
These conditions would have even young maidens lining up for it.

743
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:34,350
Still, she is a noblewoman. Being a mistress is a bit...

744
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:37,700
With the nasty rumors about her, she is lucky to get married as a mistress.

745
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:39,770
How dare you talk of a wedding without my permission!

746
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:44,830
Goodness, I came thinking everything was already spoken for.

747
01:05:44,830 --> 01:05:47,280
I guess not.

748
01:05:47,950 --> 01:05:51,390
I cannot permit this marriage, so go back.

749
01:05:51,390 --> 01:05:53,000
Arrest the criminal!

750
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,910
 Yes, sir!

751
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:56,140
Did you just say criminal?

752
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:58,780
- My mother is a criminal? What are you doing? 
 - Move aside!

753
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:00,150
- Mother! 
 - Let go of me.

754
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:01,900
What do you mean Mother is a criminal?

755
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,000
Mother! Mother!

756
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:09,580
Your Excellency!

757
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:12,680
Gosh, why are you making such a fuss?

758
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:16,610
The old maidens' mother got arrested yesterday and taken to Hanseongbu.

759
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,720
Suddenly? For what crime?

760
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,100
Madam refused the Defense Minister's offer to take her daughter as a mistress.

761
01:06:25,290 --> 01:06:28,910
The firstborn daughter was 24 years old. Right?

762
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:30,920
Since she cares so much about being a dutiful daughter,

763
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:34,480
she will end up becoming the Defense Minister's mistress.

764
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:38,540
To think I would see the day when the foolish mayor

765
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:42,120
and the perverted Defense Minister helps me.

766
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:44,450
Let us go to the merchants' inn.

767
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,190
Wait...

768
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:00,490
Gosh, you scared me.

769
01:07:00,490 --> 01:07:02,390
Did you do that, Sir?

770
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:04,260
W-What are you talking about?

771
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:08,930
Due to the law that says if you cannot wed before the age of 24, the responsibility is on the parents.

772
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:13,260
You are making Lady Ha Na become the Defense Minister's mistress.

773
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:18,130
In regard to that, is it not good since the eldest daughter will get to marry easily?

774
01:07:18,130 --> 01:07:20,570
I had my doubts...

775
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:23,760
but it was indeed your idea as expected, Sir.

776
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,920
I am extremely disappointed in you, Sir.

777
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,710
You are disappointed in me?

778
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,620
For what?

779
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:37,890
Since you broke the promise to follow my matchmaking methods first,

780
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:41,970
our matchmaking contract is not in effect as of now.

781
01:07:43,310 --> 01:07:50,680
From now on, I will make sure you cannot fulfill your royal orders.

782
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:05,960
♫  Love is falling again, love is coming to me again  ♫

783
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:09,210
♫  Strange emotions fill me and confuse me  ♫

784
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,980
♫  Because of you, because of you, I've got a lot on my mind  ♫

785
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,880

786
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:20,850
♫  Love is coming to me again, my heart is racing by itself  ♫

787
01:08:20,850 --> 01:08:27,750
♫  Because of you, because of you, I guess this is love  ♫

788
01:08:27,750 --> 01:08:34,790
♫  That day full of sunlight, I still clearly remember that moment  ♫

789
01:08:34,790 --> 01:08:38,870
  Someone wants to take you as his bride. But for a parent to refuse is a felony.

790
01:08:38,870 --> 01:08:40,570
  You will have to pay a pretty high price.

791
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:43,030
  I never thought I would gain something I wanted, thanks to Gyeongwoonjae.

792
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,840
  It is not difficult for you to come up with a justification.

793
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,900
  How much longer do I have to look after you, Hyungnim?

794
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:51,770
  I will definitely resolve this with Lady Ha Na before noon. So please buy some time.

795
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:54,900
 They will not be suspicious of you, either. Do not worry.

796
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,830
  W-W-What...! You wretch!

797
01:08:56,830 --> 01:08:58,480
  Please open the door.

798
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,300
  Do you know how long it takes for a man and a woman to fall in love?

799
01:09:02,300 --> 01:09:05,770
  I am... not the type of a man who will disappoint you.

800
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:11,530
♫  Strange emotions fill me and confuse me, because of you...  ♫

801
01:09:11,530 --> 01:09:20,630

802
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:23,530
