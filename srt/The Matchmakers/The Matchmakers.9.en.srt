(Left Councilor's second daughter-in-law and peddler)

8
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,730
When he asked me to meet at the dock out of the blue,

9
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,399
I was worried he might confess his love to me.

10
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,130
You know, docks give out that sort of feeling.

11
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:09,440
It is like a place to elope.

12
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:11,869
How is it possible...

13
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:16,509
not to know he likes me?

14
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:19,610
I am quick-witted in that field.

15
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,580
Oh...

16
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:23,819
But not me.

17
00:01:25,089 --> 00:01:29,289
I can never forget my late husband.

18
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,368
On the night stars fell from the sky,

19
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:39,398
(Sim Jung Woo, 25 years old)

20
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,530
she told me...

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,368
I was the first man who did not know her name at the inn.

22
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,009
But it was a lie.

23
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,440
This feeling of betrayal was bigger...

24
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:52,080
than the shock that she was a murderer.

25
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,789
Give her money to elope?

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,089
That was the money for the matchmaking.

27
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,918
A man never goes back on his word.

28
00:02:02,919 --> 00:02:06,059
The contract did not state I would not pay if she was a murderer.

29
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,069
I did not report her because...

30
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,069
I do not know!

31
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,739
(Episode 9: My Life Has Been Completely Destroyed)

32
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,449
How much longer did you think you could hide your identity?

33
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,120
What? How did you know?

34
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:35,988
You see...

35
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,789
I was hoping it was not you.

36
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,400
I feel extremely betrayed by you.

37
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,759
Our matchmaking contract...

38
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:46,069
has ended as of this moment.

39
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,999
My lord, I will explain...

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,069
Explain what?

41
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,339
Well...

42
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,180
What sort of an excuse can a murderer make?

43
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:01,448
- Excuse me? - I even told you...

44
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:03,650
I had to matchmake under the King's order.

45
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,949
How dare you fool an inspector?

46
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:09,789
Forget it.

47
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,489
It was my fault for failing to read you.

48
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,530
Never again...

49
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Never again appear before me.

50
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,239
What?

51
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,739
Wait. My lord...

52
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:35,150
- What is this? - The matchmaking balance.

53
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:38,048
What...

54
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,350
Good grief. What a real fool.

55
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,059
Because he still has feelings for you, he is giving you...

56
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,388
the chance to run away rather than reporting you...

57
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:45,929
to the government office.

58
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,460
So, be grateful.

59
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,900
Oh, I forgot.

60
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,370
Everyone thinks of me as Lady Yeoju.

61
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:58,340
By the way, who did I murder?

62
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,840
Why are you playing possum?

63
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,809
Eight years ago, did you not conspire...

64
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,509
to murder the Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang with your husband?

65
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:07,979
A slave hunter even visited the inn to catch you.

66
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,419
Are you talking about the death of the left state councilor's...

67
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,989
eldest son?

68
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,519
Now you are recalling it.

69
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,060
You got your money. Do not come near my lord ever again.

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,929
Catch my eye, and I will report you to the government office.

71
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,070
Dear Lady Yeoju.

72
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,308
There is a slave hunter looking for you.

73
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:39,049
Do not return even after your business.

74
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:41,679
As for Bok Hee, I will make time soon...

75
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,580
and take her to Hamgyeong Province myself.

76
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,760
Did you know about it?

77
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,489
That Lady Yeoju murdered...

78
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,059
my brother-in-law?

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,970
You know better that Lady Yeoju is not a person...

80
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,270
who can kill someone, no?

81
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,039
That is true.

82
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,878
But why is a slave hunter looking for Lady Yeoju?

83
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:12,479
After being falsely accused, her husband died,

84
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:15,048
and just the day before her transfer to Hanyang,

85
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:17,320
she luckily ran away from prison.

86
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,590
That is all I know.

87
00:05:21,359 --> 00:05:24,460
That means the real culprit has not been arrested.

88
00:05:26,729 --> 00:05:27,760
Yes.

89
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:33,100
Where must I go to find out what happened eight years ago?

90
00:05:38,809 --> 00:05:39,869
Do not worry.

91
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,579
It was my first matchmaking job.

92
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,979
So, I simply got help from a professional.

93
00:05:44,179 --> 00:05:46,349
Now that I know the principle and method,

94
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:48,280
I can succeed by myself.

95
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,929
I told you not to worry. And yet, look at your eyes filled with pity.

96
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:00,789
What is it? Tell me.

97
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:06,030
I am worried about your feelings, my lord.

98
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:08,840
My feelings?

99
00:06:09,239 --> 00:06:11,769
Do you think I have personal feelings...

100
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,439
for Lady Yeoju or something?

101
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:18,609
That is absurd! My gosh.

102
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,450
But...

103
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,850
Good grief. My lord!

104
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,650
Wait for me!

105
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,390
Gosh. What...

106
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:31,119
Seriously.

107
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:33,559
My goodness.

108
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,900
Gosh. What is it that you want to ask me this time?

109
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,769
Tell me what happened eight years ago...

110
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:39,900
when my brother-in-law passed away.

111
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,499
So you finally heard of that rumor.

112
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:45,470
What do you mean by "that rumor?"

113
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:49,779
After killing the first daughter-in-law,

114
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,478
Lady Park was punished with a high fever.

115
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:53,978
Gosh, how scary.

116
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,679
I am not talking about that ridiculous rumor.

117
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,890
Do you know anything about my brother-in-law's murder?

118
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,119
Let me see.

119
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,529
It was such a long time ago.

120
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,129
And it happened in Pyongyang.

121
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,668
What I heard was the peddler couple tried to steal silver bullion...

122
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:14,429
but ended up killing him.

123
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,699
A peddler couple killed a government official...

124
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,309
at the government office residence for some silver bullion?

125
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:22,809
It is very strange.

126
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,069
Drawing orchids is the best...

127
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,900
to find peace of mind.

128
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,309
Gosh, nice portraits.

129
00:07:57,910 --> 00:07:59,850
You are a good artist too.

130
00:08:00,049 --> 00:08:01,979
There is nothing you cannot do, my lord.

131
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,558
("Great Learning")

132
00:08:11,559 --> 00:08:13,830
According to Yi I's "Eliminating Stupidity,"

133
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:16,129
when your mind is a mess,

134
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,869
read "Great Learning" to organize one's thoughts.

135
00:08:19,669 --> 00:08:20,700
What?

136
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:41,618
The Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang's murder...

137
00:08:41,619 --> 00:08:42,659
eight years ago...

138
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,488
Yes. The case in which my brother-in-law was murdered...

139
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:47,529
when he was in Pyongyang.

140
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:49,460
Why do you want to know about it now?

141
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,258
Remember rescuing the peddler selling women's items...

142
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:52,768
along the Taedong River...

143
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:55,800
on our way back from Hamgyeong Province after meeting Father?

144
00:08:56,499 --> 00:08:57,570
Soon Gu!

145
00:08:57,869 --> 00:08:59,508
Wake up, lady!

146
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:00,509
Oh, no.

147
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,180
That peddler is the one who murdered...

148
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,749
the Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang eight years ago?

149
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,549
No. She was falsely accused of it.

150
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,080
Where is that peddler right now?

151
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,749
You see...

152
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,720
When my husband passed away,

153
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,460
you know I stayed at our parents' place for a while, right?

154
00:09:21,659 --> 00:09:24,100
Dying was all I could think of every day back then.

155
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,899
I believed I could meet my husband again if I died.

156
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,889
Are you not...

157
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,060
That child.

158
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,330
I was pregnant with her when you rescued me...

159
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:54,800
eight years ago in Pyongyang.

160
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,399
You are pretty, just like your mother.

161
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,749
My husband has passed away.

162
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,690
For who should I look pretty for?

163
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:29,499
Do it for yourself, my lady.

164
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:35,800
I think Lady Yeoju...

165
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,739
is a gift sent by my late husband.

166
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,340
It was since then...

167
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,310
when I started matchmaking using the name Lady Yeoju.

168
00:10:47,149 --> 00:10:48,580
Where is that Lady Yeoju right now?

169
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:50,149
I cannot tell you.

170
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:53,420
But fortunately, she is not in Hanyang.

171
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,619
How did you find out she was the murderer from eight years ago?

172
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,589
I think a slave hunter is after her.

173
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,159
You met the slave hunter?

174
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:03,659
That would have been the better outcome.

175
00:11:04,729 --> 00:11:06,369
Lord Gyeongunjae found out.

176
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,999
Lord Gyeongunjae thinks you are a murderer,

177
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,100
but he let you go?

178
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:15,108
I will take care of that, Soon Gu.

179
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,810
Look into the case from eight years ago.

180
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,949
If Lady Yeoju was framed,

181
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,909
then the real killer is still out there.

182
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,259
Shall I serve your evening meal?

183
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,529
Leave it.

184
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,398
I am yet digesting my morning meal.

185
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,738
You did not eat anything at all.

186
00:11:44,739 --> 00:11:46,839
You could fall ill if you do not eat.

187
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,139
Will you just get out?

188
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,840
I wish to be alone.

189
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,719
I said I wished to be alone.

190
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,989
Why are you harassing me so?

191
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,790
Oh, dear.

192
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,790
From what I see,

193
00:12:08,999 --> 00:12:11,600
you are lovesick.

194
00:12:13,729 --> 00:12:16,399
You knew what condition you had.

195
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,879
Lovesick is a sickness too, so there must be a cure.

196
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:25,148
You cannot see the person you wish to see,

197
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,648
so your mind is filled with thoughts of said person.

198
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:28,978
It is tortuous.

199
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,148
That is the sickness,

200
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:33,148
so other than going to see the person who is the cause,

201
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:34,989
there is no other cure.

202
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,858
There is truly no medicine to help?

203
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:42,358
Leave it. I am fine.

204
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:44,460
A serious condition can kill.

205
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:50,340
If you can... Let me see your hand.

206
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:51,840
This here.

207
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:56,478
The person who stained your fingernail with balsam.

208
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:57,979
Go and see her.

209
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,350
That is the cure.

210
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,450
Soon Duk.

211
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,219
You said...

212
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,420
you could tell at a glance if a couple were a good match.

213
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:12,930
Yes.

214
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,859
Erudite Maeng's second daughter.

215
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,899
Why did you match her with a farmer?

216
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,669
Because they are a good match.

217
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,899
How and why?

218
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,369
What does this sudden interest mean?

219
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:32,509
Well,

220
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:36,220
there is talk the second daughter has a nasty temper.

221
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:38,690
I was curious.

222
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,659
That is what rumors say, but if you meet her in person...

223
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:46,629
She is a lot like you.

224
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,999
She is like me? No way.

225
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:51,429
I only say the right, polite things.

226
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,670
You are opinionated and wise.

227
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,470
The farming bachelor seems gruff on the outside,

228
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,970
but is thoughtful and considerate, so they are a good match.

229
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:05,350
If that were so, he would be a better match for me.

230
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,909
You could not stand that of him.

231
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,220
So do not be too upset.

232
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:18,190
Were you aware, then?

233
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:19,359
Of what?

234
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,600
That you liked the farming bachelor?

235
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:26,369
I had gotten the feeling there was something about him,

236
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:27,969
but then I saw you at the inn.

237
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,700
Congratulations. You are marrying at last.

238
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,409
You will not be an old bachelor.

239
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,350
I found it odd, so I checked the bachelor list.

240
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:42,220
He lived next door to your maternal grandmother.

241
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,450
That is how I found out.

242
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,749
Why did you pretend not to know?

243
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,060
Because your heart is already set.

244
00:14:51,489 --> 00:14:52,560
Is it not?

245
00:14:54,729 --> 00:14:58,499
It might feel extra heart-wrenching because it is not meant to be.

246
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,488
Where are you going when you are not well?

247
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:20,019
To the downtown swings.

248
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:21,789
Why, at the crack of dawn?

249
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,060
Why else would I go but to go on the swing?

250
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:26,429
You are losing your mind now too.

251
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:29,629
I will bring Lady Yeoju to you. Will you pull yourself together?

252
00:15:29,859 --> 00:15:30,960
You will bring her?

253
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,399
Well...

254
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:37,899
This is the money I gave her at the dock.

255
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,639
She left it at the inn with instructions...

256
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:42,479
it be returned to you.

257
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,649
Lady Yeoju is still in Hanyang?

258
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:49,579
You said a slave hunter was at her house and the inn.

259
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,618
She is so popular with the Bukchon ladies.

260
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,889
I bet she is hiding at one of their houses.

261
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,460
- I will find her and... - Forget it!

262
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,889
Why would I meet with a criminal?

263
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:01,189
Cure yourself first!

264
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,628
Physician Yu said you could die if you do not see her.

265
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,430
Why would I die?

266
00:16:06,129 --> 00:16:08,029
I am a better physician than he.

267
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,199
Lovesickness is a matter of the mind.

268
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,638
If I become busy enough I cannot think of Lady Yeoju,

269
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,509
my condition will be relieved.

270
00:16:18,479 --> 00:16:21,149
Oh, dear...

271
00:16:21,409 --> 00:16:23,680
(The swings)

272
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,419
Not like that.

273
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:31,158
I told you to bend your knees when you swing backward.

274
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,159
Backward...

275
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:35,830
Darn it.

276
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,300
It looked easy,

277
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,898
but it is harder to actually do.

278
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:43,769
Do you not wish to marry Lady Ha Na?

279
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,969
I wish to marry her, but...

280
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,970
I am glad I do not have to go on the swings.

281
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,139
I hate high places.

282
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,409
I see.

283
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,748
- I will ride with you. - What?

284
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,219
Getting the feel of it...

285
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,420
will help you overcome the fear.

286
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,989
Crouch. Stand.

287
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,460
Crouch. Stand.

288
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,800
- Crouch. - Enough.

289
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,060
It is not enough. Crouch.

290
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,428
- That is enough. We can stop. - Stand.

291
00:17:13,429 --> 00:17:15,468
- I know what to do now. - Crouch.

292
00:17:15,469 --> 00:17:16,999
- Please stop! - Crouch.

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,509
- Look. - I said stop!

294
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,069
The two men on the swing.

295
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,138
Stand.

296
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:22,179
Is that not Lord Gyeongunjae?

297
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,809
Stand.

298
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:26,010
- He looks very happy. - Stand.

299
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,949
- Do you have a sword? - A sword?

300
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,618
I do not have one.

301
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:32,850
To think I am not surprised even to see such a sight.

302
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,289
- My goodness... - Please stop.

303
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,618
I must walk with my eyes closed.

304
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:38,958
- Very well. - Lead the way.

305
00:17:38,959 --> 00:17:40,858
- Stop! - This is the way to learn.

306
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:41,929
Stop!

307
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,899
The King's nanny's house?

308
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,039
Very well.

309
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:53,638
The matchmakers are saying Lord Gyeongunjae...

310
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:57,609
might be able to marry off the old ladies within May.

311
00:17:57,879 --> 00:17:59,010
All three of them?

312
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:00,480
Oh, right.

313
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:03,378
The person helping Lord Gyeongunjae...

314
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:06,619
is Lady Yeoju who made Lady Ye Jin's match.

315
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:14,129
I heard you have decided on the bachelors.

316
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,260
The grooms' families will send gifts after the May Festival.

317
00:18:18,199 --> 00:18:19,429
I was concerned...

318
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,840
my daughters would never find husbands.

319
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,570
Thank you.

320
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,139
Were you...

321
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,010
a secret matchmaker just like myself?

322
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,480
I could not help that I could see who were a good match.

323
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,480
Right.

324
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,619
It is hard to ignore a good match when you see one.

325
00:18:40,649 --> 00:18:41,989
Do you also...

326
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:45,020
see a string connecting people that are made for each other?

327
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:46,729
Pardon?

328
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,729
Some Agents of Love hear a sound,

329
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,429
and some feel a certain energy.

330
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,570
I wonder how you recognize a match.

331
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,040
I rely on deduction.

332
00:19:01,669 --> 00:19:05,550
Can you tell if you are an Agent of Love?

333
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,580
You cannot help but know.

334
00:19:09,379 --> 00:19:10,850
Once you get the feel,

335
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:14,419
they keep coming to mind that you must bring them together.

336
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,020
Am I wrong?

337
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:20,730
I cannot help but bring them together, but...

338
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,368
You tried too hard.

339
00:19:27,369 --> 00:19:28,739
(Ssireum)

340
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,770
Goodness.

341
00:19:30,699 --> 00:19:32,340
Must we do this?

342
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:35,780
It is not easy to win a woman's heart.

343
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:40,179
Teach this man how to compete.

344
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,878
I cannot take on a novice right away.

345
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:47,250
I need someone else to help him learn first.

346
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:51,719
I read up on the rules and skills, so I am no novice myself.

347
00:19:56,359 --> 00:19:58,699
Should it be me, then?

348
00:20:01,629 --> 00:20:05,510
May I volunteer myself as an opponent?

349
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,070
I wish to compete in the May Festival match,

350
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:10,340
but I have only watched and never competed.

351
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,780
You are the young man from Bukchon who I saw dating in broad daylight.

352
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,379
Do you know me?

353
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,990
Whatever. Only I am smart enough to remember.

354
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:25,429
You two can train, then.

355
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,359
Ready!

356
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,570
Is this your first time trying?

357
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,128
Begin!

358
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,638
- Come on. - Use your leg to...

359
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:38,639
- Swivel your hips. - Use your strength.

360
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,240
You are a master of the sport.

361
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:54,919
I am the only novice here, then.

362
00:20:58,060 --> 00:21:01,730
You just sit here and watch the women wash their hair?

363
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,060
I am so jealous.

364
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:07,530
I am afraid of heights,

365
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:10,139
so I am not sure if I can do this on the day.

366
00:21:10,399 --> 00:21:13,368
Constant exposure to heights will help you overcome the fear.

367
00:21:13,369 --> 00:21:15,539
Starting today, come here twice a day...

368
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,080
and look down at the stream.

369
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,379
Oh, did I tell you about the wedding day?

370
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:25,949
I asked an officer I know well at the Office of Astrology,

371
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,520
and May 25 is an auspicious day that comes around every 300 years.

372
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,688
Couples who marry on that day are blessed for three generations,

373
00:21:32,689 --> 00:21:34,289
so I earmarked that day for you.

374
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:35,958
What do you say about that?

375
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:38,459
If the Office of Astrology says so,

376
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,929
there is no doubt.

377
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,609
I do not care...

378
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:47,510
whatever the date may be.

379
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:52,209
However auspicious the day may be,

380
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,619
the 25th of next month is too soon.

381
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,289
Your family lives in the country, right?

382
00:21:59,290 --> 00:22:00,320
Yes.

383
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:04,290
Must I say this, then?

384
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:06,789
While searching for your matches,

385
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:08,830
I had the Office of Astrology read your fortunes.

386
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,830
You, Bachelor 12.

387
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,600
If you do not marry before June this year,

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,600
you will not find another match for seven years.

389
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:20,169
In seven years time...

390
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:22,679
I will be almost 40.

391
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,279
I thought again,

392
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,448
and if I hire an express courier,

393
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:32,619
I can contact my family within five days.

394
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:35,419
There is no reason I cannot marry on May 25.

395
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:37,459
It will work.

396
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,929
My lord, you did very well.

397
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,699
I am good at anything I learn once.

398
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:58,409
Darn you.

399
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,480
You...

400
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
Darn it.

401
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,820
I can forget her.

402
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:10,418
I can forget her. I can do it.

403
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:12,260
- I can erase her. - What...

404
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:14,129
I can erase her.

405
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,270
Please speak.

406
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:33,209
I spoke with an officer I know well at the Office of Astrology,

407
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:36,280
and May 25 is an auspicious day that comes around every 300 years.

408
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,290
Couples who marry on that day are blessed for three generations,

409
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,189
- So that day... - What a quack.

410
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,990
Three generations will be blessed for marrying on a good day?

411
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:45,419
Lord Inspector.

412
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,060
I hope you did not pay to hear that nonsense.

413
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,530
Of course not.

414
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
He is not that clueless or naive.

415
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:00,409
Did I not say...

416
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,980
the ladies would not care for astrology?

417
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:06,409
Did you forget?

418
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,020
What took you so long to come?

419
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,590
Do you know how hard it was, doing everything on my own?

420
00:24:18,719 --> 00:24:19,730
My gosh...

421
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,359
Not again.

422
00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:23,060
I am seeing things again.

423
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,530
My lord.

424
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,669
Why do you not work with Lady Yeoju?

425
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:36,439
Are you crying?

426
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,689
I did not cry!

427
00:24:50,419 --> 00:24:52,689
I shed a tear because something got into my eye.

428
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:56,159
Anyway, the wedding will be held next month on the 25th.

429
00:24:56,429 --> 00:24:57,500
Be prepared.

430
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:08,409
What the...

431
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:09,679
My lord.

432
00:25:12,609 --> 00:25:14,510
- He cried? - He really did.

433
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,590
A man should not cry too much.

434
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,929
The inspector just left in tears.

435
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,859
In tears?

436
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:32,429
He said something got into his eye, but...

437
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,830
We got it. You can leave now.

438
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,040
I am not yet done speaking with Lady Yeoju.

439
00:25:42,439 --> 00:25:43,439
Okay.

440
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:51,949
The wedding will happen...

441
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:54,590
next month on the 25th?

442
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:55,990
Yes.

443
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,590
I cannot accompany the inspector due to personal reasons,

444
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:03,230
but I ensure your daughters will be married on time.

445
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,129
Which family...

446
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:07,929
are you from?

447
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,740
I will keep your secret. Do not worry.

448
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,949
I am the left state councilor's second daughter-in-law.

449
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:26,350
I thought so the day we first met.

450
00:26:27,689 --> 00:26:28,689
I was right.

451
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,020
You know me?

452
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,230
You are the last match...

453
00:26:33,889 --> 00:26:36,560
I made before I lost my sight.

454
00:26:37,199 --> 00:26:40,629
I did not meet my husband through a matchmaker.

455
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,199
You two.

456
00:26:42,939 --> 00:26:45,100
Did you not first meet at a book rental shop?

457
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:31,419
Young master.

458
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,389
Someone awaits you in the book rental shop.

459
00:27:42,699 --> 00:27:43,730
Me?

460
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:55,740
You were such a good match...

461
00:27:56,209 --> 00:27:57,939
that I had to bring you together.

462
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:11,919
At the time,

463
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:15,790
I had no idea it would be my last match...

464
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,399
as an Agent of Love.

465
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,919
My husband was the match for me.

466
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:41,750
So to you, I am just a passing breeze.

467
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,290
So please,

468
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,760
do not suffer much because of me.

469
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:24,600
If all three of them are not married within May,

470
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:28,399
you must return double the down payment.

471
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,169
Do you understand?

472
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,369
To wish us success, we should chant the operation name.

473
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,550
I do not wish to admit it,

474
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,590
but Lady Yeoju...

475
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,419
destroyed my life completely.

476
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,800
Why are you here so early in the morning?

477
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:09,240
You know the Agent of Love too?

478
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,540
I thought only my mother knew.

479
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:13,209
Put this down...

480
00:30:13,810 --> 00:30:15,949
and explain why you are here.

481
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,250
I am tired.

482
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:21,520
Why did you and Lady Yeoju fight?

483
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,290
Is she in a position to fight me?

484
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,129
I told her to drop the matchmaking due to complications.

485
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:35,129
So until the wedding happens, I will handle everything myself.

486
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,399
No.

487
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:38,569
When you came by,

488
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:41,310
Lady Yeoju was with my mother informing her of the wedding date.

489
00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:44,080
The day I was at your house,

490
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:46,949
Lady Yeoju was also there?

491
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,218
You did fight.

492
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:52,149
You are avoiding each other.

493
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:56,520
If this is about your pride and ego,

494
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,419
since Lady Yeoju will come again today,

495
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:00,858
you should feign ignorance and come,

496
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,158
and apologize and make up.

497
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,928
Why should I apologize...

498
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,898
when she is in the wrong?

499
00:31:05,899 --> 00:31:06,969
You miss her.

500
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,669
Enough to shed a tear.

501
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:23,080
My lord.

502
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,320
Where...

503
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,990
It will get cold.

504
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:40,830
Where is he if he is not here either?

505
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,100
I cannot stand...

506
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,679
That man is here again.

507
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,480
Hey.

508
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:55,949
I heard you are looking for Lady Yeoju.

509
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,179
Do not come here. Visit the old ladies...

510
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,789
Go to Erudite Maeng's in Mount Nam Valley.

511
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,119
Lady Yeoju is finding matches for the daughters.

512
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,100
Why is he so solemn?

513
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,609
To turn first eye contact into fate,

514
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:25,678
you will play on the swing, watch the ssireum match,

515
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,448
and wash your hair with water boiled with sweet flag...

516
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:28,550
during the May Festival.

517
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:31,679
They are things we always do on the day of the May Festival.

518
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,449
Why did you say that in such a determined tone?

519
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:36,189
This time, they require special skills.

520
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,218
Doo Ri. After watching the ssireum match,

521
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:40,829
you will give jehotang to Bachelor 24.

522
00:32:40,830 --> 00:32:41,959
(Jehotang: A summer beverage made with herbs and honey)

523
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,529
Well done.

524
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,229
- Nice. - That was good.

525
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,799
- Look. - What is that?

526
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,139
- Oh, my. - Look at them.

527
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,070
- My gosh. - Oh, my.

528
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,540
I am getting goosebumps.

529
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,579
It is already making me cringe.

530
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,148
But a promise is a promise. You have to do it.

531
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,149
Okay.

532
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,080
I feel so sorry for myself.

533
00:33:07,219 --> 00:33:10,060
Sam Soon, you will wash your hair in Suseongdong Valley.

534
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,929
I told Lady Yeoju that I wanted to wash my hair that day.

535
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,888
I always wanted to wash my hair...

536
00:33:15,889 --> 00:33:17,959
in Suseongdong Valley before I got married.

537
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Sam Soon.

538
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,368
Shall I tell you how you can do everything you want to do...

539
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:25,938
before you get married?

540
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,240
Yes, tell me.

541
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,679
Do not get married.

542
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:34,979
Washing hair in Suseongdong Valley...

543
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,448
requires the most difficult skill to master,

544
00:33:36,449 --> 00:33:39,179
so we should practice hard starting today.

545
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,389
Yes, I am totally ready.

546
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,790
What shall I do first?

547
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:44,090
Well...

548
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:46,990
Let me change this water first and tell you.

549
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,230
It is really clean.

550
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,869
- You got this, right? - Yes.

551
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:16,360
- Gosh. - Look at this.

552
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,690
- My gosh. - You need to run.

553
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:21,690
The slave hunter is coming for you.

554
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:23,029
What?

555
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:24,960
A slave hunter?

556
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,830
Hide in that room.

557
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,468
Go inside, quick!

558
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:33,469
- Hurry. - Gosh.

559
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,139
You cannot go in there.

560
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,380
Well, why not?

561
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:47,520
Who are you?

562
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,489
Who is this?

563
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:55,330
I am fine.

564
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,060
I am not worried about you.

565
00:34:57,299 --> 00:34:59,059
Do not cause trouble for my master by getting caught...

566
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,670
by the slave hunter before the wedding.

567
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,100
My goodness.

568
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,869
This room is not safe either.

569
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,509
Yes, hide in there.

570
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:09,469
Come on, quick. Go on in.

571
00:35:15,909 --> 00:35:17,219
Wait.

572
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,719
Do not get the wrong idea.

573
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:22,619
I am doing this to survive.

574
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:26,060
I will leave the room.

575
00:35:26,659 --> 00:35:29,290
No, wait. Where are you going?

576
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,429
He said the slave hunter was outside.

577
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:34,369
Do not behave recklessly.

578
00:35:57,719 --> 00:35:59,659
Do you feel pain in your chest again?

579
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:01,560
I should just see you and die...

580
00:36:03,699 --> 00:36:05,460
if not seeing you will kill me anyway.

581
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:25,779
Who is that stranger?

582
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:29,319
How dare you barge in here?

583
00:36:30,619 --> 00:36:32,089
Before I report you to the government office,

584
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,960
- you should leave at once. - I am looking for someone.

585
00:36:37,259 --> 00:36:38,699
No, Lady Yeoju...

586
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,529
is not here.

587
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,839
At the inn, did you not say you did not know Lady Yeoju?

588
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:52,580
Oh, that was...

589
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:54,549
Well...

590
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,119
That day, I was...

591
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:09,429
Step aside, or you will get hurt.

592
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,460
There is no one in this room. I swear.

593
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:15,199
Who is causing such a commotion in my home?

594
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Mother.

595
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:23,940
I saw Lieutenant Jung on my way home.

596
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:25,710
I will go and get him.

597
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,520
I suppose today is not my day.

598
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,960
Gosh, that really scared me.

599
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:43,360
Good job, lying about seeing Lieutenant Jung.

600
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:45,730
It was not a lie.

601
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:48,600
I really saw Lieutenant Jung on my way home.

602
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:51,139
You saw Lieutenant Jung in the village?

603
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:55,069
No, I have already forgotten everything.

604
00:37:55,469 --> 00:37:57,580
I will fall for Bachelor 24.

605
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,040
No.

606
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,449
I have already fallen for him.

607
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:02,650
Why is that slave hunter after Lady Yeoju?

608
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,080
There seems to be some kind of misunderstanding.

609
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,889
Do not make a fuss about it.

610
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:24,069
It sounds like the slave hunter has left.

611
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,119
Why have you not left Hanyang?

612
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:46,290
Because I have not finished my job as the Maeng sisters' matchmaker.

613
00:38:47,529 --> 00:38:49,060
Please turn a blind eye.

614
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,230
Then I will leave as soon as my job is done.

615
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,500
Goodness.

616
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,540
You are a murderer,

617
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,839
yet you wish to be loyal?

618
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:05,540
I do apologize for lying to you about my situation,

619
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,279
but I never murdered anyone.

620
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,279
I was framed for the murder.

621
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,619
If you wish to continue your job as their matchmaker,

622
00:39:16,589 --> 00:39:17,860
stay at Gyeongunjae.

623
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,588
What do you mean?

624
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:22,889
I heard you could not even go home because of the slave hunter.

625
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:27,469
There is a place where I can stay safely, so do not be concerned.

626
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,730
I am proposing the idea because this is killing me.

627
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,299
I am doing it for my sake.

628
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,469
If I told you that I was lovesick...

629
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:39,409
because I had fallen in love with you, would you believe me?

630
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:59,059
Seeing you as often as I can...

631
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,400
is the only cure for my lovesickness.

632
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,270
If such a talented, smart man like me die because he cannot see you,

633
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:06,569
it will be a great loss for Joseon.

634
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,169
My lord, I...

635
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:10,639
You said you were framed for the murder,

636
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,980
so I will not ask you about your past.

637
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,380
And I will take care of the slave hunter.

638
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
All you have to do...

639
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,119
is come to Gyeongunjae.

640
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,730
I will not go to Gyeongunjae.

641
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,690
What?

642
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,029
Why not?

643
00:40:33,299 --> 00:40:34,299
Because...

644
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:39,699
I do not love you.

645
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,509
Well...

646
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:46,909
So...

647
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,380
you do not like me?

648
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:53,919
Do you truly want to see me die...

649
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,290
from my lovesickness?

650
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:56,690
My lord.

651
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,029
Are you not the smartest and the most upright scholar in Joseon?

652
00:41:00,759 --> 00:41:02,889
So, I firmly trust that you can and will...

653
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:04,960
overcome your lovesickness.

654
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,440
My gosh.

655
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:22,650
I will be leaving, then.

656
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,179
Please let Lady Cho know that I will visit again another time.

657
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,150
Sure, be safe.

658
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,230
Who are you to be so sure that I can overcome it?

659
00:41:48,469 --> 00:41:49,469
Please excuse me.

660
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,810
Gosh, my lord! Are you all right?

661
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,619
Of course, he is not all right.

662
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,919
The way Lieutenant Jung rejected me...

663
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,049
is nothing compared to this. She flat out rejected him.

664
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,060
Sam Soon.

665
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:08,489
Did you get rejected?

666
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,299
No, that is not what happened.

667
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:16,230
My lord, my mother wishes to speak with you.

668
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,380
You must have been very surprised to see the slave hunter in your home.

669
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,350
I will make sure it never happens again.

670
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:31,179
I heard from my daughter that Lady Yeoju was in a pickle...

671
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,080
due to some kind of misunderstanding.

672
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,889
It is okay, so you need not be concerned.

673
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:41,860
May I ask you why you trust Lady Yeoju so much?

674
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:46,158
She is the Agent of Love who can recognize...

675
00:42:46,159 --> 00:42:47,670
soulmates who are fated to be together.

676
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,799
Does the Agent of Love never sin?

677
00:42:55,369 --> 00:42:57,080
I wanted to speak with you today...

678
00:42:58,139 --> 00:42:59,638
to remind you that Lady Yeoju...

679
00:42:59,639 --> 00:43:01,449
was the one I hired as my daughters' matchmaker...

680
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,350
and to ask you to just quietly watch without meddling.

681
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:10,089
His Majesty ordered me to take care of this.

682
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:12,318
Hence, I cannot stay out of it.

683
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,659
Then only work.

684
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:17,659
Turn off your feelings for Lady Yeoju.

685
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,900
The two of you cannot be together.

686
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:26,199
You, of all people, should know that.

687
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:30,639
Most importantly, forcing someone to like you...

688
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,179
is not love.

689
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
So you do not like me?

690
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:53,529
Do you truly want to see me die from my lovesickness?

691
00:43:54,569 --> 00:43:55,569
He will not...

692
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,040
actually die because of it, will he?

693
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:02,569
No way.

694
00:44:03,369 --> 00:44:05,210
He is just a crybaby.

695
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,119
Who is a crybaby?

696
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,179
Gosh, you scared me.

697
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:15,589
What are you doing here?

698
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:20,488
Goodness. Why do you keep wiping the floor?

699
00:44:20,489 --> 00:44:22,560
I wanted to slack off, but I cannot even rest in secret because of you.

700
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,060
Oh, boy.

701
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,699
How much did she hear?

702
00:44:30,699 --> 00:44:32,600
Where are you going at this hour?

703
00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:34,139
I am going to the Ministry of Law Enforcement.

704
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:35,838
The Ministry of Law Enforcement? Why?

705
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,880
I must look into the murder of the Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang.

706
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,880
But...

707
00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:46,319
She flat out rejected him, so I was hoping he would give up.

708
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,619
He clearly has not given up.

709
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:49,889
My lord.

710
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:58,229
Lord Gyeongunjae, what brings you here?

711
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:00,329
I need to look into something.

712
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,330
Bring me the interrogation records...

713
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,838
on the Jo In Hyun case from the Year of the Rat.

714
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:05,399
(Gongcho: Interrogation records)

715
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,639
That is...

716
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,048
A lieutenant from the Capital District Office...

717
00:45:15,049 --> 00:45:16,610
asked for those records first.

718
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:17,980
What should I do?

719
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:27,759
Why are you looking into the case from eight years ago?

720
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,699
I do not think I am obligated to answer your question.

721
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:34,829
Did Lady Yeoju ask you to look into the murder...

722
00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:37,569
of the Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang from eight years ago?

723
00:45:39,569 --> 00:45:40,969
That look on your face tells me that she did.

724
00:45:41,069 --> 00:45:42,709
Then you must also know that Lady Yeoju...

725
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,080
was the main culprit in the case.

726
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,009
It appears that she was framed for it,

727
00:45:49,110 --> 00:45:50,520
so I am trying to look into it.

728
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:54,388
What is your relationship with Lady Yeoju...

729
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:55,919
that you are doing all this for her?

730
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,389
I saved her life in Pyongyang eight years ago.

731
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:02,229
When Lady Ha Na sounded the petitioner's drum,

732
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,060
you said you did not know Lady Yeoju.

733
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:05,929
That must have been a lie, then.

734
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:12,339
I wish to ask you something too.

735
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,509
I know that you are a man of principle.

736
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:17,939
If you know that she committed a grave crime,

737
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:19,909
why are you looking into it on your own...

738
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,409
instead of reporting her?

739
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,520
I am doing this...

740
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,349
for a personal reason, which is too complicated to explain,

741
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:29,889
so I will not answer your question.

742
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:33,459
However, we seem to share the same goal,

743
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:36,230
so I suggest we work together on this.

744
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,339
I trust that you will take good care of it.

745
00:46:47,009 --> 00:46:48,040
Thank you.

746
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,310
Thank you.

747
00:46:51,509 --> 00:46:54,110
My lady! Lady Jung!

748
00:46:56,779 --> 00:46:58,250
My gosh. Here.

749
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,389
Oh, boy.

750
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:04,560
To Lady Yeoju.

751
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,488
Most ordinary men...

752
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:09,060
would have been destroyed by your cruelty,

753
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:11,198
but since I have been cultivating...

754
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,400
my steadfast spirit as a scholar for the past 25 years,

755
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,869
it could not make me falter.

756
00:47:15,529 --> 00:47:16,830
I should stop beating around the bush.

757
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:18,900
I am sending you this letter...

758
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:22,339
to give you a chance to prove your innocence.

759
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,580
Come to Gyeongunjae tomorrow.

760
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,380
He wants me to come to Gyeongunjae, not the inn?

761
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:40,360
He is probably just using this as an excuse to see me.

762
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:42,830
I had better not go, then.

763
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,830
If he sees me, he will struggle even more to forget me.

764
00:47:52,969 --> 00:47:54,009
My gosh.

765
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,839
Mother, what brings you here?

766
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,580
I heard you went to see the rice paddies today...

767
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,679
and found a small paddy that we had been neglecting.

768
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:08,488
The shape was different from what was specified in the land documents,

769
00:48:08,489 --> 00:48:10,589
so I took a closer look and found the extra paddy.

770
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:13,190
So? What did you do about it?

771
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,730
I let the tenant farmer know that I knew about it...

772
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,368
and told him...

773
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:22,799
to feel free to keep using the extra land.

774
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,440
After doing all that work to find it? Why did you do that?

775
00:48:28,069 --> 00:48:29,568
I looked through the past records...

776
00:48:29,569 --> 00:48:30,678
and learned that there was no difference in the yields...

777
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,710
even without that piece of land.

778
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,379
That extra land must be motivating him...

779
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:37,009
to work twice as hard. That is why I told him to keep using it.

780
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:41,049
I see.

781
00:48:41,889 --> 00:48:45,719
But never forget about that land and be sure to manage it well.

782
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:49,130
I will, Mother.

783
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,699
Soon Gu.

784
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:04,610
You called me here too. What were you thinking?

785
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:09,650
I had no choice. Lord Gyeongunjae said he would report you otherwise.

786
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,020
Gosh, this is crazy.

787
00:49:12,679 --> 00:49:15,449
I am trying so hard to avoid him when I am with the Maeng sisters.

788
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:17,520
Why?

789
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:20,690
What? Well...

790
00:49:20,759 --> 00:49:23,489
Forget it. Go inside, tell him you remember nothing, and come out.

791
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,960
Okay.

792
00:50:04,739 --> 00:50:06,339
Lieutenant Jung, please take a seat.

793
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,540
You too. Take a seat.

794
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,279
I called you all here...

795
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,419
to find the real culprit behind the murder of the Deputy Administrator,

796
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,880
which took place in the Year of the Rat.

797
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,818
Lady Yeoju, you said you were framed for the murder.

798
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,520
Tell us what happened.

799
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:34,299
While on the run eight years ago, I fell into the Taedong River.

800
00:50:35,429 --> 00:50:37,900
I did not die, thanks to Lieutenant Jung who saved me,

801
00:50:38,299 --> 00:50:39,940
but I lost all my memory up until that point,

802
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,009
so I do not remember what happened at all.

803
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:49,480
You lost your memory? I thought it only happened in novels.

804
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:52,778
If you lost your memory,

805
00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:54,619
how could you be so sure that you were framed?

806
00:50:55,549 --> 00:50:57,819
I know Lady Yeoju could never kill anyone. That is why.

807
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,989
I trust Lady Yeoju.

808
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,199
Does she think she is a three-year-old child?

809
00:51:06,429 --> 00:51:09,130
She means she trusts herself. Why did she say it in such a manner?

810
00:51:09,469 --> 00:51:10,839
It made me cringe.

811
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,639
Lord Gyeongunjae, she remembers nothing,

812
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,170
so I believe she may leave.

813
00:51:22,549 --> 00:51:23,610
You may leave.

814
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,400
My lord. I may not remember anything, but it is still my past.

815
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:47,509
If you would allow me, I would like to find the real culprit with you.

816
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:51,009
Suit yourself.

817
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,790
Tell us what you have found out so far.

818
00:52:02,589 --> 00:52:04,520
First, let me tell you what happened.

819
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:12,499
I have been told that Gyeongunjae...

820
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,029
and the Ministry of Law Enforcement...

821
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:17,469
took all the records on In Hyun's case from eight years ago.

822
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:20,469
Lord Gyeongunjae? Why does he need those records?

823
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:21,810
That...

824
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:24,139
I do not know.

825
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,909
But I do not have a good feeling about this.

826
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:30,920
I think something bad could happen if we do not intervene.

827
00:52:35,190 --> 00:52:37,619
Shall I ask So Hyun to think of something so that we can...

828
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,190
send him into exile?

829
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,330
Do you not know that we must keep this from your sister?

830
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,299
Oh, you are right.

831
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,569
According to the records, Deputy Administrator Jo In Hyun...

832
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:56,269
was stabbed to death in his bedchamber...

833
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,339
by an unidentified assailant at midnight on April 30, 8 years ago.

834
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:15,689
Based on the statements of the witnesses,

835
00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:18,429
Jo In Hyun's father Jo Young Bae and his wife, Lady Yoo,

836
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:22,400
Lord Min arrested the prime suspect.

837
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,368
He was a man named Kwang Moo,

838
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:26,368
who supplied the Pyongyang office with goods.

839
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:29,040
It was revealed that he conspired with Jeo Tae Ran, a peddler.

840
00:53:29,469 --> 00:53:32,779
And you were Kwang Moo's wife.

841
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:35,310
Why were they accused of the murder?

842
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:38,520
It was because Jo In Hyun's silver ingots were found in their homes.

843
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,279
No way.

844
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:44,290
How could you be so sure when you remember nothing?

845
00:53:45,219 --> 00:53:47,488
What kind of idiot would murder a government official who works...

846
00:53:47,489 --> 00:53:49,929
at the office that buys goods from him, just for some silver ingots?

847
00:53:52,199 --> 00:53:55,230
Well, good point. It does not make sense.

848
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:59,239
Lieutenant Jung, continue and tell us what you have found out.

849
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,909
Kwang Moo died of an unknown cause before his transfer to Hanyang.

850
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:09,580
Then Tae Ran fled.

851
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:13,480
Because of it, the lieutenant who was guarding them lost his job,

852
00:54:13,719 --> 00:54:15,488
and a wanted poster with a reward...

853
00:54:15,489 --> 00:54:18,589
was distributed all over Pyongyang to catch Tae Ran.

854
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,089
But they failed to catch him even after a year,

855
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:24,259
so they assumed he died while on the run and closed the case.

856
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,600
The slave hunter who is after Lady Yeoju at the moment...

857
00:54:28,969 --> 00:54:30,869
is the lieutenant who lost his job back then.

858
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:57,698
Should you not go out and look for the person you wish to find?

859
00:54:57,699 --> 00:54:59,500
Why have you been sitting here all day?

860
00:55:03,569 --> 00:55:05,400
There is someone I wish to meet,

861
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,469
but it could be the person I am looking for.

862
00:55:08,339 --> 00:55:09,610
I am suddenly afraid.

863
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,509
The drawing of the face you showed me the other day.

864
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,350
Can I see it again?

865
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,759
She is prettier than this.

866
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,130
Do you know this woman?

867
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:41,139
(Hamgyeong Province, the Cheon family's inn)

868
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,549
This letter came for you.

869
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,259
To Lady Yeoju.

870
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,129
A slave hunter is looking for you,

871
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,929
so do not return even after the job is done.

872
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,528
As for Bok Hee, I will make some time...

873
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:09,400
to take her to Hamgyeong Province myself.

874
00:56:09,929 --> 00:56:11,369
From Hong Chun Soo in the Capital District Office.

875
00:56:14,569 --> 00:56:16,440
There are many things wrong about this report.

876
00:56:17,110 --> 00:56:18,540
The strangest thing is that...

877
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,548
Lord Min Seung Kwan, a powerful man in Pyongyang at the time,

878
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:23,409
was the one who found the murderer.

879
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,549
What is strange about that?

880
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,649
Lord Min is a hard-liner from the Namjang Faction.

881
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:31,419
He and Jo Young Bae, the leader of the Dongro Faction,

882
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:33,190
are sworn enemies.

883
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:36,129
It would be more believable to hear that Lord Min...

884
00:56:36,130 --> 00:56:37,830
killed Jo In Hyun.

885
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,559
And the man, Kwang Moo, who suddenly died in the prison...

886
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,969
after being accused of the murder,

887
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:45,339
was like Lord Min's right-hand man.

888
00:56:47,139 --> 00:56:49,210
Did you conduct a separate investigation on this case?

889
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,739
His Majesty appointed me as the Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang...

890
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:54,579
eight years ago because he wanted me to investigate...

891
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,849
Park Bok Ki, the Governor of Pyongan Province at the time,

892
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,750
as well as Lord Min.

893
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,588
They both submitted letters of appeals,

894
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:02,989
accusing each other of corruption.

895
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,960
However, you ended up marrying the princess,

896
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,629
so Jo In Hyun,

897
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:10,230
the Left State Councilor's eldest son, took up the position instead.

898
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,270
Lord Min cooperated with the Dongro Faction which is like his enemy...

899
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:18,199
because of his daughter's involvement.

900
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:22,009
Lord Min had a daughter who was very bright.

901
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:24,539
In the connivance of her father,

902
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:26,309
she disguised herself as a man and worked as an officer...

903
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:28,210
in the provincial office instead of her ill brother.

904
00:57:28,850 --> 00:57:29,880
The problem was that...

905
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,380
she ended up falling in love with the enemy's son from Hanyang.

906
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,969
The numbers do not match.

907
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:58,909
Do you truly not know? Or are you simply pretending?

908
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:03,549
Your uncle said to keep it that way saying it was the custom.

909
00:58:06,449 --> 00:58:08,350
I did not know since I am new here.

910
00:58:10,250 --> 00:58:12,520
And if that is the case, we should stick to the rules.

911
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,489
I will take responsibility for this.

912
00:58:15,589 --> 00:58:17,360
Jo In Hyun was a loyalist,

913
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,399
so he tried to expose the corrupt deeds of his uncle,

914
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,929
the governor of Pyongan Province.

915
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,699
Then upon confirming his sincerity, Min Seung Kwan's daughter...

916
00:58:24,029 --> 00:58:25,400
decided to cooperate.

917
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:28,468
So they joined forces...

918
00:58:28,469 --> 00:58:30,869
and began investigating the provincial governor's corrupt deeds.

919
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:34,380
In that process, Jo In Hyun found out that she was a woman,

920
00:58:34,779 --> 00:58:36,810
and they fell in love, knowing the dangers involved.

921
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,548
After wrapping up their investigation,

922
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:45,020
they lamented the fact that they could never be together,

923
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:47,089
so they committed suicide together.

924
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:50,929
So perhaps,

925
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:54,029
Lord Min cooperated with his enemy, the Dongro Faction,

926
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,130
in order to cover up his daughter's misdeed.

927
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,839
Have you regained your memory?

928
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:12,049
How do I know this story?

929
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:18,719
It is from "The Scholar's Man," a novel.

930
00:59:20,489 --> 00:59:22,989
It is so similar to this case that I did not even realize it.

931
00:59:24,529 --> 00:59:25,929
Could that novel be...

932
00:59:27,529 --> 00:59:30,770
Perhaps, it is based on a true story just like "The Lady's Private Life."

933
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,610
The author's pen name is Socheon.

934
00:59:36,469 --> 00:59:37,939
He wrote "The Scholar's Man" eight years ago...

935
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,679
and nothing else after that,

936
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:41,810
so not much is known about him.

937
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,850
Oh, a book distributor I know...

938
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:48,089
once mentioned that he saw him as a monk at Sunhwa Temple,

939
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,690
but I am not sure if it is true.

940
00:59:53,219 --> 00:59:55,130
At Sunhwa Temple?

941
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,049
My lord, what brings you here?

942
01:00:17,409 --> 01:00:18,980
The chief at the inn told me...

943
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,089
that you found the author of the novel.

944
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:43,869
There is a monk who goes by the name of Socheon.

945
01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:46,610
He will be back soon, so let us wait.

946
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,489
My goodness.

947
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:28,888
This place is empty now.

948
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:30,790
We can go inside to take shelter from the rain.

949
01:01:40,299 --> 01:01:41,299
My gosh.

950
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,889
Why is it raining? There was not a single cloud in the sky.

951
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,989
I suppose foxes are out and about looking for mates.

952
01:02:07,659 --> 01:02:09,730
When foxes are looking for mates,

953
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:13,060
they make the rain come down so people would not know.

954
01:02:14,969 --> 01:02:18,100
People would be mesmerized by the rain from the clear sky.

955
01:02:21,469 --> 01:02:24,369
So, we are under the spell of the foxes' trick now.

956
01:02:29,380 --> 01:02:31,080
This rain will stop soon,

957
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,690
so do not worry.

958
01:02:40,589 --> 01:02:42,029
What you say under such a spell...

959
01:02:43,429 --> 01:02:44,960
will not be held against you.

960
01:02:46,130 --> 01:02:47,299
So...

961
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:51,869
do not hesitate to answer me truthfully.

962
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,310
Why...

963
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:05,420
did you lie that you did not like me?

964
01:03:29,670 --> 01:03:32,679

965
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,029
(Listen to "I Love You" by SF9's Inseong on all music platforms.)

966
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:57,670
You wrote about the murder of the Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang.

967
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,739
The letter exposes their corrupt deeds...

968
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,440
and evidence that they were plotting treason.

969
01:04:03,509 --> 01:04:04,880
What do you mean?

970
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,810
Do not worry.

971
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:09,150
Even if every spinster in Hanyang were to wed,

972
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,519
the Crown Prince would not get married.

973
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:12,778
This is nuts.

974
01:04:12,779 --> 01:04:14,889
Why do I keep thinking of him?

975
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:16,790
You were the one who told me this.

976
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:19,619
When people fall in love, it happens instantly.

977
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,190
I, too, wish to spend the rest of my life with you.
