1
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,155
(Rowoon)

2
00:00:25,254 --> 00:00:27,195
(Cho Yi Hyun)

3
00:00:35,635 --> 00:00:36,764
(Writer: Ha Soo Jin)

4
00:00:36,764 --> 00:00:37,834
(Directors: Hwang Seung Ki, Kim Soo Jin)

5
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:49,745
(The Matchmakers)

6
00:00:52,514 --> 00:00:54,525
(Jung Soon Gu, 29 years old)

7
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,754
(Note: He chooses to remain single.)

8
00:00:56,754 --> 00:00:58,995
(Lieutenant of the Capital District, Soon Duk's older brother)

9
00:00:59,595 --> 00:01:01,495
Why have I chosen to remain single?

10
00:01:02,624 --> 00:01:04,394
Because I felt bad for my sister...

11
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:06,995
who was married off to a man, knowing she would be widowed soon...

12
00:01:06,995 --> 00:01:08,635
because of my success as the son of our family.

13
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:12,874
I cannot forgive my father for marrying her off to him,

14
00:01:13,635 --> 00:01:15,874
so I choose not to marry for the rest of my life.

15
00:01:22,145 --> 00:01:23,314
(Maeng Sam Soon, 21 years old, the 3rd of the old ladies)

16
00:01:23,314 --> 00:01:24,454
(Note: A romance novelist)

17
00:01:24,454 --> 00:01:25,755
Lieutenant Jung?

18
00:01:26,855 --> 00:01:28,225
I'm over him already.

19
00:01:28,684 --> 00:01:32,124
I already decided to focus my energy on Bachelor 23,

20
00:01:32,124 --> 00:01:34,165
the good cook.

21
00:01:35,365 --> 00:01:36,395
Yes.

22
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:40,395
Washing my hair at Suseongdong Valley was...

23
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:43,434
the one thing I wanted to try among the stories...

24
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:45,305
my mother told me about agents of love.

25
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,835
So, I asked Lady Yeoju to let me do it.

26
00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:50,544
I will turn it into the rendezvous of my life...

27
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:52,344
like the ladies in Bukchon.

28
00:01:55,745 --> 00:01:58,284
(Episode 10: Love Blooms at the May Festival)

29
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:00,715
What you say under such a spell...

30
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:03,225
will not be held against you.

31
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:05,495
So...

32
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:10,094
do not hesitate to answer me truthfully.

33
00:02:14,705 --> 00:02:15,865
Why...

34
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:22,004
did you lie that you did not like me?

35
00:02:34,925 --> 00:02:37,624
I am sure that you like me too.

36
00:02:40,325 --> 00:02:41,495
When we circled the pagoda,

37
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:44,495
you said you would be my protection.

38
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,164
When I collapsed at the inn,

39
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,305
you ran over to me faster than anybody.

40
00:02:50,604 --> 00:02:52,805
And by the river, you became truly relieved...

41
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:55,675
when you saw that I was fine.

42
00:02:57,104 --> 00:03:01,115
Also, you talked to me with great poise and calm,

43
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,654
but your pulse was racing faster than normal.

44
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:10,085
Please turn a blind eye.

45
00:03:10,425 --> 00:03:12,825
Then I will leave as soon as my job is done.

46
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,934
All of these incidents say...

47
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:23,904
that you also like me.

48
00:03:26,175 --> 00:03:27,175
By any chance,

49
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,745
was I mistaken because I was a nerd?

50
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,724
My heart ached...

51
00:03:46,254 --> 00:03:49,564
when you spoke without looking at me.

52
00:03:51,795 --> 00:03:53,835
Back then, I did not know the reason.

53
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:03,205
I think I know now.

54
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:08,985
It was...

55
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:13,485
because I also liked you.

56
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,284
However...

57
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:33,705
I cannot forget my deceased husband...

58
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,674
until the end of my life.

59
00:04:51,695 --> 00:04:54,195
That is why I cannot accept your feelings...

60
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:58,294
or let you have mine.

61
00:05:30,065 --> 00:05:31,164
Socheon.

62
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,465
You are...

63
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:38,505
What brings you here, Lord Gyeongunjae?

64
00:05:40,234 --> 00:05:42,875
Are you in need of another dead body?

65
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,914
Well...

66
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:48,015
Are you Socheon,

67
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,354
the one who wrote "The Scholar's Man?"

68
00:06:03,724 --> 00:06:05,395
You came looking for me...

69
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:07,765
after eight years because of that novel?

70
00:06:08,335 --> 00:06:09,435
That novel was a depiction...

71
00:06:10,565 --> 00:06:13,104
of the murder of Deputy Administrator of Pyeongyang.

72
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:14,705
Was it not?

73
00:06:16,705 --> 00:06:19,375
Did you write it after someone told you the story?

74
00:06:19,974 --> 00:06:21,445
It was not something I heard.

75
00:06:23,284 --> 00:06:24,914
It was something I experienced.

76
00:06:30,484 --> 00:06:32,395
You must be that woman...

77
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,765
who dressed up as a man in the novel.

78
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,114
The numbers do not match.

79
00:06:58,685 --> 00:07:01,185
Do you truly not know? Or are you simply pretending?

80
00:07:02,554 --> 00:07:05,695
Your uncle said to keep it that way, saying it was the custom.

81
00:07:07,354 --> 00:07:09,224
I did not know since I am new here.

82
00:07:11,294 --> 00:07:13,835
And if that is the case, we should stick to the rules.

83
00:07:13,835 --> 00:07:14,864
I will...

84
00:07:15,734 --> 00:07:16,935
take responsibility for this.

85
00:07:34,924 --> 00:07:38,554
I did not understand why the main character...

86
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:41,625
worked with his enemy to cover up his dead daughter's affair.

87
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:43,994
But I finally understand.

88
00:07:46,835 --> 00:07:49,065
Anybody would work with his enemy...

89
00:07:49,664 --> 00:07:51,775
to cover up his son's homosexuality...

90
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:54,404
because the honour of his family was at stake.

91
00:07:55,945 --> 00:07:58,614
Both of you did not take your lives like the novel.

92
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:01,744
Who killed Jo In Hyun and created this false charge?

93
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,385
I am the one...

94
00:08:07,114 --> 00:08:08,525
who killed Jo In Hyun.

95
00:08:12,395 --> 00:08:14,825
If I had not visited him on that day,

96
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:18,594
would he not be alive right now?

97
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:21,335
I think about that...

98
00:08:22,534 --> 00:08:24,104
every single day.

99
00:08:24,635 --> 00:08:25,835
These were the letters...

100
00:08:25,935 --> 00:08:28,075
Lord Park Bok Ki exchanged with the translator of the Ming.

101
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:31,945
It should be enough to prove that he pocketed the tribute articles.

102
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,215
By tomorrow, he will notice the letters are missing.

103
00:08:35,385 --> 00:08:36,614
We do not have much time.

104
00:08:37,085 --> 00:08:39,585
Lodge a letter of appeals at the royal court tomorrow.

105
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,195
I am sorry.

106
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:48,524
I do not think I can do this.

107
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:53,494
All right.

108
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:57,004
I am sure you feel uneasy about reporting your uncle.

109
00:08:57,234 --> 00:08:58,905
However, it will be better...

110
00:08:59,175 --> 00:09:01,175
if you do it because you are his family.

111
00:09:01,175 --> 00:09:03,344
This letter does not only contain the corruption of the tributes.

112
00:09:04,175 --> 00:09:06,815
It also has evidence of treachery, a plan to kill Prince Unhae.

113
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:11,384
What do you mean? I did not see anything of that sort.

114
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,825
You would know what I meant after tomorrow.

115
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:17,185
I also believed it was right...

116
00:09:17,185 --> 00:09:19,295
to report my uncle and rectify this wrong custom.

117
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:22,594
However, if I used these letters as evidence for my petition,

118
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:24,994
our family would get annihilated.

119
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:46,085
Calm down.

120
00:09:49,085 --> 00:09:50,925
I am sure we will find a way to resolve this.

121
00:10:05,205 --> 00:10:06,774
What are you two doing?

122
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,325
Rumours said...

123
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:28,024
you were a homosexual.

124
00:10:28,764 --> 00:10:29,795
Was this true?

125
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:34,835
I am sorry.

126
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:42,644
Father.

127
00:10:43,374 --> 00:10:45,315
Father!

128
00:10:52,484 --> 00:10:54,215
I survived,

129
00:10:55,185 --> 00:10:57,124
but he took the stab without a chance to resist.

130
00:10:57,925 --> 00:10:59,994
He lost his life then and there.

131
00:11:02,565 --> 00:11:04,565
Did you just say...

132
00:11:05,234 --> 00:11:07,364
Jo In Hyun was killed by his father?

133
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:20,244
What was in that letter as the evidence of the plan...

134
00:11:20,545 --> 00:11:22,144
to kill Prince Unhae?

135
00:11:36,894 --> 00:11:39,335
Lord Park took the letters back when he came into the room,

136
00:11:39,335 --> 00:11:40,894
so I did not get a second look.

137
00:11:41,764 --> 00:11:43,835
But I did not find such things when I looked over them.

138
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:46,774
Even if I had missed it,

139
00:11:47,134 --> 00:11:49,675
nothing had happened to Prince Unhae at that time.

140
00:11:49,974 --> 00:11:51,274
It seems like...

141
00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:54,644
the Dongro Faction stopped the plan after his death.

142
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,085
Many innocent lives...

143
00:11:59,114 --> 00:12:01,455
were sacrificed to cover up that incident.

144
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:06,354
My father also passed away less than half a year after that.

145
00:12:08,425 --> 00:12:09,864
I came to realize...

146
00:12:10,264 --> 00:12:12,195
our existence...

147
00:12:13,264 --> 00:12:15,035
must have been a misfortune.

148
00:12:16,734 --> 00:12:19,274
So I wanted to wash myself of that sin...

149
00:12:20,104 --> 00:12:22,675
and chose to live recovering abandoned dead bodies.

150
00:12:28,884 --> 00:12:31,344
I do not wish to speak of this incident again.

151
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:48,165
Why did you choose Sunhwa Temple?

152
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:51,504
This temple is sponsored...

153
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,134
by Left State Councillor Jo Young Bae's family.

154
00:12:53,935 --> 00:12:55,774
He will not let you live if he finds out about you.

155
00:12:56,305 --> 00:12:59,415
I do not understand why you choose to remain here.

156
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,215
Perhaps that was why he chose this place of all places.

157
00:13:09,785 --> 00:13:12,325
The memorial tablet of the one he loves rests here.

158
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,144
I understand that you were falsely charged,

159
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,945
but it might be difficult to prove your innocence...

160
00:13:31,004 --> 00:13:32,445
under the law.

161
00:13:37,014 --> 00:13:39,984
And just as you said, my love sickness was my problem.

162
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:41,384
Do not mind it.

163
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:45,724
You may continue to make the matches.

164
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,524
However, Lieutenant Jung said he would protect you...

165
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:50,724
until the weddings ended.

166
00:13:50,925 --> 00:13:53,264
That is all. Be careful.

167
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,905
This letter does not only contain the corruption of the tributes.

168
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:38,104
It also has evidence of treachery, a plan to kill Prince Unhae.

169
00:14:38,104 --> 00:14:40,815
What do you mean? I did not see anything of that sort.

170
00:14:42,045 --> 00:14:43,744
What was the evidence...

171
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:45,955
of treachery that Jo In Hyun saw?

172
00:14:47,655 --> 00:14:50,884
Why did the mortician monk not notice anything?

173
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:53,825
Lady Jung.

174
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:56,925
Lady Jung?

175
00:14:58,935 --> 00:15:00,234
Goodness.

176
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:02,504
My gosh. She left again.

177
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:05,075
What will I say this time?

178
00:15:05,075 --> 00:15:06,734
I am here.

179
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,144
Goodness.

180
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,984
Why are you out here again?

181
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:22,455
I felt frustrated as if my head was stuffed with cotton wool.

182
00:15:23,085 --> 00:15:25,024
I could not sit in my room.

183
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:27,195
It is not like your head is a blanket.

184
00:15:27,425 --> 00:15:29,394
Why was it stuffed with cotton wool?

185
00:15:32,094 --> 00:15:33,565
Please get up.

186
00:15:34,295 --> 00:15:36,104
Lieutenant Jung is here.

187
00:15:38,065 --> 00:15:39,205
My brother?

188
00:15:47,175 --> 00:15:49,585
I could have gone to Sunhwa Temple with you.

189
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,915
Why did you go with Lord Gyeongunjae?

190
00:15:52,354 --> 00:15:54,185
It was not that I went with him.

191
00:15:54,854 --> 00:15:57,785
He had been waiting in front of Sunhwa Temple.

192
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:02,925
Soon Gu.

193
00:16:03,795 --> 00:16:05,864
It feels like my head is about to burst.

194
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:09,705
Can you scold me next time?

195
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,504
What about that novelist?

196
00:16:17,205 --> 00:16:18,274
Did you meet him?

197
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:20,075
Yes.

198
00:16:22,384 --> 00:16:24,585
Lady Yeoju was falsely accused.

199
00:16:26,715 --> 00:16:28,285
Do you also know who the real culprit is?

200
00:16:33,094 --> 00:16:35,925
The matchmaker met the mortician monk at Sunhwa Temple.

201
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:39,494
At Sunhwa Temple?

202
00:16:40,565 --> 00:16:43,535
Is she trying to find the list of the dead people?

203
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:44,965
Or is she trying to become a Buddhist nun?

204
00:16:44,965 --> 00:16:47,134
Good grief. What in the world is she up to?

205
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:48,905
As soon as she returned, she picked up initial reports...

206
00:16:48,905 --> 00:16:50,405
of the incident from eight years ago...

207
00:16:50,644 --> 00:16:52,445
and the document given to the daughter-in-law...

208
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,215
of the left state councillor at the Ministry of Law Enforcement...

209
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:55,384
and the Ministry of Culture.

210
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:59,555
Wait, is she digging up your son's incident?

211
00:16:59,854 --> 00:17:01,215
Goodness.

212
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,055
You never let me talk.

213
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:07,094
Bring me that mortician monk who met with Lord Gyeongunjae...

214
00:17:07,724 --> 00:17:09,024
and that woman.

215
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:10,925
Yes, my lord.

216
00:17:12,034 --> 00:17:14,465
He died in his father's hands?

217
00:17:18,064 --> 00:17:19,234
Are you all right?

218
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,534
I am not all right.

219
00:17:22,845 --> 00:17:25,115
I never imagined vindicating Lady Yeoju...

220
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,415
would have anything to do with exposing my father-in-law's crimes.

221
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:32,754
What about Lord Gyeongunjae?

222
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,254
What do you think he will do?

223
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:37,455
He says Lady Yeoju is innocent,

224
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:41,425
but it will not be easy to prove it.

225
00:17:42,965 --> 00:17:45,165
It is tough to hold a father responsible...

226
00:17:47,435 --> 00:17:48,804
for killing his son over homosexuality.

227
00:17:48,804 --> 00:17:51,034
However, he would become the shame of his family,

228
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,705
so everyone wanted to hide it.

229
00:17:54,534 --> 00:17:55,705
Soon Gu.

230
00:17:57,845 --> 00:17:59,915
Do you also think the honour of one's family is...

231
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:03,514
more important than the life of one's son?

232
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,615
I do not think so.

233
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:10,625
But our father also married you off to this family against your will...

234
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,554
to save our family.

235
00:18:15,425 --> 00:18:17,024
My incompetence...

236
00:18:18,224 --> 00:18:19,834
has not done you any good.

237
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:24,304
I am sorry.

238
00:18:25,334 --> 00:18:26,675
What do you mean?

239
00:18:28,234 --> 00:18:29,945
I was married against my will?

240
00:18:29,945 --> 00:18:31,145
I know everything.

241
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,814
You and Father...

242
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:36,715
fought for days before your marriage.

243
00:18:36,715 --> 00:18:37,784
Back then,

244
00:18:39,254 --> 00:18:41,584
I should have done my part to call this off.

245
00:18:44,584 --> 00:18:45,595
Soon Duk.

246
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:48,764
If it gets too hard to stay here,

247
00:18:50,925 --> 00:18:52,165
come back home.

248
00:18:56,004 --> 00:18:57,534
Why do you say that to me?

249
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,935
I fought with Father...

250
00:19:02,605 --> 00:19:04,274
because he tried to stop me...

251
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,615
from marrying my husband, just because he was sick.

252
00:19:08,345 --> 00:19:10,215
I was trying to convince him.

253
00:19:13,054 --> 00:19:14,155
Is that true?

254
00:19:18,054 --> 00:19:20,754
I am sure that you like me too.

255
00:19:20,925 --> 00:19:21,994
It was...

256
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,195
because I also liked you.

257
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:31,135
I...

258
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:35,875
I loved my husband so much.

259
00:19:43,044 --> 00:19:44,145
I see.

260
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:46,955
I had...

261
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,685
a wrong idea.

262
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,455
I am sorry.

263
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,625
Do not cry.

264
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:15,345
(Cordially sealed)

265
00:20:53,984 --> 00:20:57,084
(Cordially sealed)

266
00:21:02,324 --> 00:21:03,625
The May Festival is coming up,

267
00:21:03,925 --> 00:21:05,865
so I send my regards on this fan.

268
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:09,064
Summer enriches everything,

269
00:21:09,365 --> 00:21:12,175
but things can easily go wrong and also rot everything.

270
00:21:12,834 --> 00:21:14,834
When you are appointed as a government official in time,

271
00:21:15,304 --> 00:21:18,044
I hope you will create a gentle breeze like this fan...

272
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:22,484
and become someone who looks after the people.

273
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:32,625
Goodness.

274
00:21:35,925 --> 00:21:37,724
I thought I would win this round.

275
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:39,895
Can we play one more round?

276
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:43,165
I must win at least one round in this May Festival no matter what.

277
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,574
I am paid to play you. We can play as much as you wish.

278
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:54,514
Wait.

279
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:59,284
Something urgent came up.

280
00:21:59,754 --> 00:22:01,484
Let us postpone our lesson.

281
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:14,994
Goodness.

282
00:22:16,635 --> 00:22:18,935
I am sorry. My legs suddenly got entangled.

283
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,205
You should have been more careful.

284
00:22:24,274 --> 00:22:25,875
You were the one who suddenly ran out.

285
00:22:28,074 --> 00:22:29,715
I hear you are about to marry...

286
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,314
the only daughter of the left state councillor.

287
00:22:31,484 --> 00:22:34,554
You should focus on only on thing, both in ssireum and marriage.

288
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:41,395
What is wrong with him?

289
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:18,695
Lady Jung.

290
00:23:19,195 --> 00:23:20,195
Yes?

291
00:23:20,564 --> 00:23:21,794
What are you doing?

292
00:23:23,004 --> 00:23:24,064
Spin it around.

293
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,645
That darned fox, playing a trick on me.

294
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:32,145
Darn it.

295
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:47,595
This is driving me crazy.

296
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,564
Why do I think of him at such random times?

297
00:23:53,935 --> 00:23:55,834
I will forget him over time.

298
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,935
Yes.

299
00:24:06,615 --> 00:24:09,185
You do not even disappear anymore.

300
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:24,264
(Year of the Yellow Mouse)

301
00:24:24,264 --> 00:24:27,834
(Year of the Red Monkey)

302
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:31,334
These were the letters...

303
00:24:31,334 --> 00:24:33,334
Lord Park Bok Ki exchanged with the translator of the Ming.

304
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:34,474
(Jo In Hyun, Tribute corruption)

305
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,605
This letter does not only contain the corruption of the tributes.

306
00:24:37,605 --> 00:24:40,314
It also has evidence of treachery, a plan to kill Prince Unhae.

307
00:24:41,645 --> 00:24:45,685
Did you just say Jo In Hyun was killed by his father?

308
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:46,685
(Jo Young Bae, murdered)

309
00:24:48,185 --> 00:24:49,355
Many innocent lives...

310
00:24:50,024 --> 00:24:52,254
were sacrificed to cover up that incident.

311
00:24:52,494 --> 00:24:53,724
(Lady Yoo)

312
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,024
(Suicide)

313
00:24:55,925 --> 00:24:57,365
(Bestowed with a memorial gate)

314
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:03,564
The symptoms of golden silkworm poison mentioned...

315
00:25:03,564 --> 00:25:05,705
in a Ming book on medicine I read recently...

316
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,375
were similar to the princess' symptoms...

317
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,445
from eight years ago.

318
00:25:23,824 --> 00:25:25,155
(A merchant from the Ming)

319
00:25:25,155 --> 00:25:28,554
You speak fluent Joseon. Have you traded for long?

320
00:25:28,865 --> 00:25:30,125
What if I have?

321
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,534
Has anyone else asked for golden silkworm poison in the past?

322
00:25:35,435 --> 00:25:36,534
Who killed him?

323
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:40,074
Probably the ones who plotted the crown prince's kidnapping.

324
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,705
They wanted to silence him.

325
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,715
(The Crown Prince abducted)

326
00:25:45,715 --> 00:25:46,945
Both this maid...

327
00:25:47,615 --> 00:25:49,284
and the princess...

328
00:25:49,685 --> 00:25:52,314
have most likely contracted golden silkworm poisoning.

329
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:04,024
Lord Gyeongunjae must be competing...

330
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:05,564
in the swing contest for the May Festival.

331
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:08,165
I saw him swinging in pair with old bachelors.

332
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:11,234
Goodness, it was such an eyesore.

333
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:17,574
Thanks to him,

334
00:26:17,845 --> 00:26:20,774
the Capital District Office will have excellent progress...

335
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:23,115
in the problem with spinsters and old bachelors.

336
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,715
What do you mean?

337
00:26:28,355 --> 00:26:31,855
The old bachelors who associated with Lord Gyeongunjae said...

338
00:26:31,855 --> 00:26:34,925
they would all marry the old ladies.

339
00:26:35,224 --> 00:26:37,294
We would no longer be reprimanded...

340
00:26:37,294 --> 00:26:39,665
over the problem with spinsters and old bachelors this year.

341
00:26:43,165 --> 00:26:44,165
Lord Kim.

342
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:48,945
The problem is not performance of the Capital District Office.

343
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:52,675
We must stop Lord Gyeongunjae from marrying off the old women.

344
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:57,185
Why is that so?

345
00:26:59,314 --> 00:27:00,455
A symbol tells us what is to come.

346
00:27:00,455 --> 00:27:04,155
(It means a small movement shows what will happen in the future.)

347
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:05,554
Did you forget...

348
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:07,895
the excuse we used to stop the Crown Prince from marrying?

349
00:27:08,794 --> 00:27:10,365
It was the rampant problem...

350
00:27:10,365 --> 00:27:11,925
of spinsters and old bachelors in Hanyang.

351
00:27:11,925 --> 00:27:15,395
However, if the Lord Gyeongunjae steps in as a royal-in-law...

352
00:27:15,564 --> 00:27:17,834
and marries three spinsters with old bachelors,

353
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:20,304
the royal court will use this as the momentum...

354
00:27:21,274 --> 00:27:23,074
to marry the Crown Prince.

355
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:39,425
My sister, you already knew...

356
00:27:40,524 --> 00:27:42,425
what the symbol meant.

357
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:48,734
We should use this chance to eliminate Lord Gyeongunjae.

358
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:52,734
Why do you blurt out the things of your mind without thinking?

359
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:56,945
So?

360
00:27:57,574 --> 00:28:00,314
Do you have a plan to stop his endeavours?

361
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,715
"Stop his endeavours?"

362
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:06,615
Marrying spinsters and old bachelors is very important to our kingdom.

363
00:28:07,314 --> 00:28:10,625
If Lord Gyeongunjae of the Dongro Faction would do that,

364
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:11,685
it is something we should celebrate.

365
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,294
Also, the mother of Erudite Maeng's three daughters...

366
00:28:15,625 --> 00:28:17,494
is of the Jo family clan.

367
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:21,064
Are you saying you will sit around...

368
00:28:21,064 --> 00:28:23,034
and let the Crown Prince marry?

369
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,465
Please do not worry.

370
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:27,175
Even if all spinsters of Hanyang get married,

371
00:28:27,635 --> 00:28:29,675
the Crown Prince will never marry.

372
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,605
(Cordially sealed)

373
00:29:10,244 --> 00:29:11,814
Take that to the Mount Nam Valley.

374
00:29:22,925 --> 00:29:24,064
(Cordially sealed)

375
00:29:31,635 --> 00:29:33,234
Thank you for relaying the news of Hanyang.

376
00:29:33,734 --> 00:29:35,804
If I am appointed to an office,

377
00:29:35,804 --> 00:29:39,615
I will become a virtuous official who works for the people.

378
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:43,715
I also painted something on fans as a token of my gratitude.

379
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,355
The painting of Mount Mokmyeok is for you.

380
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:52,824
How did you know Maeng Ha Na had been...

381
00:29:52,955 --> 00:29:54,024
exchanging letters with him?

382
00:29:54,824 --> 00:29:57,564
He disappeared from the abode of the King's nanny.

383
00:29:57,764 --> 00:29:59,494
But the Queen did not punish her.

384
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,165
Instead, she gave her a roll of silk.

385
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,935
I found it odd and kept watching, then came to that knowledge.

386
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,774
It looked like Maeng Ha Na was the one who hid him...

387
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,474
that night.

388
00:30:12,615 --> 00:30:14,574
How impudent of her!

389
00:30:14,574 --> 00:30:15,645
I will get her...

390
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,054
next time.

391
00:30:23,984 --> 00:30:25,724
I have impersonated Maeng Ha Na...

392
00:30:26,855 --> 00:30:28,994
and sent a letter to the Crown Prince.

393
00:30:38,705 --> 00:30:41,834
Young Master, if you come to Hanyang in the upcoming May Festival,

394
00:30:41,834 --> 00:30:44,375
I will give you a tour of the city.

395
00:30:44,804 --> 00:30:48,915
Also, you will get to find out how good I am at swinging,

396
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,415
so please come.

397
00:30:51,345 --> 00:30:52,445
I will wait.

398
00:30:56,885 --> 00:31:00,054
My mother will not let me go out.

399
00:31:01,425 --> 00:31:02,494
What should I do?

400
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:16,574
My son is now old enough to write poetry?

401
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,074
When did you become such a big boy?

402
00:31:19,814 --> 00:31:21,574
How is it?

403
00:31:23,814 --> 00:31:24,915
I liked it.

404
00:31:25,314 --> 00:31:28,814
I especially liked how you used the word companion,

405
00:31:29,014 --> 00:31:30,324
not friend.

406
00:31:30,625 --> 00:31:32,955
I should show it to my teacher too.

407
00:31:37,165 --> 00:31:38,324
He is coming.

408
00:31:39,165 --> 00:31:41,494
What? Already?

409
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:46,534
He could feel burdened if he found out I was listening,

410
00:31:46,534 --> 00:31:47,875
so let us keep this a secret.

411
00:31:48,334 --> 00:31:49,405
Yes, Mother.

412
00:32:08,155 --> 00:32:09,365
Have you been well?

413
00:32:09,824 --> 00:32:12,564
Yes, have you also been well, Teacher?

414
00:32:13,865 --> 00:32:16,865
I was quite troubled with a matter of my heart.

415
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,635
What is the matter?

416
00:32:21,675 --> 00:32:23,705
I miss my late wife.

417
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:27,074
Do you mean the princess...

418
00:32:27,074 --> 00:32:28,375
you were forced to marry?

419
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:32,514
My aunt told me about it.

420
00:32:33,314 --> 00:32:37,054
My apologies if it was inappropriate.

421
00:32:39,494 --> 00:32:42,665
Everyone in Joseon knows the story. No need to apologize.

422
00:32:44,724 --> 00:32:47,034
I will tell you a secret no one knows.

423
00:32:50,534 --> 00:32:52,935
I was not forced to marry her like the rumour says.

424
00:33:05,945 --> 00:33:08,415
I loved the princess enough...

425
00:33:09,084 --> 00:33:12,054
to give up on my dream of becoming the Premier.

426
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:17,064
You were having a hard time because you missed the princess.

427
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:22,595
Sometimes I have a hard time because I miss my birth father and mother.

428
00:33:22,905 --> 00:33:24,635
I understand how you feel.

429
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:31,675
When that happens, suffering is all I can do.

430
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,145
Do you remember your birth parents?

431
00:33:39,915 --> 00:33:41,955
I was too young to remember them.

432
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:45,054
But I remember how they often smiled at me.

433
00:33:46,054 --> 00:33:49,395
My mother also told me they were good people.

434
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:55,895
I have always noticed it,

435
00:33:56,764 --> 00:33:58,804
but you seem to have a good relationship with your mother.

436
00:33:59,304 --> 00:34:02,534
Yes, I love my mother the most in the world.

437
00:34:02,534 --> 00:34:05,504
As long as I am with her, I am not scared of anything.

438
00:34:11,615 --> 00:34:13,155
Listening to you...

439
00:34:13,655 --> 00:34:16,024
helps me clear my disordered heart.

440
00:34:16,984 --> 00:34:18,055
I beg your pardon?

441
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:20,854
Thank you.

442
00:34:35,135 --> 00:34:38,274
"Hogangbulhohak gipyeyagwang."

443
00:34:39,075 --> 00:34:42,914
"If you only pursue the power and do not pursue learning,"

444
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,984
"it will only result in a flippant effect."

445
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:50,285
It is time to end the class.

446
00:34:51,285 --> 00:34:52,794
Did I interrupt the class?

447
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:55,425
I was about to end it.

448
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:06,035
To hear my grandson studying,

449
00:35:06,734 --> 00:35:08,675
it reminds me of my late eldest son.

450
00:35:10,704 --> 00:35:14,414
He was a smart and sweet son.

451
00:35:20,254 --> 00:35:21,285
My apologies.

452
00:35:21,854 --> 00:35:25,184
When you age, you remember the past clearer than yesterday.

453
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:26,854
Sorry for bringing up an uncomfortable subject.

454
00:35:28,325 --> 00:35:31,925
Thanks to you, my grandson enjoys studying.

455
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:34,995
Because your grandson is smart and kind-hearted,

456
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:36,805
he would have done well even if it were someone else.

457
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:40,874
Oh, I heard Erudite Maeng's daughters are...

458
00:35:40,874 --> 00:35:43,745
getting married on May 25.

459
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:47,745
You played an integral role in resolving the spinster problem.

460
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:51,914
You even know the date of their marriage?

461
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:55,885
You are a talent like no other in Dongro Faction.

462
00:35:55,984 --> 00:35:57,984
Your move deserves attention.

463
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:01,495
You are not just one of many sons-in-law.

464
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:19,445
Was she telling me to pull the right strings?

465
00:36:19,975 --> 00:36:21,044
Pardon?

466
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:22,575
It seems she is aware the spinster's marriage leads to...

467
00:36:22,575 --> 00:36:24,144
the Crown Prince's marriage.

468
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:25,814
How can she be so calm?

469
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:28,015
Who?

470
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:29,754
Wait.

471
00:36:30,385 --> 00:36:31,385
Whom do you mean?

472
00:36:34,854 --> 00:36:38,725
(The day of May Festival)

473
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:45,465
Enjoy the festival and come to the tightrope act at noon.

474
00:36:45,664 --> 00:36:47,774
I have already talked to his mother.

475
00:36:47,774 --> 00:36:49,135
Do not be sidetracked.

476
00:36:49,274 --> 00:36:50,475
I understand.

477
00:36:50,805 --> 00:36:53,245
Gae Dong will reserve a good spot for you.

478
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,144
Geun Seok, make sure to listen to your aunt.

479
00:36:57,285 --> 00:36:58,414
Soon Duk.

480
00:36:58,644 --> 00:37:01,414
Are you making Geun Seok watch me?

481
00:37:02,584 --> 00:37:05,555
Geun Seok should have fun with his friends.

482
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,425
I do not mind, Aunt.

483
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:09,995
I would like to meet my future uncle.

484
00:37:11,365 --> 00:37:13,664
Be polite to your future uncle.

485
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:14,995
Yes, Mother.

486
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,965
Just because Mother went to meet Royal Noble Consort Suk,

487
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:19,405
do not let your guard down.

488
00:37:19,535 --> 00:37:21,274
You should come home early.

489
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:24,805
Sure. Have a good day.

490
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:27,274
Come with me. Bye.

491
00:37:44,164 --> 00:37:46,965
Geun Seok, we should go outside the city.

492
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:48,535
Why?

493
00:37:48,535 --> 00:37:51,365
You have to meet your future husband later.

494
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:53,374
I met him last night.

495
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:54,805
Sorry?

496
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:08,515
My lord?

497
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,254
Are you the headmaster's young master?

498
00:38:12,725 --> 00:38:14,624
Oh, yes.

499
00:38:14,854 --> 00:38:16,495
Gae Dong, will you give us some privacy?

500
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:20,865
I will be behind the alley.

501
00:38:30,245 --> 00:38:32,905
I am sorry for calling you out at this hour.

502
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:34,675
I do not mind.

503
00:38:34,675 --> 00:38:38,845
But we were meant to meet tomorrow.

504
00:38:41,115 --> 00:38:42,484
That is why I wanted to see you.

505
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,984
Since it is the last May Festival before getting married,

506
00:38:45,984 --> 00:38:48,254
I would like to spend it with my friends.

507
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,595
If you do not mind,

508
00:38:50,595 --> 00:38:54,365
I was thinking maybe we could spend the May Festival separately.

509
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:58,734
I do not mind. You should enjoy it with your friends.

510
00:38:59,434 --> 00:39:00,475
Thank you.

511
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:10,684
- Wait. - Wait.

512
00:39:22,055 --> 00:39:23,124
Well...

513
00:39:28,834 --> 00:39:31,834
Should I say I received it from you during the May Festival?

514
00:39:32,535 --> 00:39:34,874
And I received this from you.

515
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,945
This is our secret.

516
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:43,414
I like how we have a secret before even getting married.

517
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:47,555
- Bye. - Bye.

518
00:39:55,925 --> 00:39:57,524
If you do not hurry up, I will not take you with me.

519
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,155
Get a hold of yourself.

520
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:27,954
What has gotten into you? You never came before I did.

521
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:30,265
Sometimes you need a day like this.

522
00:40:31,164 --> 00:40:33,695
To tell you about the May Festival plan today...

523
00:40:33,695 --> 00:40:35,465
At 2pm, Suseongdong Valley.

524
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:37,604
At 2:30pm, ssireum area.

525
00:40:37,604 --> 00:40:39,905
And at 3pm, the swing. Am I right?

526
00:40:41,104 --> 00:40:42,175
That is correct.

527
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,305
Then shall we move to Suseongdong Valley,

528
00:40:44,305 --> 00:40:45,774
the place of the first match?

529
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:03,925
What are you doing here?

530
00:41:05,195 --> 00:41:07,765
I was out to enjoy May Festival with my nephew.

531
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:10,535
You always wanted to meet Geun Seok.

532
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:14,934
But...

533
00:41:24,044 --> 00:41:25,314
What do you want to do today?

534
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:27,285
I am not sure.

535
00:41:51,644 --> 00:41:53,144
How have you been...

536
00:42:13,535 --> 00:42:15,934
- Hello. - Hello.

537
00:42:19,434 --> 00:42:22,175
No men are allowed in Suseongdong Valley today.

538
00:42:53,135 --> 00:42:55,374
Maybe I should have asked why he was here.

539
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:04,745
Did I make you wait?

540
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:07,615
No, I just arrived.

541
00:43:07,615 --> 00:43:08,615
Come with me.

542
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,765
What is wrong? Are you nervous?

543
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:20,794
Yes.

544
00:43:21,865 --> 00:43:24,365
Imagine you are just washing your hair.

545
00:43:25,934 --> 00:43:26,934
Follow me.

546
00:43:38,445 --> 00:43:39,745
I will be up there.

547
00:43:40,115 --> 00:43:41,155
Okay.

548
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:10,215
Lieutenant Jung.

549
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,715
I told you to watch Lady Yeoju.

550
00:44:13,084 --> 00:44:15,015
What are you doing here?

551
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:17,124
No man is allowed...

552
00:44:18,285 --> 00:44:20,055
in the valley below.

553
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:21,725
Yes.

554
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:23,495
True.

555
00:44:23,894 --> 00:44:25,394
What about Bachelor 23?

556
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:28,664
Oh, right. He should have been here a long ago.

557
00:44:28,865 --> 00:44:29,894
I will...

558
00:44:29,894 --> 00:44:31,135
- My goodness. - go look for him.

559
00:44:43,544 --> 00:44:45,785
The food took too long.

560
00:44:52,584 --> 00:44:53,595
Oh, no.

561
00:44:56,995 --> 00:44:59,825
Lady. That is too rough to eat.

562
00:45:02,434 --> 00:45:05,365
You should only pick soft leaves that look like this.

563
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:09,934
No. Not that one...

564
00:45:41,274 --> 00:45:42,305
Not yet.

565
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:48,715
We should not waste any time here.

566
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,414
I cannot do it anymore.

567
00:45:55,584 --> 00:45:57,055
I need to stretch my legs.

568
00:46:01,655 --> 00:46:02,894
Oh, my legs feel numb.

569
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,225
Oh, my.

570
00:46:06,624 --> 00:46:08,095
My goodness.

571
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:11,104
Are you okay?

572
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,504
She fell.

573
00:46:12,504 --> 00:46:13,834
Oh, my goodness.

574
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:16,204
- What do I do? - Are you okay?

575
00:46:20,075 --> 00:46:21,544
Lieutenant... Lieutenant Jung.

576
00:46:22,274 --> 00:46:23,345
What do we do?

577
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:29,754
My gosh.

578
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:49,874
I thought this only happens in novels.

579
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:53,544
I do not care even if I cannot get married.

580
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:55,314
No.

581
00:46:55,314 --> 00:46:57,414
If I cannot marry Lieutenant Jung,

582
00:46:57,945 --> 00:46:59,445
I would rather marry no one.

583
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:23,905
My lord!

584
00:47:25,644 --> 00:47:26,644
Hurry.

585
00:47:26,874 --> 00:47:27,914
Oh, yes.

586
00:47:32,914 --> 00:47:33,954
What just happened?

587
00:47:43,354 --> 00:47:46,664
Did you not say the bachelors had no problems?

588
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:49,834
However, Bachelor 23 did not appear.

589
00:47:51,104 --> 00:47:54,374
Why did Lieutenant Jung suddenly appear?

590
00:47:55,204 --> 00:47:58,644
I do not know why Bachelor 23 did not appear.

591
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:01,575
Am I the only one...

592
00:48:02,314 --> 00:48:03,345
who cares about this marriage?

593
00:48:03,584 --> 00:48:05,484
I care about this marriage too.

594
00:48:05,484 --> 00:48:07,785
My life depends on it.

595
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:10,854
What?

596
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,854
Since Lieutenant Jung started it,

597
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,155
he shall take responsibility.

598
00:48:17,024 --> 00:48:19,365
Lieutenant Jung will take responsibility?

599
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:20,695
What do you mean?

600
00:48:23,294 --> 00:48:24,334
I understand.

601
00:48:25,564 --> 00:48:27,374
Take responsibility for what?

602
00:48:42,084 --> 00:48:43,084
My lady.

603
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:46,325
If you are okay with it,

604
00:48:49,925 --> 00:48:51,595
will you marry me?

605
00:49:17,285 --> 00:49:18,285
Yes.

606
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:21,754
I would love to.

607
00:49:25,265 --> 00:49:26,265
Okay.

608
00:49:28,365 --> 00:49:29,365
Thank you.

609
00:49:32,365 --> 00:49:33,434
What...

610
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:36,874
What on earth? So suddenly?

611
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:39,175
I feel relieved...

612
00:49:39,675 --> 00:49:40,945
that Lieutenant Jung is getting married.

613
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:44,115
We should leave them alone.

614
00:49:45,684 --> 00:49:47,885
But... How can they...

615
00:50:00,695 --> 00:50:01,695
But...

616
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:04,334
how can he propose to her out of nowhere?

617
00:50:04,734 --> 00:50:06,204
You said it yourself.

618
00:50:06,535 --> 00:50:09,305
It takes less than a moment for a man and a woman to fall in love.

619
00:50:17,184 --> 00:50:19,385
I think Lieutenant Jung is a better match for Lady Sam Soon...

620
00:50:19,385 --> 00:50:21,515
than Bachelor 23.

621
00:50:21,954 --> 00:50:23,215
What do you think?

622
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:26,885
That is true.

623
00:50:27,254 --> 00:50:29,394
What do we do about Bachelor 23?

624
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:32,325
He thinks he is marrying Lady Sam Soon.

625
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:35,465
Too bad. He is the one who broke the promise.

626
00:50:36,135 --> 00:50:38,434
I even gave him advice...

627
00:50:38,434 --> 00:50:40,575
to win a woman's heart with delicious food.

628
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:44,805
How is it?

629
00:50:45,104 --> 00:50:46,204
Then...

630
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:50,175
I also made this.

631
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:59,555
Are you happy that Lieutenant Jung is marrying Lady Sam Soon?

632
00:51:00,155 --> 00:51:01,854
You have been smiling since earlier.

633
00:51:02,555 --> 00:51:03,555
Me?

634
00:51:04,765 --> 00:51:07,834
Your heart is not in pain anymore to see them together?

635
00:51:09,734 --> 00:51:12,234
My heart still pounds,

636
00:51:12,734 --> 00:51:14,774
but it does not hurt as much as before.

637
00:51:15,905 --> 00:51:16,934
In fact,

638
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:19,475
I think I am happier than before.

639
00:51:22,414 --> 00:51:25,684
Some Agents of Love hear a sound,

640
00:51:26,515 --> 00:51:29,254
and some feel a certain energy.

641
00:51:30,015 --> 00:51:31,925
I wonder how you recognize a match.

642
00:51:34,495 --> 00:51:36,354
Lord, are you...

643
00:51:36,954 --> 00:51:38,664
We are late for ssireum.

644
00:51:38,664 --> 00:51:40,124
No, if we go now, we can still watch it.

645
00:51:40,834 --> 00:51:41,894
Wait for me.

646
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:43,934
Oh, right. Ssireum.

647
00:51:45,265 --> 00:51:47,175
We are late. Run.

648
00:51:53,075 --> 00:51:54,144
When I lift the rock,

649
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,845
catch the fish with this basket, understood?

650
00:51:59,445 --> 00:52:00,885
Geun Seok.

651
00:52:01,115 --> 00:52:02,414
Catch a lot!

652
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:04,584
Aunt Ye Jin.

653
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:07,394
If you raise your voice like that, you will only drive fish out.

654
00:52:08,095 --> 00:52:09,725
Be quiet.

655
00:52:10,465 --> 00:52:11,894
You are louder.

656
00:52:13,365 --> 00:52:14,495
Are you ready?

657
00:52:16,794 --> 00:52:19,504
One, two, three.

658
00:52:21,934 --> 00:52:23,004
I caught a fish.

659
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:25,745
We should do it again.

660
00:52:26,144 --> 00:52:28,575
Yes. Let us catch two this time.

661
00:52:28,575 --> 00:52:29,615
Okay.

662
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:33,445
One, two, three.

663
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:36,115
I caught another one.

664
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:38,524
You are good at it.

665
00:52:47,234 --> 00:52:49,064
For whom is this jehotang...

666
00:52:50,035 --> 00:52:51,965
when I do not see anyone?

667
00:52:53,734 --> 00:52:56,104
Whatever. I did my best.

668
00:52:56,834 --> 00:52:58,004
Lady Doo Ri.

669
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,075
Lady Doo Ri!

670
00:53:01,715 --> 00:53:02,914
Are you Lady Doo Ri?

671
00:53:03,675 --> 00:53:05,914
Lady Yeoju told me to reserve a spot...

672
00:53:05,914 --> 00:53:07,414
for you.

673
00:53:08,055 --> 00:53:09,084
This way.

674
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:12,024
How meticulous.

675
00:53:15,394 --> 00:53:17,294
Excuse me. One second.

676
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:18,325
Come here.

677
00:53:18,325 --> 00:53:19,865
Oh, dear.

678
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:23,265
Here we go.

679
00:53:27,774 --> 00:53:29,234
I thought you were not coming.

680
00:53:30,305 --> 00:53:31,905
What are you talking about? I am not here for you.

681
00:53:34,414 --> 00:53:37,445
I shall win and give the cotton cloth to this lady!

682
00:53:37,445 --> 00:53:38,484
Great!

683
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:42,385
Why? You should not.

684
00:53:44,024 --> 00:53:45,584
Come to the center.

685
00:53:46,084 --> 00:53:48,024
- We should start. - Come now.

686
00:53:48,024 --> 00:53:49,095
- Hurry. - Let us start.

687
00:53:51,325 --> 00:53:52,524
What is wrong with him?

688
00:53:54,294 --> 00:53:56,064
Now then, grab the satba.

689
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:03,374
- Ready. - Go for it.

690
00:54:03,604 --> 00:54:04,675
Begin!

691
00:54:10,945 --> 00:54:12,015
Darn it.

692
00:54:12,345 --> 00:54:13,785
- Oh, no. - No!

693
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,015
Hang in there!

694
00:54:26,524 --> 00:54:27,564
Keep watching me.

695
00:54:38,745 --> 00:54:41,945
- The blue satba wins! - The blue satba!

696
00:54:43,274 --> 00:54:44,314
Good grief.

697
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:47,914
Seriously.

698
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:49,385
What a fool.

699
00:54:49,615 --> 00:54:51,254
Why look at me in that situation?

700
00:54:52,885 --> 00:54:54,095
How embarrassing.

701
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:16,615
You said you would give me the cotton cloth if you won.

702
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:18,015
But how could you lose in the first match?

703
00:55:19,044 --> 00:55:20,215
That man earlier...

704
00:55:20,914 --> 00:55:22,385
was a front-runner.

705
00:55:23,555 --> 00:55:25,055
Sure, he was.

706
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:27,854
Drink this.

707
00:55:32,294 --> 00:55:34,135
Did you bring this for me?

708
00:55:35,595 --> 00:55:36,635
No.

709
00:55:36,934 --> 00:55:39,104
I am giving it to you because the one for it did not come.

710
00:55:40,564 --> 00:55:42,604
You get punished for wasting food, no?

711
00:55:43,834 --> 00:55:46,104
I am grateful to that guy who did not show up.

712
00:55:53,385 --> 00:55:54,385
Oh, right.

713
00:55:54,814 --> 00:55:56,615
I cannot give you the cotton cloth,

714
00:55:57,015 --> 00:55:58,624
but I do have something for you.

715
00:56:08,095 --> 00:56:09,135
But why?

716
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:11,504
It is to apologize for the incident when we first met.

717
00:56:12,064 --> 00:56:14,504
And I bought it thinking it would look good on you.

718
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:52,675
You must be bummed out not being able to participate...

719
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:54,644
in the ssireum match because of me.

720
00:56:55,575 --> 00:56:58,515
There will be ssireum matches in Chuseok.

721
00:56:59,245 --> 00:57:00,314
So do not worry.

722
00:57:01,715 --> 00:57:02,754
Listen.

723
00:57:05,385 --> 00:57:07,425
Live a happy life with your future wife.

724
00:57:11,365 --> 00:57:12,925
You should also take the state examination...

725
00:57:13,794 --> 00:57:14,995
and not just focus on farming.

726
00:57:16,635 --> 00:57:18,135
After all, you are smart.

727
00:57:25,845 --> 00:57:26,874
All right.

728
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:30,945
You should live happily too.

729
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:44,265
- Yes! - Good job!

730
00:57:44,825 --> 00:57:46,725
- Nice. - That is it.

731
00:57:46,725 --> 00:57:48,865
Yes, trip him. Use your leg.

732
00:57:53,664 --> 00:57:54,934
Are they not there?

733
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:57,204
I am worried about Lady Doo Ri. I must check up on her.

734
00:57:57,504 --> 00:57:58,575
Goodness.

735
00:58:03,945 --> 00:58:04,984
Excuse me.

736
00:58:05,245 --> 00:58:07,754
Have you not seen Lady Doo Ri at the ssireum field?

737
00:58:08,354 --> 00:58:10,115
Oh, I have.

738
00:58:10,555 --> 00:58:14,024
But she headed that way with a scholar.

739
00:58:15,894 --> 00:58:17,394
Did you act as a matchmaker?

740
00:58:18,524 --> 00:58:21,195
No wonder he was good-looking.

741
00:58:22,294 --> 00:58:23,595
Thank you for telling me.

742
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:29,934
Lady Doo Ri is all set. Let us go to the swings now.

743
00:58:34,245 --> 00:58:37,215
Why does everyone say Bachelor 24 is handsome?

744
00:58:53,265 --> 00:58:54,934
Welcome. Have a look.

745
00:58:54,934 --> 00:58:56,265
We have sea bream.

746
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,925
What took you so long?

747
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:21,825
I am extremely nervous.

748
00:59:22,354 --> 00:59:23,695
Do not tense up.

749
00:59:23,695 --> 00:59:25,365
Just proceed as you have practiced.

750
00:59:26,765 --> 00:59:30,135
By the way, why is Lady Ha Na not with you?

751
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:34,905
There she comes.

752
00:59:35,334 --> 00:59:36,734
My gosh, what a beauty.

753
00:59:36,734 --> 00:59:38,704
Which family is she from?

754
00:59:38,845 --> 00:59:40,204
I am shocked.

755
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:51,285
The main goal is to walk to the swings...

756
00:59:51,285 --> 00:59:53,155
to make the scholar ask for your family's approval.

757
00:59:53,155 --> 00:59:54,624
(The groom asks the bride for marriage approval.)

758
00:59:54,624 --> 00:59:56,394
The scholar you met eyes with at Sunhwa Temple...

759
00:59:56,394 --> 00:59:58,195
when you gave advice. Remember him?

760
00:59:59,624 --> 01:00:01,365
We did not meet eyes.

761
01:00:01,865 --> 01:00:04,164
It was a one-sided stare from that scholar.

762
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:08,035
That scholar will participate in the May Festival swing contest.

763
01:00:09,475 --> 01:00:11,274
I thought of him as nothing but a rich nerd.

764
01:00:11,745 --> 01:00:12,745
But not bad.

765
01:00:12,745 --> 01:00:14,575
When you see him at the swing field,

766
01:00:14,774 --> 01:00:16,215
approach him naturally.

767
01:00:19,584 --> 01:00:21,354
Getting too close makes you look easy.

768
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:25,825
But the scholar will not recognize you...

769
01:00:25,825 --> 01:00:27,285
from afar due to the crowd.

770
01:00:31,865 --> 01:00:33,925
Stop when you are five steps away from him.

771
01:00:34,394 --> 01:00:36,164
If we are five steps away,

772
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,265
how will he make conversation with me?

773
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,664
Wait, she is right.

774
01:00:43,834 --> 01:00:45,745
I dislike loud men.

775
01:00:51,715 --> 01:00:54,954
The scholar will take the remaining four steps.

776
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:06,425
Do they not look good together,

777
01:01:06,894 --> 01:01:08,664
standing near each other?

778
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:11,004
We should stop being a third wheel.

779
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,135
Let us watch them from a distance.

780
01:01:37,495 --> 01:01:39,695
It is my first time enjoying the May Festival.

781
01:01:40,595 --> 01:01:42,894
It is better than I thought.

782
01:01:45,465 --> 01:01:46,535
Your first time?

783
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:50,604
What did you do during the May Festival until now?

784
01:01:50,704 --> 01:01:51,905
I hated crowded places,

785
01:01:51,905 --> 01:01:53,644
so I was at home reading books alone.

786
01:01:54,345 --> 01:01:57,675
That, too, is not as bad as you think it is.

787
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:01,684
Since you came this year,

788
01:02:02,254 --> 01:02:04,215
you should continue to do so starting next year.

789
01:02:08,655 --> 01:02:11,265
My plan is to enjoy the May Festival with you from next year onwards.

790
01:02:18,834 --> 01:02:20,905
There is no need to forget about your late husband.

791
01:02:24,845 --> 01:02:26,644
I, too, have not forgotten about the Princess.

792
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:29,245
Like you,

793
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:33,345
I will not be able to forget her all my life.

794
01:02:36,385 --> 01:02:37,454
However,

795
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:40,254
I surely have feelings for you.

796
01:02:42,555 --> 01:02:43,655
Do you...

797
01:02:46,765 --> 01:02:47,865
not feel the same?

798
01:03:23,334 --> 01:03:26,164
(The Matchmakers)

799
01:03:41,914 --> 01:03:43,914
Do you believe in fates?

800
01:03:44,385 --> 01:03:45,954
A man and a woman's predestined bond...

801
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:47,624
No!

802
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:49,495
is similar to fate.

803
01:03:50,055 --> 01:03:52,265
Will we not go through what your husband did...

804
01:03:52,265 --> 01:03:53,695
to your son eight years ago?

805
01:03:54,535 --> 01:03:55,834
Do you have someone in mind?

806
01:03:58,104 --> 01:03:59,104
Bachelor 12.

807
01:03:59,504 --> 01:04:01,035
Do not lose this lady.

808
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:02,575
The symptoms are telling me...

809
01:04:02,575 --> 01:04:04,374
that you are the Agent of Love, my lord.

810
01:04:05,004 --> 01:04:06,774
Are you going to get rid of them?

811
01:04:07,204 --> 01:04:08,215
We should...

812
01:04:08,745 --> 01:04:10,814
never meet again.

813
01:04:26,995 --> 01:04:29,934
