1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:10,700

2
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,270

3
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,370

4
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,880

5
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,860
- The thing is— 
 - The thing is—

6
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,920
You can go first.

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,160
I am fine, you can go first.

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,940
Should I?

9
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,720
I think I am better than him at matchmaking.

10
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,170
I am Ssangyeonsulsa.

11
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,070
Exactly.

12
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:19,550
I was not even born a Ssangyeonsulsa, but I am almost as good as His Excellency.

13
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,240
So I am better than him, am I not?

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:26,070
I probably would have conquered the matchmaking market if I were born a woman.

15
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:29,730
Oh, with your resentful personality?

16
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,870
In matchmaking, you must cater to many madams and their tempers.

17
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,440
Why would I have to cater to their tempers?

18
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:39,790
When my chest accurately recognizes fates.

19
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,010

20
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,740

21
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,070
Are you not going to tell me which family the Young Master is from?

22
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,900
I have a matter I must settle with his family first.

23
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,570
So, I will when the time is right.

24
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,300
Could he be the crown prince?

25
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:25,550
Oh, my. The hiccups of truth?

26
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,750
Amazing. I was only second-guessing.

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,120
It is a secret to other people.

28
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,250
Although I do think Lady Ha Na already knows.

29
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,510
I guess the heavens really do match fated ones together.

30
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,040
How did Lady Ha Na meet the crown prince who is inside the palace?

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,440
How amazing.

32
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,850
I will hear it from Crown Prince later and tell you.

33
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,470
How did you first meet Princess, Your Excellency?

34
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:08,810

35
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,520
  Even now, after eight years have passed,

36
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,100
  I still cannot explain why I walked up to that

37
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,040
  court maid and stood in front of her like a fool instead of

38
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,160
  going to Sungkyunkwan.

39
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,990
I think I was probably

40
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,890
worried about her.

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:19,950
The sight of her looking around the insignificant street with sparkling eyes.

42
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,700
Worried, my foot.

43
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,320
You mean you fell in love at first sight.

44
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,810
And then?

45
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,440
I asked where she was going and

46
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,020
she said she had about two hours free,

47
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,250
so she wanted to visit the market street.

48
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:44,540
Even then, I did not go to crowded places because of my chest pain.

49
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,950
But it did not matter.

50
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:52,130
Because my heart was racing from the beginning.

51
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,490
Princess also hid her identity like me.

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,060
And then?

53
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:09,780
After two hours, she went back to the palace and

54
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,850
I was constantly reminded of her, although I knew

55
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:16,950
not to dare have feelings for a court maid.

56
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,130
And I met her again after a few months when I went to His Majesty to ask him

57
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,420
not to choose me as the princess's husband.

58
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,620
 All right. I heard you have something to tell me about marrying the princess.

59
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,120
 Huh?

60
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,630
 Looks like they have fallen in love, huh?

61
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,890
I do not remember what I told His Majesty that day.

62
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,060
But I do remember one thing for sure.

63
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,230
That I was extremely happy.

64
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,070
Are you disappointed you are not the first person I fell for?

65
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,580
Yes.

66
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:32,470
I am deeply disappointed.

67
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,070
 That was a lie.

68
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:40,170
 Because he was not forced to marry Princess,

69
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:44,360
 I actually liked him more.

70
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:47,990
To hear you are deeply disappointed,

71
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,170
I am more glad than ever.

72
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:17,590
Did you come because you were reminded of your first son and his wife?

73
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,750
Because we do not ask about their backgrounds,

74
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:33,070
I did not know Monk So Cheon was from Namjang Party.

75
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,530
When will I be able to meet the monk?

76
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:41,540
Since the Left State Minister is also looking for him,

77
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,690
we are looking and asking around everywhere we can.

78
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:51,640
You said the matchmaker met the monk as well. Right?

79
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:55,900
Yes, that is what I was told.

80
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,370
The one helping His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae's matchmaking is...

81
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,760
Yeojudaek, who set up Ye Jin. Right?

82
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,470
Yes, Madam. Should I tell her to visit?

83
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,290
No, I must meet her now.

84
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,800
Even though I am a Ssangyeonsulsa,

85
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,330
I also need to see something to feel something.

86
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,310
Not at all. You already felt it.

87
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:47,370
You remember choosing Old Bachelor Number 16 for Lady Du Ri. Right?

88
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,900
  If you care about the future of the three daughters,

89
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,440
  number 16 with the greatest potential to take office is better for her.

90
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:07,880
Back then, I was too arrogant because I thought I was a Ssangyeonsulsa.

91
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,310
This is how they find their fated ones.

92
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:19,200
I was only speaking based on the conditions, so I am not certain.

93
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,750
We can confirm it right now.

94
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,030
How?

95
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,460
I am fine with anyone.

96
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,780
Men are all about the same.

97
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:33,120
I cannot prevent our youngest from marrying because of me.

98
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,290
Thank you. You will not be disappointed.

99
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,060
Thank you.

100
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,370
What brings you here, Your Excellency?

101
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,490
I came to match you because there is a woman who is

102
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,050
the perfect fit for you, Number 16 Scholar.

103
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,970
I already have a woman in mind.

104
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,290
Sorry? Have you already gotten engaged to that woman?

105
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,750
To be honest, I could not even talk to her yet.

106
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:11,170
However, I passed the general exams this time and am trying to take courage.

107
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:15,170
Do you mind telling me which family she is from?

108
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,470
Well, she is...

109
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,230
Master Maeng's second daughter who is good at sewing.

110
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:24,300
I have been thinking of her for a while.

111
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,480
I fell for her when I first saw her at Temple Seonhwa on Buddha's Birthday.

112
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,690
As expected, a Ssangyeonsulsa is accurate.

113
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,770
Since we also found Lady Du Ri's match,

114
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:45,810
I'm starting to see the end of this matchmaking.

115
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,300
Which family are you from, Madam?

116
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,700
I am—

117
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,470
Never mind.

118
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:07,560
I think I would be better off not knowing.

119
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:11,920
Let us...

120
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,660
stop by somewhere.

121
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,190
This is where I used to live.

122
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:28,400
From age eight to 17.

123
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,440
My father's family had ups and downs, so we always moved within Hanyang.

124
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,390
But I liked it when I was living here.

125
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,470
Mother was alive, then, too.

126
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,770
I also grew up in this neighborhood.

127
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:49,430
Really?

128
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,500
I thought you lived in a big house since birth.

129
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,990
My late father had no skills in building wealth.

130
00:11:57,690 --> 00:11:59,990
My father was the same.

131
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,090
To such a father,

132
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:11,640
I said some harsh things, asking if he was happy to gain a big house in Bukchon

133
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,270
by selling his son.

134
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,900
I found out much later that...

135
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:22,810
he was only worried I might suffer because of my flawed personality

136
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:29,340
if I take public office when His Majesty told me.

137
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:33,490
I think fathers' problems are that they never tell you things clearly.

138
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:36,060
When he passed away,

139
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,860
he apologized for marrying me off to the princess.

140
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:44,210
But I am always regretful that I never told him that...

141
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,440
I was not forced to marry the princess.

142
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,370
He probably knew.

143
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:59,140
He just did not tell you.

144
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,310
Thank you for saying that.

145
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,040
The weather is perfect for drying out your feelings today.

146
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,800
I guess we might have met in the past since we grew up in the same neighborhood.

147
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,190
How would it have been if we met back then?

148
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,510
We probably would not even have exchanged greetings.

149
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,830
Because a prickly goody-two-shoes is not my preferred type.

150
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:55,330
I also do not prefer a distracted type like you.

151
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,830
I am so glad we did not meet back then.

152
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,050
I am ever so glad we met now.

153
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:26,430
 Do not work too hard, and just do your wage's worth.

154
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:30,550
 Wife, how can you say such unethical—

155
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,260
 I will be home soon.

156
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,360
What are you doing in my house?

157
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,090
- The thing is— 
 - We stopped by to receive the great energy you have here.

158
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:59,000
Do not sell this house and make sure to keep it.

159
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,740
O-Okay. Thank you.

160
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,800
You are making a profit.

161
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,470
Do you also know a lot about feng shui?

162
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,820
I said whatever came to mind so he would not think we were thieves.

163
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:19,510
I learned all of this from you.

164
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,210
As expected, you exceeded your youth.

165
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,180
My youth...

166
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:26,420
It is not youth—

167
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,930
You should refrain from idioms—

168
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,520
Never mind! I can teach you.

169
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,780
What is wrong?

170
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:14,090
O-Oh, I am sorry.

171
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:17,860
I hid away for a moment because the Left State Minister's wife was there.

172
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,850
You also know her. Right? The figurehead of Joseon.

173
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,630
I do.

174
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:27,240
But why are you avoiding the Left State Minister's wife?

175
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:31,290
Well, she does not want me to succeed in matchmaking.

176
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,680
So, I did not want to be seen with a matchmaker.

177
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,210
By chance, is she on her way to Yeojudaek?

178
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,040
I have somewhere to be, so please excuse me!

179
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,590
Wait, where do you have to be—

180
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:45,480
W-Where are you—

181
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,140
At least tell me where you—

182
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,600
Is she not home?

183
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,300
We need to boil it before drying it to store it for a long time.

184
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,520
What brings you all the way here, Madam?

185
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:29,060
You could have called for me.

186
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,280
My goodness, Madam!

187
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,490
You need to tell me what the matter is!

188
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:52,680
I did not come because of my daughter's marriage.

189
00:17:54,870 --> 00:18:01,500
Why did you go to see Monk So Cheon with His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

190
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,510
S-Sorry?

191
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:20,170
You did not run into Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong?

192
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:22,690
She was here just now.

193
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,700
Bad inklings about things are almost always right.

194
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,150
Lee clearly said it was Yeojudaek.

195
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,010
Gosh, this woman, seriously.

196
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:44,440
Find the matchmaker who accompanies Prince Gyeongwoonjae

197
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,320
and bring her to me right away!

198
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,490
Yes, Madam.

199
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,060
She asked why you met Monk So Cheon? Not about the matchmaking for Master Maeng's family?

200
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,650
Yes.

201
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:02,480
But I do not know the situation, so I could not give an excuse.

202
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,690
How did she know I went to see Monk So Cheon with His Excellency?

203
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:11,100
Who is that scholar, and why do you still accompany him?

204
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,140
Come on, now!

205
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,880
No reason. We just do matchmaking together.

206
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,660
Because he is a Ssangyeonsulsa.

207
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,760
Ssangyeonsul—

208
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:25,110
What is that?

209
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:27,780
One who recognizes nuptial fates.

210
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,570
Joyakdol! 
  (A small stone)

211
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,150
I told you to go without me.

212
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,760
I cannot even come with you because I am dressed like this.

213
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,720
This is my way of calming down my feelings.

214
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,350
Looking long enough until I can get no more.

215
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,790
If you go on first, I will follow you from three steps away.

216
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:20,720
How is it so hard to marry a noble family's widow?

217
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:26,310
What is the use even if my appeal letter is accepted?

218
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:31,890
When Joseon's laws are so inflexible!

219
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,770
Goodness, goodness!

220
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,880
Crown Prince, are you feeling unwell?

221
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,630
My heart is unwell.

222
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,730
Is it because of Lady Ha Na of Namsan Village?

223
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,790
How did you know?

224
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,430
Why do you like Lady Ha Na?

225
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:22,150
Because Lady Ha Na is one of the wisest people I know.

226
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,050
She sure is smart.

227
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:32,060
I knew you would know about Lady Ha Na's wisdom, that is masked behind her looks.

228
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,150
Crown Prince, this is a secret.

229
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:41,610
I met the Ssangyeonsulsa I have been looking for.

230
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:47,130
He let me know you and Lady Ha Na are fated to be together by the heavens.

231
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,510
Is that true?

232
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,550
Therefore, I plan to promote a marriage between you two.

233
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:57,340
So please trust me and wait a little.

234
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,280
 Mother, this is Geun Seok's mother.

235
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,070
Come in.

236
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,440
I organized the goods servant Kim delivered until yesterday.

237
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,290
All right.

238
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:42,100
Who is the letter from?

239
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:50,070
It is the one my first son sent me when he was in Pyeongyangbu.

240
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,540
Back then, I did not know he would pass so vainly and

241
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:57,930
told him there was no need to send greeting letters often while he was busy.

242
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:00,470
But now, I regret saying such things.

243
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:06,800
Did you go to Temple Seonhwa today because you were reminded of Brother-in-law?

244
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,730
I am reminded of him more often lately.

245
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:15,500
Because it feels like I did not know my son very well.

246
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,200
I told you some foolish things.

247
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,120
We will visit Royal Consort Sookbin the day after tomorrow,

248
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,390
so get yourself and Geun Seok prepared.

249
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,350
Me, too?

250
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,170
Your Excellency.

251
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,620
What you said was right, Your Excellency.

252
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:50,680
The merchant who sold the geumjam poison back then was an interpreter from the Ming Dynasty.

253
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,080
Are you certain?

254
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,460
Yes, I saw that he is currently staying at Taepyeonggwan.

255
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,430
All right.

256
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,500
I will report this to His Majesty the day after tomorrow when I enter the palace.

257
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:07,590
Left State Minister's household will face a bloodbath for treason now, huh?

258
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,470
Why would she want to bring me along as well?

259
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,650
Because you will soon be the madam of the house,

260
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,190
so she must be telling you to be close to Royal Consort Sookbin.

261
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,710
But Mother is so healthy.

262
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:35,530
I think my mother is also aging.

263
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:41,230
Lately, she has talked to me a lot about my older brother.

264
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,060
Why are you drinking so much today?

265
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,460
When did I ever have a reason for drinking?

266
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,070
Are you still...

267
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,420
unable to forget the orabeoni who farms?

268
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,950
Does anything change just because I cannot forget him?

269
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,870
That orabeoni is getting married now.

270
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:20,920
Did you ever think about marrying him, Ye Jin?

271
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,510
No. Never.

272
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:25,220
Because I never had the time.

273
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,260
My brothers left this world when they were too young.

274
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,980
So I cannot be a baby and insist I marry someone I love.

275
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,670
At least, I have to marry a family who is an equal to us

276
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:42,310
to help Geun Seok when he takes office in the future.

277
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:01,550
Ye Jin, when did you grow up so much?

278
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:08,180
I am so ashamed of going around thinking only about myself.

279
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:11,840
What? What are you ashamed of?

280
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,270
For being a matchmaker?

281
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,340
Thanks to that, I got myself a good husband!

282
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:19,410
Gosh, why are you crying?

283
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,430
Don't cry.

284
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:27,650
I'm sorry.

285
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,190
Why are you crying?

286
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,700
You are doing great.

287
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,490

288
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:18,140
Goodness.

289
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:23,330
How come you came dressed like this today?

290
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:27,560
Because I have to go home early for a family matter.

291
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:31,530
Just because you disclosed your identity, you cannot be so careless—

292
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,660

293
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:37,940
I wrote some tips that would help during the wedding.

294
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:49,260
It lists hairdressers, wedding planners, and their addresses.

295
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:54,030
I already gave everyone on the list a word so they will help out with the wedding.

296
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,440
Why are you telling me all this?

297
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,520
You can do it yourself.

298
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,940
Right, Yeojudaek will be doing the makeup for the bride.

299
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,400
You know Yeojudaek. Right?

300
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,540
Is something wrong?

301
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,410
- Why? 
 - You are not looking at me while saying all this.

302
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,480
Your Excellency,

303
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,870
I can no longer...

304
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:36,420
Oh Bong, why are you leaving already?

305
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,910
Did you finish all the work I gave you?

306
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:43,380
Madam, I will hear you out next time.

307
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:45,570
I have an urgent matter.

308
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,970
Your Excellency, did you tell me to do something? I was just—

309
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,740
Good job.

310
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,610
Sorry?

311
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,710
I will just tell him I will quit next time I see him.

312
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,810
Seeing him for a couple more days will not hurt.

313
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,870
As you guaranteed,

314
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:44,000
it looks like my feelings will never calm down, Madam.

315
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:46,800
Therefore,

316
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,290
I must see you for even a day more if I can.

317
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,670

318
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,020
Do you remember the murder of the Deputy Mayor that happened in Pyeongyangbu eight years ago?

319
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,270
That is when a robber murdered the Left State Minister's first son.

320
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,990
You said you have something to report about Crown Prince's abductor, so why bring that up suddenly?

321
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:32,520
That case is the beginning of the current case of Crown Prince's abduction.

322
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,090
Jo In Hyeon, who was investigating the corruption in Pyeongyangbu back then,

323
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:40,110
knew his father and Pyeongyang's inspector, Park Bok Gi, had planned treason.

324
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,410
I think the evidence of treason Jo In Hyeon found was the geumjam poison.

325
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:47,720

326
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,560

These letters contain not only evidence of stealing from the tributes

327
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:53,870
 but also of treason for attempting to murder Grand Prince Woon Hae.

328
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,300
That means...

329
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:59,440
Left State Minister attempted to kill Crown Prince eight years ago as well?

330
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:04,470
Yes. Jo In Hyeon accidentally found out this fact while investigating the corruption.

331
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:07,570
But he was killed by his father, Jo Young Bae, by accident.

332
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:09,850
What are you saying now?

333
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,710
What about telling Sister the truth and asking for her help?

334
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,700
That can never happen.

335
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,640
Once my wife finds out I killed In Hyeon,

336
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:25,160
her emotions will carry her away as a mother, and

337
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,930
create unnecessary disputes within the family,

338
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,460
instead of staying rationally sound to judge right from wrong.

339
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:38,110
That is a hard way to say you are scared that Sister will abandon you.

340
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:44,130
Since things came down to this, let us get rid of Gyeongwoonjae together.

341
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:49,910
If Gyeongwoonjae uses his intelligence to find out what we did eight years ago,

342
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,080
getting abandoned by Sister is not the problem.

343
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:56,360
It will be over for all of us.

344
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,840
Do not worry.

345
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,620
I will take it into my own hands this time.

346
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,690
When I think about losing my warehouse goods and

347
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,750
Maeng Ha Na because of Gyeongwoonjae,

348
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,040
I get so angry.

349
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:19,970
I could not look into the details of the devastating death of the Left State Minister's first son

350
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,010
because of Princess' death back then.

351
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:26,950
But such a backstory existed, huh?

352
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,610
But nothing happened to Crown Prince at the time.

353
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,050
But Princess died instead,

354
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:38,800
and we could not figure out that she was poisoned to death

355
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,450
so it was wrapped up as a sudden death.

356
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:45,350
The Left State Minister tried to harm Crown Prince with the geumjam poison again.

357
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,530
Since we confirmed that a Ming interpreter purchased the poison,

358
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:54,390
you will be able to uncover the Left State Minister's treason if you arrest and interrogate him.

359
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,000
It is not difficult to arrest the interpreter at Taepyeonggwan, but...

360
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:04,980
Is something weighing on you?

361
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:10,470
Is not Park Bok Gi the uncle of Prince Jin Seong?

362
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:15,990
If his treason is found out, I am afraid that Prince Jin Seong will also be in danger.

363
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:24,330
However, I cannot just do nothing when Crown Prince was almost killed twice in one month.

364
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:26,070
All right.

365
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:30,910
I will arrest that interpreter and interrogate him.

366
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,710
How is your visit to the palace?

367
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,050
It is better than I imagined.

368
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:48,170
Geun Seok is becoming more like the eldest nephew as he grows older.

369
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,930
Geun Seok's mother is handling most of the household work now.

370
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,540
Sister praises you a lot,

371
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:03,470
saying you are wise in taking care of business

372
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:06,430
and taking good care of Ye Jin and Geun Seok.

373
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,500
All I did was do what Mother told me to do.

374
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:16,510
That is right. Nothing goes wrong if you do what Sister says.

375
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,880
I will keep that in mind.

376
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,140
I told the Minister of Justice about the document

377
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,760
from eight years ago, so I will let you know as soon as I get it.

378
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,640
I will be waiting.

379
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,610
Mother,

380
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:51,050
is the legal document that you asked of Royal Consort Sookbin

381
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,040
regarding Brother-in-law's case from eight years ago?

382
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:03,910
I am just guessing based on what you said the other day.

383
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:07,270
Your face seems to be full of worry, Mother.

384
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:17,680
At first, I thought you were quite strange.

385
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,180
Everyone was afraid of me, but you were not.

386
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:26,220
You asked me if you were curious about anything without hesitation,

387
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:31,130
and spoke up whenever you thought something was wrong without getting timid.

388
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:35,120
I often felt comforted...

389
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:38,820
by your actions.

390
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:45,400
And I feel the same way right now.

391
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:51,390
What you are thinking is correct.

392
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,040
Maybe it is because I was not by his side when he died,

393
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:02,640
but I keep thinking about how I do not even know how he died despite being his mother,

394
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,980
so I am looking into what happened with my firstborn son.

395
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,780
Though I do not know what use it is after eight years have passed...

396
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,440
Master.

397
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,060
What are you doing here?

398
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,490
Master, this is my mother.

399
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,630
You must be on your way back from seeing the king.

400
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:32,930
Your Excellency.

401
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,250
Oh, yes.

402
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:39,960
Then we shall be on our way.

403
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:21,780
  Since we confirmed that a Ming interpreter purchased the poison,

404
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,300
  you will be able to uncover the Left State Minister's treason if you arrest and interrogate him.

405
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:34,370

406
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,890
Arrest His Excellency Park Bok Gi right away!

407
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,510
What are you saying all of a sudden?

408
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:49,030
I could have put your younger sister to death for treason.

409
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:27,020
What is it that you are uncharacteristically hesitant to speak?

410
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,680
Mother.

411
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:42,860
I am...

412
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,430
Yeojudaek, the one called the goddess of matchmaking.

413
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,500
What do you mean by that?

414
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,580
To be honest, not only was I lending books,

415
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,230
but I also did matchmaking.

416
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,350
I was also the one who did the matchmaking for Lady Ye Jin.

417
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,290
What did you say?

418
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:11,170
So, I fooled you into thinking that I was Yeojudaek, who makes facial powder.

419
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,470
I am sorry.

420
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,650
Does that mean you were the one who did the matchmaking for

421
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:25,930
Master Maeng's daughters with His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

422
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,980
Yes.

423
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:39,370
What is the reason you are telling me the truth now?

424
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:47,690
I felt I should tell you about what I heard from Monk So Cheon about Brother-in-law's death.

425
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:03,230
So, are you saying you reported the Left State Minister and His Excellency Park Bok Gi

426
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,640
for what happened eight years ago as treason to the King?

427
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,650
I did so without knowing that Yeojudaek was your younger sister, Officer.

428
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:12,710
So you should have told me earlier.

429
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,500
The king already knows about the treason.

430
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,680
What difference would it make if I arrested His Excellency Park Bok Gi for murder?

431
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,960
Fortunately, the king is worried about Prince Jin Seong's safety.

432
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,340
So?

433
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,120
If Park Bok Gi and the Left State Minister are charged with treason,

434
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:36,540
then Prince Jin Seong will not be able to avoid punishment.

435
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:40,900
Therefore, if I find a severe crime charge to remove him from office and speak to the king again,

436
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,150
he will probably not charge them for treason.

437
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,730
For that reason, I can arrest His Excellency Park Bok Gi immediately for murdering Lee Cho Ok. However,

438
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,800
all we have is circumstantial evidence,

439
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,910
and all the witnesses will not agree to testify because they fear retribution.

440
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:57,550
I have a plan regarding that.

441
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:03,610
Everything is set for Park Bok Gi, so let us look for a severe crime for the Left State Minister.

442
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:04,850
Pardon?

443
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:09,330
Would you not be better at investigation than me, Officer?

444
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:11,080
That is true.

445
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:26,000
It must have been hard to summon the courage to tell me. Thank you for letting me know.

446
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:33,710
How will Prince Gyeongwoonjae handle what happened eight years ago?

447
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:37,560
His Excellency did not know I was a noblewoman either,

448
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,270
so he only said it would be difficult to prove Yeojudaek's innocence by revealing this fact.

449
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:45,550
Ye Jin and Geun Seok will be...

450
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:49,700
gravely hurt if they discover this.

451
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,370
Be very careful to make sure they never find out.

452
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:57,100
Yes, I will keep that in mind.

453
00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:00,740
Also, just because you confessed to it yourself

454
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,110
does not mean I forgave you for deceiving me and going around with another man.

455
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:11,160
Until I speak to you again, do not leave our home for the time being.

456
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,710
If you disobey me this time, I will not forgive you.

457
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,140
Thank you for trying so hard to help my younger sister.

458
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,640
It is what I should do.

459
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:46,040
Do you love her?

460
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,510
Now that you know who my younger sister is, do not meet her anymore.

461
00:44:57,510 --> 00:44:59,740
This is not a request,

462
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:04,520
but my warning to you as Soon Deok's brother.

463
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,010
Your Excellency, please come over here.

464
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:30,430
Do you not think Madam Yoo's suicide is a bit strange?

465
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,110
You are right.

466
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:35,060
She would have known that her husband was gay,

467
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,580
so it is weird how she followed her husband to death, leaving behind a young son.

468
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:41,540
At the scene of what happened, Madam Yoo...

469
00:45:43,270 --> 00:45:46,620

470
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,510
Madam Yoo was also at the scene.

471
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:59,710
So, it was not a suicide, but she was killed to shut her up...

472
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,990
I cannot believe I spent all those years not knowing...

473
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,340
Your mother...

474
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:47,470
Your mother is sorry.

475
00:47:28,570 --> 00:47:31,560
Are you really giving it to me?

476
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,960
Yeah. You have wanted it.

477
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,350
I do not need it anymore.

478
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:43,420
Are you not going to do matchmaking anymore?

479
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,200
Yeah. I do not think I can anymore.

480
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,210
I remember.

481
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:05,480
Maybe it was because Madam Yoo committed suicide as soon as the Minister's wife arrived at Pyeongyangbu,

482
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:09,780
but there were widespread rumors about how she was coerced into hanging herself by her mother-in-law.

483
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:14,100
But everyone in Hanyang seems to believe that is true.

484
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,170
To tell you the truth, that rumor spread because at the time

485
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:25,380
a coroner said at a drinking party that it was clear

486
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,780
Madam Yoo did not hang herself but someone killed her

487
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:32,630
and then hung her.

488
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:36,670
So, she did not hang herself.

489
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,380
Madam Yoo did not commit suicide.

490
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:45,100
By chance, do you know who killed her?

491
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:01,500
I did see the Left State Minister tie the dead Madam Yoo to the crossbeam.

492
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:20,300
It is not like we are meant to be. Why can I not forget him?

493
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,240
You can forget him.

494
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:28,040
I think I have nearly forgotten him.

495
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,010

496
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:44,190
His Majesty is not feeling well,

497
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:47,330
so he said he would hear your report tomorrow.

498
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,310
Is he very ill?

499
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,530
I believe he has a light muscle ache.

500
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:54,470
Goodness...

501
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,060
He does not typically postpone reports.

502
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,070
Goodness.

503
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:03,590
Is he very sick?

504
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:06,560
Goodness.

505
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:14,770
If you charge the Left State Minister and Park Bok Gi for a different crime and remove them from office,

506
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:19,500
you could prevent harm from befalling Prince Jin Seong and also protect Crown Prince.

507
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:22,100
What do you mean by other crimes they have committed?

508
00:51:22,100 --> 00:51:26,310
Park Bok Gi murdered Lee Cho Ok of Pildong last September.

509
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,940
Did you not say there was no corroborative evidence for that?

510
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:30,930
Many witnesses did not speak up for fear of retribution.

511
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:34,720
If we promise personal protection, I think we will be able to find a witness.

512
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,570
Is that so?

513
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,110
I have been feeling uneasy about that anyway. So that is good.

514
00:51:42,110 --> 00:51:45,720
The Left State Minister murdered his daughter-in-law, Madam Yoo, and reported it as a suicide,

515
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:47,850
so he is guilty of falsely receiving a memorial gate.

516
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:51,450
He killed his own daughter-in-law? This is crazy!

517
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:52,770
Do you have corroborative evidence?

518
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:56,060
The Officer of Pyeongyangbu at the time testified that

519
00:51:56,060 --> 00:51:59,660
he saw the Left State Minister tie Madam Yoo's body to the crossbeam.

520
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:02,170
Really?

521
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:07,950
But will the Left State Minister acknowledge his guilt just because of that man's testimony?

522
00:52:07,950 --> 00:52:11,040
Do you not have corroborative evidence of his treason, Your Majesty?

523
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,800
Tell them you will charge them with treason if they do not acknowledge their guilt.

524
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:19,010
Then, they will acknowledge their guilt.

525
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,060
I see.

526
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:24,370
They would choose to be removed from office for murder

527
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:28,300
rather than having their entire families put to death for treason.

528
00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:31,890
Only you and I must know about this.

529
00:52:31,890 --> 00:52:38,350
Things will get very complicated, especially if that inflexible Chief Royal Secretary finds out.

530
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:39,970
All right.

531
00:52:39,970 --> 00:52:45,190
Gosh, you are quite a genius.

532
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,520

533
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:59,540
I will be sleeping early today, so come back in the morning.

534
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,990
Yes, okay.

535
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,230
You do not need to prepare dinner.

536
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:23,020
Instead, the mayor and the junior deputy minister will come in about an hour,

537
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,450
so you just need to prepare the alcohol and snacks then.

538
00:53:25,450 --> 00:53:28,860
Yes, I understand.

539
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,750
Gae Dong, bye.

540
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:49,980
You must not make any mistakes this time.

541
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,300
Eliminating a nerd is a piece of cake.

542
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,810
I will return before the alcohol and snacks are brought in here.

543
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,820
I was here all night tonight.

544
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:40,730
I feel like something really bad is about to happen tonight.

545
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:46,700
What do you mean?

546
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,180
I overheard this while I was cleaning the men's quarters.

547
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,130
  Do not worry.

548
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,820
  I will take it into my own hands this time.

549
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,710
  When I think about losing my warehouse goods and

550
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,500
  Maeng Ha Na because of Gyeongwoonjae, I get so angry.

551
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,140
I think the person they talked about eliminating

552
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:17,390
was Young Master's tutor, His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

553
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,380
 Eliminating a nerd is a piece of cake.

554
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:30,410
Oh, Young Madam! Young Madam, where are you going?

555
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,570
Is that you outside, Oh Bong?

556
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:10,800
What are you doing here, Madam?

557
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,380
You should hurry up and escape!

558
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:15,430
My uncle is coming to kill you, Your Excellency!

559
00:57:27,130 --> 00:57:29,070
He is not here, either.

560
00:57:29,070 --> 00:57:32,520
You said he entered his home earlier. Why is he not here?

561
00:58:34,690 --> 00:58:37,310
Bring a lamp quickly!

562
00:59:07,070 --> 00:59:08,400

563
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:10,660

564
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:12,810

565
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:16,960
Gyeongwoonjae, that bastard.

566
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,630
When did he look into all of this?

567
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:21,680
This is not good.

568
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,230
Let us go back for now.

569
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,840
Okay.

570
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,160
Are you all right?

571
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:23,740
But did you come while you were cooking?

572
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,170
I was in such a rush...

573
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:31,550
Still, how could you come here dressed like this?

574
01:00:31,550 --> 01:00:34,250
What if someone sees you?

575
01:00:35,090 --> 01:00:37,760
Who cares if someone sees me?

576
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,680
I could not think about anything else

577
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:44,030
when I realized you might die, Your Excellency.

578
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,210
I am sorry...

579
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,350
for scaring you.

580
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:22,820
And...

581
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,790
thank you...

582
01:01:26,510 --> 01:01:28,760
for saving me like this.

583
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:34,300
I thought I could do it,

584
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:39,090
but I do not think I can...

585
01:01:53,130 --> 01:01:56,280
To go on and forget about you.

586
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,330
Did you only realize that now?

587
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:06,670
I knew it the moment I first saw you...

588
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:10,450
that you were someone I could never forget.

589
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:43,760
♫  The moment you faced me like the bright sunlight  ♫

590
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:50,880
♫  You came down into me, blindingly  ♫

591
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,910
♫  Among fates as countless as the stars  ♫

592
01:02:56,910 --> 01:03:02,750
♫  I met you like a miracle  ♫

593
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:10,350
♫  The wind is blowing again  ♫

594
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:19,000
♫  Do you know that my heart is wavering for you?  ♫

595
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:27,050
♫  That I love you, that you are the one  ♫

596
01:03:27,050 --> 01:03:33,730
♫  I tried to ignore it, but in the end, it was you  ♫

597
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:37,090
♫  That I love you  ♫

598
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:41,480

599
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:46,380
♫  I will love you slowly  ♫

600
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:53,420

601
01:03:55,470 --> 01:03:57,650
 I told you not to leave the house.

602
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,460
  I do not know if I can trust you anymore.

603
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:03,650
  The Eastern Palace's court maid woke up.

604
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:05,560
  What are you trying to do right now?

605
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:07,630
  I can make that happen.

606
01:04:07,630 --> 01:04:09,260
  What did you say?

607
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:10,990
  I am being framed!

608
01:04:10,990 --> 01:04:13,020
  Instead of asking how,

609
01:04:13,020 --> 01:04:16,520
  you should ask me what I want.

610
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:20,050
  It is my turn to fulfill my part of the deal.

611
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:22,000
  Stop meeting my daughter-in-law.

612
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:26,910
  If you keep meeting her, I will have to take the matter into my own hands.

613
01:04:26,910 --> 01:04:33,970
♫  That you are the one, I tried to ignore it...  ♫

614
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,230
