00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
- Well... - Well...

7
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,429
Please speak first.

8
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,630
No, you can speak first.

9
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:01,859
Shall I?

10
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,269
I believe I am a much better matchmaker.

11
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,799
I am the Agent of Love.

12
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,839
Precisely.

13
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,969
I was not even born as an Agent of Love,

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,009
but my skills were as great as yours, my lord.

15
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,880
Does that not make me much more amazing?

16
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,019
If I had been born as a woman,

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,220
I would have had the matchmaking market in my hands.

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,690
Sure, even with your temperamental personality?

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,588
Matchmaking requires humouring many different ladies.

20
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,830
There is no need to humour anybody...

21
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:36,399
because my heart can always spot which two are meant to be.

22
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,679
(Episode 12: Lovers Under a Time Limit)

(Young Master)

24
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,690
Will you not tell me which family that young master belongs to?

25
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:07,630
Right.

26
00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:11,000
There are things I must figure out with that family,

27
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:14,400
so I will find the right time to tell you.

28
00:02:15,269 --> 00:02:16,900
By any chance, is he the Crown Prince?

29
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,739
Oh, my. The hiccup of truth.

30
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:25,479
My gosh. It was a blind guess.

31
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,319
Please keep it a secret from everyone else,

32
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,590
although I have a feeling Lady Ha Na already knows.

33
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,019
I guess there really are matches made by fate.

34
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,430
He must have been in the palace, so how did Lady Ha Na meet him?

35
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,930
How amazing.

36
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,430
I will ask the Crown Prince later and let you know.

37
00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:53,139
My lord,

38
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,139
how did you meet the Princess?

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,419
(8 years ago)

40
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,199
Even after eight years,

41
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,970
I still wonder why I did not head to Sungkyunkwan.

42
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,669
Why did I walk over to that court lady...

43
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,440
and stood before her, dazed?

44
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,380
It was inexplicable.

45
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,009
Perhaps...

46
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,479
I was worried.

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,889
She was looking around at an ordinary street...

48
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,590
with such sparkle in her eyes.

49
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:19,759
Worried, my foot.

50
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,960
You fell for her at first sight.

51
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,030
And?

52
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,600
I asked what she was looking for,

53
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,270
and she said she had two hours of free time,

54
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:32,770
so she wanted to visit the streets.

55
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:40,079
Even back then, I stayed away from crowded places...

56
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,419
because of my chest pain.

57
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,720
But that did not matter.

58
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,520
My heart was already racing...

59
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,760
from the moment we met.

60
00:04:55,499 --> 00:04:58,070
The Princess also lied about her identity, just like me.

61
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:01,739
And?

62
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,070
She returned to the palace two hours later.

63
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,379
I knew I should not dare to have feelings for court ladies,

64
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:13,609
but I kept thinking about her after that day.

65
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,319
A few months later, I went to see His Majesty...

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,020
to ask him to retract his offer to marry the Princess.

67
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,160
That was when we met again.

68
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,298
Yes, so...

69
00:05:35,299 --> 00:05:38,410
you had something to say about marrying the Princess?

70
00:05:48,179 --> 00:05:49,220
Right?

71
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:52,390
These two are looking at each other.

72
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,020
I do not remember what I said to His Majesty on that day,

73
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,660
but I do remember one thing.

74
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,799
I was very happy.

75
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:22,418
Are you disappointed that you are not the first one...

76
00:06:22,419 --> 00:06:23,780
I have feelings for?

77
00:06:25,419 --> 00:06:26,419
Yes.

78
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,020
I am very disappointed.

79
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,590
That was a lie.

80
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:37,359
I liked him even more...

81
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,999
because he did not marry the Princess against his will.

82
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,809
I am very glad to hear...

83
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,869
that you are very disappointed.

84
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:14,169
Did you come because you missed your eldest son and his wife?

85
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,379
We do not pry into their history when people become monks.

86
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,248
That was why I did not know Monk Socheon was...

87
00:07:28,249 --> 00:07:29,720
a part of the Namjang Faction.

88
00:07:31,749 --> 00:07:35,460
When do you think I can meet him?

89
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,989
Even the left state councillor is looking for him,

90
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:42,499
so we are doing everything we can to find him.

91
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:44,669
You said...

92
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,869
that matchmaker also met with the monk, right?

93
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,410
As far as I know, yes.

94
00:07:58,609 --> 00:08:01,049
Did you say Lady Yeoju, the matchmaker for Ye Jin,

95
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,989
was also the one helping out with Lord Gyeongunjae's matches?

96
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,450
Yes, my lady.

97
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,119
Shall I summon her?

98
00:08:10,989 --> 00:08:13,929
No, I need to meet her now.

99
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,450
I may be the Agent of Love,

100
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,850
but I have to see something to feel things.

101
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,190
No, you already have felt it.

102
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,119
Do you remember mentioning Bachelor 16...

103
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:44,519
as Lady Doo Ri's spouse?

104
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,529
If you consider the future of the three daughters,

105
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:50,960
Bachelor 16 is a better choice, as he is likely to succeed.

106
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,580
Back then, I was very arrogant, thinking I was the Agent of Love.

107
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,978
The ladies are slowly finding their matches.

108
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:12,019
(Bachelor 16)

109
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,319
I only made that decision based solely on his qualifications,

110
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,690
so I wasn't very sure.

111
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,389
We can check right away.

112
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,960
How?

113
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,070
I am fine with anybody.

114
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,930
Men are all the same.

115
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,940
I cannot stop my younger sister from marrying because of me.

116
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,970
Thank you. You will not be disappointed.

117
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:42,979
Thank you.

118
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:48,960
What brings you here, my lord?

119
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:52,158
I found a suitable lady you could marry,

120
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,889
so I came to make a match.

121
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:57,200
I already have someone I wish to marry.

122
00:09:57,659 --> 00:10:00,998
What? Have you already promised to marry that lady?

123
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,600
To be frank, we have never even talked.

124
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:06,639
But this time, I passed the state exam,

125
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:08,279
so I was trying to muster the courage.

126
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:12,609
Could you tell us who the lady was?

127
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,149
Well, she is...

128
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,989
the crafty second daughter of Erudite Maeng's family.

129
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,759
I fell for her at first sight and gave her my heart...

130
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,119
after we met at Sunhwa Temple on Buddha's birthday.

131
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:34,470
As I expected, you were right on as the Agent of Love.

132
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,499
We have found a spouse for Lady Doo Ri too,

133
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:42,540
which means the end of this matchmaking is near.

134
00:10:47,249 --> 00:10:49,019
Which family are you with?

135
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,859
Well...

136
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,189
I am...

137
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,330
No, never mind.

138
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,060
I would rather not know.

139
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:08,840
Let us...

140
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:12,310
make a quick stop.

141
00:11:20,909 --> 00:11:22,550
This was my old house...

142
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:24,989
from when I was 8 to 17.

143
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,829
My family was not well-off,

144
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:34,159
so we moved around a lot within Hanyang.

145
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,159
But I was happy while I lived here.

146
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,100
My mother was alive back then.

147
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,840
I also grew up in this area.

148
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:46,670
You did?

149
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:50,210
I thought you had always been rich since birth.

150
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,509
My late father did not have a knack for building wealth.

151
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,550
Just like my father.

152
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,220
I said the most wicked thing...

153
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,258
to a father like him,

154
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,300
saying he must be happy to get a big house in Bukchon...

155
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,859
in return for selling off his son.

156
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,629
Much later,

157
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,440
His Majesty told me...

158
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,239
my father agreed to do this because he was worried...

159
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,909
I might suffer from hardships if I rose to success...

160
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,680
because of my feisty character.

161
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,779
The problem with fathers is that they never share how they feel.

162
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,450
When he passed away,

163
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,290
he said he was sorry he made me marry the Princess.

164
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,729
But I could not tell him I did not marry her against my will.

165
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:43,930
I always...

166
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,200
regretted that.

167
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:50,869
He probably knew,

168
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,710
although he never said it.

169
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,989
Thank you for saying that.

170
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:14,690
Today is a great day to hang your heart out.

171
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,909
If we lived in the same neighbourhood,

172
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,350
we might have met back then.

173
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:37,879
What would have happened if we met back then?

174
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,690
Well...

175
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,420
We probably would have never talked.

176
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:48,129
A temperamental nerd is not my type.

177
00:13:48,659 --> 00:13:51,999
I also do not like someone who is as unfocused as you are.

178
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:56,499
What a relief that we did not meet back then.

179
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:02,680
And it is a relief we have met now.

180
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,829
Do not work too hard.

181
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,700
Just work hard enough to earn your keep.

182
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,100
My dear, how can you say something so disrespectful...

183
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,009
I will be home soon.

184
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,090
What are you doing in my house?

185
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,988
Goodness. Well...

186
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:53,758
I sensed good luck at this site in passing, so I took some energy.

187
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,200
Do not sell this place. Make sure you keep it with you.

188
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,070
I see. Thank you.

189
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,499
You are practically making money.

190
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,210
Do you also know a thing or two about feng shui?

191
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,850
I just made up a lie in case he thought we were thieves.

192
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:16,149
I learned this from you.

193
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,988
I knew it. You have surplused your teacher.

194
00:15:19,989 --> 00:15:21,320
Surpassed.

195
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,259
Not surplused.

196
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,489
You should stay away from words you do not know.

197
00:15:28,529 --> 00:15:31,129
Never mind. I can always let you know.

198
00:16:00,229 --> 00:16:01,489
What is wrong?

199
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,470
Goodness, I am sorry.

200
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,470
I had to flee from the wife of the left state councillor.

201
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,450
You know about her too, right? The hidden influence of Joseon.

202
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,810
Right.

203
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:21,779
I do.

204
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:24,720
But why are you avoiding her?

205
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,148
Well, the thing is,

206
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:28,889
she does not want me to succeed in making matches.

207
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,259
I did not want her to see me with a matchmaker.

208
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,029
Wait, is she on her way to meet Lady Yeoju?

209
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,699
I have to be somewhere, so please excuse me.

210
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,299
You have to be somewhere, so you have to go?

211
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,268
Where are you... Wait.

212
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,800
Tell me where you are going.

213
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:53,180
Is she not home?

214
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,050
I must boil it first before it is dried to store it longer.

215
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,510
What brings you all the way here, my lady?

216
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,750
You should have summoned me.

217
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:44,159
Goodness, my lady!

218
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,128
You need to tell me what is going on.

219
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:49,240
I am not here because of my daughter's marriage.

220
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,639
Why did you meet...

221
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:58,109
Monk Socheon with Lord Gyeongunjae?

222
00:18:00,449 --> 00:18:01,449
Sorry?

223
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,560
Did you not run into the left state councillor’s wife?

224
00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:19,330
She was here just now.

225
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,139
Bad premonitions always come true.

226
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,480
Lee clearly said it was Lady Yeoju.

227
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,679
Goodness, that woman.

228
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,619
Find the matchmaker Lord Gyeongunjae was sighted with...

229
00:18:42,189 --> 00:18:43,490
and bring her to me at once.

230
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,159
Yes, my lady.

231
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:51,929
She asked why you met with Monk Socheon,

232
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,399
not about marrying the daughters of Erudite Maeng?

233
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,869
Yes.

234
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:59,409
But I did not know about it, so I could not make up an answer.

235
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:03,409
How did she know we met with Monk Socheon?

236
00:19:04,439 --> 00:19:05,979
Who is that man?

237
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,750
Why are you always with him?

238
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,050
Goodness.

239
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,060
He and I are working together on this match.

240
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,859
He is the Agent of Love.

241
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:19,790
"The Agent of Love?"

242
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,230
What is that?

243
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:24,399
Someone who can tell those who are meant to be.

244
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:27,399
You little one.

245
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,780
You should have left first.

246
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,280
I cannot walk with you while I am dressed like this.

247
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,090
This is a tactic I am using to get over you,

248
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,959
by looking at you so much until I get sick of you.

249
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,060
You can walk first.

250
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:56,500
This time, I will remain three steps behind you.

251
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,219
Goodness.

252
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:17,340
How is it this difficult to marry a widow of a nobleman?

253
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:21,608
Even if my petition was accepted,

254
00:21:21,609 --> 00:21:23,520
it proved to be absolutely no use.

255
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,350
The law of Joseon has zero flexibility.

256
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,609
Goodness, Your Highness.

257
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,310
Are you unwell?

258
00:21:54,609 --> 00:21:56,320
My heart is unwell.

259
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,320
Is it because of Lady Ha Na of Mount Nam Valley?

260
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,359
How did you know?

261
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,000
Why do you like her?

262
00:22:13,169 --> 00:22:15,539
Because she is...

263
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:18,840
the wisest person among the people I know.

264
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:22,540
She surely is smart.

265
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:26,079
I knew you would notice the wisdom...

266
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,609
hidden behind her looks.

267
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:31,750
Your Highness.

268
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:33,990
Allow me to share a secret.

269
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:38,189
I found the Agent of Love, the one I had been looking for.

270
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:42,729
The Agent told me you and Lady Ha Na were...

271
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,330
meant to be together.

272
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:46,000
Is that true?

273
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,169
Hence, I plan on pushing your marriage with her,

274
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,010
so please trust me and wait a little longer.

275
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,990
Mother, it is I, Soon Duk.

276
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:11,689
Come in.

277
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,469
(Journal, May, the Year of the Red Monkey)

278
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,109
I organized the things Kim brought in until yesterday.

279
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,280
Good.

280
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:38,780
Who is that letter from?

281
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:44,219
It was...

282
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,990
from my eldest son while he served in Pyongyang.

283
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,929
I did not realize he would pass away in such vain.

284
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,760
I told him...

285
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,000
he did not have to send me too many letters since he was busy.

286
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:57,500
I even regret saying that now.

287
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,169
Did you go to Sunhwa Temple...

288
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:03,379
because you thought of him?

289
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,209
He has been on my mind much more often recently.

290
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,149
It felt like I never really knew him.

291
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,230
I held you back for such an unnecessary talk.

292
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,560
We are visiting Royal Noble Consort Suk in two days.

293
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,560
Make sure you and Geun Seok are ready to go.

294
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,100
Including me?

295
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,149
My lord.

296
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,320
What you said was correct.

297
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,350
The one who sold golden silkworm poison...

298
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,919
was an interpreter for Ming.

299
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:49,590
Are you sure?

300
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:51,958
Yes, I saw him...

301
00:24:51,959 --> 00:24:53,090
at Taepyeong Hall now.

302
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:55,699
I see.

303
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,230
I shall pass it to His Majesty when I enter the palace in two days.

304
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,569
The left state councillor and his family will...

305
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:04,369
suffer brutally for charges of treason.

306
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:13,050
Why do you think she wants me to come?

307
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:18,219
Because you will be the lady of the family soon,

308
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:20,790
so she must want you to be close to Royal Noble Consort Suk.

309
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,260
But Mother is still healthy and well.

310
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,830
My mother must be getting old too.

311
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,270
She keeps bringing up...

312
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,740
my eldest brother lately.

313
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,280
Why are you drinking so much today?

314
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,980
It was not like I ever needed a reason to drink.

315
00:25:58,719 --> 00:25:59,730
Are you...

316
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,000
still not over that farmer?

317
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:10,070
Nothing will change even if I cannot get over him.

318
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,510
He is about to marry soon.

319
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:18,080
Have you ever considered marrying him?

320
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:19,649
No.

321
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,909
I did not have time to think.

322
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,280
My brothers...

323
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,520
left this world too early.

324
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:30,759
I could not throw a fit like an immature kid,

325
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,560
wanting to marry someone I liked.

326
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:35,189
I should marry someone who was on par with our family...

327
00:26:35,389 --> 00:26:37,499
to be of help when Geun Seok...

328
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,899
rose to power in the future.

329
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:55,379
Ye Jin.

330
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,149
When did you grow up so much?

331
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,859
I feel ashamed for going around only concerned about myself.

332
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,559
What are you talking about? Why should you feel ashamed?

333
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,760
Because you are a matchmaker?

334
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:13,270
I will have a good spouse thanks to you.

335
00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:16,969
Goodness, why are you crying?

336
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,199
Please do not cry.

337
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,480
I am sorry.

338
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:27,780
Why are you crying?

339
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:33,290
You are doing well.

340
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:49,169
("Everything About Matchmaking")

341
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,359
Goodness.

342
00:28:17,929 --> 00:28:19,869
Why did you come looking like this today?

343
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,399
I must return early because of a family affair.

344
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,209
You may have exposed your identity, but our work is still work...

345
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,340
("Everything About Matchmaking")

346
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,550
I put together a few things that will be useful for the wedding.

347
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,589
This is a list of wig makers and wedding planners,

348
00:28:45,590 --> 00:28:46,790
as well as their addresses.

349
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,059
I already spoke to the ones on that list.

350
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,699
They will help out during the wedding.

351
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,929
Why are you telling me this?

352
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:55,939
You can do this yourself.

353
00:28:56,169 --> 00:28:59,369
And Lady Yeoju will do the makeup for the brides.

354
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,969
You know who she is, right?

355
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,179
Is something going on?

356
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:08,649
Why?

357
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,179
You keep talking without looking at me.

358
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
My lord.

359
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:25,459
I do not think I can...

360
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,010
O Bong, why are you leaving?

361
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,609
Did you finish what I told you to do?

362
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,980
I will hear what you have to say next time.

363
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,209
Something urgent has come up.

364
00:29:52,959 --> 00:29:54,159
("Everything About Matchmaking")

365
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,800
Lord Gyeongunjae.

366
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:02,839
Did you put me up for something?

367
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,399
- I just... - Good one.

368
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:08,669
Pardon?

369
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:18,379
I will tell him that I will quit next time we meet.

370
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,389
Nothing bad will happen for seeing him just a couple more days.

371
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,439
My feelings...

372
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,810
did not seem to go away, unlike what you told me.

373
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:43,879
Therefore,

374
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:48,879
I need to keep seeing you for at least a day or two longer.

375
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,530
Do you remember...

376
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,669
the deputy administrator murder case in Pyongyang from eight years ago?

377
00:31:14,639 --> 00:31:16,208
That was when the eldest son of the left state councillor...

378
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:17,780
got murdered by a robber.

379
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,479
You said you had something to say about the Crown Prince's abductor.

380
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,980
Why do you suddenly bring that up?

381
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,780
That case was...

382
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,850
the beginning of the Crown Prince's abduction.

383
00:31:30,189 --> 00:31:32,590
Jo In Hyun had been investigating the corruption of Pyongyang.

384
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,658
He knew his father...

385
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,329
and Park Bok Ki, the governor of Pyongan at that time,

386
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:37,659
had been conspiring for treachery.

387
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,830
The evidence of treason Jo In Hyun discovered...

388
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,129
must have been golden silkworm poison.

389
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:45,468
(I obtained the poison that leaves no traces as you asked.)

390
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:47,570
This letter does not only contain the corruption of the tributes.

391
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:50,939
It also has evidence of treachery, a plan to kill Prince Unhae.

392
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,609
Are you saying...

393
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,549
the left state councillor already had conspired...

394
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,080
to kill the Crown Prince eight years ago?

395
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,948
Yes, Jo In Hyun came across this evidence...

396
00:31:59,949 --> 00:32:02,020
during his investigation of the corruption.

397
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,619
He was killed by his father, Jo Young Bae, in an accident.

398
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,659
What do you mean by that?

399
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,730
Why do we not tell my sister the whole truth...

400
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,230
and request help?

401
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,669
I cannot do that.

402
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,939
If she finds out that I killed In Hyun,

403
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,638
it will be impossible for her to discern anything reasonably.

404
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,980
She will act only on her emotions.

405
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,850
It will only cause conflict within the household.

406
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:32,719
Just say that you are scared of losing my sister's favour.

407
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,889
Save the excuses.

408
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,060
Since it has come to this,

409
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:40,760
let us get rid of Lord Gyeongunjae.

410
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,800
Lord Gyeongunjae is a sharp one.

411
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,100
If he snoops around and uncovers what we did eight years ago,

412
00:32:47,669 --> 00:32:49,770
So Hyun will be the least of our concerns.

413
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,939
It will be the end for us.

414
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:57,080
Do not worry.

415
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,179
I will do it myself this time.

416
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:03,879
Just thinking about how I lost my money...

417
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,320
and Maeng Ha Na because of Gyeongunjae...

418
00:33:07,389 --> 00:33:08,820
makes my blood boil.

419
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:16,599
Back then, I was preoccupied with the Princess' death...

420
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,530
that I did not pay attention to the death of Lord Jo's son.

421
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,639
So that was the hidden truth.

422
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,070
However,

423
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,010
nothing happened to the Crown Prince then.

424
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,179
Instead, Her Highness died,

425
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,219
and we lacked evidence to claim that she was poisoned...

426
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,280
so her death was brushed off as a sudden one.

427
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:40,888
This time, Lord Jo tried...

428
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:42,619
to poison His Highness as well.

429
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:45,919
I have verified that the poison was procured by a Ming interpreter.

430
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,990
If you summon and interrogate him,

431
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,000
we will be able to expose Lord Jo's treachery.

432
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,529
Summoning an interpreter...

433
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,570
from Taepyeong Hall is not hard, but...

434
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,409
Is there something you are worried about?

435
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,609
Park Bok Ki...

436
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:07,179
is Prince Jinsung's uncle after all.

437
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:09,479
If he is caught for treason,

438
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,549
I am worried that Prince Jinsung will also be implicated.

439
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:18,919
However, I cannot disregard the Crown Prince's safety...

440
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,429
when they attempted to kill him twice this month.

441
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,060
Fine.

442
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,429
I will summon that interpreter and open an investigation.

443
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,880
How do you find the palace?

444
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,650
It was more pleasant than I imagined.

445
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:44,779
Geun Seok reminds me of In Hyun the more he grows.

446
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,690
Soon Duk is now in charge of most affairs in our household.

447
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:58,759
So Hyun often praised you.

448
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:00,869
She said you were quick-witted...

449
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:03,569
and that you took great care of Geun Seok and Ye Jin.

450
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,869
I merely carried out what Mother instructed me to.

451
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:10,210
Yes.

452
00:35:10,509 --> 00:35:12,739
You will be fine if you do as So Hyun says.

453
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:15,409
I will bear that in mind.

454
00:35:23,089 --> 00:35:25,460
I have asked the ministry for the document...

455
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:27,230
you requested for.

456
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,259
I will let you know once I receive it.

457
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,170
I will wait for your news.

458
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:43,509
Mother.

459
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,549
Is the document you asked Royal Noble Consort Suk for...

460
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,679
related to In Hyun's death eight years ago?

461
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:00,659
I made that assumption based on what you said previously.

462
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:03,900
You seemed perplexed.

463
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,170
At first,

464
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,710
I found you amusing.

465
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:17,480
When everyone feared me,

466
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,480
you were the only one who did not.

467
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:23,520
You did not hesitate to ask questions,

468
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,080
and you were bold...

469
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,819
to speak up when something was wrong.

470
00:36:30,659 --> 00:36:31,889
With you around,

471
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:35,560
I felt comforted at times.

472
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,369
Including...

473
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:42,330
right now.

474
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,069
You are right.

475
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,580
Perhaps it is because I was not by his deathbed.

476
00:36:54,449 --> 00:36:55,679
But I keep thinking...

477
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,319
that I do not know how he died despite being his mother.

478
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:02,790
So I wanted to look into his death.

479
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:10,500
It might be pointless, though. Eight years have passed.

480
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:29,310
Master.

481
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:35,589
What brings you here?

482
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,449
Master.

483
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,150
This is my mother.

484
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:24,040
Were you meeting His Majesty?

485
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:29,880
Lord Sim?

486
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:33,449
Yes, I was.

487
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,380
See you around.

488
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:17,359
I have verified that the poison...

489
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,020
was procured by a Ming interpreter.

490
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,159
If you summon and interrogate him,

491
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,000
we will be able to expose Lord Jo's treachery.

492
00:39:36,779 --> 00:39:38,610
Arrest Lord Park Bok Ki at once.

493
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,049
What do you mean, all of your sudden?

494
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:45,480
I might get your sister killed for treason.

495
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,718
What is it?

496
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,619
Why are you hesitating to speak up? It is not like you.

497
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,529
Mother.

498
00:40:38,799 --> 00:40:39,799
I am...

499
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:45,179
Lady Yeoju, the so-called master of matchmaking.

500
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:50,219
What do you mean?

501
00:40:51,279 --> 00:40:53,290
Besides running the book rental shop,

502
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,750
I was also a matchmaker.

503
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:00,029
Ye Jin's wedding was also arranged by me.

504
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,659
What?

505
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,000
That is why...

506
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,999
the Lady Yeoju who makes powders...

507
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,929
pretended to be me to fool you.

508
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:11,400
I am sorry.

509
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,139
You mean...

510
00:41:16,779 --> 00:41:18,179
Lord Gyeongunjae's partner...

511
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,310
that is helping him to match the Maeng girls is you?

512
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,020
Yes.

513
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,960
Why are you telling me all this now?

514
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:40,170
I thought I should tell you...

515
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:44,199
what Monk Socheon told me about In Hyun's death.

516
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:56,819
So you are saying...

517
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,549
you reported Lord Jo and Lord Park to the King...

518
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:03,150
for treason over that incident eight years ago?

519
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:06,060
I reported them without knowing Lady Yeoju was your sister.

520
00:42:06,389 --> 00:42:09,230
See? You should have hinted to me earlier.

521
00:42:14,299 --> 00:42:16,199
His Majesty already knows of their treason.

522
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:19,198
What would change if I arrest Lord Park Bok Ki...

523
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:20,368
for murder?

524
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,839
Luckily, His Majesty...

525
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,480
is worried for Prince Jinsung's safety.

526
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:28,750
So?

527
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:30,818
If Park Bok Ki and Lord Jo are caught for treason,

528
00:42:30,819 --> 00:42:33,750
Prince Jinsung will also be punished.

529
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,888
So if you report them for another crime...

530
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,119
that will cost them their titles,

531
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:40,630
His Majesty will not punish them for treason.

532
00:42:40,929 --> 00:42:42,888
If that is the case, I can arrest Park Bok Ki...

533
00:42:42,889 --> 00:42:45,399
for Lee Cho Ok's murder right away.

534
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,029
However, all I have is circumstantial evidence.

535
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,399
Neither will the witness testify...

536
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,940
since Lord Park may retaliate.

537
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:54,239
I have a plan for that.

538
00:42:56,509 --> 00:42:57,710
Forget Park Bok Ki.

539
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,810
We should find a crime for Lord Jo.

540
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:02,409
What?

541
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,750
You are a better investigator than me, are you not?

542
00:43:07,049 --> 00:43:08,150
That is true.

543
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,298
You must have struggled to speak up.

544
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:22,600
Thank you for letting me know.

545
00:43:26,139 --> 00:43:27,409
What does Lord Gyeongunjae...

546
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,509
plan to do about the incident eight years ago?

547
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,949
As he did not know I was a noblewoman,

548
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,249
he said it would be hard...

549
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,750
to absolve Lady Yeoju's crime even if he exposed the matter.

550
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,449
Ye Jin and Geun Seok...

551
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:46,619
If they learn about this, they will receive a huge blow.

552
00:43:47,389 --> 00:43:49,089
Make sure they never find out.

553
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,469
Yes, I shall be careful.

554
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,799
Also,

555
00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:57,969
just because you came clean with me,

556
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:00,269
does not mean I have forgiven you for lying to me...

557
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,739
and going around with a man.

558
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:04,339
Until I tell you to,

559
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:07,080
you may not leave the house for the time being.

560
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:09,980
If you disobey me again,

561
00:44:10,779 --> 00:44:12,380
I will not forgive you anymore.

562
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,110
Thank you for trying...

563
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:38,380
- to help my sister. - I am just doing the right thing.

564
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:42,679
Do you love her?

565
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,219
Now that you know who my sister is,

566
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,360
please stop seeing her. I am not requesting.

567
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,299
As Soon Duk's brother,

568
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,469
this is my warning.

569
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,779
Lord Sim, please come here.

570
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,589
Lady Yoo's suicide seems odd, does it not?

571
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,060
You are right.

572
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,060
She must have known her husband liked men.

573
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:35,600
Why would she join her husband in death when she had a son?

574
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:38,199
During the murder, was Lady Yoo...

575
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:52,980
Lady Yoo was at the scene of the crime.

576
00:45:53,219 --> 00:45:56,250
She did not take her own life but was silenced?

577
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,560
To think I was unaware.

578
00:46:37,830 --> 00:46:38,900
I am...

579
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,069
I am so sorry, In Hyun.

580
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,279
Are you really giving it to me?

581
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,880
Yes. You said you wanted it.

582
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:34,020
I do not need it anymore.

583
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:37,759
Are you...

584
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,960
quitting matchmaking?

585
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:43,589
Yes.

586
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:45,929
I do not think I can continue anymore.

587
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,580
Of course, I remember.

588
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,408
As soon as Lady Park arrived in Pyongyang,

589
00:48:01,409 --> 00:48:03,150
Lady Yoo had committed suicide.

590
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:04,448
Rumours had it...

591
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:06,650
that Lady Park forced her to hang herself.

592
00:48:07,449 --> 00:48:10,659
But everyone in Hanyang believed that rumour.

593
00:48:13,589 --> 00:48:17,329
The rumour was started by a coroner over drinks.

594
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,729
(Coroner: Someone who examines bodies)

595
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,029
He said Lady Yoo...

596
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,670
did not hang herself to death.

597
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,839
He claimed that she was hung after someone killed her.

598
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,170
That was how the rumour spread.

599
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:33,279
So she did not hang herself.

600
00:48:37,179 --> 00:48:38,920
Lady Yoo did not commit suicide.

601
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,750
Do you know who killed her?

602
00:48:53,360 --> 00:48:54,500
I saw...

603
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:57,900
the left state councillor tie Lady Yoo's body to the beams.

604
00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:16,779
Why can I not forget him? It is not like we are meant to be.

605
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:20,889
I can forget him.

606
00:50:22,949 --> 00:50:24,460
I think I have almost forgotten him.

607
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,670
His Majesty is unwell.

608
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:44,440
He will read the reports tomorrow.

609
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:46,440
Is he in a bad condition?

610
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:50,049
He is feeling under the weather over a slight fever.

611
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:51,350
Goodness.

612
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:54,790
It is rare for him to skip on reports.

613
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:56,850
Oh, dear.

614
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,219
Is he very sick?

615
00:51:02,589 --> 00:51:03,589
Poor him.

616
00:51:07,529 --> 00:51:09,569
If Lord Jo and Park Bok Ki are sentenced...

617
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:12,000
for other crimes and stripped of their titles,

618
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,269
Prince Jinsung will not be affected,

619
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,869
and you will be able to protect the Crown Prince.

620
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:19,040
By other crimes, you mean...

621
00:51:19,779 --> 00:51:21,349
Park Bok Ki murdered Lee Cho Ok...

622
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:23,049
in September last year.

623
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,150
I thought there was no evidence for that case.

624
00:51:26,719 --> 00:51:28,689
No one spoke up in fear of retaliation.

625
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,249
If we promise to protect their identity,

626
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,819
we will be able to find witnesses.

627
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:33,460
Is that so?

628
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,830
I have been bothered by that case all this time.

629
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:39,630
This is great.

630
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,099
Eight years ago, Lord Jo killed his daughter-in-law,

631
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,468
claiming she killed herself.

632
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:45,440
He built a memorial gate for her as a cover-up.

633
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:46,869
Kill his daughter-in-law?

634
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,310
What an insane...

635
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:50,440
Do you have evidence?

636
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,080
The officer in Pyongyang from then...

637
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,908
said that he saw Lord Jo tie Lady Yoo's body...

638
00:51:54,909 --> 00:51:56,710
to the beams at the time.

639
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:58,449
Is that so?

640
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:00,889
However,

641
00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:05,259
will Lord Jo admit his crime with that testimony alone?

642
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,290
You have evidence of his treason.

643
00:52:08,889 --> 00:52:10,459
Please tell him...

644
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,900
you will sentence him for treason if he does not admit the crime.

645
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,029
If you do, the both of them will own up to their crimes.

646
00:52:16,770 --> 00:52:17,799
I see.

647
00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:21,610
Rather than being wiped out as a clan for being traitors,

648
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:24,980
they would rather have their titles stripped for murder.

649
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:29,649
Keep this a secret between you and me.

650
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,650
Especially...

651
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:35,020
from the chief royal secretary. Things will get out of hand.

652
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:37,089
Good.

653
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:38,819
My, look at you.

654
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:41,460
What a brilliant idea.

655
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:55,309
I will head to bed early tonight.

656
00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:56,909
Come back in the morning.

657
00:52:57,310 --> 00:52:58,580
Yes, my lord.

658
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:16,190
We are good for dinner.

659
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:18,029
In two hours,

660
00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:20,600
the Chief Magistrate and Deputy Minister are coming.

661
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:22,900
Bring out the drinks and snacks then.

662
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,369
I will, Father.

663
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:31,279
Bye, Gae Dong.

664
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:46,259
It must be done perfectly this time.

665
00:53:47,690 --> 00:53:49,889
Getting rid of that nerd is a piece of cake.

666
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:54,270
I will be back before the drinks are served.

667
00:53:58,199 --> 00:54:00,569
I was here all night long today.

668
00:54:33,699 --> 00:54:37,239
It seems something horrible will happen tonight.

669
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:43,179
What do you mean by that?

670
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,889
I overheard this while cleaning the men's room the other day.

671
00:54:56,029 --> 00:54:57,060
Do not worry.

672
00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,659
I will do it myself this time.

673
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,730
Just thinking about how I lost my money...

674
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:05,299
and Maeng Ha Na because of Gyeongunjae...

675
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:06,940
makes my blood boil.

676
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:09,909
The target worth getting rid of...

677
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,009
is most likely Young Master's tutor, Lord Gyeongunjae.

678
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,920
Getting rid of that nerd is a piece of cake.

679
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,259
Lady Jung! Where are you going?

680
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:57,989
Is it you outside, O Bong?

681
00:56:06,199 --> 00:56:08,230
What brings you here, my lady?

682
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:09,869
Hide at once.

683
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:12,069
My uncle is trying to get you killed.

684
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,040
He is not here, either.

685
00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:29,250
You said he came home earlier. So where is he?

686
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:32,819
Darn it.

687
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,739
Get me some light. Hurry.

688
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:05,778
(Crown Prince's Kidnapping)

689
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:06,940
(Suspect)

690
00:59:08,179 --> 00:59:09,250
(Letter)

691
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,750
That little Gyeongunjae...

692
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:16,089
When did he look into all of this?

693
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:18,319
I cannot believe this.

694
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,619
Let us return for now.

695
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:21,929
Understood.

696
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:26,730
You really...

697
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,710
Goodness. Are you all right?

698
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:17,850
My lady...

699
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:20,380
Did you come here while making dinner?

700
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,790
I was in a rush.

701
01:00:26,589 --> 01:00:29,229
Still, you should have known better than to come here like that.

702
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,830
What if someone sees you?

703
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:34,469
Does that even matter?

704
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:37,799
When I thought you could die,

705
01:00:38,469 --> 01:00:40,699
my mind went blank.

706
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,009
My apologies for startling you.

707
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:19,710
And...

708
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:22,610
thank you...

709
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,350
for saving me.

710
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:30,889
I thought I could do it.

711
01:01:33,819 --> 01:01:35,630
But I was wrong.

712
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:52,909
I cannot forget you, my lord.

713
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:58,850
Did you only realize that now?

714
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:03,219
The moment I first met you, I knew...

715
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,190
I would never forget you.

716
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:37,750
(The Matchmakers)

717
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:55,029
Did I not tell you not to leave the house?

718
01:03:55,369 --> 01:03:57,299
I am not sure if you can be trusted.

719
01:03:58,199 --> 01:04:00,369
The court maid of Dongungjeon has woken up.

720
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:03,170
What is this?

721
01:04:03,270 --> 01:04:04,940
I can do it.

722
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:06,409
What?

723
01:04:06,980 --> 01:04:08,580
I am being framed!

724
01:04:08,779 --> 01:04:10,809
You should not ask the method...

725
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,219
but what I want.

726
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:16,989
So it is my turn to listen to your condition.

727
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:19,658
Do not meet with my daughter-in-law.

728
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:21,219
If you defy my words,

729
