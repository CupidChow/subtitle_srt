A nobleman benefits...

00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:58,789
from his mother's family when young,

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,060
his wife's family as an adult,

11
00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:02,959
and...

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,300
his children's in-laws when old.

13
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,270
It is commonly said, no?

14
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,038
To be frank,

15
00:01:09,039 --> 00:01:11,169
if the Left State Councillor and Lord Park...

16
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,140
were not Prince Jinsung's relatives,

17
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,910
the head of the Dongro Faction...

18
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,750
would have been me.

19
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:21,119
Gosh.

20
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:23,780
It is a well-known fact...

21
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:27,319
both are Lady Park's puppets.

22
00:01:28,559 --> 00:01:30,059
To succeed,

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,390
a man must marry well.

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,000
Good grief.

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,139

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,339
he is in the palm of my sister's hand.

29
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,179
Just you wait and see.

30
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,050
Whether my sister settles this problem or not.

31
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:55,679
Oh, right.

32
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,550
You asked about the incident eight years ago.

33
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:00,890
Back then, the plan was...

34
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,319
to put golden silkworm poison inside the Crown Prince's food...

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,559
while everyone was busy with the Princess's royal wedding.

36
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:08,759
Pardon?

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,000
It was not dangerous.

38
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,970
There are no symptoms of being poisoned.

39
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,139
Then, an investigation cannot be conducted.

40
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,769
Nor would there be any suspicions. It was a perfect plan.

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,079
Either way, I, too, am very curious...

42
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,680
why the Princess died.

43
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,250
(Episode 13: The Decision to Leave)

44
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,859
Wait. I should inform...

45
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,299
So Hyun first, not Young Bae.

46
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,699
So Hyun!

47
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,410
So Hyun!

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,609
So Hyun. Did I not say we should get rid of Gyeongunjae?

49
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,579
What is with all this fuss?

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,319
That jerk is trying to bring us all down for plotting treason.

51
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,889
Good grief. Had I not gone there, what would have happened?

52
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,130
Explain to me so that I can understand.

53
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,160
I just came back from Gyeongunjae.

54
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,930
Do not worry. I was not discovered.

55
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,769
But that is not the problem.

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,569
Lord Gyeongunjae...

57
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,470
was looking into our golden silkworm poison purchase.

58
00:03:52,729 --> 00:03:53,769
I see.

59
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:55,900
So Uncle...

60
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,810
left in a rush in shock after seeing that.

61
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:02,609
Then...

62
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,109
what will happen to my family?

63
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:09,780
Tonight, the Left State Councillor and Lord Park...

64
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:12,389
will be arrested for murder.

65
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,919
I should return now.

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,389
Do not go.

67
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,070
I cannot have you go there alone.

68
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,499
Let us run...

69
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,510
far away right now.

70
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,350
My lord.

71
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,720
I am not leaving to die.

72
00:04:51,629 --> 00:04:53,129
I am going home.

73
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,129
My lady.

74
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,580
Simply knowing that you are safe today...

75
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,479
is enough for me.

76
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,859
But...

77
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,700
I found a weakness we could use against him.

78
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:34,330
Even in that situation,

79
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,900
I brought this.

80
00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:45,010
Your sly daughter-in-law...

81
00:05:45,549 --> 00:05:47,450
is communicating secretly with Lord Gyeongunjae.

82
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,650
Were you meeting His Majesty?

83
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,260
Lord Sim?

84
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,489
Yes, I was.

85
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,570
How can the King's son-in-law have an affair with a married woman?

86
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:08,239
We can bring him down at once.

87
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,569
But Soon Duk is our family member.

88
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,640
But So Hyun...

89
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,640
I will take care of it.

90
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,479
Do not say a word about this to others for the time being.

91
00:06:19,109 --> 00:06:21,720
My lady! You must come out!

92
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:22,979
My lady!

93
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,729
What brings you here at this hour?

94
00:06:39,129 --> 00:06:41,840
How dare you come in here and cause this ruckus?

95
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:43,070
Lord Park Bok Ki.

96
00:06:44,239 --> 00:06:46,840
You are under arrest for murdering Lee Cho Ok in September.

97
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,179
- Arrest him. - Understood.

98
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:53,809
Let go!

99
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,590
You!

100
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,189
Lee Cho Ok took her own life, no?

101
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,059
And do you have proof that I killed her?

102
00:07:05,229 --> 00:07:06,289
Forget that.

103
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,059
Does the Chief Magistrate know about this?

104
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,169
I have yet to report to the Chief Magistrate.

105
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,770
You are one crazy jerk, are you not?

106
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,939
It was an urgent royal command.

107
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,910
I had no choice.

108
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,109
"Royal command?"

109
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,510
So Hyun.

110
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,530
Do you know where you are to cause this scene?

111
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,640
Criminal Jo Young Bae, obey the royal command.

112
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,679
What was that?

113
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,090
Eight years ago,

114
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,789
you murdered Lady Yoo, then made it look like suicide,

115
00:08:08,119 --> 00:08:10,020
and received the memorial monument.

116
00:08:10,689 --> 00:08:13,858
Wait. What do you mean he murdered his daughter-in-law?

117
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,199
Was it not suicide?

118
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,399
How did this happen?

119
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,760
I am being framed!

120
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,929
If you feel wronged,

121
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,669
explain yourself to His Majesty the King.

122
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,239
- Arrest him. - Yes, my lord.

123
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:28,410
What?

124
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,878
They must have come from the Capital District Office.

125
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:35,879
Right?

126
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,179
- What is going on? - Were they hiding something?

127
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,619
- Oh, no. - What will happen?

128
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,550
Did I not tell you not to leave the house?

129
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,019
And yet, you disobeyed me.

130
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:48,690
Where were you until now?

131
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:54,359
When I heard you worked as a matchmaker with Gyeongunjae,

132
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,659
I thought you were daring but never hated you.

133
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,040
Because I trusted you when you said you would only love my son.

134
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:07,769
But I am not sure if you can be trusted now.

135
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,070
I did it...

136
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:07,869
for the sake of our nation.

137
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,368
Trying to kill the Crown Prince...

138
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:12,170
was for the sake of our nation?

139
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,710
When Prince Jinsung was young,

140
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:19,479
did you not say yourself he could be a great king?

141
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,950
Yes, I did.

142
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,119
But Prince Jinsung had one detrimental flaw.

143
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,460
The fact...

144
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,960
that his mother's family wanted nothing but more power.

145
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:38,369
Now there is only one thing you can do for our nation.

146
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:43,268
To decide whether you will be punished for treason...

147
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:44,340
for trying to...

148
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,070
kill my son, or for killing your son's wife eight years ago.

149
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,009
That is what you can do now.

150
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,200
What did Park Bok Ki say?

151
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:11,460
He chose to be charged with Lee Cho Ok's murder.

152
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,350
Did Lady Yeoju leave any letters?

153
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,359
I doubt she will be able to for a while.

154
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,358
Were you aware that Lady Yeoju...

155
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,489
Yes, I knew.

156
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:44,059
The real Lady Yeoju who made dohwa powder...

157
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,269
introduced us.

158
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,470
Then why did you not tell me?

159
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,570
You never asked.

160
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,579
Say what you will.

161
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,080
I am done with Lord Sim here.

162
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,849
Pass this on for me.

163
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,220
(Letter)

164
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:11,729
It is Lady Yeoju's letter you waited for.

165
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:21,899
You there.

166
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:24,070
Wait a moment.

167
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,779
What is this about?

168
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:31,608
I heard you are Lord Jo's servant.

169
00:13:31,609 --> 00:13:33,180
Is his grandson well?

170
00:13:33,950 --> 00:13:35,720
I am the young master's tutor.

171
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,649
Oh, you must be Lord Gyeongunjae.

172
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,190
He was startled and afraid, but he is well.

173
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:49,399
Is his mother well also?

174
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:56,600
(Letter)

175
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,139
Oh... Well, things happened.

176
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:04,609
She is locked up in the annex.

177
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:18,489
(Letter)

178
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,039
I write this letter for fear you will be unable to sleep...

179
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,139
out of concern for me.

180
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,470
I am well.

181
00:15:06,609 --> 00:15:08,440
My family is in turmoil,

182
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,879
but my mother-in-law is strong, so do not worry too much.

183
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,509
Where am I?

184
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,009
You are awake.

185
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,040
Wait here a moment.

186
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,720
Once Jo Young Bae confesses his crimes,

187
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,658
I will exile them both to Jeju Island...

188
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:58,489
and never call them back.

189
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:00,829
I am concerned that after a while,

190
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:03,499
the Dongro Faction will petition...

191
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,399
for their reinstatement saying we need men to serve the country.

192
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,569
They killed my daughter...

193
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:11,940
and also tried to kill my son.

194
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,969
As long as I live, they will not be reinstated.

195
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,040
No.

196
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,940
Even after I die,

197
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,479
I will leave will that bans their reinstatement.

198
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:22,820
Do not worry about that.

199
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,720
I am the King.

200
00:16:30,119 --> 00:16:34,190
Now I just need to marry off my son.

201
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,629
- Yes. - Your Majesty.

202
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,228
The chief royal secretary is here.

203
00:16:39,229 --> 00:16:40,470
He is early today.

204
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,070
Let him in.

205
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:50,680
Yes. I am glad you are here.

206
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,579
We were discussing...

207
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,649
Lord Jo and Park Bok Ki's punishment.

208
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,519
Your Majesty. There is a more pressing matter.

209
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:02,190
The court maid of Dongungjeon has woken up.

210
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,330
- Has she? - Yes.

211
00:17:06,989 --> 00:17:09,230
As Lord Gyeongunjae suspected,

212
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,029
she said Lord Jo gave her the poison...

213
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,729
and told her to take it.

214
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:15,668
That means he must be charged...

215
00:17:15,669 --> 00:17:17,899
with treason and not murder.

216
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:23,080
Is there a chance the court maid could have lied?

217
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:26,010
- Well... - No?

218
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,149
Oh, right.

219
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:31,849
She was ill and unconscious for a long time,

220
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,689
so there is a possibility she is confused.

221
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,158
The head shaman we had been looking for was captured...

222
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:39,790
on Mount Jiri and is being transported to Hanyang.

223
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,659
That will clearly expose the left state councillor’s treason.

224
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,570
You sent men all the way to Mount Jiri?

225
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:47,770
Yes.

226
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:50,070
I see. Well done.

227
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,300
Thank you.

228
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,648
The Namjang Faction blamed you...

229
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,919
and Prince Jinsung for plotting treason,

230
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:05,490
and petitioned that you be poisoned.

231
00:18:05,949 --> 00:18:07,090
Poisoned?

232
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,320
What on earth...

233
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:12,159
I must see my sister.

234
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:18,929
They will kill my son?

235
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,270
No, they cannot. I cannot allow it.

236
00:18:23,639 --> 00:18:24,639
What is happening?

237
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:36,350
("The Art of War")

238
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,299
Chief Magistrate. What if this leads to a massacre?

239
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,398
Lord Gyeongunjae is a Dongro Faction member.

240
00:18:57,399 --> 00:18:58,869
Would he let that happen?

241
00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:03,539
But Lord Gyeongunjae is a member only for show.

242
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,939
- Oh, dear. - No...

243
00:19:10,219 --> 00:19:11,279
(Letter)

244
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,790
It is from Lady Park.

245
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,490
(To Capital District Office Chief Magistrate)

246
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,500
Tonight, at Lord Jo's residence,

247
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,128
she will host a gathering.

248
00:19:27,129 --> 00:19:30,270
What gathering when Lord Jo is locked up?

249
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:34,739
Could Lady Park have a plan?

250
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,480
Even if she does, a gathering in this situation...

251
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:39,409
I will not go.

252
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,320
Will you go, Chief Magistrate?

253
00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:45,949
If none of you will go,

254
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,919
I will act accordingly.

255
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,259
- That is only right. - I cannot go.

256
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:54,689
- Forget it. - This is right.

257
00:20:02,939 --> 00:20:05,570
You said you would not come.

258
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,310
I came because I could not think of a good solution.

259
00:20:11,709 --> 00:20:14,310
Are you not all in agreement?

260
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,719
Chief Magistrate, should you not sit at the head?

261
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,129
Does it matter who sits where?

262
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:31,300
I can always move after Lady Park joins us.

263
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,919
You are still out here?

264
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,918
Stop grovelling to those with power...

265
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:54,949
and serve your country.

266
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,719
That is not advice. It is a warning.

267
00:21:03,859 --> 00:21:04,959
Welcome.

268
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,730
Everyone is waiting.

269
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:09,070
Come inside.

270
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:08,290
I thank you all...

271
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,760
for being present in these troubled times.

272
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,030
Due to a political conspiracy,

273
00:22:14,770 --> 00:22:17,969
my husband and brother are being persecuted.

274
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:19,869
But I invited...

275
00:22:20,609 --> 00:22:24,280
Lord Gyeongunjae, and he will explain the misunderstanding.

276
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:30,750
I brought you all here today to request you wait...

277
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,020
calmly and without any concern.

278
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,409
Ye Jin.

279
00:22:59,449 --> 00:23:01,480
What if Mother finds out?

280
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,178
Who cares if she finds out...

281
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:05,520
when our family is almost ruined?

282
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,320
I am sorry, Ye Jin.

283
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,429
Why would you apologize?

284
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:19,669
So...

285
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:22,540
Did Father...

286
00:23:23,439 --> 00:23:25,270
really kill...

287
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,310
my older sister-in-law?

288
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:30,439
The Namjang Faction made that up, right?

289
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,550
Oh, well.

290
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:40,050
It was before you married. How would you know?

291
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,020
Well...

292
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,530
Lady Park wishes to see you.

293
00:23:57,139 --> 00:23:58,199
Very well.

294
00:24:07,609 --> 00:24:09,449
What are you up to?

295
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,590
I am trying to assist the King.

296
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,290
Preserving your family...

297
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,659
is assisting the King?

298
00:24:18,889 --> 00:24:19,959
Yes.

299
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:22,730
Only I can do that.

300
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:26,899
The King wishes to charge my husband...

301
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:30,070
and brother for murder, not treason,

302
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,570
so he can...

303
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:34,310
strip us of our power but save Prince Jinsung.

304
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,280
I can help him do that.

305
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,550
What can you do?

306
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,250
You should not ask me how.

307
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,320
You should ask what I want.

308
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,820
That is how a deal is made.

309
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,530
And if I refuse?

310
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,800
You will not be able to.

311
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:02,600
If my family were to be killed for treason,

312
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:07,040
my daughter-in-law would also perish.

313
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:10,179
Would you be all right with that?

314
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:18,990
Are you not in love with my daughter-in-law?

315
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,889
You were locked in the annex,

316
00:26:28,189 --> 00:26:30,389
but you must have heard of the crisis our family is facing.

317
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:34,429
I will resolve the problem within a few days.

318
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,658
You are to care for Ye Jin and Geun Seok...

319
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:39,770
so they do not suffer.

320
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,270
Mother. Are you...

321
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,000
all right?

322
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,740
If I dare say so,

323
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,040
I am worried about you.

324
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,280
However big a crisis may come,

325
00:26:58,879 --> 00:27:01,050
if the women of the house are strong and upright,

326
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:03,419
that household will never fall.

327
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:08,290
The Minister of Defence's family...

328
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,399
still thinks you are a matchmaker.

329
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,069
Visit them tomorrow...

330
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:15,369
and ensure Ye Jin's marriage will go ahead.

331
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,770
If they were to jump to conclusions...

332
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,340
and call off the marriage before I sort out this mess,

333
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,040
it would look bad for us all...

334
00:27:24,379 --> 00:27:26,480
when in the end, we will become in-laws anyway.

335
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:30,780
I understand,

336
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,790
Mother.

337
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:42,600
There is no reason we cannot wait another 2 or 3 days.

338
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,929
What do you think?

339
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:48,198
I believe she made the offer because she has a plan.

340
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,369
You could make the decision...

341
00:27:50,439 --> 00:27:52,270
once you see what Lady Park is up to.

342
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:55,939
But she said once it is taken care of,

343
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:58,010
there is something she wants.

344
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,879
What I want...

345
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,249
is for Erudite Maeng's daughters to be married...

346
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:05,649
at my house when my daughter also gets married.

347
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,459
She wants her daughter to be married at the same time as the old ladies?

348
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,359
I cannot figure out what she is up to.

349
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:20,629
I will look into it some more.

350
00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:28,939
Will Prince Jinsung really be poisoned?

351
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,750
Nothing has been decided yet.

352
00:28:33,449 --> 00:28:36,379
Prince Jinsung would not harm me.

353
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,480
You know everything.

354
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,449
Please protect him.

355
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:47,560
I wish to protect him more than anyone.

356
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,980
Whenever I wish to see you,

357
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,580
I look up at the night sky.

358
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:13,090
Do you remember releasing a lantern at Sunhwa Temple?

359
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,089
(To Lord Gyeongunjae)

360
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,320
You asked what I wished for.

361
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,159
What did you wish for?

362
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,539
I wished that you and I could successfully complete...

363
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,540
the matchmaking.

364
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,040
Did you not say revealing the wish would prevent it from coming true?

365
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,810
Why did you tell me what you wished for?

366
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,949
What is strange is,

367
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:46,649
I am sure I ruined one lantern,

368
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,260
but I saw two of them floating in the sky.

369
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,629
That is not strange at all.

370
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:55,490
I released one more later on.

371
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,060
If something is strange,

372
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:01,699
it is that I wished for the same thing you did.

373
00:30:02,369 --> 00:30:06,609
That is why, many years from now, when I speak of the past,

374
00:30:07,169 --> 00:30:10,279
I will fondly remember the time when we...

375
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,040
released a lantern together.

376
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:15,010
When I look up at the night sky,

377
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,179
I will think of you now.

378
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,359
I am sure...

379
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:31,129
our wishes will come true.

380
00:30:33,969 --> 00:30:35,669
Because you will never find out...

381
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,510
what I wished for.

382
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,100
Is the lieutenant in?

383
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:16,909
Why do they ask when they never wait for an answer?

384
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,050
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

385
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,419
I asked to see you...

386
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:35,689
because I had something to tell you.

387
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,260
I also have something to say to you.

388
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:41,270
May I go first?

389
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:43,840
Yes. You may go ahead.

390
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:47,869
Seol Hwa or Baek Myo. Which is better?

391
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,840
What?

392
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:52,810
For my new pen name.

393
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,679
Did you not agree to stop writing novels?

394
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:00,490
I do not write novels because I like to.

395
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:04,159
I write because I cannot help it.

396
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:07,530
So even if we marry,

397
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,959
I will go on writing.

398
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,830
Remember that.

399
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,600
I suppose you have not heard the news yet.

400
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,439
Because of my family,

401
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,409
I am afraid we cannot wed.

402
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:27,449
Because of how your in-law is being accused of treason?

403
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:31,879
You knew about it?

404
00:32:32,149 --> 00:32:35,519
That will not pose a problem at all for our plan to get married.

405
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,688
Why not?

406
00:32:36,689 --> 00:32:38,589
I may have to resign from my position.

407
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,189
Then I can...

408
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:42,090
support you.

409
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,699
So, just help me decide...

410
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,669
what my new pen name should be between Seol Hwa and Baek Myo.

411
00:32:56,679 --> 00:32:59,240
Do not even think that you will not marry me.

412
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:06,750
If you wish to hold me, you may do so.

413
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,119
Why are you here?

414
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,619
My lord needed to send something to Lady Park.

415
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,459
Right.

416
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:49,800
They could have sent a servant. Why are you here?

417
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,369
Are you here because you wanted to see the mess my family was in?

418
00:34:02,609 --> 00:34:04,010
Now that I am in this mess, do you think...

419
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:06,250
I got what I deserved?

420
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,389
Why are you saying what you do not even mean?

421
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,060
I am just...

422
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,400
Bu Kyum.

423
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,369
I am terrified.

424
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,810
The chief magistrate...

425
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,409
was here in the morning.

426
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,049
Meeting with the members of the Dongro Faction was a good call.

427
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:20,819
Oh, right.

428
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:23,960
I heard Lord Gyeongunjae...

429
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,929
offered to take care of it.

430
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,330
Did you promise him that you would pay him or something?

431
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,170
Before I answer that, I must ask you something first.

432
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,839
Is it true that you killed our elder daughter-in-law?

433
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:55,250
She was going insane.

434
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:57,989
She said she would tell her family everything,

435
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,159
so I had no choice.

436
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,130
She witnessed her father-in-law killing her own husband.

437
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:08,299
How could she not lose her sanity after seeing that?

438
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,440
So, it is true that you killed my son.

439
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,750
There was a reason I could not tell you.

440
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:25,448
In Hyun fell in love with a man.

441
00:36:25,449 --> 00:36:28,049
Our enemy's son, at that. On top of that,

442
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:32,690
he was also trying to expose our plan to the royal court.

443
00:36:33,389 --> 00:36:34,690
However, the enemy's son,

444
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,159
Min Seo Jun, is still alive.

445
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,600
You were a nobody.

446
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:43,568
I made you the left state councillor.

447
00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:46,409
How dare you kill my son?

448
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:49,610
So Hyun.

449
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,150
How dare you speak to your husband in that manner? Such insolence!

450
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:02,049
I will come back tomorrow evening...

451
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:05,560
and let you know how I will handle this matter.

452
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:08,889
Wait, my dear.

453
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,500
So Hyun!

454
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,939
They have not been convicted of treason yet.

455
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,469
If it turns out that they are not guilty after all,

456
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,838
things will become awkward between you and Lord Jo's family.

457
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:26,779
That concerns me too.

458
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,150
But even if they are not guilty of treason,

459
00:37:30,179 --> 00:37:32,449
Lord Jo supposedly killed his elder daughter-in-law.

460
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,689
I heard their younger daughter-in-law...

461
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,249
had a few screws loose,

462
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,520
which always bothered me.

463
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:45,960
I actually know their younger daughter-in-law very well.

464
00:37:46,529 --> 00:37:48,299
People say she has gone mad, but it is a false rumour.

465
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,569
All things aside,

466
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,869
Young Master Si Yeol and Lady Ye Jin...

467
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:54,909
would make a good couple.

468
00:37:56,369 --> 00:37:58,940
It is not that I dislike their daughter.

469
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,949
Si Yeol seems to like her too.

470
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,250
I should not have let them meet so soon.

471
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,949
Oh, dear.

472
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:14,190
Anyway, all right.

473
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,600
Although I do not think the situation will change.

474
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,069
Gosh.

475
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:23,069
Goodness me.

476
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,069
My gosh.

477
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,479
I cannot ask questions, so I need not answer either.

478
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,589
Fine, I feel much better this way.

479
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:44,619
Lady Jung.

480
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:48,588
You cannot be out and about dressed like that at this critical time.

481
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:50,400
What if Lady Park finds out?

482
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,769
I left the house with her permission because of Ye Jin's wedding,

483
00:38:53,770 --> 00:38:55,029
so do not worry.

484
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:59,199
I thought I should stop by for I wanted to see you.

485
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:02,868
I suggest you go and stay with your maternal family.

486
00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:05,210
- I will let Lieutenant Jung know... - No way.

487
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,880
I must do my duty.

488
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:09,849
Knowing that the family is in distress, how could I...

489
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:11,719
desert them, leaving Geun Seok and Ye Jin behind?

490
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,020
I am very worried about you.

491
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:24,730
I wanted to see you because I knew you would be worried.

492
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:28,730
My mother-in-law said she would get it all sorted out, so do not worry.

493
00:39:28,969 --> 00:39:31,100
She is certainly capable of getting this sorted out.

494
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:32,969
You know that too.

495
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,639
Are you not in love with my daughter-in-law?

496
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:44,949
Then I will go ahead and think that we have a deal.

497
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:49,989
I do not want the family to suffer disgrace any further.

498
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:51,690
Hence,

499
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,130
I must ask you not to see my daughter-in-law again.

500
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,560
If you keep seeing her,

501
00:39:57,299 --> 00:39:58,630
I will have no choice...

502
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:01,069
but to do things my way to protect the family.

503
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:06,069
Do not trust Lady Park too much.

504
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:08,440
Pardon me?

505
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:13,549
My mother-in-law is the only one I can trust now.

506
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:19,480
If you are that worried about me,

507
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,420
please write me back right away when you receive my letters.

508
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,790
If not, I will be so frustrated that I might die.

509
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,969
In the guestroom, you will find a brown pill.

510
00:40:40,469 --> 00:40:42,069
Bring it to me.

511
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:45,980
It is very important, so do not tell a servant to look for it.

512
00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:47,850
Find it yourself.

513
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,580
Yes, Mother.

514
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,849
For today's dinner,

515
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,389
prepare your uncle-in-law's dinner too.

516
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,060
As for his dinner,

517
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:05,230
cook something nice, and make plenty of food.

518
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,299
Bring a bottle of ginger wine too.

519
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,159
Thank you.

520
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,190
You can go now.

521
00:41:35,429 --> 00:41:37,699
Yes, Mother.

522
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:14,429
So Hyun!

523
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,869
My gosh.

524
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:28,409
How are you holding up?

525
00:42:29,279 --> 00:42:30,279
Gosh.

526
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,350
It is so uncomfortable being here.

527
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:38,420
Anyway, I heard Lord Gyeongunjae would get things sorted out.

528
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:40,659
I bet...

529
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:43,799
it is because of the painting I had snatched up.

530
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:51,969
Then it is all thanks to me.

531
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
But...

532
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,509
even Lord Gyeongunjae would not be able to make everything go away.

533
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,279
Right, he would not be able to.

534
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:11,589
Then,

535
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,589
I would not mind being exiled to a quiet place for a few months.

536
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:20,369
Preferably to Jinju.

537
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,900
I hear the kisaengs there are very beautiful.

538
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,770
Oh, my.

539
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:46,659
So Hyun, you are the only one who truly cares about me.

540
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,529
Tomorrow,

541
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,860
you will be released.

542
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,029
So, relax and sleep well.

543
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,139
That is very soon.

544
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,509
So Hyun.

545
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,650
Thank you.

546
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:36,670
I do not think I can do it.

547
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:43,549
You must stay strong.

548
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:47,319
This is the only way we can save...

549
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,150
Prince Jinsung and the family.

550
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,440
Give us some privacy.

551
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,009
Yes, Your Highness.

552
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:24,860
Your Highness.

553
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,420
I am sorry.

554
00:45:31,529 --> 00:45:32,560
So?

555
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,400
How can we get this situation sorted out?

556
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:40,310
I believe that everyone...

557
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:43,110
would only speak the truth when faced with death.

558
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,179
Hence,

559
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,880
prove your innocence...

560
00:45:48,509 --> 00:45:50,318
by taking your own life.

561
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:51,618
(Jajin: Taking one's own life)

562
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:54,750
Then the King and the people would believe...

563
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:58,159
that you were unfairly framed due to political reasons.

564
00:46:01,830 --> 00:46:02,889
I...

565
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:07,799
I would gladly take my own life to save the family name,

566
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:10,899
but Geun Seok is the only one left to carry on the family name,

567
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:13,298
so it would be irresponsible to give up and take my own life.

568
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:15,138
As the head of the family,

569
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:17,139
I should stay alive to restore the family name later on.

570
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:21,349
As for the treason,

571
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,350
the King cannot do anything if I keep on denying it.

572
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,889
Must you disappoint me to the end?

573
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,290
How dare you.

574
00:46:29,549 --> 00:46:31,719
You cannot speak to your husband in that manner.

575
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:36,659
It was a wise decision to write your will in advance.

576
00:46:37,259 --> 00:46:38,299
What did you say?

577
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,130
I wish to prove my innocence through death.

578
00:47:43,089 --> 00:47:45,159
Eight years ago, my son, Jo In Hyun,

579
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:49,630
obtained golden silkworm poison to get rid of Prince Unhae...

580
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:51,798
because of his loyalty toward Prince Jinsung,

581
00:47:51,799 --> 00:47:53,639
who was the Crown Prince at the time.

582
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:56,739
Upon finding out about it,

583
00:47:57,739 --> 00:47:59,509
I killed my precious eldest son...

584
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:03,080
to stop him from committing high treason.

585
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,579
I killed my own child...

586
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:08,249
for the sake of my loyalty toward His Majesty.

587
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,019
But I have now been accused of treason...

588
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,420
because of an unverified statement.

589
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,789
The unfairness of this infuriates me,

590
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,060
and I wish to take my own life to prove my innocence.

591
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,170
So, the left state councillor took his own life.

592
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,969
What is the cause of Park Bok Ki's death?

593
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,440
We were keeping a close watch on him and found no signs of foul play.

594
00:48:34,049 --> 00:48:35,948
It appears that the extreme psychological distress...

595
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:37,650
resulted in his sudden death.

596
00:48:40,549 --> 00:48:42,519
Eight years ago, the main suspect...

597
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,619
in the murder of the Deputy Administrator of Pyongyang...

598
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,389
died suddenly in a similar manner before his transfer to Hanyang.

599
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:53,299
He brought it upon himself.

600
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:58,400
"One would speak the truth when faced with death."

601
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,138
"Since Jo Young Bae proved his innocence..."

602
00:49:00,139 --> 00:49:03,339
"through death, so he is to be acquitted of all charges."

603
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:08,150
"As for Park Bok Ki, he confessed to the murder of Lee Cho Ok,"

604
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:09,810
"so it will be recorded..."

605
00:49:10,449 --> 00:49:12,949
"that he was guilty of murder."

606
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,389
Like Park Bok Ki, Lord Jo should have only been acquitted of treason.

607
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:22,759
Why did you acquit him of murder too?

608
00:49:23,830 --> 00:49:26,199
Because of his eldest son, who is now deceased.

609
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:31,939
Jo In Hyun came to see me before he left for Pyongyang...

610
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:33,469
to work as the deputy administrator eight years ago.

611
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,939
He said he would thoroughly investigate...

612
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:39,839
the corruption in Pyongyang even if his family was involved.

613
00:49:41,549 --> 00:49:43,750
At first, I did not believe him fully.

614
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,679
But he kept his word.

615
00:49:46,049 --> 00:49:47,488
He informed me of the details...

616
00:49:47,489 --> 00:49:49,250
concerning his uncle Park Bok Ki's corrupt deeds.

617
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,189
Shortly after I received his last letter where he wrote...

618
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:54,159
that he was close to obtaining solid evidence,

619
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,659
he suddenly died,

620
00:49:57,860 --> 00:50:00,159
so I felt terrible.

621
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,270
The left state councillor’s acquittal...

622
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,839
was my way of repaying his son for his loyalty.

623
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,980
So after all, the left state councillor’s late son was the one...

624
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,049
who saved the family, not Lady Park.

625
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:34,529
What is the matter that you suddenly barged in like that?

626
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:40,069
Come and sit down if you have something to say.

627
00:50:48,449 --> 00:50:50,409
Mother, was it you?

628
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:53,319
What do you mean?

629
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,219
If you are referring to how the problem has been taken care of...

630
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:02,360
Yes, it was me.

631
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,199
And you helped me.

632
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,710
Did you find it?

633
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,299
Thank you.

634
00:51:42,429 --> 00:51:43,529
You can go now.

635
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,369
Mother, I always looked up to you...

636
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:53,610
for you seemed to know the answer to everything.

637
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,909
But you killed your own family.

638
00:51:57,779 --> 00:51:59,250
I think this is wrong.

639
00:52:01,589 --> 00:52:03,089
You think it is wrong?

640
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,020
Then your father-in-law...

641
00:52:06,989 --> 00:52:09,060
and uncle-in-law would have been executed for treason.

642
00:52:10,089 --> 00:52:11,158
Prince Jinsung and Royal Noble Consort Suk...

643
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:12,230
would have been poisoned to death,

644
00:52:12,699 --> 00:52:14,529
and Geun Seok and Ye Jin would have been forced into slavery.

645
00:52:14,869 --> 00:52:17,569
Was letting the family fall apart the right thing to do?

646
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:23,239
What do you think you would have done in this situation?

647
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:28,150
I am pretty sure...

648
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,549
that you would have made the same choice.

649
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:35,920
I will take care of everything for the funeral.

650
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:38,460
Only think about Ye Jin's wedding.

651
00:52:40,989 --> 00:52:42,630
Father has passed away.

652
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,130
Ye Jin's wedding cannot take place right away.

653
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,929
I told you that I would take care of everything.

654
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:50,869
Just do as I say.

655
00:53:03,449 --> 00:53:06,250
They will soon announce the plan to select the Crown Princess.

656
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:09,850
Make sure you submit Lady Ha Na's Virgin Note.

657
00:53:11,759 --> 00:53:13,159
This is happening, at last.

658
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:15,560
Well understood.

659
00:53:16,989 --> 00:53:20,560
You knew that Lady Ha Na and the Crown Prince were meant to be?

660
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,040
Ten years ago,

661
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:26,500
while watching the royal family's parade,

662
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,839
I saw the string connecting Ha Na to the Crown Prince.

663
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:35,079
Did you tell her not to wed...

664
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,610
for you did not want to send her to the palace?

665
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:39,980
That was one of the reasons.

666
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:43,520
If Prince Jinsung, who has more power, were to ascend the throne,

667
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:46,690
the Crown Prince would be as good as dead.

668
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:51,159
I can assure you that Prince Jinsung would never ascend the throne.

669
00:53:51,799 --> 00:53:55,500
Lady Ha Na saved the Crown Prince's life twice.

670
00:54:03,969 --> 00:54:05,310
Can Agents of Love...

671
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:08,409
recognize their own soulmates?

672
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,150
Of course, they can.

673
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:13,719
But...

674
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:17,690
you think a soulmate must make your heart flutter, so in your case...

675
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,690
I am not so sure.

676
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,830
What do you mean?

677
00:54:23,529 --> 00:54:26,060
Heart flutters can be caused by fear,

678
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:28,770
seeing pretty women,

679
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,699
and even by hearing drums.

680
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,569
When you feel your heart flutter, you will be confused...

681
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:38,179
whether it was caused by meeting your soulmate...

682
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,080
or by impulsive feelings.

683
00:54:42,949 --> 00:54:44,009
Yes.

684
00:54:44,949 --> 00:54:46,250
You are right.

685
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,920
I heard some Agents of Love were more capable than others.

686
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,460
I suppose you are one of the less capable ones.

687
00:54:57,529 --> 00:54:59,960
I have never had someone criticize my capability before.

688
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:02,929
What I know for sure...

689
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,900
is that you and Lady Yeoju are not meant to be.

690
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,569
I saw who Lady Yeoju was meant to be with.

691
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:18,049
Did you also know that Lady Yeoju was a member of Lord Jo's family?

692
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:24,259
I told you...

693
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:26,819
to forget her because I was worried about her.

694
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:29,360
If people find out about your relationship,

695
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:33,259
she will suffer humiliation for she is a woman.

696
00:55:42,139 --> 00:55:44,409
Jo Young Bae's wife has submitted an appeal.

697
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:47,850
You should read it first.

698
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,319
In my husband's will,

699
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:01,560
he wrote that his funeral be kept as simple and short as possible.

700
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:03,830
He also wrote that...

701
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,060
his daughter's wedding should not be postponed because of his death.

702
00:56:08,029 --> 00:56:10,130
Also, the left state councillor was...

703
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:13,900
greatly concerned about the issue of spinsters and old bachelors.

704
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:17,880
Knowing that Erudite Maeng's family was not well-off,

705
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:20,739
he said to marry off Erudite Maeng's daughters along with my daughter.

706
00:56:21,549 --> 00:56:26,080
So please give me permission to hold his funeral as quickly as possible.

707
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:34,589
It is now my turn to grant her wish.

708
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:41,830
The funeral should take place the following month,

709
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:45,040
but in the left state councillor’s case,

710
00:56:45,699 --> 00:56:49,170
he lost his dear son due to his loyalty,

711
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:53,679
then lost the other son as well to an illness.

712
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,508
So I cannot ignore his love for his daughter,

713
00:56:56,509 --> 00:56:59,119
who is his only remaining child.

714
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,389
Hence, I give you my permission...

715
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:06,759
to complete the funeral before her wedding.

716
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:19,069
Also, your family and the family of the Minister of Defence,

717
00:57:19,799 --> 00:57:22,109
the father of the groom-to-be, will each receive...

718
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:24,440
ten rolls of silk as your wedding gift.

719
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,279
I was going to use the funeral...

720
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,549
as an excuse to postpone the wedding...

721
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,020
and call it off eventually.

722
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:39,389
But even the King knows about it now,

723
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,960
so I have no choice. I am doomed.

724
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,900
Oh, dear.

725
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:48,798
I believe she thinks that hosting the spinsters' joint wedding,

726
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,968
which was organized by the royal court,

727
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,939
at her residence along with her daughter's wedding...

728
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,869
will show everyone that her family is still influential.

729
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:57,810
Seeing her achieving her goal with such tact...

730
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:01,549
makes me relieved that she is not a man.

731
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:03,779
Your Majesty.

732
00:58:07,380 --> 00:58:09,949
Even if everything goes well with the spinsters' joint wedding,

733
00:58:10,549 --> 00:58:12,658
please do not accept my appeal...

734
00:58:12,659 --> 00:58:14,060
to annul my marriage.

735
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:16,489
What do you mean?

736
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,400
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

737
00:58:21,929 --> 00:58:24,069
I submitted the appeal...

738
00:58:24,699 --> 00:58:26,540
because of the Princess' final wishes.

739
00:58:41,449 --> 00:58:42,619
Work for the government,

740
00:58:44,119 --> 00:58:45,759
and help my father.

741
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,540
The Princess said that?

742
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,330
Get down on your knees.

743
00:59:23,589 --> 00:59:25,029
- Why? - What do you think?

744
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:28,000
I need something to step on to jump over the wall.

745
00:59:28,770 --> 00:59:30,400
If you step on me,

746
00:59:30,529 --> 00:59:31,969
I will break my back.

747
00:59:32,299 --> 00:59:34,440
It has not even been six months since I got married.

748
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:36,008
Must you brag about being a married man?

749
00:59:36,009 --> 00:59:37,540
You talk about it all the time.

750
00:59:39,779 --> 00:59:41,579
Just step on this and jump over.

751
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,779
You are tall.

752
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:49,718
Or shall I jump over the wall and talk to her?

753
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,219
No, why would you do that?

754
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:54,020
I will do it. Stand watch.

755
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:55,860
Yes, my lord.

756
01:00:19,219 --> 01:00:20,279
Let me go first.

757
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:22,589
Stay there for a moment.

758
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,199
Trust me and come down.

759
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:34,319
Breaching the ethical codes is considered a grave sin.

760
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,059
How did you think to jump over the wall...

761
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:38,900
to sneak into a widow's house?

762
01:01:39,659 --> 01:01:41,060
What if someone saw you?

763
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,540
Did you miss me that much?

764
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,810
I was heading out to see you too.

765
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:55,179
I suppose we were on the same wavelength.

766
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,580
My lady.

767
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:05,159
You are okay, right?

768
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,630
Now that I got to see you,

769
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,699
I am okay.

770
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:24,440
I did not jump over the wall...

771
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:27,810
because I wanted to see you.

772
01:02:31,049 --> 01:02:34,850
I simply wanted to tell you to stop sending me letters.

773
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:41,158
Is it because you are worried about me?

774
01:02:41,159 --> 01:02:42,230
- I... - No.

775
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:46,460
Like you said,

776
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,000
my feelings have died down.

777
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:59,839
I do not love you anymore.

778
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:28,739
(The Matchmakers)

779
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:46,420
Watch your conduct.

780
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:48,989
Being unable to be with the one you love...

781
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:52,900
I believe the Crown Prince needs Lord Gyeongunjae.

782
01:03:53,230 --> 01:03:56,429
I have realized that I will never be the person you want me to be.

783
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:00,369
From now on, I will find my own way.

784
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,310
I am...

785
01:04:02,509 --> 01:04:07,179
falling for you more and more.

786
