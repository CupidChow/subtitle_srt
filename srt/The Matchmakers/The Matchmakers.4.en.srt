00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,629
Currently?

00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:59,059
(Kim O Bong, 28 years old, Jung Woo's butler)

8
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,559
After I got married, my lord became more pitiful.

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,369
He will not experience the joy of love at that age...

10
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:06,770
and will grow old as a widower.

11
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,668
Rather than becoming a government official,

12
00:01:10,669 --> 00:01:13,940
I hope my lord will get married after completing the matchmaking.

13
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:17,879
Then he will finally realize how cruel it is...

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,448
to make your newlywed subordinate...

15
00:01:19,449 --> 00:01:21,880
work overtime on the first Buddha's birthday after our wedding.

16
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,860
Please cut out what I said.

17
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:34,759
Can I start?

18
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:42,470
I always feel anxious whenever I think of Lady Jung.

19
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:45,568
She does not know how scary her mother-in-law is.

20
00:01:45,569 --> 00:01:47,809
Yet, she keeps roaming outside.

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,780
What?

22
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,750
Have you not heard?

23
00:01:53,309 --> 00:01:54,618
She killed her first daughter-in-law...

24
00:01:54,619 --> 00:01:55,978
and received a Title of Womanly Honour.

25
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,280
Gosh, how terrifying.

26
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,419
By the way,

27
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,890
please do not say I told you this.

28
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,259
All right. Here you go.

29
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,530
How is this a lotus flower?

30
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,470
What?

31
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,840
Never mind.

32
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,639
We should just buy one in the market tomorrow.

33
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:26,049
Should we buy one?

34
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:28,519
Is it that bad?

35
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,090
As for Lady Jung,

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,889
her essence is made of love.

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,699
(Episode 4: It Takes 4.5 Seconds to Fall in Love)

38
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,500
Three long hoods?

39
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:51,370
Embroider the other two except for this piece.

40
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,910
Please let the previous embroiderer do it.

41
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,108
One is for me, and the other is for you.

42
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,509
What about the remaining one?

43
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,880
These are not for us. They are for the brides-to-be.

44
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,319
You have enough long hoods already.

45
00:03:06,449 --> 00:03:08,859
When I try them on, they are not presentable enough.

46
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,530
Buy me a new long hood too.

47
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,329
By the way, do you need them urgently?

48
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:18,298
Actually, the embroiderer...

49
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:21,169
is a noble lady who lives in Mount Nam Valley.

50
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,440
She will be wearing her own work.

51
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,138
But that family is having trouble,

52
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:29,039
so I am not sure if I can ask her.

53
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,650
What do you mean?

54
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:34,948
The madam of the family went senile...

55
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:37,149
and refused to marry off her daughters.

56
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,749
She was arrested by the office.

57
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,850
What?

58
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:42,960
No, Soon Duk.

59
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,729
It is time for dinner.

60
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,729
Oh, goodness.

61
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,530
Please tell me the details.

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,668
How is my mother a criminal?

63
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,940
What is her crime?

64
00:03:58,269 --> 00:03:59,439
By law,

65
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,909
if a woman is unable to get married by the age of 24 due to reasons...

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,810
other than poverty,

67
00:04:05,009 --> 00:04:06,509
her parents shall be responsible.

68
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,018
Therefore, even if she will be a concubine,

69
00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:11,049
when a marriage prospect appears,

70
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,850
it is a felony for the parents to reject him.

71
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,060
Hence, as the chief magistrate,

72
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,060
I sentence Lady Cho to 30 flogs.

73
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,270
Magistrate Kim, my mother is ill.

74
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,270
I am working on my own marriage,

75
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,679
so please retract the sentence.

76
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,178
Did you not say the same thing three years ago,

77
00:04:38,179 --> 00:04:39,779
when spinsters were getting married?

78
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,320
Looking at this picture, I think your mother is the problem.

79
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,090
I will not let it slide this time.

80
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,460
However, Lady Cho. If you allow your child to marry right now,

81
00:04:49,619 --> 00:04:51,989
I will pretend this never happened.

82
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:57,770
Even if my daughter wanted to,

83
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,999
I will never accept this marriage.

84
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:01,369
Mother.

85
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:09,609
Maeng Ha Na's mother has been arrested by the office.

86
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:14,849
She is a filial daughter.

87
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,580
She will not let her mother be mistreated like that.

88
00:05:19,749 --> 00:05:21,019
I cannot believe...

89
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,059
I will finally have what I want thanks to Lord Gyeongunjae.

90
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:32,399
(A few days ago)

91
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,400
Let us drink.

92
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,868
Oh, come on.

93
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,739
You should have seen how furious the left state councillor was.

94
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:49,479
Although I am not his subordinate, he keeps bossing me around.

95
00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:52,350
He reports to my sister anyway.

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,559
Here, please accept my drink and calm down.

97
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,299
When Prince Jinsung takes over the throne,

98
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,128
it is not the left state councillor but Minister Park here...

99
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:06,869
who will become the king's uncle.

100
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,498
- Yes. - You are right.

101
00:06:09,499 --> 00:06:11,469
- Goodness. - That is right.

102
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,569
- Yes. - That is correct.

103
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,939
Why, you fools.

104
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:16,580
How can you...

105
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,650
say something so true?

106
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:23,679
It is so true.

107
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,350
- Let us drink. - Goodness.

108
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,129
By the way,

109
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,030
how is Lord Gyeongunjae's progress with matchmaking the old ladies?

110
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,400
I am not sure.

111
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:45,009
Anyway, since they are at it,

112
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:47,439
I hope they will marry off the first daughter, at least.

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,910
She is 24 years old already.

114
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:51,010
What about that?

115
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,510
If a woman does not get married by 24...

116
00:06:54,679 --> 00:06:57,780
on grounds other than poverty, her parents can be punished.

117
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,419
I may be penalized too.

118
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,489
I...

119
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:06,830
may be able to solve your problem.

120
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,659
I will take in Erudite Park's daughter...

121
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,970
as my concubine.

122
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,970
Your concubine?

123
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,238
But she has so many rumours.

124
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,939
The rumour of her being possessed with the female ghost...

125
00:07:20,369 --> 00:07:21,710
was started by me.

126
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,678
Since those spinsters acted like they were so desirable,

127
00:07:24,679 --> 00:07:26,410
I wanted to teach them a lesson.

128
00:07:33,189 --> 00:07:35,720
I see. So that was your plan.

129
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,228
You had the big picture in mind.

130
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:40,390
How brilliant.

131
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,129
Lusting after women...

132
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,869
is the spirit that men have, is it not?

133
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:57,840
You are right.

134
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,929
You must be quick.

135
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,790
Lady Cho, this is Lady Yeoju.

136
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:48,228
Lady Ha Na and I will settle this by noon.

137
00:08:48,229 --> 00:08:50,700
Please stall time for us before your sentence.

138
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,739
Soon Gu!

139
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,278
What brings you here at this time?

140
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,079
I know. I have to be at breakfast,

141
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,350
but I have an urgent matter.

142
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,779
What is it?

143
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,249
There is a lady who was treated unjustly.

144
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:15,420
Can you open the door to the petitioner's drum?

145
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:26,100
She left so early. Why is she not back yet?

146
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:33,070
Oh, whatever. I did my best, okay?

147
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,149
My, the sleepyhead Ye Jin woke up early to see me off.

148
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,919
Did the sun rise from the west today?

149
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,758
Since Mother is away,

150
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:51,489
I should see you off.

151
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,190
Have a nice day.

152
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,899
By the way, where is Soon Duk?

153
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:01,899
I did not see her at breakfast either.

154
00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:05,310
Well, Soon Duk is sick...

155
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,149
Where did you go so early in the morning?

156
00:10:16,119 --> 00:10:17,879
Did you stay out last night?

157
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,690
Of course not.

158
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:23,790
I went to wipe the seat in your palanquin.

159
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,830
You should have asked a servant.

160
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,258
I wanted to do it myself since you will be riding in it.

161
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:34,070
Since my wife is away, you are the lady of the house.

162
00:10:34,529 --> 00:10:36,139
Look after the servants...

163
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:38,809
and make sure to treat guests with special care.

164
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,369
Yes, Father.

165
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:07,670
Mother, please eat.

166
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,239
In this situation, you should eat up and be strong.

167
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:13,170
All right.

168
00:11:13,171 --> 00:11:14,608
Oh, goodness.

169
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:16,879
Why is the law so crappy?

170
00:11:18,009 --> 00:11:21,080
I thought Lady Yeoju and Ha Na would settle this. Where are they?

171
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,190
It is time for your sentence.

172
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:29,960
I have yet to eat. Please wait.

173
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,320
Pardon?

174
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,199
How much does she want to eat? Why is she so slow?

175
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,300
Please sit here.

176
00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:45,769
What are you doing? Hurry up and come.

177
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,519
So?

178
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:03,259
Did you change your mind through the night?

179
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,259
I would rather get beaten to death.

180
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,129
I will not change my mind.

181
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,868
Execute her punishment!

182
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:17,940
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

183
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,670
- Goodness. - Mother.

184
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,960
The Minister of Defence, an official of this kingdom,

185
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,720
did not do his part to look after the people in this drought.

186
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,430
Rather, he swindled their fortune by giving out high-interest loans...

187
00:12:41,029 --> 00:12:42,399
while taking away their young daughters...

188
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:44,229
instead of interest.

189
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,840
His lascivious did not end there.

190
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,499
He uses the law as an excuse...

191
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,170
to forcefully take me as his concubine.

192
00:12:53,609 --> 00:12:54,979
All I wish to do is...

193
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,180
serve my blind single mother as her eldest daughter.

194
00:12:57,509 --> 00:12:59,680
How does this turn into her crime?

195
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,680
What is going on?

196
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,289
She exposed the high-interest loans the Minister of Defence gave out.

197
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,050
My goodness. I am so proud of her.

198
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:14,758
- Goodness. - Why is she doing this?

199
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:16,060
- My goodness. - This way.

200
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:19,800
Stop the punishment!

201
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:22,939
A petition was filed for Lady Cho by the petitioner's drum.

202
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,939
Her punishment is put on hold until the investigation...

203
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,070
of the Department of Justice is over by the royal command.

204
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,580
The royal command?

205
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:34,680
There are no legal problems with this, right?

206
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,319
Darn it. I may end up in trouble...

207
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,749
for trying to help the Minister of Defence.

208
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,619
- Let her go immediately. - Yes, sir.

209
00:13:47,489 --> 00:13:49,529
Mother, are you all right?

210
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:52,170
- Yes. - I am so relieved.

211
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,940
That impudent brat.

212
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,340
How dare she use the petitioner's drum?

213
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:13,019
The Honourable and Respectful Madame of Sunhwa Temple sent a letter.

214
00:14:13,989 --> 00:14:14,989
My sister?

215
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,019
She found out already?

216
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:19,059
(Sunhwa Temple)

217
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,498
It has not been too long since he brought in a concubine.

218
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:23,560
(The Mother of the Minister of Defence)

219
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,440
He must have wanted to see it through while I was here.

220
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,170
Do not worry too much.

221
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:36,540
I told him not to say a word or respond in any way...

222
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,009
through a letter.

223
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,649
Do you choose...

224
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:42,519
to stay silent in this situation?

225
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,889
My sister told me to stay silent.

226
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:48,960
What does a woman know about politics? Why do you listen to her?

227
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,090
Well, she said...

228
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,060
He did not do anything wrong in the eyes of the law.

229
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:56,158
Also, it would be difficult to prove the rumour...

230
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,499
that he gave out usurious loans.

231
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:01,529
It is best not to respond to a matter such as this one.

232
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:04,939
Things do not look very good...

233
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,509
inside the palace and the outside.

234
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,738
If you do not provide a convincing explanation,

235
00:15:08,739 --> 00:15:10,879
His Majesty will nitpick over the usurious loans you give out.

236
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:16,550
Do you have a plan?

237
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,690
I took a measure.

238
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,519
You can head over...

239
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,159
to Gyeongunjae right now.

240
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,590
Gyeong...

241
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,129
All right.

242
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:30,359
(Gyeongunjae)

243
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,869
Stand by my side with a sad face.

244
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,790
If I help out this time,

245
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,359
the left state councillor will find me an office out of the city.

246
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,519
Please do me a favour.

247
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:59,759
It is a piece of cake for you to justify a matter like this.

248
00:16:00,029 --> 00:16:01,089
If something goes wrong with me as the eldest son,

249
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,159
it would be the end of our family.

250
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,430
Imagine how much resentment our late father will hold against you.

251
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:10,499
How much longer must I continue to look after you?

252
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,239
This is the last time.

253
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,379
Please do it for your pregnant sister-in-law, niece, and nephew.

254
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:29,090
Walk faster.

255
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,460
Just let me down.

256
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,810
The left state councillor told me about your matter.

257
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,979
It is just my luck.

258
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,379
So? Can you find a justification to avoid responsibility?

259
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,018
It will cost you quite a lot...

260
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,820
as this is a grave matter.

261
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,590
Is that all right?

262
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,230
I do not care how much you demand.

263
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:13,899
So...

264
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,609
Just give me the justification.

265
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,080
Starting from last year, the drought...

266
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,350
kept...

267
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,060
I...

268
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,358
I was not wrong yet.

269
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:41,429
"Starting from last year and until this year."

270
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:44,300
You were missing, "and until this year."

271
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,499
If you already forgot the first part,

272
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,070
how will you recite everything before His Majesty?

273
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,179
Can you cut it down drastically?

274
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,179
I cannot shorten it anymore.

275
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,060
No matter how convincing this justification is,

276
00:18:10,459 --> 00:18:13,490
how am I supposed to memorize everything you wrote down...

277
00:18:13,689 --> 00:18:15,899
as someone who started as a military officer?

278
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,570
Yes.

279
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,929
What if you do this?

280
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,040
What is it?

281
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:32,948
Maeng Ha Na, the eldest daughter of Maeng Sang Chun,

282
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:36,480
who was a former erudite of Sungkyunkwan,

283
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,379
sounded the petitioner's drum yesterday...

284
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:42,090
and protested against the malicious behaviour of the minister of defence.

285
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:44,320
Minister of Defence, do you have a statement?

286
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,060
Your Majes...

287
00:18:51,859 --> 00:18:52,899
I have...

288
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,009
Minister of Defence suddenly came down with a cold,

289
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:04,379
so he was not able to speak.

290
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,208
Hence, he wrote out...

291
00:19:06,209 --> 00:19:09,619
his statement for this incident before he came into the office.

292
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,020
Is that so?

293
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,689
In that case, you can read the statement he wrote,

294
00:19:14,949 --> 00:19:16,560
Chief Royal Secretary.

295
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:17,719
Yes, Your Majesty.

296
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,929
"I would like to state..."

297
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,269
"this incident began because of my devotion to serve."

298
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,270
What?

299
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,109
Is it devotion to keep concubines and give out usurious loans?

300
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
Is it?

301
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:44,879
Continue reading.

302
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,350
Yes, Your Majesty.

303
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,289
"The people were unable to pay back grains..."

304
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,289
"they borrowed last year due to continuous drought."

305
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,899
"Instead, they often returned to borrow more grains."

306
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:59,429
"Hence, I also have continuously let the people borrow grains..."

307
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,299
"just as I did last year,"

308
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:05,000
"only by taking a small charge in return."

309
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,938
You have not paid back what you have borrowed last year.

310
00:20:08,939 --> 00:20:10,810
You do not qualify to borrow more.

311
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,809
Please give me just enough to last until I harvest barley.

312
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,349
My family is about to starve to death.

313
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,249
You can borrow some from the minister of defence.

314
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,949
But he takes twice as much for interest.

315
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:23,619
Next.

316
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,590
"In the process of paying back what they owed,"

317
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,188
"Kim Tae Jin, my former tenant farmer,"

318
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,059
"asked to pay off his debt..."

319
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:32,299
"by giving up his daughter as one of my family."

320
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,530
"I accepted his offer and freed him of his debt..."

321
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:36,899
"became the beginning of this misunderstanding."

322
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,409
Your daughter is the interest, so you shall pay back the principal.

323
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,040
- Goodness, my lord. Do not do this. - My girl!

324
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,810
- No! - Mother!

325
00:20:48,649 --> 00:20:51,148
Goodness, no! Honey! Our daughter.

326
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:52,689
No, do not do this!

327
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,590
- Not my daughter! - No, please...

328
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:56,320
Not my daughter!

329
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:00,530
Was that what happened?

330
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:05,029
"Also, I wanted to take in Maeng Ha Na as a concubine..."

331
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,929
"as your loyal subject."

332
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,938
"Since the days of previous kings,"

333
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:10,800
"people have said plagues..."

334
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,569
"and natural disasters are caused..."

335
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:14,439
"when the resentment of the people become piled up."

336
00:21:15,369 --> 00:21:17,678
"Among such resentment, the bitterness of spinsters is..."

337
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,149
"the most profound of them all."

338
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,148
"She is about to turn 24 years old,"

339
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,378
"but she does not have a chance of ever getting married..."

340
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:25,749
"because of hearsay surrounding her conduct."

341
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:27,550
"I decided to sacrifice myself..."

342
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:29,520
"and take Maeng Ha Na in as my family..."

343
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:33,629
"to reduce the resentment of our people."

344
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:36,500
I have misunderstood you briefly,

345
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:39,369
although you were concerned so dearly about this kingdom.

346
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,469
I am deeply moved by your loyalty.

347
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,969
I grant you ten rolls of cotton.

348
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,590
Allow me to read the rest of the statement.

349
00:22:01,590 --> 00:22:03,719
"The rest?" That was all.

350
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,389
What?

351
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
I...

352
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:12,100
Minister of Defence, you are unwell.

353
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:14,830
You do not need to speak.

354
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,070
Continue reading.

355
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,810
"These foolish people cannot comprehend my intentions."

356
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:24,079
"Therefore, I shall change..."

357
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,750
"the means of showing my loyalty to level with them."

358
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,479
"Maeng Ha Na..."

359
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,520
"has not become 24 years old yet as the law prohibits."

360
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:34,590
I will encourage her to marry before the year is over.

361
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,559
And I will make sure those who borrowed grains...

362
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,959
from the government office and me last year...

363
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,889
only pay back the principal.

364
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,399
"Also, those who borrow this year..."

365
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,230
"will not have to pay any interest."

366
00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:55,939
"But the government office needs to take an interest,"

367
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:57,879
"so I shall use my own money,"

368
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,810
"what is my own,"

369
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,679
"to relieve the difference."

370
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,379
The officials...

371
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,489
of the Department of Justice shall provide administrative assistance...

372
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:10,060
to Minister of Defence as he carries out his pledges.

373
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,819
Also, report the result...

374
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,789
back to me in a quick and continuous manner.

375
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,159
I shall implement everything immediately.

376
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:19,770
Immediately.

377
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:22,240
Goodness.

378
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:27,240
Gosh.

379
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,050
Goodness.

380
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,719
It took so much work to accumulate my fortune.

381
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,520
Sim Jung Woo!

382
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,060
I will destroy you!

383
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:03,709
You already justified his case through the first part.

384
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:06,879
Why did you present a solution although he did not ask for it?

385
00:24:09,379 --> 00:24:11,519
An unconventional action was necessary...

386
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,189
to turn this scandal into a moving tale.

387
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:18,219
Minister of Defence also agreed to do so beforehand.

388
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,590
When did I do that?

389
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,398
It will cost you quite a lot...

390
00:24:24,399 --> 00:24:26,330
as this is a grave matter.

391
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,969
Is that all right?

392
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:34,309
I thought you were demanding payment for creating this justification.

393
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:36,540
You should have made yourself clear!

394
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:40,010
How could I have made myself clearer than that?

395
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
I mean,

396
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,219
he really was not clear about this.

397
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,260
Please allow me to leave.

398
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,270
That...

399
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,580
Did you just see him smile?

400
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,519
He was out to get us from the start.

401
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,189
You caused all this to happen because of your short memory.

402
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:22,118
If you could not memorize it,

403
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:24,260
at the very least, why did you not read everything?

404
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:26,659
It was too long.

405
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,230
You must have had a tough day.

406
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,740
I heard you told Ha Na to sound the petitioner's drum.

407
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:46,750
I am greatly indebted to you through this incident.

408
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,409
Thank you.

409
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,889
To be honest, the inspector played a bigger part in this matter.

410
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,090
He went to the palace and petitioned to His Majesty.

411
00:25:58,419 --> 00:25:59,629
That old-fashioned man from Bukchon?

412
00:26:02,629 --> 00:26:04,698
(1 day ago)

413
00:26:04,699 --> 00:26:06,329
(2 days ago)

414
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,800
(3 days ago)

415
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,749
My goodness.

416
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,379
Did you do this?

417
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,379
What do you mean?

418
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,749
You knew the law said the parent was at fault...

419
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,118
if their child did not marry until they turned 24.

420
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:33,590
That is how you made Lady Ha Na become the minister's concubine.

421
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:35,530
Was it not a good thing...

422
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,730
if their eldest daughter got to marry so easily?

423
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,600
I knew it would be the case,

424
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,040
and it surely was you who came up with this idea.

425
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,540
I am utterly disappointed in you!

426
00:26:47,409 --> 00:26:49,639
You are disappointed in me?

427
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:51,439
Because of what?

428
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,409
It is much easier for her to marry now that this happened to her!

429
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,850
Do not use...

430
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,550
the word, handle, to discuss marriage.

431
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,320
Right.

432
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,388
Fine.

433
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,760
You broke the promise to abide by my method of matchmaking,

434
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,030
so our contract has terminated as of this hour.

435
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:12,729
I did not do...

436
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:15,198
For the next two months, I will do everything I can to make sure...

437
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:18,399
not one of Erudite Maeng's daughters gets married.

438
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,409
What do you mean?

439
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:25,179
From now on,

440
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:30,020
I will make sure you fail to carry out the royal command.

441
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:48,070
I hope that is not Maeng Ha Na...

442
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,069
banging on that petitioner's drum. It cannot be right.

443
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,169
That is correct.

444
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,570
Lady Ha Na is banging on the petitioner's drum.

445
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,109
Do you truly think she can use that to punish Minister of Defence?

446
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:01,280
Yes.

447
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:03,079
Everyone in the city knows...

448
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,779
he bullies the people with his high-interest loans...

449
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:07,990
and is a lustful man.

450
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:10,118
A month ago, he took a 14-year-old girl as a concubine,

451
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:13,730
calling her the interest for his ridiculous loan.

452
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:15,659
That is human trafficking.

453
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,358
It makes no sense that a man like that will go unpunished.

454
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,799
First off, the loans he gives out is a separate matter,

455
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,069
and it is tough to prove, so he cannot be held responsible.

456
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,840
Also, there is no legal problem for man to be lascivious.

457
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:27,809
The lawful problem is...

458
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:30,439
with Lady Cho, who stops her spinster girl from marrying.

459
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:34,209
She just hit the petitioner's drum after committing a crime,

460
00:28:34,409 --> 00:28:36,820
so she will also be punished for obstructing public officials.

461
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,218
There is no such ridiculous law.

462
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:42,990
Would I not know the law much better as an inspector?

463
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,859
That is true.

464
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,969
Goodness. What should I do?

465
00:28:55,429 --> 00:28:56,869
Should I not have told her to hit it?

466
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,709
I will resolve this.

467
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:08,749
What? Why?

468
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,948
Unlike how you jumped to a conclusion, I did not do this,

469
00:29:11,949 --> 00:29:14,689
and I have the ability to resolve this matter.

470
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:17,060
What? Wait.

471
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:19,790
You did not do this?

472
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:24,229
Wait, you should have said so...

473
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,830
before I became worked up.

474
00:29:25,969 --> 00:29:28,629
You did not give me a chance to say anything.

475
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:33,409
Also, there is one thing I need to clarify.

476
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:40,510
I am...

477
00:29:43,649 --> 00:29:46,050
not a man who will disappoint you.

478
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,050
Please settle this for her good.

479
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,149
Do not worry.

480
00:30:22,689 --> 00:30:24,718
No matter what you imagine, I am a man who is...

481
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,429
capable of doing much more.

482
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,809
Many people were troubled because of the money lending business...

483
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:49,250
the minister of defence operated.

484
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,580
Can we use this chance...

485
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,489
to hold him responsible for acting as a loan shark?

486
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:58,858
However, no one who took out a high-interest loan from him...

487
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,929
will come out and testify, afraid of his retaliation.

488
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,599
On top of that, the reason she banged on the drum...

489
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,199
was not because of the loan.

490
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,628
All she asked for was to release her mother from getting punished.

491
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:10,369
If we had to nitpick over this,

492
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:13,168
Lady Cho was the one who broke the law.

493
00:31:13,169 --> 00:31:14,709
It is a complicated matter.

494
00:31:15,969 --> 00:31:17,379
Your Majesty.

495
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,250
Lord Gyeongunjae is here.

496
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,050
Let him in.

497
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,740
What is it?

498
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:47,608
I found a way to punish the minister of defence...

499
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:50,310
for the usurious loan by using Maeng Ha Na's petition.

500
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:52,679
All of a sudden?

501
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,178
All right. Tell me.

502
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,019
The minister of defence will find a way to resolve this,

503
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,819
so please gather your subjects...

504
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,020
to question him openly.

505
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,919
All right. I understand.

506
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,199
Anyway, how is everything going with the marriage of the spinsters?

507
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,868
You have less than two months left.

508
00:32:12,869 --> 00:32:14,429
Why are you meddling with this...

509
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,540
Wait. Come closer.

510
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,340
You will not ask me...

511
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:24,080
to let you off marrying spinsters after resolving this, right?

512
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:27,309
Holding him responsible is...

513
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,020
a process I am taking to marry the spinsters.

514
00:32:30,719 --> 00:32:32,648
I see. I knew it was odd...

515
00:32:32,649 --> 00:32:34,619
that you ran over this quickly.

516
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,059
As you know, life is...

517
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,429
precious for everyone.

518
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,030
I knew the minister of defence would not do that.

519
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,300
Everything was the inspector's idea?

520
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,840
Gosh, he is kind of wonderful.

521
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:51,199
How is he wonderful?

522
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:53,310
She will end up...

523
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,639
as his concubine anyway if we fail to marry.

524
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,649
You can...

525
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,619
get married.

526
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,948
I know all three of you will...

527
00:33:08,949 --> 00:33:11,188
marry someone you fancy within May.

528
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,320
Give me your trust.

529
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,369
I am tired. Let us go home.

530
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,899
Yes, Mother. Excuse us.

531
00:33:31,209 --> 00:33:32,740
Thank you for today.

532
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:37,719
Have a safe trip home.

533
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,010
I heard what happened at the King's Office.

534
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,980
I wanted to stay quiet just as you suggested,

535
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,949
but your husband said I had to come up with an excuse,

536
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:10,379
so I asked Lord Gyeongunjae, and this happened.

537
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,250
The left state councillor must have said that for a good reason.

538
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,059
If you think about it, everything happened...

539
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,589
because of your carelessness.

540
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:24,428
Only if your husband did not egg me on...

541
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,469
There is no reason to nitpick over what has already happened.

542
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:30,940
We just need to make sure this does not happen again.

543
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:38,909
Did you find out who opened the door to the petitioner's drum for her?

544
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,080
Not yet.

545
00:34:42,279 --> 00:34:44,778
Maeng's daughter does not have any governmental connections.

546
00:34:44,779 --> 00:34:48,190
She must have received help to open up the door to the drum.

547
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,190
You are right.

548
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,460
I will find out immediately.

549
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,420
Are you sure my family will not suffer...

550
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,949
in any way?

551
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,560
You will not draw any suspicion,

552
00:35:26,259 --> 00:35:29,389
so, of course, your family will not suffer from any harm.

553
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:31,199
Do not worry.

554
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,639
Your Highness, the head shaman wishes to see you.

555
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,980
Yes, what is it?

556
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,250
Please dismiss others.

557
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,150
You may leave.

558
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:07,500
The energy in the palace out of the ordinary.

559
00:36:10,799 --> 00:36:12,670
It feels just like the day...

560
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:17,880
eight years ago, the day Her Highness the Princess passed.

561
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:23,420
If you do not let the Prince leave the palace,

562
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:26,949
his life will be in danger.

563
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:45,040
That was order-made. It is not for sale.

564
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,210
You can pick out something in the back.

565
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:55,179
I am looking for the one who ordered this.

566
00:36:56,619 --> 00:36:57,949
Lady Yeoju?

567
00:37:01,989 --> 00:37:03,589
That is Lady Yeoju.

568
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,218
During the high season for weddings,

569
00:37:06,219 --> 00:37:07,889
I am asked...

570
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,630
to make and deliver celadon to Lady Yeoju in Hanyang.

571
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,000
Lady Yeoju.

572
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,540
You will go to Hamgyeong Province before Buddha's birthday?

573
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,879
The peddlers we were supposed to travel with...

574
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,710
decided to depart early.

575
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:31,678
In this situation,

576
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,448
I do not think I can be there to receive the wedding day...

577
00:37:34,449 --> 00:37:36,489
for Lady Ye Jin at your place after Buddha's birthday.

578
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:37,790
What should we do?

579
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,489
I cannot stop you from travelling to make big money.

580
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,460
I will manage.

581
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,270
Will you take Bok Hee as well?

582
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,100
Bok Hee is staying behind at the inn.

583
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:54,310
It must be sad not to be with Mom on Buddha's birthday, Bok Hee.

584
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:58,040
If she has to go, it is better for her to make it quick.

585
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:01,650
Where did you find such a trustworthy daughter?

586
00:38:03,009 --> 00:38:05,920
You saved her, my lady.

587
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,819
I cannot believe I will get to see Mount Geumgang with my eyes.

588
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,089
I am so excited.

589
00:38:12,489 --> 00:38:14,130
Let us hurry.

590
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,230
You may fall down again. Be careful.

591
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,299
What?

592
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,670
Hey.

593
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,210
Soon Gu! Hey, wake up.

594
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,580
Hey there. What should we do?

595
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,130
You are right.

596
00:38:50,299 --> 00:38:52,730
You were pregnant with Bok Hee back then.

597
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:57,239
Did you hear that? I was the one who saved you.

598
00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:00,940
You cannot forget me once you are a prominent merchant.

599
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:03,408
You know that you promised first...

600
00:39:03,409 --> 00:39:05,509
to find me a husband, right?

601
00:39:06,409 --> 00:39:07,679
Look how clever she is.

602
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:09,480
How adorable.

603
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:21,889
Hello, my lord.

604
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,298
I am here to meet Lady Yeoju today.

605
00:39:25,299 --> 00:39:27,029
- So I have heard. - Where are you going?

606
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:28,869
Where...

607
00:39:38,279 --> 00:39:41,750
I did not know you had this space back here.

608
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:46,080
She said she would be responsible for letting you in, so you can come.

609
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,189
But you do not work...

610
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:49,718
for the Capital District Office or the Department of Justice...

611
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,259
with this marriage as the front, do you?

612
00:39:51,619 --> 00:39:52,689
I also do not like...

613
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,290
the Capital District Office or the Department of Justice.

614
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:55,730
Anyway.

615
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,259
Are you saying Lady Yeoju is in here?

616
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,940
It smells musty in here.

617
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:06,839
Do you ever clean up?

618
00:40:09,469 --> 00:40:11,610
Do I just go through this door?

619
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:15,179
Wait! You cannot close that door!

620
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:16,818
I really am not with the Capital District Office...

621
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:18,150
or the Department of Justice!

622
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,920
Do you know who I am?

623
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,189
The door. Please open the door.

624
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,730
You are easily frightened.

625
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:35,330
Are you in there?

626
00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:49,610
Goodness. My gosh.

627
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:52,920
Good grief.

628
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,239
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

629
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,440
Right. You were here.

630
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,718
This is where we copy novels.

631
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,149
But the Capital District Office has heightened their surveillance,

632
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,718
so it will be left empty for a while.

633
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,920
I plan on using this place for our matchmaking operation.

634
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,718
Right. If you have anything urgent to pass to me...

635
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:33,929
as we work together,

636
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,130
you can leave a letter with the chief of the inn.

637
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:39,159
Do not do anything urgently outside of the plan.

638
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,569
Sure.

639
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,670
But just in case.

640
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,040
And answer me just once.

641
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,210
Fine.

642
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,639
Ta-Da.

643
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,540
I put this up to boost our motivation.

644
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:58,580
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

645
00:42:00,219 --> 00:42:01,650
(Matchmaking)

646
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,040
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

647
00:42:20,009 --> 00:42:21,469
I knew something did not seem right.

648
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:24,809
I can read, but it is rather tough to write.

649
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,750
If you cannot write Chinese characters correctly,

650
00:42:27,049 --> 00:42:28,509
just use the Korean alphabet.

651
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,849
But that would make me look not too smart.

652
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,790
You look less smart when you get the character wrong.

653
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:39,319
Anyway. Tell me what...

654
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:43,429
the matchmaking operation is.

655
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:45,259
Explain it to me.

656
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:53,940
Let me share the overall schedule for the matchmaking operation.

657
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,610
Please look at the map.

658
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,579
(April 8)

659
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:03,480
On Buddha's birthday, we will find the matches for the ladies.

660
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,650
On the day of the May Festival, the matches will turn into fate.

661
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:09,789
On May 15, the man will ask for the ladies' hands.

662
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:10,818
(Asking for the hand: Visiting the bride's family for permission)

663
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:13,989
Lastly, on May 25, they will hold a triple wedding.

664
00:43:15,489 --> 00:43:17,699
The overall schedule seems appropriate.

665
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,500
Thank you.

666
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:24,739
We will begin the operation on April 8 at Sunhwa Temple.

667
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:31,310
Sunhwa Temple is where old bachelors of the city gather.

668
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:32,709
We will find a suitable man...

669
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,980
for the ladies by conducting the first eye contact.

670
00:43:49,089 --> 00:43:51,360
First eye contact is my secret weapon,

671
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,928
which incapacitates one's background...

672
00:43:53,929 --> 00:43:56,230
and widespread reputation.

673
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,939
It is a perfect operation for these ladies...

674
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,310
who suffer from false rumours.

675
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,279
There are no records of the tactics...

676
00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:06,139
used by the agents of love.

677
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,048
However, they each have skills...

678
00:44:09,049 --> 00:44:10,179
used to make matches.

679
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,489
Is she really an agent of love?

680
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:17,060
Therefore, what we need to do is...

681
00:44:18,619 --> 00:44:21,130
prepare for the first eye contact at Sunhwa Temple.

682
00:44:23,759 --> 00:44:25,600
By first eye contact,

683
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,569
do you literally mean looking into each other's eyes?

684
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,339
Of course, it is.

685
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:33,170
It is literally the moment when a man and a woman...

686
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:34,869
look into each other's eyes.

687
00:44:35,409 --> 00:44:36,569
Goodness.

688
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:40,040
How can you find your spouse by doing something like that?

689
00:44:40,179 --> 00:44:41,479
It is more reasonable...

690
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,380
to look for an adequate family to marry them to.

691
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,249
How much time do you think...

692
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,190
a man and a woman need to fall in love?

693
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:51,719
It is one-half of the hundredth of a quarter-hour.

694
00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:53,460
It is almost an instant.

695
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,158
It is that fast?

696
00:44:56,159 --> 00:44:59,060
People who have felt this before would know.

697
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,338
Right, most people of noble birth...

698
00:45:07,339 --> 00:45:08,908
do not get a chance to have the first eye contact.

699
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:10,379
If they are lucky, they only get to do it...

700
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,839
at their wedding, so do not worry.

701
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:15,980
I met my husband through an eye contact...

702
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:18,319
at a book rental shop.

703
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,719
- At a book rental shop? - Yes.

704
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:25,089
Our first encounter was like a scene from a novel.

705
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:13,500
A man who pulls out a book from a high shelf...

706
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:16,039
often shows up in stories,

707
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,678
but it never happens in real life.

708
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:20,250
On that day, it did to me.

709
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,219
I asked my husband after we married, and he also had fallen for me then.

710
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:26,988
How can you apply...

711
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:29,549
the experience of a merchant to a noblewoman's wedding?

712
00:46:29,949 --> 00:46:31,859
The noble class marry...

713
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,318
to serve their ancestors...

714
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:35,159
and carry on their family lineage.

715
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:37,199
Love is not necessary.

716
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:39,759
No.

717
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:42,969
Love is everywhere, and it is the beginning of everything.

718
00:46:43,069 --> 00:46:44,838
Upward affection is to one's parents,

719
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:46,899
and downward is to their children.

720
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,440
And it all starts from a married couple's love.

721
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:53,110
What a sentimental sophistry by a lady.

722
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:55,150
But it is true.

723
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,920
Then, let us teach the ladies how to make the first eye contact.

724
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,718
Does that mean one needs skills to make eye contact?

725
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,988
Of course.

726
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:04,189
Make good eye contact,

727
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,860
and she will most likely get married.

728
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,460
A delicate yet intricate skill is needed.

729
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:12,960
Let us go.

730
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:42,230
Lady Ha Na and Lady Doo Ri.

731
00:47:42,389 --> 00:47:44,399
It will not take long. Come to the yard...

732
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,299
and join us, please?

733
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:49,669
I can see and learn everything from here.

734
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,770
Do not worry.

735
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
Unbelievable.

736
00:47:53,569 --> 00:47:54,569
Mother.

737
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:57,209
- Shall we read "Book of Han" today? - All right.

738
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,739
What about you, Lady Doo Ri?

739
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,310
Can you not see how much needlework has to be done?

740
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:09,589
Let us begin with you, Lady Sam Soon.

741
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,690
My lord. Please stand near that wall.

742
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:21,170
Good grief.

743
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,569
Oh, a bit more to the left.

744
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,940
"Left."

745
00:48:27,509 --> 00:48:30,039
No. I meant right.

746
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,179
Really, you should have said so from the start.

747
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,480
Yes, that is perfect.

748
00:48:36,949 --> 00:48:38,750
I cannot understand what this is for.

749
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,889
We will learn about making the very first eye contact today.

750
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:45,420
I will demonstrate first. Please watch carefully.

751
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:50,600
First, put on the long hood like so.

752
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:52,929
Then cover.

753
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:32,000
Return after putting on the long hood back on.

754
00:49:35,969 --> 00:49:38,139
- That is it? - Yes.

755
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:42,009
It may look easy, but it is a delicate yet complex skill.

756
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,079
The core of making the first eye contact...

757
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,048
is when you reach the spot after walking around,

758
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:50,250
lower the long hood slightly so that your face is visible,

759
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,719
and smile lightly toward the wall in front of you.

760
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:55,259
Would you like to give it a go?

761
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:56,960
I know exactly what I must do.

762
00:49:57,230 --> 00:49:59,258
You, the author of "The Lady's Private Life,"

763
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:00,730
will pull it off perfectly.

764
00:50:01,029 --> 00:50:02,199
- Go ahead. - All right.

765
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:23,150
My goodness, Lady Sam Soon.

766
00:50:24,489 --> 00:50:27,559
You were told to smile. So why are you frowning?

767
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,059
But I am smiling right now.

768
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:31,360
That is absurd, no?

769
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:34,799
- This is bad. - Lady Sam Soon.

770
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:37,940
Oh, right.

771
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:41,169
It may be awkward as this is your first try.

772
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:43,369
Practicing will make you better at it.

773
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:04,959
Let us meet here again after an hour.

774
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,230
I am happy with it as I am paid and do not have to work.

775
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:10,739
But will you really not go to your grandparents' house?

776
00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:12,469
Everything is fine as long as you keep quiet.

777
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:16,670
You do know this is a secret from my sister-in-law as well, right?

778
00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:21,250
I have been paid, so of course, it is a secret.

779
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,500
What brings you here?

780
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,299
I came to see you.

781
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:52,239
Lady Ha Na and Lady Doo Ri. Please take a turn while I am here.

782
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:57,250
Ladies.

783
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,650
Did you not promise to cooperate?

784
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:07,630
Doo Ri. Let us do it and get it over with.

785
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,489
A promise is still a promise.

786
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:13,230
Give me a moment, Mother.

787
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,209
I was commissioned to make it. You must keep it clean.

788
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,380
Use your own.

789
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:32,080
These long hoods you are making look like they are for us.

790
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,250
The one without flower embroidery is mine.

791
00:52:35,089 --> 00:52:36,150
Am I wrong?

792
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,758
I knew she was smart.

793
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,819
You are right.

794
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,929
Really?

795
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:45,730
- Is this mine? - Yes.

796
00:52:45,860 --> 00:52:48,000
My gosh, it is beautiful.

797
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,889
As expected, you did an amazing job.

798
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:19,258
But Ha Na did not look toward the wall...

799
00:53:19,259 --> 00:53:21,069
or smiled.

800
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:23,029
Sam Soon.

801
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:26,199
The objective of Lady Yeoju's first eye contact skill...

802
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:28,969
is to show the men standing near the wall...

803
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,439
my single-braided hair and my face...

804
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,610
by sliding the long hood down to tell them I am a maiden.

805
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,449
So the stunning I do not have to smile.

806
00:53:37,850 --> 00:53:38,880
You are implying...

807
00:53:40,279 --> 00:53:42,020
that I am ugly, right?

808
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,029
Instead, you are cute.

809
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:52,330
I am cute only to you.

810
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:56,599
Not being pretty is not your fault.

811
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,199
Do not let it upset you.

812
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,009
The rumour that the first daughter was stupid...

813
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:07,040
was made up due to her outstanding beauty.

814
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,089
Can you really be here and not at your grandparents' house?

815
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:20,089
My grandmother is away at the Sunhwa Temple.

816
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:23,860
As for my grandfather, his mind wanders.

817
00:54:24,259 --> 00:54:25,699
He does not recognize me.

818
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,270
Give me your hand.

819
00:54:31,139 --> 00:54:33,139
- What? - Hurry.

820
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:35,810
Right.

821
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,440
Here.

822
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:49,650
What is with this?

823
00:54:50,150 --> 00:54:51,190
Do not take it off.

824
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,529
You will come to Sunhwa Temple on Buddha's birthday, yes?

825
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:06,540
Well, no. I have to spade the rice paddy that day.

826
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:10,509
But you will not work until night time.

827
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:15,310
I have other work to do as well, so I cannot make it.

828
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,580
Jeez.

829
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:20,889
Then who will make my lantern this year?

830
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:30,460
Would you like to try, Lady Doo Ri?

831
00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:34,770
Must I practice to look good to men?

832
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,670
Lady Doo Ri, think of it like this.

833
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:43,008
It is not to look good to men.

834
00:55:43,009 --> 00:55:45,908
It is to choose the man I want skilfully.

835
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:49,110
I do not have a man I want.

836
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:53,919
If you continue to be uncooperative,

837
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,150
I will report your sister to the Capital District Office.

838
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:57,719
- Really, you... - Oh, dear...

839
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:02,389
Stand in front of me.

840
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:13,139
I will never smile before a man, all right?

841
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:18,908
Go to the wall, my lord.

842
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:21,449
- Did she put down the needle first? - She did.

843
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,169
I get why there are rumours that...

844
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:51,879
she works at a kisaeng house,

845
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:53,279
although people know it is for her clothes.

846
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,480
It is because of that mysterious charm.

847
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,119
You pass, Lady Doo Ri.

848
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,020
Continue with your needlework.

849
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:03,319
You must finish the long hood before Buddha's birthday...

850
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,489
to wear them out that day.

851
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:08,460
Now then, Lady Sam Soon.

852
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,259
Give it another try.

853
00:57:10,389 --> 00:57:12,499
I have gotten a sense of it now.

854
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:15,669
Everything was good. But it would be great...

855
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:18,069
if you could smile more lightly like this.

856
00:57:18,469 --> 00:57:21,868
A bit more lightly. Relax your face more.

857
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:24,139
Give it a go first. Come on.

858
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,489
Good grief.

859
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,520
What is taking her so long?

860
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:39,860
Father will leave his office any minute now.

861
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,129
Gosh, my lady!

862
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:47,769
Why are you back so late?

863
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:50,369
I am sorry. My work took longer than expected.

864
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,469
Ye Jin. Did something bad happen back at your grandparents' place?

865
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:57,610
Did someone nag at you?

866
00:57:57,909 --> 00:58:00,008
Nothing bad happened.

867
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:01,549
Let us go already.

868
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:05,480
She is really quick-witted.

869
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,649
Be quiet.

870
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:08,389
What is it?

871
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:23,069
Where have you been this late in the night?

872
00:58:23,330 --> 00:58:25,369
Father, that is...

873
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:28,009
I asked Soon Duk to join me at our grandparents' place.

874
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,679
But Grandfather kept repeating what he said over and over again.

875
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,080
So we left the house quite late.

876
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,380
I see.

877
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:38,020
So that was what happened.

878
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,690
Great work, Soon Duk.

879
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,460
Let us head inside.

880
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,600
Lady Ye Jin has gotten better at lying like you, my lady.

881
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,610
That is what you call an exceptional student.

882
00:59:03,839 --> 00:59:05,409
"An exceptional student."

883
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:07,779
How cool.

884
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,369
A court maid of Dongungjeon...

885
00:59:34,839 --> 00:59:36,539
is inches away from death after eating...

886
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:37,940
the crown prince's leftover late-night snack.

887
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:40,580
We cannot leave the crown prince in Dongungjeon...

888
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:42,879
when we do not know where the poison is from.

889
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:43,909
But my queen,

890
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:48,489
did you not say you made that snack yourself?

891
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,119
That is why I feel much more anxious.

892
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:54,659
Calm down first, my queen.

893
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,229
Even the court physician said...

894
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:59,400
he could not conclude if it was due to poison.

895
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:02,069
The Dongungjeon court maid could have an illness.

896
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:05,569
But the symptoms of Dongungjeon's court maid...

897
01:00:06,339 --> 01:00:08,969
are too similar to that of the dead princess.

898
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,540
Did the head shaman not tell us that...

899
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:13,879
the princess suffered misfortune...

900
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,710
instead of the crown prince eight years ago?

901
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:17,749
As the head shaman suggested,

902
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,649
allow the crown prince to stay at the private house...

903
01:00:19,650 --> 01:00:20,920
for the time being.

904
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:23,089
I cannot simply believe the shaman's words...

905
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:27,259
and have the crown prince of this country leave the palace.

906
01:00:39,339 --> 01:00:41,269
I told you I would not go.

907
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,908
Must you drag me to it?

908
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:45,710
You had new clothes and a long hood made for Buddha's birthday.

909
01:00:46,409 --> 01:00:47,639
So what has gotten into you?

910
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:48,980
I do not know.

911
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,610
Everything has become boring.

912
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:53,919
Why is the lotus lantern festival of Buddha's birthday...

913
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,219
boring to you, Aunt?

914
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,420
You will understand when you become my age.

915
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,758
You are not even 20 to say that.

916
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,159
I know.

917
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:05,560
Let us go.

918
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:11,239
Will you really not have a look at your future husband's face?

919
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,540
I will meet him once we get married.

920
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:16,239
Seeing him beforehand makes no difference, no?

921
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:28,189
Lady Yeoju will surely come to see you,

922
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,019
so stop looking around.

923
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,819
Well, I am indeed noticeably good-looking.

924
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:37,060
Does your chest hurt again?

925
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,360
With the crowd, I expected this to happen.

926
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:41,869
I am all right.

927
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:06,020
What is it? Did you find Lady Yeoju?

928
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:07,889
No.

929
01:02:08,290 --> 01:02:09,730
I must have gotten the wrong person.

930
01:02:10,529 --> 01:02:13,400
Someone who should be in the palace would not be here.

931
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,739
Has there been any changes in Dongungjeon?

932
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:24,039
A court maid of Dongungjeon...

933
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,009
met a sudden death.

934
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,480
After that incident, the inspection court maids...

935
01:02:30,710 --> 01:02:32,379
searched through my court maids' rooms...

936
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,080
on the pretext of regulating the people.

937
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:38,219
They must be looking for the poison.

938
01:02:39,719 --> 01:02:40,719
"Poison?"

939
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:43,159
Good grief, is this not bad?

940
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,460
Did you mess up your job?

941
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,899
The crown prince is still alive and well,

942
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:50,399
while our hand has been exposed,

943
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,869
so Lady Park has to act very carefully now.

944
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,509
Our goal is to keep the crown prince alive and well.

945
01:02:57,909 --> 01:03:00,210
What nonsense are you spouting?

946
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,319
When the crown prince leaves some food behind,

947
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,630
eat it along with the medicine I gave you.

948
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:21,159
Why did you have the useless court maid...

949
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:24,500
eat the hard-earned poison?

950
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:28,639
It was to make the crown prince leave the palace.

951
01:03:29,139 --> 01:03:32,409
Will we be able to do that with this incident?

952
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:34,508
What if they find the source of the poison?

953
01:03:34,509 --> 01:03:36,580
Will it not put us in danger?

954
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:38,650
Do not worry about that.

955
01:03:39,179 --> 01:03:40,218
Nobody found out...

956
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:42,589
the poison from eight years ago was golden silkworm poison.

957
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:46,389
So, nobody will figure it out this time, either.

958
01:03:48,690 --> 01:03:52,258
What is more, I have hired someone who will make the crown prince...

959
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:54,000
leave the palace.

960
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:57,670
Let her in.

961
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:08,480
Are you not the head shaman of Sungsoochung?

962
01:04:08,909 --> 01:04:11,920
I thought you were one of the Queen's people.

963
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,080
I do not serve the Queen...

964
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:19,389
but the future owner of the palace.

965
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:25,960
And so,

966
01:04:25,961 --> 01:04:27,830
did the crown prince leave the palace?

967
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,169
I informed the Queen to have him travel...

968
01:04:30,170 --> 01:04:32,270
on Buddha's birthday when there was a crowd.

969
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:34,639
He must have moved...

970
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,409
to the private house tonight.

971
01:04:42,909 --> 01:04:44,250
You and I are the only ones...

972
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,819
who should know you are staying here.

973
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:50,150
I will come pick you up myself on the day you return to the palace.

974
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:52,889
Do not forget that.

975
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:56,060
Where will the crown prince reside?

976
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:58,860
As the Queen is a very cautious person,

977
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:01,299
she kept it even from me.

978
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,568
If we do not know that,

979
01:05:04,569 --> 01:05:07,040
it is the same as when the crown prince is in Dongungjeon.

980
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:08,709
Must you complicate things?

981
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,210
The private house the crown prince is staying at...

982
01:05:10,670 --> 01:05:12,008
will be the house of the princess's family...

983
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:14,139
or the King's nanny.

984
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,679
Finding that place will not be hard.

985
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:19,819
And when we succeed,

986
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:23,519
the Queen could be blamed for sending the crown prince...

987
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,460
to a private house in secret and not us.

988
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,889
It is surely not a bad plan.

989
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:36,230
Why are you telling us this only now?

990
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,969
You should have given us a heads-up.

991
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:43,170
There will be no mistakes when you do not know a thing.

992
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,350
Shall I transform into Lady Yeoju now?

993
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,520
- What? - Really.

994
01:06:10,869 --> 01:06:13,000
I wonder which family she is from.

995
01:06:13,139 --> 01:06:14,369
I have never seen her before.

996
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,480
So my makeup transformation is perfect.

997
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,750
Where should I change?

998
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,529
Oh, dear.

999
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,659
How about here?

1000
01:06:43,029 --> 01:06:45,299
My apologies.

1001
01:06:52,679 --> 01:06:54,210
Good grief.

1002
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:06,790
My gosh.

1003
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:08,989
Goodness.

1004
01:07:09,489 --> 01:07:11,330
Why is it so crowded today?

1005
01:07:12,259 --> 01:07:14,560
I need to put on makeup to meet Lord Sim.

1006
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:33,049
Stop being nervous.

1007
01:07:33,319 --> 01:07:35,790
Even my brother cannot recognize me before and after makeup.

1008
01:07:35,989 --> 01:07:37,020
Right.

1009
01:07:48,029 --> 01:07:49,130
What do I do?

1010
01:08:24,270 --> 01:08:25,270
You...

1011
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:29,570
What is with this outfit?

1012
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:32,480
Do you...

1013
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:35,009
recognize who I am?

1014
01:08:35,249 --> 01:08:37,310
How can I not recognize you?

1015
01:08:58,129 --> 01:09:01,039
(The Matchmakers)

1016
01:09:19,959 --> 01:09:22,128
Lord Gyeongunjae is a matchmaker?

1017
01:09:22,129 --> 01:09:23,928
Maybe he is helping the King.

1018
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,258
Seize your fated match...

1019
01:09:25,259 --> 01:09:26,529
and live happily.

1020
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:27,998
Let us do this!

1021
01:09:27,999 --> 01:09:29,498
Please pardon me.

1022
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,200
I knew you were Hwa Rok.

1023
01:09:31,469 --> 01:09:33,538
You must watch your widowed daughter-in-law.

1024
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:35,409
A private tutor will arrive.

1025
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:37,008
Come to the vacation home near the field.

1026
01:09:37,009 --> 01:09:39,208
Your heart pounds when you see the one you like.

1027
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:40,439
What did you wish for?

1028
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,479
Stand still in front of me.

1029
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:44,008
Walk with your eyes on me.

1030
01:09:44,009 --> 01:09:45,850
I will be your shield.

1031
