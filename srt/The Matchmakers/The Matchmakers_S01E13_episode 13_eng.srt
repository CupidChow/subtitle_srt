1
00:00:19,190 --> 00:00:21,450

2
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,290

3
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:31,630

4
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:47,130

5
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,990

6
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,790
They say a noble is taken care of by his mother's family when he is young,

7
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:04,430
by his wife's family when he is an adult,

8
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:10,250
and by his in-laws' family when he is old. Right?

9
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:16,930
Honestly, if the Left State Minister or His Excellency Park was not related to Prince Jin Seong,

10
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,360
I would have been the leader of Dongno.

11
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,070
Is there anyone who does not know they are only puppets of the minister's wife?

12
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,050
For a man to be successful, he needs to marry well.

13
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,630

14
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:51,600
No matter what Gyeongwoonjae does, he is within the grasp my sister's palm in the end.

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,010
Just wait and see whether my sister takes care of this or not.

16
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,830
Oh, that is right.

17
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:02,160
You asked about the incident from eight years ago.

18
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,220
Back then, the plan was to put geumjam poison in Crown Prince's food

19
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:10,350
when everyone was busy with the princess's wedding.

20
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,860
Sorry?

21
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,840
You see, there is no risk in that plan because the poison works without any symptoms.

22
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,070
Then, no investigation can be done

23
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:23,680
and there was no way to be suspected, which made it a perfect plan.

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
Anyhow, I am really curious, too.

25
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,430
Why did the princess die?

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,190

27
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,800
Hold on. It is correct to tell...

28
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,050
Sister first before I tell Brother-in-law.

29
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,980
Sister!

30
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,760
Sister!

31
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:59,280
Sister, I told you we should have gotten rid of Gyeongwoonjae!

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,160
What are you making a big fuss about?

33
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:09,240
He is trying to kill all of us by making us traitors.

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,830
Goodness, I am so glad I went there.

35
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,190
Say it so I can understand the situation.

36
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,060
I was at Gyeongwoonjae just now.

37
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,630
Do not worry. I was not caught.

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,870
That is not important right now.

39
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,180
Gyeongwoonjae was looking into how we acquired the geumjam poison.

40
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,420
It looks like Uncle left in a hurry in shock after seeing that.

41
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,700
What is going to happen to my family now?

42
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,060
Tonight, the Left State Minister and His Excellency Park will be arrested for murder.

43
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,730
I think I must go back now.

44
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:22,020
Please do not go.

45
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,670
I cannot send you there alone.

46
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,210
Let us just go far away just like this.

47
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,960
Your Excellency,

48
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,370
I am not going there to die.

49
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,780
I am going home.

50
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,520
Madam...

51
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:12,240
I am satisfied with knowing...

52
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,030
you were unharmed today.

53
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,400
But I found his weakness we can use to get him.

54
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,550
I brought this in the midst of that urgent situation.

55
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:51,130
It looks like our conniving nephew's wife is colluding with Gyeongwoonjae.

56
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,270
  You must be on your way back from seeing the king.

57
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,600
  Your Excellency.

58
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,940
 Oh, yes.

59
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,300
A prince and a married woman are having an affair!

60
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,350
We can bring him down right away.

61
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,160
Geun Seok's mother is our family member, too.

62
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,120
However, Sister...

63
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:21,080
I will take care of it, so do not tell anyone about this matter for now.

64
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,390
 Madam, please come outside!

65
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:26,540
 Madam!

66
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,370
What brings you here at this hour?

67
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
How dare you barge in here and cause a scene!

68
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,710
Your Excellency Park Bok Gi,

69
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:50,020
you are under arrest for murdering Lee Cho Ok last September.

70
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,750
- Arrest him. 
  - Yes!

71
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,140
Let go!

72
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,190
Hey!

73
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:05,120
Lee Cho Ok killed herself!

74
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,670
Also, do you have proof I killed her?

75
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,910
Never mind.

76
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,620
Does His Excellency the Mayor even know you are doing this?

77
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,890
I could not report to His Excellency the Mayor yet.

78
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,880
This bastard is totally out of his mind.

79
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,580
It was an urgent order from His Majesty, so I could not help it.

80
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,350
From His Majesty?

81
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,820
Sister.

82
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,210
How dare you think you can cause a scene here?

83
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,250
The criminal, Jo Young Bae. Obey His Majesty's order.

84
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:05,140
What did you say?

85
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:10,510
It was confirmed you killed your daughter-in-law, Madam Yoo, eight years ago, and

86
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,240
disguised it as suicide to receive the Virtuous Woman's Memorial Gate.

87
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,440
W-Wait, he killed his daughter-in-law?

88
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,800
- Was it not a suicide? 
 - What happened to his daughter-in-law?

89
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,320
I am being framed!

90
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:25,440
You should explain yourself before His Majesty if it is a false accusation.

91
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,000
- Arrest him. 
  - Yes, sir!

92
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,520
- I think they came from Hanseongbu. 
 - There's no way...

93
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,000
- How could this be? 
 - What to do...

94
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:49,530
I told you not to leave the house, but you disobeyed me.

95
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:52,430
Where did you go this late at night?

96
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,410
When I heard you were doing matchmaking with His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae,

97
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:01,260
I deemed you bold, but I did not hate you.

98
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,650
Because I trusted that you would only ever love my son.

99
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,570
But I do not know if I can trust you anymore.

100
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:10,640
Your humble subject did it for the nation.

101
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,270
Attempting to kill the crown prince was for our nation's sake?

102
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:18,140
When Prince Jin Seong was young,

103
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:23,200
you also said he was worthy of becoming a wise king.

104
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,520
Yes, I did.

105
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:31,860
But Prince Jin Seong had a fatal flaw.

106
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,010
His mother's family was interested in gaining power for themselves only!

107
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:42,110
There is only one thing you can do for this nation now.

108
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:48,100
Decide whether you want to be punished for treason for attempting to kill the crown prince or...

109
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,280
you will be punished for killing...

110
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,590
your daughter-in-law eight years ago.

111
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:11,070
What happened to Park Bok Gi?

112
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,080
He chose the crime of murdering Lee Cho Ok without hesitation.

113
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,760
Did you not receive any letter from Yeojudaek?

114
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,050
It would be hard for her to send any for a while, do you not think?

115
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:42,750
Well, do you also happen to know—

116
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:44,120
Yes, I know.

117
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,840
The real Yeojudaek, who makes facial powder, introduced her to me in the first place.

118
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,440
Why did you not tell me all this time?

119
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,150
You never asked me.

120
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:02,880
You can go ahead. I am done with His Excellency.

121
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,540
Please deliver this for me.

122
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:15,420
Here is your long-awaited letter from Yeojudaek.

123
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,420
Look, wait a—

124
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,630
Hold on a moment.

125
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,960
How can I help you?

126
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,080
I heard you are the Left State Minister's servant.

127
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,360
Is his grandson doing okay?

128
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,190
I am your young master's tutor.

129
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:43,090
Oh, you are His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

130
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:48,720
Goodness! He was shocked, but he is doing okay.

131
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,090
Is his mother doing okay as well?

132
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,320

133
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:08,180
Something happened, so she is locked up in the annex.

134
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:22,340

135
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:06,580
 I am writing because you probably are not sleeping well from worrying about me, Your Excellency.

136
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,890
 I am doing well.

137
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,450
 Although things are not looking good for my family,

138
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,510
 Mother is here, so you do not have to worry too much.

139
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,110
Where am I right now?

140
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,000
Have you gained your senses?

141
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,750
Please wait a moment.

142
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,430
If Jo Young Bae confesses his sin as well,

143
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,320
I plan to exile them to Jeju Island and never call them in again.

144
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,420
I am worried that the Dongno Party will appeal for their reinstatement after some time,

145
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:10,270
saying we need people who will work for the nation.

146
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,800
They killed my daughter and even attempted to kill my son as well.

147
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:19,170
They will never be reinstated as long as I am alive— No.

148
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:23,950
Even after I die, I will prohibit their reinstatement in my will.

149
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,470
So do not worry about that.

150
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm the king.

151
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:37,590
Now we just need to wed the crown prince.

152
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:39,640
- Yes. 
  - Your Majesty!

153
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,740
 Chief Royal Secretary is here!

154
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,450
He came a bit early today.

155
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:46,690
He may enter!

156
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,630
You came just in time.

157
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:57,780
We were discussing the punishments for the Left State Minister and Park Bok Gi.

158
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,000
Your Majesty, there is a more urgent matter.

159
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,980
The Eastern Palace's court maid woke up.

160
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,480
- Really? 
 - Yes.

161
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,750
As Prince Gyeongwoonjae surmised,

162
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:15,150
she confessed the Left State Minister gave her the poison and forced her to take it.

163
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:21,400
Therefore, the Left State Minister has to be punished for treason, not murder.

164
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:26,660
Is it not possible the Eastern Palace's court maid is telling a lie?

165
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,480
Huh?

166
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,950
Oh, right!

167
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,000
Since she has been ill for a long time,

168
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,280
is there a possibility she spoke nonsense?

169
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,530
Shaman Do was finally arrested at Mt. Chiri after a secret pursuit and is being transferred to Hanyang now.

170
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,130
So, the Left State Minister's acts of treason will be brought to light.

171
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,240
You went all the way to Mt. Chiri to arrest her?

172
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,390
- Yes. 
 - I see.

173
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:55,000
- I-I commend you. 
 - Thank you so much.

174
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:05,790
The Namjang Party accused Your Highness and Prince Jin Seong of being masterminds of treason.

175
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,450
They asked His Majesty to order deaths by poison!

176
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:10,730
Deaths by poison?

177
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,130
What is this?

178
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:15,960
I must go see Sister right now.

179
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,480
My son will be killed?

180
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,020
That cannot happen. Absolutely not!

181
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,210
What is this?

182
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:40,610

183
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,820
Your Excellency the Mayor, will this not become a massacre?

184
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,130
My, my. His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae is also in Dongno Party. Will they go that far?

185
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:07,240
His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae is in Dongno Party, but only in name.

186
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,380
This is from the Left State Minister's wife.

187
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,070
She said there is a meeting at the Left State Minister's house today.

188
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,740
What meeting when the Left State Minister is locked up?

189
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,210
Could it be that the Left State Minister's wife has a solution?

190
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,810
Even so, going to the Left State Minister's residence at a time like this is...

191
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:42,600
I am not going!

192
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,940
Are you going to go, Your Excellency the Mayor?

193
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,940
If no one is going to go,

194
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,600
I will also do the same as all of you.

195
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,160
Of course.

196
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,200
 - We should be cautious. 
 - This is right.

197
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,060
Seriously. You all said you wouldn't go.

198
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,140
I came because I did not have any solution.

199
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,030
Are you not all thinking the same thing?

200
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,390
His Excellency the Mayor should sit at the head. Right?

201
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:30,750
Is the seat placement even important right now?

202
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,960
I can move after the Left State Minister's wife comes in.

203
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:54,510
Are you still doing this work here?

204
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:57,650
Stop catering to those in power and work for the country.

205
00:20:57,650 --> 00:21:01,430
This is a warning, not advice.

206
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,500
Have you arrived?

207
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,380
Everyone is waiting.

208
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,670
Please come inside.

209
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:15,320
Thank you for attending this meeting at a chaotic time without anyone missing.

210
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:21,250
Left State Minister and His Excellency Park are suffering due to political framing,

211
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:27,790
but His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae here will clear up the misunderstanding.

212
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:36,600
So, I prepared this assembly to request you all not to be hasty and wait patiently.

213
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,840
My Lady,

214
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,950
what are you going to do if Mother finds out?

215
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,180
Would that even matter when my family is about to go down?

216
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,000
I am sorry, My Lady.

217
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:18,910
What are you apologizing for, Sister?

218
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,740
Well...

219
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:28,860
did Father really do that to...

220
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:33,990
Eldest Sister-in-Law? The Namjang Party just made it up. Right?

221
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,660
I mean, how would you know since it was before you married into our family?

222
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:59,550
Madam is looking for you.

223
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,630
I understand.

224
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,870
What are you trying to do right now?

225
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,600
I am trying to help His Majesty.

226
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:21,450
Saving your family is helping His Majesty?

227
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,050
Yes.

228
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,360
Only I can do it.

229
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,730
His Majesty must be trying to punish the Left State Minister and my brother for murder rather than treason.

230
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:37,990
It may be that they want to eliminate external enemies but save Prince Jin Seong.

231
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,800
I can make that happen.

232
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,340
How will you do that?

233
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:48,370
Instead of asking how,

234
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:51,580
you should ask me what I want.

235
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,870
That is how a deal is established.

236
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:56,030
What if I refuse?

237
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,270
You probably cannot do that.

238
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:06,130
If my family is to be extinct for treason,

239
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:10,600
my daughter-in-law will not be safe, either.

240
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,720
Will you be okay with that?

241
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:22,830
You have feelings for my daughter-in-law, do you not?

242
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:30,610
Even though you were only allowed in the annex,

243
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:33,740
I am sure you are aware of our family's peril.

244
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:38,090
I will take care of this crisis within a few days.

245
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,670
So you take care of Ye Jin and Geun Seok so they are not traumatized.

246
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:45,100
Are you...

247
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,010
all right, Mother?

248
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:52,660
It is shameless of me, but I am worried about you, Mother.

249
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:03,820
No matter how big a crisis comes your way, a family will not go down as long as

250
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:07,150
its women are standing strong.

251
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:14,070
Since the Defense Minister's family still knows you as a matchmaker,

252
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,040
go to them tomorrow and make sure Ye Jin's marriage is not called off.

253
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,410
If the Defense Minister's family

254
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:24,950
hastily decides to break off the marriage even before I take care of this matter,

255
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:30,050
things will not look good when they will be married anyway.

256
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,060
I understand, Mother.

257
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,350

258
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:46,000
Waiting two or three days more is not a problem.

259
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,850
But what do you think?

260
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:50,670
I believe she made the offer because she has a solution.

261
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:56,400
I think you can decide after seeing the Left State Minister's wife's solution.

262
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,940
However, she said there is something she wants for resolving this matter.

263
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:09,130
What I want is to have Master Maeng's family's weddings with my daughter's at my house.

264
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:16,210
She wants her daughter's wedding to be held with the old maidens' weddings?

265
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:21,420
I have no idea what she is thinking.

266
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:24,160
I will look into it further.

267
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,500
Will Prince Jin Seong really be ordered to die by poison?

268
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,940
Nothing has been decided yet.

269
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,050
Prince Jin Seong will never hurt me.

270
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:44,030
Since you are good at anything, please protect Prince Jin Seong.

271
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,040
I am probably the one who wants to protect him the most.

272
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:10,160
 I look at the night sky whenever I miss Your Excellency.

273
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,600
 Do you remember the sky lanterns at Temple Seonhwa?

274
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,920
 You asked me what I wished for. Right?

275
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,810
 What wish did you make?

276
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:37,000
 I wished to successfully finish matchmaking with you.

277
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:42,260
 Did you not say a wish does not come true once it is spoken?

278
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:45,180
 Why are you telling me your wish now?

279
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,530
 What was interesting is I clearly messed up one sky lantern,

280
00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,500
 but there were two sky lanterns floating in the sky on the way back.

281
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,290
 There is nothing weird about it.

282
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,760
 I was the one who set it afloat later.

283
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,600
 If there is anything that is interesting,

284
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,810
 it is that I wished for the same thing as you.

285
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,600
 Therefore, when I talk about old times on a much later day,

286
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,590
 I think I will remember that we set the sky lanterns together.

287
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:21,710
 I think I will be reminded of you when I see the night sky now.

288
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:34,710
 Your wish will surely come true.

289
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:39,290
 Because the wish I made that day...

290
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,110
 will not be delivered to you.

291
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,930
The Officer is inside. Right?

292
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,550
Why does everyone ask me when they will not wait to hear my reply?

293
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,950
I wanted to see you...

294
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:38,940
because there is something I must tell you.

295
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,050
I also have something to tell you.

296
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,080
Can I tell you first?

297
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,110
Oh, okay. You can go ahead.

298
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:51,560
Which one is better, Seol Hwa or Baek Myo?

299
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,310
Sorry?

300
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:56,510
It is for my new pen name.

301
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,560
Were you not going to quit writing novels?

302
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,330
One does not write novels because they want to.

303
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,140
They write because they cannot stop writing.

304
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:13,200
So, I am going to continue writing novels even after we marry.

305
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,350
That is all there is to it.

306
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,140
It looks like you have not heard the news yet.

307
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,440
I do not think I can marry you because of my family problem.

308
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,900
Because your in-laws were accused of treason?

309
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,600
You already knew?

310
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,060
That matter is not a problem for our marriage.

311
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:41,100
Why is it not a problem? I might lose my position.

312
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,340
I can just make a living for both of us, then.

313
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:58,370
So you just need to decide whether my pen name should be Seol Hwa or Baek Myo.

314
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,950
Do not even think about not marrying me.

315
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:10,370
If you want to give me a hug, you can go ahead.

316
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:40,710
What brought you here?

317
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,720
Elder said he needed to send something to the Left State Minister's wife.

318
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,730
Exactly.

319
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:53,380
Why did you come instead of a servant from my mother's family?

320
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,820
Did you come to see how my family will go down?

321
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:09,480
Are you happy now that things turned out like this?

322
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,900
Why are you saying things you do not mean?

323
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,280
I am just...

324
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:27,660
Orabeoni...

325
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,780
I am so scared.

326
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:17,140
The mayor visited me early in the morning.

327
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:21,440
Holding a meeting for the Dongno Party was a good idea.

328
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,090
Right.

329
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,830
I heard Prince Gyeongwoonjae say he would resolve the matter himself.

330
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,070
Did you promise to give him money or something?

331
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:42,700
Before that, there is something I must ask you.

332
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,390
Did you really kill our eldest daughter-in-law?

333
00:35:56,290 --> 00:36:01,640
She lost her mind and said she would tell her side of the family everything.

334
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,720
So I could not help it.

335
00:36:05,910 --> 00:36:08,880
She saw her father-in-law kill her husband.

336
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,820
It would be weird if she stayed sane.

337
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:22,320
You indeed kill my son.

338
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,510
I had a reason I could not tell you.

339
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:31,580
On top of falling in love with a man, our enemy's son, back then,

340
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,920
In Hyeon tried to let the Royal Court know about our plan!

341
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,940
Min Seo Joon, that enemy's son you mentioned, is alive. Is he not?

342
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:47,420
I made you into the Left State Minister when you were nothing, and you dare...

343
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,220
You dare kill my son?

344
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,970
Wife...

345
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:56,850
how dare you speak so vulgarly to your husband!

346
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:05,480
I will come back tomorrow evening...

347
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,070
to tell you how this matter will be resolved.

348
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,940
Wait a moment, Wife!

349
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,030
 Wife!

350
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,530
It is not like the Royal Court confirmed it to be treason.

351
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:27,340
Would it not be uncomfortable with the Left State Minister's family if they were found innocent?

352
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:30,000
I am also wary of that,

353
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,660
but even if they are innocent of treason,

354
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:35,610
they said he killed his eldest daughter-in-law!

355
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:38,690
I was already worried because I heard

356
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,840
their second daughter-in-law was not in her right mind.

357
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:49,020
I am close to their young madam,

358
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,610
but rumors about her insanity are false.

359
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:53,300
Putting everything aside,

360
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:58,820
Young Master Shi Yeol and Young Lady Ye Jin are a good couple.

361
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,460
It is not like I do not like their daughter, either.

362
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,490
It looks like Shi Yeol likes her as well.

363
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:09,330
I should not have let them meet in advance!

364
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:11,340
My gosh!

365
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,340
I understand.

366
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,420
Though I do not think the situation will change.

367
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,500
Goodness.

368
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,450
Goodness!

369
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,750
I do not give him a chance to ask, so I do not need to answer.

370
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,800
This is way more convenient.

371
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,490
Madam!

372
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,090
How can you go around dressed like this at a time like now?

373
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,940
What if your mother-in-law finds out?

374
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:56,360
Mother permitted me to leave for my sister-in-law's marriage.

375
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,460
Do not worry.

376
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,940
Since I got to leave, I wanted to meet you.

377
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,390
What do you think about staying with your family even now?

378
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:07,930
- I will let Officer know— 
 - That is nonsense.

379
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,600
A person cannot be so shameless.

380
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:15,200
How can I leave Geun Seok and Ye Jin and escape to my family when there is a crisis in my house?

381
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:21,600
I am extremely worried about you.

382
00:39:25,090 --> 00:39:27,930
This is why I wanted to meet you.

383
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,490
Mother said she would take care of the family matter, so do not worry too much.

384
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:36,330
You also know Mother is capable of taking care of it. Right?

385
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:41,130
  You have feelings for my daughter-in-law, do you not?

386
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,600
 I will take this as a yes to my offer.

387
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:53,110
 I do not want any more damage done to my family's name.

388
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:57,310
 Therefore, stop meeting my daughter-in-law.

389
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,740
 If you keep meeting her,

390
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:04,800
 I will have to take the matter into my own hands for my family.

391
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,930
Do not trust your mother-in-law too much.

392
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,540
Pardon?

393
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:17,160
The only person I can trust right now is Mother.

394
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,020
If you are so worried about me,

395
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:25,540
just reply to my letters as quickly as possible.

396
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:28,030
So I do not die of frustration.

397
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,910
There should be a yellow pill in the men's quarter.

398
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,350
Find it and bring it to me.

399
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:46,930
It is an important item,

400
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:51,450
so do it yourself instead of making a servant do it.

401
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,110
Yes, Mother.

402
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:01,160
For tonight's dinner, prepare enough for your uncle as well.

403
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,420
For Uncle,

404
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:08,680
prepare good food in generous amounts.

405
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:12,040
Also, prepare a bottle of ginger wine.

406
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:36,600
That is all.

407
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,870
You can leave now.

408
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,220
Yes, Mother.

409
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,050
Whoa, Sister!

410
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,890
How are you doing?

411
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:36,030
It is unspeakably uncomfortable.

412
00:42:37,270 --> 00:42:42,170
Anyhow, I heard Gyeongwoonjae will take care of it, huh?

413
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:47,370
It is because of the drawing I brought. Right?

414
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,510
I have done a big job this time.

415
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,070
But even Gyeongwoonjae will not be able to make it...

416
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:09,900
as though it never happened. Right?

417
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:19,120
In that case, I am fine with going on an exile for a few months at a remote place.

418
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,170
I think I would prefer Jinju, if possible.

419
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:27,390
They say the courtesans there are so beautiful.

420
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,940
Goodness.

421
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:50,340
As expected, you are the only one who really cares for me.

422
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:56,730
By tomorrow, you will get to leave this place.

423
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,330
So have a good sleep tonight.

424
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,680
So soon, huh?

425
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,710
Sister.

426
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:15,970
Thank you.

427
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,410
I do not think I can do it.

428
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,400
Brace your heart with strength.

429
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:52,800
This is the only way to save Prince Jin Seong and our family.

430
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:15,310
Please excuse us for a moment.

431
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:16,920
Yes.

432
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,210
Your Highness, I am overwhelmed with shame.

433
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:39,030
All right. What is the way to resolve our family situation?

434
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:46,570
I believe people speak only the truth in the face of death.

435
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:48,240
Therefore,

436
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:54,060
you will prove your innocence by taking your own life.

437
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:01,810
Then, His Majesty and other people will think you were politically framed for a false crime.

438
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,920
I-If...

439
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:10,910
If it means our family will live, taking my own life is not even an issue.

440
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,710
But our young Geun Seok is the only male in our family. How can I irresponsibly leave this world?

441
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:20,730
I need to stay alive as the center of our family to revive our family in the future.

442
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:26,710
If I continue to deny treason, His Majesty will be unable to do anything.

443
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,640
You disappoint me to the end.

444
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,420
Alas. How dare you speak to your husband that way?

445
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,720
It was indeed a good idea to prepare your will in advance.

446
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,570
What?

447
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:44,760
 I seek to prove my innocence with my death.

448
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:48,790
 Eight years ago, my son, Jo In Hyeon,

449
00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:52,980
 harbored a wrongful loyalty toward Prince Jin Seong, then the crown prince.

450
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:57,610
 As such, he obtained geumjam poison to get rid of Grand Prince Woon Hae.

451
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:02,340
 After realizing such a fact, I was determined to stop my son's capital crime.

452
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:07,150
 So I killed my precious oldest son, even casting away my humanity.

453
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:10,730
 I stayed loyal to the king by killing my own child.

454
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,940
 But I became a traitor based on unconfirmed testimonies.

455
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:19,770
 Thus, I am proving my innocence with death to relieve my sorrow and resentment.

456
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,680
The Left State Minister took his own life.

457
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:31,230
What is the cause of death for Park Bok Gi?

458
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:35,090
His corpse was examined, but there was no sign of murder.

459
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:41,180
 He is expected to have died a sudden death due to immense emotional stress.

460
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:46,810
The suspect in the murder of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor eight years ago

461
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:52,050
also died suddenly like this before he was transferred to Hanyang.

462
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,580
He had it coming.

463
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:01,050
As it is believed a person tells the truth in the face of death,

464
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:07,000
Jo Young Bae is innocent of all of his allegations as he claimed innocence with his death.

465
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:11,170
Since Park Bok Gi confessed to murdering Lee Cho Ok,

466
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,530
he shall be recorded as a murderer in his testimony.

467
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:23,370
You should have acquitted the Left State Minister of treason, just like Park Bok Gi.

468
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:26,250
Why did you also acquit him of murder?

469
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,670
It is because of his deceased eldest son.

470
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:34,360
Before he became Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor eight years ago,

471
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,740
Jo In Hyeon had come to me first.

472
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:43,330
He said he would thoroughly investigate the corruption in Pyeongyangbu regardless of his family ties.

473
00:49:43,970 --> 00:49:46,730
I was also doubtful at first,

474
00:49:46,730 --> 00:49:52,320
but he reported the circumstantial evidence of his uncle's corruption as promised.

475
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:57,000
After telling me in his last letter that he would be able to secure physical proof,

476
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,370
he passed away suddenly.

477
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:03,750
So, my heart was very heavy.

478
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:13,340
The sentence for the Left State Minister was my reply to his son's loyalty.

479
00:50:14,040 --> 00:50:17,660
Left State Minister's family was saved

480
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,580
by their dead son, not his mother.

481
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,150
What brings you here all of a sudden and making a fuss?

482
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,670
If you have something to say, come sit.

483
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:53,930
Are you the one who did all that, Mother?

484
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,690
What do you mean?

485
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:02,930
If you are talking about having resolved our family crisis,

486
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:06,050
I am the one who did them.

487
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:11,880
You helped as well, did you not?

488
00:51:15,510 --> 00:51:18,320
Did you find what I told you to find?

489
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:44,860
That is all.

490
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:47,030
You can leave now.

491
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:53,680
I always respected you, Mother.

492
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,670
Because you seemed to know the answer to everything.

493
00:51:56,670 --> 00:51:59,400
However, going so far as to kill your family...

494
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:02,890
I do not think this is right.

495
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,850
You do not think this is right?

496
00:52:06,850 --> 00:52:12,600
So are you saying it was right to be sentenced for treason, having His Excellency and Uncle be beheaded,

497
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,070
having Prince Jin Seong and Royal Consort Sookbin ordered to die by poison,

498
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,290
having Geun Seok and Ye Jin become slaves,

499
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:21,400
and just watch the entire household fall apart?

500
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,990
What would you have done in this situation?

501
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:34,030
You probably would have made the same choice as me.

502
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,810
I will prepare the funerals on my own.

503
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:42,060
So you just take care of Ye Jin's wedding.

504
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,970
When Father has passed away,

505
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,770
how can we hold Ye Jin's wedding?

506
00:52:48,770 --> 00:52:51,600
Did I not say I will take care of it?

507
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,560
You only need to do as I say.

508
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:05,920

509
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,080
The royal selection for the crown princess candidate will be announced soon.

510
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,530
Make sure to submit Lady Ha Na's information for the royal selection.

511
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,020
So this is how it is in the end.

512
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:18,730
I understand.

513
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,180
Did you already know that the crown prince was Lady Ha Na's fated one?

514
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:29,490
Ten years ago, while watching the Royal Family's procession,

515
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:34,440
I saw my eldest and the crown prince connected with a string.

516
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,130
Did you not marry her because you did not want to send her to the palace?

517
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,510
That is one of the reasons.

518
00:53:43,510 --> 00:53:46,610
Because the current crown prince would have been as good as dead

519
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:50,160
if the powerful Prince Jin Seong took the throne.

520
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:54,250
Prince Jin Seong will never be able to become the king now.

521
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:58,840
Because Lady Ha Na saved the crown prince's life twice.

522
00:54:06,430 --> 00:54:11,800
Does Ssangyeonsulsa also recognize their own fated ones?

523
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,390
Of course.

524
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:23,200
But your case would be vague since you recognize nuptial fates by the beating of your heart.

525
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,940
What do you mean?

526
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:29,340
Because one's heart races when he is in fear,

527
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,730
when he sees a beautiful person,

528
00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,140
and even when he hears the beating of the drums.

529
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,460
I am saying it will be unclear

530
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,550
whether your heart is beating because she is your fated one or because of your emotions.

531
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,300
Yes, I see what you mean.

532
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:53,620
I heard some Ssangyeonsulsa are better than others.

533
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:57,980
It looks like you are one of the lacking ones.

534
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:03,490
That is the first time I have heard that I lack in something.

535
00:55:04,290 --> 00:55:09,620
What is certain is that Yeojudeak is not your fated one.

536
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,960
Because I saw Yeojudaek's nuptial fate.

537
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:21,730
Did you also know Yeojudaek was a member of the Left State Minister's family?

538
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:30,490
I told you to forget her because I was worried about Yeojudaek.

539
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:36,710
When a relationship is exposed, it is always the women who get humiliated and punished.

540
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:47,660
Jo Young Bae's wife sent an appeal letter.

541
00:55:47,660 --> 00:55:51,270
I think you need to look at that first.

542
00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:04,840
 In my husband's will, he wanted the funeral to be as brief and simple as possible.

543
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:10,460
 He requested his daughter's wedding not to be delayed because of his death.

544
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:17,000
 Also, the Left State Minister cared an awful lot about old bachelors and maidens when he was alive.

545
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:20,700
 So he told the less fortunate Master Maeng's daughters to

546
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,910
 have their weddings with my daughter's.

547
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:29,770
 Therefore, please allow his funeral to be carried out promptly.

548
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:38,250
It is my turn to fulfill my part of the deal.

549
00:56:41,710 --> 00:56:45,360
It is proper to hold the funeral next month,

550
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:48,110
but for the Left State Minister's case,

551
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:52,810
he let his healthy son pass on before him out of loyalty,

552
00:56:52,810 --> 00:56:56,950
and even lost another child in vain to an illness.

553
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:02,910
So, I cannot refuse the father's feelings for his only daughter.

554
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:10,290
Therefore, I allow the funeral to be held before the set wedding.

555
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:22,320
 Additionally, 10 pils of cotton are to be given to the Left State Minister's family

556
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,400
 and the Defense Minister's family, each as a wedding gift.

557
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:32,830
I was going to break off the marriage subtly

558
00:57:32,830 --> 00:57:36,540
by talking about the funeral,

559
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:42,380
but even His Majesty knows now.

560
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:45,680
So it is over for good now.

561
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,960
Goodness.

562
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,420
I assume she thought she could show her family was still strong by having

563
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,520
the old maidens' weddings, supported by the government, along with her daughter's wedding.

564
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,870
Seeing how meticulous she is with her work,

565
00:58:00,870 --> 00:58:05,230
I am glad the Left State Minister's wife is not a man.

566
00:58:05,230 --> 00:58:06,890
Your Majesty.

567
00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:13,010
Even if the old maidens' weddings end in success,

568
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:17,840
please do not allow my appeal letter for my marriage annulment.

569
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,070
What are you saying?

570
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:24,410
Why the sudden change of heart?

571
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:30,170
I appealed for the marriage annulment because of Princess' will.

572
00:58:43,890 --> 00:58:46,250
 Please take office...

573
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:49,590
 and help Father.

574
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:07,050
Princess said such a thing, huh?

575
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,120
Kneel down and hunch over.

576
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:28,030
- Why? 
 - Why else?

577
00:59:28,030 --> 00:59:31,190
I need to step over something to get over the fence.

578
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,010
If you step on me, Your Excellency,

579
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,760
my back will be in shambles.

580
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,970
It has not even been half a year since I got married!

581
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:41,340
Is being married some kind of a title? Talking about it every chance you get.

582
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:46,540
You can just step on this and go over since you are already tall.

583
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:52,250
Or should I just go over and tell her?

584
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,410
Forget it! Why would you go over?

585
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,350
I will go over, so stand there and look out.

586
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,150
Okay.

587
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:23,590
I will go first—

588
01:00:23,590 --> 01:00:26,200
Please stay there for a moment.

589
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,820
Trust me, and come down.

590
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,930
The virtues of Confucius' teachings are alive and well.

591
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:42,220
How did you even fathom sneaking into an annex where a widow lives?

592
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:44,740
What if someone sees you?

593
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:51,190
Did you miss me that much?

594
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,150
I was on my way to see you as well.

595
01:01:56,150 --> 01:01:58,840
Look how we are connected.

596
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,790
Madam.

597
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,730
You are okay. Right?

598
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:15,150
Now that I see you, I am okay now.

599
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:31,330
The reason I climbed the wall is not because I missed you.

600
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:38,260
I came to tell you not to send me any more letters.

601
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,650
Is it because you are worried about me?

602
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:45,490
- I— 
 - No.

603
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:49,920
As you said before,

604
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:54,620
my feelings have calmed down.

605
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:03,290
I do not love you anymore, Madam.

606
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:28,460
♫  The moment you faced me like the bright sunlight  ♫

607
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:31,320

608
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:36,810
♫  You came down into me, blindingly  ♫

609
01:03:36,810 --> 01:03:42,780
♫  Among fates as countless as the stars  ♫

610
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:47,040
♫  I met you like a miracle  ♫

611
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:49,370
 Mind your behavior from now on.

612
01:03:49,370 --> 01:03:51,790
  Being unable to be with the one they love.

613
01:03:51,790 --> 01:03:55,600
  It seems to me... Prince Consort is someone the crown prince really needs.

614
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,270
  I realized I cannot be the person you want me to be.

615
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:03,660
  Therefore, I plan to find my own method from now on.

616
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:10,840
  I like... you... more... and more, Your Excellency.

617
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:16,120
♫  Even if I avoid...  ♫

618
01:04:17,110 --> 01:04:25,400

619
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:29,120
