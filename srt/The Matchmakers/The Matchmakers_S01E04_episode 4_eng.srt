1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:14,550

2
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,320

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,390

4
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,860

5
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,110

Right now?

6
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,840

I feel even sorrier for His Excellency now that I am married.

7
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,010
To age into an old man without knowing what it is like to be in a happy marriage.

8
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:17,020
More than His Excellency taking office, I hope he weds after succeeding in this matchmaking.

9
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,100
That way, he will learn how cruel it is to

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,220
make me work overtime on my first Buddha's Birthday as a newlywed.

11
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,960
Please delete what I just said.

12
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,920
Should I start now?

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,060

If I think about my younger madam, I'm always so nervous.

14
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,930
She is clueless as to how scary her mother-in-law is

15
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,980
and just wanders around outside.

16
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,740
Huh?

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,490
Did you not hear the rumor?

18
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,180
That she killed her oldest daughter-in-law and received the Virtuous Woman's Memorial Gate.

19
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,600
Gosh, so scary.

20
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,880
Well, don't go around and say you heard this from me.

21
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,670
All right, here.

22
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,610
How is this a lotus flower?

23
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,110
What?

24
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,700
This won't do.

25
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,730
Let's go buy one at the street market tomorrow.

26
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,730
Must be nice.

27
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,700
Is it that bad?

28
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,800
Young Madam has a heart of gold.

29
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,970

30
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:47,550
You need three head coverings?

31
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:53,770
Except for this one, I need flower embroidery on the other two.

32
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:57,640
Please request them to the skilled seamstress from last time.

33
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,360
Mine, yours...

34
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,490
Who is the remaining one for?

35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,390
These are not for us but for prospective brides.

36
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,560
You have plenty of head coverings.

37
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,020
I don't have ones to actually wear.

38
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,630
Make me a new head covering for me, too!

39
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,360
Excuse me. Are you in a rush?

40
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,330
Actually, the seamstress is a noblewoman who lives in Namsan Village.

41
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:27,080
Looks like she'll be wearing the covering she makes.

42
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,560
I do not know if I can ask her because their house is a mess right now.

43
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,240
A mess?

44
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:39,400
The madam of that family has gone senile and refuses to marry off her daughters.

45
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,600
- The government office has arrested her. 
 - What?

46
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,650
Sister, you cannot.

47
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,250
It is time to make dinner.

48
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,950
My goodness...

49
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,800
Can you tell me in detail?

50
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,880
How could my mother be a criminal?

51
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,480
What is the crime?

52
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,090
According to the law, if the reason a woman cannot wed before the age of 24

53
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,380
is not due to impoverishment, then the responsibility is on the parents.

54
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:13,380
Therefore, though, as a mistress, someone wants to take you as his bride.

55
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,200
But for a parent to refuse is a felony.

56
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,730
Therefore, with the power bestowed as Mayor,

57
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:23,550
I order 30 beatings to Madam Jo, the wife of Maeng Sang Cheon.

58
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:33,590
Mayor sir, my mother is gravely ill.

59
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,970
I am currently looking for a match, so please withdraw the punishment.

60
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,920
Did you not say this during the widespread marriage season for older people three years ago?

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,690
From what I hear, the problem is in your mother's wrong mindset.

62
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,900
I cannot let this go easily.

63
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,890
However, if Madam Jo decides to approve her daughter to wed,

64
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,070
then I will overwrite this.

65
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,440
Even if my daughter wishes to,

66
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,420
I can never allow it.

67
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,640
Mother...

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,800
Maeng Ha Na's mother has been taken to Hanseongbu.

69
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,630
Since she is a filial daughter, she probably will not merely watch her mother suffer.

70
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,170
I never thought I would gain something I wanted, thanks to Gyeongwoonjae.

71
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,670

72
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:37,040
Let us do that!

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,200
Gosh, the Left State Minister was so furious.

74
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,920
The Left State Minister orders me around when I am not even his subordinate.

75
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,570
He does as my older sister orders anyway.

76
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,380
Here, please take a glass from me and rest easy.

77
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,740
If Prince Jin Seong takes the throne,

78
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,200
wouldn't the Defense Minister become the king's uncle, not the Left State Minister?

79
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,830
Yes, that is right.

80
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,600
 That is right.

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,830
 Gosh, that is right!

82
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,750
You people!

83
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,100
How could you...

84
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,760
say all the right things?

85
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,520
 That is right!

86
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,840
 Raise your glasses!

87
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:41,160
So, what happened with Gyeongwoonjae setting up the old maidens?

88
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:44,190
I am not quite sure.

89
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,800
In any case, while they are at it, I hope they marry off the eldest daughter, at least.

90
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,140
Since she is already 24.

91
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,350
What is wrong with 24?

92
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:56,820
If a woman cannot wed before the age of 24,

93
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,280
unless it's due to poverty, it is the responsibility of the parents and Hangseongbu.

94
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,580
It may trouble me as well.

95
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:10,010
I shall be able to solve your worries, Mayor.

96
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:15,150
I will bring Master Maeng's eldest daughter as my mistress.

97
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,530
Mistress? A woman who is so lewd?

98
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,540
I made false rumors that she was possessed by a virgin spirit.

99
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:29,560
I wanted to fix her attitude since she was acting so arrogant as a spinster.

100
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,700
O-Oh, I see.

101
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,320
There were great intentions.

102
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,810
Of course.

103
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,040
Is it not the spirit of a real man to desire women?

104
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,180
You have to come out right away.

105
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,360
Madam, I am Yeojudaek.

106
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,460
I will definitely resolve this with Lady Ha Na before noon.

107
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,900
So please buy some time before the punishment.

108
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:01,260

109
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,970
O-orabeoni!

110
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,560
Why are you here at this hour?

111
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,900
Well, I have to make breakfast, but I have an urgent request.

112
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,060
What is it?

113
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,900
There is a lady who has been treated unjustly.

114
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,730
Could you open the door to Sinmungo? 
  (A drum that was hung on the gate tower outside the palace for special petition)

115
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,360
Why hasn't she returned since leaving at dawn?

116
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,570
Gosh, I don't know about this. I've done what I can.

117
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:48,060
You are not an early riser. What a surprise to see you come out to bid me farewell.

118
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,130
Did the sun rise from the west today?

119
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:54,720
Mother is not home. Of course, I should see you off.

120
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,480
Have a good day.

121
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,920
How about Geun Seok's mother?

122
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,560
I do not think I saw her during breakfast, either.

123
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,350
W-Well... she is not very well...

124
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:18,220
Where did you go this morning?

125
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,580
Did you spend the night outside?

126
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,270
Of course not.

127
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:27,100
I cleaned your sedan seat, Father.

128
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,160
You should have the maids do that.

129
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,410
I wanted to wipe it myself for you, Father.

130
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,720
When Ye Jin's mother is not here, you are the lady of the house.

131
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,930
You should manage the servants and not be negligent in serving guests.

132
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:43,660
Yes, Father.

133
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,570
Mother, please eat.

134
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:14,260
You must eat well at times like this.

135
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,860
All right.

136
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,260
Gosh! What kind of crappy law is this?

137
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,230
Yeojudaek and Sister said they would resolve this. Where are they?

138
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,930
It is now time for the punishment.

139
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:32,460
I have not eaten yet, so wait.

140
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,070
What?

141
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:44,310
Why is it taking so long for her to eat?

142
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,360
Sit over here.

143
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,120
What are you doing? Hurry up!

144
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,530
Well, have you changed your mind overnight?

145
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,330
Even if I am beaten to death, I will never change my mind.

146
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,020
P-Punish her!

147
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,390
 Yes, sir!

148
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,990
- Gosh... 
 - Mother!

149
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:37,710
 The Defense Minister of a nation

150
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:40,550
 has not looked after the people starving due to drought

151
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,210
 but is stealing wealth using usury

152
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:47,570
 and taking young daughters of the people in exchange for interest.

153
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:51,370
 The Defense Minister's lechery does not stop here.

154
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,800
 He is forcing me to become his mistress using the law as an excuse.

155
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:59,760
 As the eldest daughter, I am only trying to take care of my blind, widowed mother.

156
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,090
 How could this be my mother's crime?

157
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:05,210
 Gosh, what is going on?

158
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,480
 She made a complaint against the Defense Minister's usury practice.

159
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,180
 My goodness, she is a brave woman.

160
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,350
 What in the world!

161
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,230
 What is she doing?

162
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,580
Stop the punishment!

163
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,160
The injustice of Madam Jo has been reported to Sinmungo.

164
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,360
His Majesty ordered the Royal Investigation Bureau to hold the punishment until the investigation was over.

165
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,850
H-His Majesty's order?

166
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,060
There will not be any legal problems. Right?

167
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,250
What if I get in trouble while trying to help the Defense Minister?

168
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:44,880
- Release her immediately. 
 - Yes, sir.

169
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,370
- Mother, are you okay? 
 - Yes.

170
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,530
What a relief.

171
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,090
That damn bitch...

172
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:05,120
How dare she ring the Sinmungo!

173
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,090
Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong has sent a letter from Temple Seonhwa.

174
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,120
Sister did?

175
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,870
Does she already know?

176
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,200

177
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:26,900
It has not been long since he's brought in a mistress.

178
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,810
I guess he wanted to take care of it while I was here.

179
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,750
Please do not worry too much.

180
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:41,350
I have sent a letter telling him not to say anything or respond in any way.

181
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,460
So, you will do nothing in this situation?

182
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,230
Sister advised me to stay put.

183
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,540
What does a woman know about politics that you listen to her?

184
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,390
W-Well, Sister said...

185
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,920
 The Defense Minister has not done anything illegal.

186
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,440
It will be difficult to prove his usury practice, which is merely a rumor.

187
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,810
Not doing anything is best in these situations.

188
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:09,150
The atmosphere within and outside the palace is extremely bad.

189
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,260
Unless you give an acceptable explanation, the king will dwell on your usury practice.

190
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,330
Then, is there any solution?

191
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,520
I have taken some actions,

192
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,780
so you go to...

193
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,460
- Gyeongwoonjae now. 
 - Gyeon...

194
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,110
Understood.

195
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,280
Just stand there with a pitiful face.

196
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,070
The Left State Minister said

197
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,570
he would find a government position if I helped him this time,

198
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,750
so please help me.

199
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,110
It is not difficult for you to come up with a justification.

200
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:05,180
If I do not do well as the eldest son, it is over for our family.

201
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,870
Imagine how much our deceased father would resent you.

202
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,840
How much longer do I have to look after you, Hyungnim?

203
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,510
This will be the last time.

204
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,740
Think about your pregnant sister-in-law, nephew, and niece.

205
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,350
Move it. Hurry up! Hurry!

206
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,880
Gosh, let me off.

207
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:55,460
I received a message from the Left State Minister.

208
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,820
What terrible luck.

209
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,320
So, is there a justification for me to avoid the consequences?

210
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,430
Since this matter is quite serious, you will have to pay a pretty high price.

211
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,940
Are you okay with that?

212
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:15,080
I do not care how much it takes.

213
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,650
Yes.

214
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,920
Just give me the justification.

215
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,450
"Following the drought from last year..."

216
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,660
I do not think I have made a mistake yet...

217
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,090
"Following the drought from last year to this year."

218
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:47,470
You have forgotten "to this year."

219
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,380
How will you recite all this in front of His Majesty if you are like this from the start?

220
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,960
Could you shorten the content?

221
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,370
I cannot shorten it any further.

222
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,610
No matter how good the justification is,

223
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:19,180
how could I, a military officer, possibly memorize all this tonight?

224
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,330
How about this?

225
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,060
What...

226
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:35,130
A former master at Sungkyunkwan,

227
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:38,870
Maeng Sang Cheon's eldest daughter, Maeng Ha Na

228
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,960
ringed the Sinmungo yesterday.

229
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,400
She expressed resentment toward the Defense Minister's treatment.

230
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,610
Do you have anything to say, Defense Minister?

231
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,960
Your Maj...

232
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,000
your humble...

233
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,640
The Defense Minister has suddenly lost his voice due to his cold.

234
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,120
Before entering the Royal Council Hall today, he has written his position on this incident.

235
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,060
I see.

236
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:18,940
Then, read the Defense Minister's letter, Chief Royal Secretary.

237
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:20,610
Yes.

238
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,490
I inform you that the origin of this incident stemmed from my loyalty.

239
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,840
What?

240
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,420
You're saying bringing in a mistress and practicing usury is loyalty?

241
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,580
Keep reading.

242
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,140
Yes...

243
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:54,430
Due to consecutive droughts, the people were unable to repay the grain they had borrowed last year.

244
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,430
They had to borrow grain again, and this is happening repeatedly.

245
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:01,860
Accordingly, from last year to this year,

246
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:08,460
I have provided grain to the starving people at a low fee.

247
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,190
I cannot lend you more grain since you have not paid back

248
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,450
for the grain from last year.

249
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,050
Please give me enough to last until barley harvest season.

250
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:18,530
My family is all about to starve to death.

251
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:21,540
You will be able to borrow some from the Defense Minister.

252
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:24,830
But the interest there is way too high.

253
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,930
Next.

254
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,930
In the process of giving out loans,

255
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:30,430
Kim Tae Jin, a past tenant of my house

256
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:34,490
asked me to take his daughter to be in my family in exchange for canceling his debt.

257
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,400
Saving Kim Tae Jin's family became the start of a misunderstanding.

258
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:45,690
Your daughter is just interest. You still need to pay the principal.

259
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,250
- Father! 
 - No!

260
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,280
This is unjust!

261
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,060
Not my daughter! No!

262
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,540
Not my daughter!

263
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,580
I was unaware of such a story.

264
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,820
Also, bringing in Maeng Ha Na as my mistress is also out of loyalty.

265
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:13,580
Since the previous kings' era, it has been said that when people's resentment reaches Heaven,

266
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:17,700
plagues and natural disasters will spread throughout the country.

267
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,810
I deemed the greatest sorrow among the people was the sorrow of old maidens.

268
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:25,660
Even at the age of 24, because of rumors about her misbehavior,

269
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,130
Maeng Ha Na had no hope of wedding.

270
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:32,520
 With my heart of a saint, I wanted to reduce the resentment

271
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,370
 of the people by taking Maeng Ha Na into my family.

272
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,250
Defense Minister, you care for our nation so greatly.

273
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,720
I misjudged you for a moment.

274
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,040
Because I am moved by the Defense Minister's loyalty,

275
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:48,230
I grant him ten rolls of cotton fabric.

276
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:02,740
I shall read the rest.

277
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,770
The rest? That should be all.

278
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,080
What?

279
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,670
Defense Minister, you are sick.

280
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:17,560
Do not force yourself to speak.

281
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,190
Continue to read.

282
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:24,510
Since the oblivious people of the nation do not understand my deep concern for them,

283
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,490
I shall change the ways I express my loyalty according to their level.

284
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,890
Since Maeng Ha Na is not over the age of 24 according to the law,

285
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,440
 I shall recommend her to wed on her accord before the end of the year.

286
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,410
 For those who borrowed grain from the government last year

287
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,480
 are to pay back only the principal.

288
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,620
And borrowing grains shall not take interest this year.

289
00:22:56,420 --> 00:23:00,770
In regard to the government interest, I shall use my own money!

290
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,510
I shall use my own money to pay for the interest!

291
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,730
The Royal Investigation Bureau shall give administrative support

292
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,570
to ensure that the Defense Minister can do as he says.

293
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,130
Report to me efficiently and continuously regarding the issue.

294
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:21,050
I will proceed immediately.

295
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,540
Immediately!

296
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,200
Goodness...

297
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,600
I worked so hard to build my wealth!

298
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:50,500
Shim Jeong Woo! I will crush you!

299
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:06,260
The first part was enough as a justification.

300
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,060
Why did you offer a resolution we did not ask for?

301
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,800
In order to turn the scandal into a good story,

302
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,690
an unconventional follow-up was necessary.

303
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:20,920
This, again, was approved by the Defense Minister beforehand.

304
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,620
When did I?

305
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:29,010
 Since this matter is quite serious, you will have to pay a pretty high price.

306
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,150
 Are you okay with that?

307
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:36,630
I thought it was the cost of coming up with a justification.

308
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:39,020
Then you should have said it clearly!

309
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,130
How could I have been more clear?

310
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,930
I mean...

311
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,830
He really did not say it clearly.

312
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:54,560
Then, I shall get going.

313
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,550
Did you see Gyeongwoonjae smile just now?

314
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,830
That bastard deliberately did us dirty.

315
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:23,100
You could not memorize that and led us into this situation?

316
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,760
If you could not memorize it, you should have at least read it thoroughly!

317
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,880
It was much too long.

318
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,430
You went through a lot.

319
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:44,870
I heard you told Ha Na to ring the Sinmungo.

320
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:49,570
I am in great debt to you for this matter.

321
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,530
Thank you.

322
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,070
Actually, the Inspector helped more than I did.

323
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:00,740
He went to the palace and made a request to the king himself.

324
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,730
The Bukchon geezer?

325
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:06,960

326
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,670

327
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,130

328
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,090
Gosh, you scared me.

329
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,840
Did you do that, Sir?

330
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,050
W-What are you talking about?

331
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:32,420
Due to the law that says if you cannot wed before the age of 24, the responsibility is on the parents.

332
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,770
You are making Lady Ha Na become the Defense Minister's mistress.

333
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:41,530
In regard to that, is it not good since the eldest daughter will get to marry easily?

334
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:43,210
I had my doubts...

335
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,980
but it was indeed your idea as expected, Sir.

336
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,700
I am extremely disappointed in you, Sir.

337
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,620
You are disappointed in me?

338
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,960
For what?

339
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,110
Since the eldest will be taken care of that way, didn't her marriage issue become much easier?

340
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:59,340
Please do not refer to marriage...

341
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,740
as something to be "Taken care of."

342
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,710
All right.

343
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,340
Since you broke the promise to follow my matchmaking methods first,

344
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,720
our matchmaking contract is not in effect as of now.

345
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,020
W-Well, that was not my fault—

346
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,960
For the next two months, I will strive my best so that none of

347
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,430
Master Maeng's daughters get married.

348
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,570
What do you mean by that?

349
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,730
From now on,

350
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,180
I will make sure you cannot fulfill your royal orders.

351
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,460
There is no way...

352
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:52,370
Meang Ha Na is ringing the Sinmungo or something. Right?

353
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,780
- That cannot be. 
 - That is right.

354
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,020
Maiden Ha Na is ringing the Sinmungo.

355
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,540
Do you really think you can punish the Defense Minister with the Sinmungo?

356
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,960
Yes.

357
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:07,020
The Defense Minister harassed citizens with usury

358
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:10,620
and everyone in the city knows he loves to play around with women.

359
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,410
A month ago, as a payment for interest,

360
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:16,160
he took a 14-year-old girl who is not even at a marriageable age as his mistress.

361
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,030
That is human trafficking.

362
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,670
It makes no sense that we cannot punish someone like him!

363
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:23,120
First, the usury issue is separate from the current matter.

364
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,360
It will be difficult to prove and, thus, difficult to punish.

365
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,420
And a man's affinity toward women does not become a legal problem.

366
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,100
What does become a legal problem is

367
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,510
Madam Jo who is preventing her daughters from marriage.

368
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,690
Since she is ringing the Sinmungo even after committing a crime...

369
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:39,780
the crime of obstruction of official duties will be added.

370
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,560
What kind of nonsensical law is that?

371
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:46,090
As an inspector, I would know a lot more about the law than you do.

372
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,610
True...

373
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:00,080
Oh, no. Maybe I shouldn't have told her to ring the Sinmungo.

374
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:08,780
I shall take care of this for you.

375
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,240
Pardon?

376
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,090
Why?

377
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,200
Contrary to your hasty misunderstanding, I did not do this.

378
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,630
And I am capable of resolving that issue.

379
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:20,120
Hold on...

380
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,090
This was not your doings, Sir?

381
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:28,350
T-Then you should have said so before I started to throw a fit.

382
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:32,200
Did you give me a chance to say anything?

383
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,800
Also, one more thing. I must make this clear.

384
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,280
I am...

385
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:49,160
not the type of a man who will disappoint you.

386
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,100
 I sincerely ask that you take care of this well.

387
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,850
 Do not worry.

388
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:29,630
 Whatever you imagine, I can go above and beyond that.

389
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:52,060
Did you not say people were suffering greatly from the Defense Minister's high-interest loan?

390
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,640
Is there a way...

391
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,600
I can punish the Defense Minister for his usury practice?

392
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,060
However, no one will come forward

393
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,190
to testify about the usury in fear of the Defense Minister's retribution.

394
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,400
Also, since the reason for ringing the Sinmungo was not because of the usury practice,

395
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,830
but to stop her mother's punishment.

396
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,300
Technically, Madam Jo is the one who broke the law.

397
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,160
The case is very complicated.

398
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,300
 Your Majesty! His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae has arrived.

399
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,100
Let him in.

400
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,750
Yes, what is it?

401
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:49,800
Regarding Maeng Sang Cheon's eldest daughter Maeng Ha Na's Sinmungo case,

402
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:53,700
there is a resolution to punish the Defense Minister's usury practice.

403
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,870
Out of the blue?

404
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,340
Go ahead and speak.

405
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:00,080
The Defense Minister will bring the solution himself.

406
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,920
Your Majesty, I ask that you gather the ministers

407
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,200
and make a space to reprimand the Defense Minister.

408
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,100
All right. Will do.

409
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,640
By the way...

410
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,390
is the case of setting up marriages for old maidens going well?

411
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,610
With less than two months left, and you are putting yourself out in these—

412
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:20,830
Hold on a minute. Come over here.

413
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:23,280
You...

414
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:27,490
You won't ask me to forget the old maidens and bachelors case over the Defense Minister's case. Right?

415
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:32,900
Punishing the Defense Minister is a process of encouraging old maidens to wed.

416
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,940
Right, no wonder you came with great urgency.

417
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,730
Since life is very important to everyone.

418
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,510
I did not think the Defense Minister would do such a thing.

419
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,220
But I guess it was all Inspector's idea.

420
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,300
Wow, Inspector is quite cool.

421
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,210
What's so cool?

422
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,560
It doesn't change the fact that

423
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,880
Sister will become the Defense Minister's mistress if she can't wed this year.

424
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,620
Then...

425
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,530
she shall wed.

426
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,400
Within May, all three of you shall wed with those you wish to.

427
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,660
Please trust me.

428
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,900
I am tired. Let us go home.

429
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,410
Yes, Mother.

430
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:28,700
- All right, then. 
 - Yes.

431
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:36,100
Thank you for today.

432
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:40,910
Get home safe.

433
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,210
I heard what happened at Royal Council Hall.

434
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,380
I tried to stay put like you advised, Sister.

435
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,570
But Brother-in-law said I should defend myself.

436
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:13,800
I shouldn't have asked Gyeongwoonjae.

437
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,490
If that's what the Left State Minister did, there must be a reason.

438
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,230
If you think about it, all this happened because of your carelessness.

439
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,680
Sister, if Brother-in-law had not instigated—

440
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,580
What is done is done!

441
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,340
You must make sure not to repeat this in the future.

442
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:41,840
Have you looked into who opened the door for her to Sinmungo?

443
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,350
I-I have not...

444
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:48,230
If Master Maeng's daughter, who has no connection to government office, opened Sinmungo,

445
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:51,270
she would have gotten someone's help!

446
00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:53,380
That is right...

447
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:56,830
I will find out immediately.

448
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:24,540
 You are certain my family will not be harmed. Right?

449
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,890
 They will not be suspicious of you, either.

450
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:32,010
 So, certainly, no harm would be done to your family.

451
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:34,420
 Do not worry.

452
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:42,870
Your Majesty, Shaman Do is requesting your audience.

453
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:49,660
Yes, what is it?

454
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,700
Please dismiss the others.

455
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,350
Wait outside.

456
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,850
The vigor in the palace is very strange.

457
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,080
Just like the day...

458
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:21,110
the princess died eight years ago.

459
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:26,360
If you do not move His Highness the Crown Prince outside the palace,

460
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,050
his life will be in danger.

461
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:47,660
That is a custom order, so it is not for sale.

462
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:51,410
Over there. Pick one from the back.

463
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,770
I am looking for the person who ordered this.

464
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:01,040
Yeojudaek?

465
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,320
This is Yeojudaek.

466
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,470
During the tax-paying season every year,

467
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,880
I make the facial powder and take them to Yeojudaek's house in Hanyang.

468
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:21,290
Yeojudaek...

469
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:26,860
You are going to Hamgyeongdo before Buddha's Birthday?

470
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:32,350
The porters who were moving with us said they would leave early.

471
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,910
Because of the circumstances, I don't think

472
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,870
I can go to your house to receive the marriage date after the Buddha's Birthday.

473
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:41,080
What should I do?

474
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:46,370
I cannot stop you from going away to make a fortune.

475
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,120
I will figure it out on my own.

476
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,090
Are you taking Bok Hee, too?

477
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:53,270
Bok Hee decided to stay at the merchants' inn.

478
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:57,550
Bok Hee, you must be upset that your mom is not here on Buddha's Birthday.

479
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:01,480
It is better they go now if they are going to go anyway.

480
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,210
You have such a trustworthy daughter.

481
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,170
You saved Bok Hee, Madam.

482
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,700

I am very excited to see Mt. Geumgang in person.

483
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,370
Let us go quickly. Quickly.

484
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,620
You might trip. Be careful.

485
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,640
E-Excuse me!

486
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,880
Orabeoni!

487
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,860
Hello? Wake up! Hello?

488
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,890
What are we to do?

489
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,730
That is true. Since you were pregnant with Bok Hee back then.

490
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,850
You heard, right? I am the one who saved you.

491
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,250
You cannot act like you don't know me when you grow rich later.

492
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,640
You know your promise to find me a husband for free comes first. Right, Madam?

493
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,540
Gosh, she sure is smart.

494
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,800
Gosh, she is so cute.

495
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:25,560
Welcome back, Sir.

496
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,590
I am here to see Yeojudaek.

497
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:30,140
- I have heard. 
 - Where did she go...

498
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,230
W-Where—

499
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:44,750
I never knew there was a space like this here.

500
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,820
Yeojudaek said she would be responsible, so I am letting you in.

501
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,420
But you are not working for

502
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:53,720
Hanseongbu or the Royal Investigation Bureau by pretending to set up matches. Right?

503
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,910
I do not like Hanseongbu or the Royal Investigation Bureau, either.

504
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,370
Anyway,

505
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,630
you are saying Yeojudaek is here. Right?

506
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:07,780
Gosh, it smells musky in here.

507
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,070
I wonder if anyone ever cleans this place.

508
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,560
I need to enter through this door. Right?

509
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,770
W-W-What are you doing!

510
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:20,700
I really am not part of Hanseongbu nor the Royal Investigation Bureau!

511
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,530
You wretch! Who do you think I am!

512
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:27,400
Door... Please open the door.

513
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,890
 You really are very fearful.

514
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:38,560
A-Are you there?

515
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,840
Goodness.

516
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,600
Gosh.

517
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,810
Goodness.

518
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,420
Gosh.

519
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,630
You were here.

520
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:26,000
This place is used to transcribe novels.

521
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,970
It has been empty for a while due to strict Hanseongbu crackdowns.

522
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:32,380
So, we should use this place as a matchmaking mission base.

523
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:36,400
Oh, yes, and if there is something you urgently need to say while working,

524
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,960
you can leave a letter to the head merchant at the merchants' inn.

525
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,890
Do not make unscheduled urgent plans.

526
00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:45,870
Yes, yes. But you must be prepared just in case.

527
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,580
Answering once is enough.

528
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,720
Yes.

529
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:52,880
Ta-da!

530
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,280
I have written this to boost our motivation.

531
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,940

532
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:24,700
No wonder it felt a bit empty.

533
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:27,200
I can read, but writing is quite difficult.

534
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,110
If you are not confident in Chinese characters, you should just write in Hangul.

535
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:34,110
If it is all written in Hangul, it does not look as nice.

536
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,980
Making a mistake is worse.

537
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:42,500
Anyway. Like you spoke of... the...

538
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:48,340
Explain the "Matchmaking Mission."

539
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:56,530
I shall inform you of the schedule of the "Matchmaking Mission."

540
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,760
Please take a look at the map.

541
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,740

First, we will find the ladies' their husbands on Buddha's Birthday.

542
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:10,080
Make fate into destiny on May 5th.

543
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:13,080
Receive formal proposals from the grooms' families on May 15th.

544
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,780
A joint wedding will be held on the 25th day of that month.

545
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,670
The overall schedule looks decent.

546
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:22,550
Thank you.

547
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,920
It shall begin on Buddha's Birthday at the Temple Seonhwa.

548
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,660
Temple Seonhwa is where the capital city's old bachelors gather.

549
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:38,200
We will find the ladies' husbands with "first-sight."

550
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,730
 My special move, "first-sight,"

551
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:58,880
 has the great power to offset a person's family background or reputation.

552
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:03,920
It is a perfect plan for the ladies who are haunted by false rumors.

553
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,660
 There is no record of how Ssangyeonsulsa found the matches,

554
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,040
 so there is no way to find out.

555
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,090
 They each have their own skill for finding a match.

556
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,380
 Could she really be Ssangyeonsulsa?

557
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:20,760
So, what we need to do now...

558
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:24,340
is to prepare for first-sight at Temple Seonhwa.

559
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,320
"First-sight" does not refer to

560
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:31,130
literally looking at each other's eyes. Right?

561
00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:32,930
Why would it not be?

562
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,720
It is literally the first moment a man and a woman see eye to eye.

563
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,430
Come on now. How could someone find her forever partner in that way?

564
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:46,650
It would be much more reasonable to find someone by looking at their family background.

565
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:51,930
Do you know how long it takes for a man and a woman to fall in love?

566
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:54,550

That's half of one-hundredth of a corner, almost in an instant.

567
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:57,220
It pretty much happens in an instant.

568
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,400
That fast?

569
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,270
People who have experienced it at least once would know.

570
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:11,140
W-Well, most noblemen cannot experience first-sight.

571
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:14,620
If you are lucky, it happens at the wedding hall, so do not worry.

572
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:19,360
I met my husband through first-sight.

573
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,320
In the bookstore.

574
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,030
- In the bookstore? 
 - Yes.

575
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:28,460
The first moment we met was like a scene from a novel.

576
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:18,340
A man who reaches for a book from the high shelf seems common only in novels.

577
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:23,520
But this unrealistic scenario happened to me that day.

578
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,750
After getting married, my husband said he fell in love with me then, too.

579
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:32,270
How dare you bring your experience as a merchant to the marriage of noblemen?

580
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:34,290
For nobility, marriage is to:

581
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:37,800
firstly, respect the ancestors; and secondly, produce the next generation.

582
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:41,050
You do not always need love.

583
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:45,380
No, love is everywhere and the beginning of everything.

584
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,210
The heart to love your parents and to love your children.

585
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:52,010
It all starts with a couple's love.

586
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,330
Such a sentimental fallacy of a woman.

587
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:58,380
It is true, though.

588
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,620
Let us go teach the ladies the skill of first-sight.

589
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,990
Do you need skills to look someone in the eye?

590
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:08,920
Of course. The marriage is half-way successful if the first-sight goes well.

591
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:14,220
It requires very exquisite and delicate skills.

592
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,850
Let us go.

593
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:45,780
Ladies Ha Na and Du Ri, it will just be a moment.

594
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:49,460
Could you join us in the front yard?

595
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:53,970
I can do it well just by looking from here, so do not worry.

596
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,470
- Mother, should I read the "Book of Han" today? 
 - Sure.

597
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:01,630
Then, how about you, Lady Du Ri?

598
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:04,400
Can't you see I'm backed up with sewing?

599
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,820
Then, we should start with Lady Sam Soon.

600
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,900
Sir, please stand against the wall over there.

601
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:28,230
A little more to the left.

602
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:29,810
To the left.

603
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:32,310
W-Wait, no, to the right.

604
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,250
My gosh, just say it at once.

605
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:38,360
Yes, that is perfect.

606
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,280
I wonder what the fuss is about.

607
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,710
Today, you will learn the skill of first-sight.

608
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:48,980
I shall demonstrate, so please watch carefully.

609
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:53,760
First, you wear the head covering like this.

610
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:35,260
And come back wearing the head covering again.

611
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:39,880
That is it?

612
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:44,700
Yes. It looks very easy to do, but it is actually very detailed and difficult.

613
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:49,310
The key to "first-sight" is when you reach the spot I designate after Topdol, 
  (A Buddhist ritual)

614
00:49:49,310 --> 00:49:52,790
wear the head covering so just a bit of your face shows.

615
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:56,420
You strike a soft smile toward the wall.

616
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,660
Would you like to try?

617
00:49:57,660 --> 00:49:59,530
I think I have gotten the gist.

618
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:03,360
As the author of "The Madam's Private Life," of course, you would be great, Hwa Rok.

619
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,230
- Shall we? 
 - Yes.

620
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,830
Maiden Sam Soon!

621
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:29,860
Why are you frowning? She said to smile!

622
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:32,430
I am smiling right now.

623
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,490
Are you serious?

624
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,790
- This is tragic. 
 - Lady Sam Soon?

625
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,430
You might be awkward since this is your first time.

626
00:50:43,430 --> 00:50:46,520
However, it shall get better with practice.

627
00:51:04,850 --> 00:51:07,250
Let us meet here in two hours.

628
00:51:07,250 --> 00:51:10,690
This is good for me since I will be paid and get to rest.

629
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:13,140
But are you sure you do not need to go to your mother's family?

630
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:15,490
As long as you keep your mouth shut, I'm fine.

631
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:19,850
It's especially a secret from my sister-in-law. Got it?

632
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,370
I've been paid, so of course, I won't tell.

633
00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:42,160
What brings you here?

634
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:44,440
I am here to see you, Orabeoni.

635
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:55,460
Ladies Ha Na and Du Ri, could you both walk while I am here?

636
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:03,710
Maidens, you promised to cooperate.

637
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:10,110
Du Ri, let us get this over with.

638
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,590
Since a promise is a promise.

639
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,390
Mother, please wait for a moment.

640
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:28,560
H-Hey! That's an order, so you can't get it dirty.

641
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,480
Use yours, Sister!

642
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,900
I think the head coverings you are making now are all ours.

643
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,400
This one without a flower embroidery is mine.

644
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:40,090
- Is that not true? 
  - She sure is smart.

645
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,180
That is right.

646
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,760
Really?

647
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,220
- Is this mine? 
 - Yeah...

648
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,140
Wow, it's so pretty.

649
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:19,030
You did so well. As expected.

650
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:24,290
She did not look at the wall or even smile.

651
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:28,840
My youngest sister, the first-sight skill Yeojudaek speaks of

652
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,530
is to take off the head covering and show your braided hair.

653
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:33,780
The goal is to show the men by the wall that

654
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:37,140
I am a virgin and show them my face.

655
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,170
I do not need to smile since I am extremely pretty.

656
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:41,750
That would mean...

657
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:45,380
that I am ugly.

658
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:51,260
But you are cute.

659
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,530
I am only cute in your eyes, Sister.

660
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,970
It is not your fault you are not pretty,

661
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:01,450
so do not be upset about that.

662
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,500
The rumor that the eldest is an idiot

663
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:10,100
must have been a false rumor due to her good looks.

664
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:19,410
Is it okay to be here like this without going to see your mother's family?

665
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:22,870
My grandmother went to Temple Seonhwa, so she's not there.

666
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:26,580
And my grandfather's mind comes and goes.

667
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:28,900
So he wouldn't recognize me even if I went.

668
00:54:31,550 --> 00:54:33,510
Let me see your hand.

669
00:54:33,510 --> 00:54:36,300
- What? 
 - Hurry!

670
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:52,430
What is this?

671
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:54,390
Don't you dare take it off.

672
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:04,700
You're coming to Temple Seonhwa on Buddha's Birthday. Right?

673
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,720
No, I am working at the rice paddy field that day.

674
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:13,710
You're not working until night.

675
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:18,430
Other than that, I have a lot of work to do. So I cannot go.

676
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,070
Then, who will make my lantern this year?

677
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,480
Lady, would you like to try?

678
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:37,930
Do I need to practice to look good to men?

679
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,040
Lady Du Ri, how about thinking of it this way?

680
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:45,350
It is not to look good to men,

681
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:48,210
but it is a skill for choosing the man I want.

682
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:52,230
There is no man I want.

683
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:58,480
If you are this uncooperative, I shall sue your younger sister to Hanseongbu!

684
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,650
Gosh, seriously!

685
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,380
S-Stand in front.

686
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:16,320
I will never smile in front of a man.

687
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,140
Sir, go stand against the wall.

688
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,700
- She will put the needle away first. Right? 
 - Gosh, she will.

689
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,510
Everyone knows it's her style.

690
00:56:52,510 --> 00:56:56,700
I see why there is a false rumor about her frequenting a courtesan house.

691
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,910
It was because of her strange charm.

692
00:56:58,910 --> 00:57:01,090
Lady Du Ri, you have also passed the test.

693
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:02,900
You may continue sewing.

694
00:57:02,900 --> 00:57:05,930
You have to make those head coverings by Buddha's Birthday

695
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:09,020
for all three of you to wear them.

696
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:12,680
All right, then. Lady Sam Soon, shall we try again?

697
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:14,840
I think I have finally gotten the idea.

698
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:17,950
It's all good, but I think it would be nice if you could just

699
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:20,710
smile a little bit like this.

700
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:24,190
W-Well, maybe a bit softer. Loosen your expression.

701
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,470
Why don't you try again?

702
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:37,510
Goodness gracious.

703
00:57:37,510 --> 00:57:40,020
Why is she so late?

704
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:43,120
It is time for Father to return home.

705
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,440
Gosh, Young Madam!

706
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:50,130
Why are you so late?

707
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,550
I am sorry. Work took a lot longer than expected.

708
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:58,150
Ye Jin, did something bad happen to Mother's family?

709
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,090
Did someone say something that wasn't nice to you?

710
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:04,710
Why would I have a bad day? Let us go already.

711
00:58:06,070 --> 00:58:07,750
She catches on quickly.

712
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:09,410
Lower your voice.

713
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:11,470
What is it?

714
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:25,650
Where is everyone roaming around at this late hour?

715
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,670
Father, that is...

716
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:30,600
I asked Sister to go to Mother's family with me.

717
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:35,140
But Grandfather kept repeating himself again and again.

718
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:38,250
So we left Mother's family a little late.

719
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,080
I see.

720
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:45,070
You went through a lot, too, Geun Seok's mom.

721
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,390
Let us go inside.

722
00:58:55,820 --> 00:58:59,310
Lady Ye Jin is getting better at lying just like you, Young Madam.

723
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:04,870
You call this "The pupil has overcome the master."

724
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,960
"The pupil has overcome the master."

725
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,750
So cool.

726
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:34,340

727
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,060
A maid from Eastern Palace 
  (Crown Prince's palace)

728
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:41,040
is on the verge of death after eating the crown prince's leftover food.
(Crown Prince's palace)

729
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,130
Since we do not know the source of the poison,

730
00:59:43,130 --> 00:59:45,180
we cannot leave the crown prince in Eastern Palace.

731
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:46,930
But My Queen,

732
00:59:46,930 --> 00:59:51,350
did you not say you made the food yourself?

733
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,560
That is why I am ever more worried.

734
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,420
My Queen, please calm down for now.

735
00:59:57,420 --> 01:00:01,960
The physician said that we cannot conclude the cause was the poison.

736
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,580
It could be the palace maid's illness at the Eastern Palace.

737
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:08,620
But the palace maid's symptoms are far too similar

738
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:12,370
to the late princess's symptoms.

739
01:00:12,370 --> 01:00:14,180
Eight years ago, Shaman Do said

740
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:18,620
the Princess faced misfortune instead of the crown prince.

741
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:23,870
Like Shaman Do advised, please allow the crown prince to stay at the private residence for a while.

742
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,060
We cannot send the crown prince of this country

743
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:30,370
outside the palace just because of what a shaman said.

744
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:45,160
I said I would not go, but you had to drag me out.

745
01:00:45,160 --> 01:00:48,610
You asked for a new head covering to wear on Buddha's Birthday.

746
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:50,020
Why the sudden change of mind?

747
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:51,490
I don't know...

748
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,390
Everything is boring now.

749
01:00:54,390 --> 01:00:58,960
Aunt, why is the Lotus Lantern Festival held for Buddha's Birthday boring?

750
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,770
You will know when you become my age.

751
01:01:01,770 --> 01:01:04,090
You are not even 20. It is too early to blame your age.

752
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:06,000
Exactly.

753
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,410
Let us go.

754
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:14,340
Are you really not going to see the young master who is to become your husband?

755
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,710
I will see him when I get married anyway.

756
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,380
Nothing will change even if I see him beforehand.

757
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:32,300
Yeojudaek will come to find you. Stop looking around for her.

758
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:36,230
I mean, my looks do stand out.

759
01:01:38,180 --> 01:01:40,430
Do you have chest pain again?

760
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:43,120
I expected this much since there are a lot of people.

761
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,790
I am fine.

762
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:09,200
What is it? Did you find Yeojudaek?

763
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:12,720
No. I must have mistook someone.

764
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,460
There is no way someone in the palace would be out here.

765
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:24,520
Are there any changes at the Eastern Palace?

766
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,270
One of the palace maids of Eastern Palace died suddenly.

767
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:32,940
Since then, on the pretext of cracking down on misbehavior,

768
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:37,320
the palace ladies searched the quarters of my maids.

769
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,830
They must be looking for poison.

770
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:43,510
Poison?

771
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,430
This sounds like trouble.

772
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:49,870
How did you manage this?

773
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:52,650
The crown prince is fine while our cards are all on the table.

774
01:02:52,650 --> 01:02:56,630
Isn't this just narrowing down Royal Consort Sook Bin's range of actions?

775
01:02:56,630 --> 01:03:00,130
The goal is to keep the crown prince unharmed.

776
01:03:00,130 --> 01:03:03,360
What kind of nonsense is that?

777
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,190
 If the crown prince leaves his food unfinished,

778
01:03:17,190 --> 01:03:20,740
 eat the medicine I gave you with his food.

779
01:03:20,740 --> 01:03:23,780
The poison which was difficult to attain.

780
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:27,370
Why did you waste it on a palace maid?

781
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:31,410
In order to bring the crown prince outside the palace.

782
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:35,000
With this, do you think we can bring the crown prince outside the palace?

783
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,020
Do you not think they will try to find where the poison came from and complicate our side?

784
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,410
Please do not worry about that.

785
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:45,440
They were not able to reveal that the geumjam was poison eight years ago.

786
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,690
They will not be able to reveal that it was poison this time, either.

787
01:03:50,930 --> 01:03:57,270
Also, I have recruited a person who will bring the crown prince outside the palace.

788
01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:00,680
Bring her in.

789
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:11,220
Aren't you the shaman of Sungsoocheong? 
  (Institution where shamans resided as to maintain the wellness of the royal family)

790
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:14,870
I thought you were the queen's person.

791
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,290
Not Her Majesty the Queen,

792
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,540
but I follow the future owner of the palace.

793
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:30,150
Right. Has the crown prince left the palace?

794
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:35,060
I have advised the queen to move specifically on the crowded day of Buddha's Birthday.

795
01:04:35,890 --> 01:04:37,610
Tonight...

796
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:40,630
he would have moved to the private residence.

797
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:49,510
It is a secret between you and me that you are staying here.

798
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,150
When you return to the palace, I will personally come and get you.

799
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,120
Keep that in mind.

800
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:58,910
Where is the crown prince staying?

801
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:01,630
The queen was very cautious

802
01:05:01,630 --> 01:05:05,310
and has not told me, either.

803
01:05:05,310 --> 01:05:06,840
If we do not know the whereabouts,

804
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,470
it is the same as if the crown prince was in the Eastern Palace.

805
01:05:09,470 --> 01:05:10,980
You have made things so complicated.

806
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,920
The crown prince shall most likely

807
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,820
reside in the princess's residence or wet-nurse's home.

808
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:19,720
It shall not be difficult to find those places.

809
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:24,110
Also, when we succeed, we shall not be blamed

810
01:05:24,110 --> 01:05:28,350
but rather the queen for secretly sending the crown prince to the private residence.

811
01:05:28,350 --> 01:05:31,150
It is not a bad idea.

812
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:38,820
Why is everyone bringing this up now?

813
01:05:38,820 --> 01:05:42,100
You could have given us a heads-up.

814
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,410
Mistakes cannot be made in oblivion.

815
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:59,590
I should slowly transform into Yeojudaek soon.

816
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,390
 I wonder which family she belongs to.

817
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:17,460
I have never seen her before, either.

818
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:21,480
Gosh, my makeup must be perfect.

819
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,190
Where could be good?

820
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:43,630
Maybe here?

821
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:48,540
I-I-I am v-very sorry.

822
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:56,730
Oh, no...

823
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:14,530
Goodness, why are there so many people this year?

824
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:17,750
I need to meet with His Lordship, but I can't find a place to put my makeup on.

825
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:35,620
Don't get nervous.

826
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:38,340
My brother cannot even recognize me before and after makeup.

827
01:07:38,340 --> 01:07:40,000
Yes...

828
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:51,760
What do I do?

829
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:28,180
You!

830
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:32,730
What is this outfit?

831
01:08:33,820 --> 01:08:35,640
Do you...

832
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,500
recognize me?

833
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:40,460
How could I not?

834
01:08:41,110 --> 01:08:49,400

835
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:52,560
♫  I don't know what's happening  ♫

836
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:59,050
♫  My world changed the day you arrived  ♫

837
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:03,260

838
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:07,060
♫  So I'm unsure of this feeling  ♫

839
01:09:07,060 --> 01:09:11,300
♫  Is it love? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  ♫

840
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:14,690
♫  I really wonder if it is  ♫

841
01:09:14,690 --> 01:09:22,330
♫  My heart races and aches since the moment I met you  ♫

842
01:09:22,330 --> 01:09:24,410
  What do you mean Prince Gyeongwoonjae is setting people up?

843
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,250
  I worry that he may be helping the king.

844
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:28,790
  Let us find a good fate and live happily.

845
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:30,290
  Hurray!

846
01:09:30,290 --> 01:09:31,770
  Please excuse me... for a moment.

847
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:33,670
  So you were Hwa Rok, after all, Maiden.

848
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,650
  You need to watch your widowed daughter-in-law.

849
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:39,260
  Tutor is to come soon, so come to the annex.

850
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,480
  Your heart races when you see someone you like.

851
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:42,720
  What wish did you make?

852
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,860
  Just stand there covered for a moment.

853
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,300
  Just follow me closely from behind, looking at only me.

854
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:48,910
  Make me your shield.

855
01:09:48,910 --> 01:09:54,100
♫  A moment like fate  ♫

856
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,410
