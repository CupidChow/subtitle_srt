1
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,170

2
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,270

3
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:50,850

4
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,380
So... right now...

5
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,950

Shim Jeong Woo is part of the Dongno Party.

6
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,350

So why do I keep him close and care for him?

7
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:19,490

8
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:23,130
I have never disliked the Dongno Party.

9
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,410
I just do not like the Left State Minister's people.

10
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:30,380
Even Jeong Woo's father, who first founded the ideology of the Dongno Party,

11
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,180
he would make appeals to everything I did and argue.

12
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,510
Right. Just like the way Jeong Woo does now.

13
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,690
Yes, I was annoyed, but I never disliked Jeong Woo's father.

14
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,730
However, the current Left State Minister...

15
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,740
The Left State Minister pretends to be loyal and presents a plausible justification

16
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,370
and he is only desperate to rise to power, which is so obvious.

17
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:55,930
So, how can I like him?

18
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:02,650
Geez, I can only speak my thoughts freely when I am away from my servants like this.

19
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:06,430
The king is not that great, after all. Is that not so?

20
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,940
Gosh, I shouldn't have done this.

21
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,630

22
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,480
While I was at Temple Seonhwa,

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,120
I heard that you amended a false rumor about the Defense Minister.

24
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,840
As a way of repaying the favor, I asked to meet with you

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,740
to suggest a good position, Your Excellency.

26
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,070
A good position?

27
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,100
Please be my grandson's private tutor.

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,500
I also heard you refused to adopt a child, as your family suggested.

29
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:43,010
It is fine now at your young age,

30
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:46,250
but you shall feel lonely with age.

31
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,570
So, you will be less lonely in your old age if you have a pupil.

32
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,980
Who looks after their private tutors nowadays?

33
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:55,060
Why not?

34
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:00,800
Your Excellency, you are matchmaking for the daughters of Master Maeng of Sungkyunkwan,

35
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,870
whom you were taught for less than 15 days.

36
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,520
There is nothing you do not know, Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong.

37
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:17,320
Eighty percent of what I do is merely to kill time, not for any other reason.

38
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,180
Again, I am grateful for your concern for my old age.

39
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,720
But I have no experience in teaching anyone.

40
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,470
I shall refuse to take your grandson's tutor position.

41
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:35,080
This child should grow up well in order to lead the Dongno Party founded by your father.

42
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,850
On the days you teach my grandson,

43
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,630
it would be nice to talk about current events over tea with me, just like today.

44
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:56,060
If I get a private tutor, will I have to study until late at night again?

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,030
I guess that is the case...

46
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:02,430
Why have a tutor when you already go to school?

47
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,140
But you know your grandmother is doing all this for your own good, right, Geun Seok?

48
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,190
Yes, I understand that "Good medicine tastes bitter."

49
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,250
Let us go inside.

50
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,660
  It's fine.

51
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,970
  I can just check in with the physician laterâ€”

52
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:28,380
  What are you doing right now?

53
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,560
There is no way.

54
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,950

55
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,370
Grandmother, it is me, Geun Seok!

56
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,600
Come on in.

57
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:02,540
I have a nosebleed.

58
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,720
It is from sewing too diligently, so do not worry. Go greet your grandmother.

59
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,430
Yes.

60
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,360
Why did your mother not come in with you?

61
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:39,570
She had to return to the annex because of a sudden nosebleed.

62
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,570
A nosebleed?

63
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,010
Just like I get nosebleeds from studying diligently,

64
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:49,250
Mother's nose is bleeding from sewing diligently, so she said not to worry.

65
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,800
Have you had a nosebleed?

66
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,910
Yes. However, Mother said not to study after the hour of dog, so I no longer have nosebleeds.

67
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,430
What is the matter?

68
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:06,600
It seems it was a secret with his mother not to study after the hour of dog.

69
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,120
Young Madam!

70
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,750
Gosh, what is wrong?

71
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:20,590
W-What is going on?

72
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,430
Who is the person who came as Geun Seok's private tutor?

73
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,820
It is His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

74
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,140
What?

75
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,260
 Inspector was that infamous Resentful Man?

76
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,980
 You are lashing out without a reason, just like Resentful Man.

77
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,500
 What did you just say?

78
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,800
  I am sorry.

79
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,650
 For comparing you with Resentful Man, Prince Gyeongwoonjae, the scumbag.

80
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:48,070
 You haven't even met Prince Gyeongwoonjae, though!

81
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,050
 I'm going crazy.

82
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,650
 I just bad-mouthed the Resentful Man to his face. Right?

83
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,040
Young Madam.

84
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,350
Young Madam?

85
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:01,740
Young Madam!

86
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,430
Yes?

87
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,950
Have you gone deaf now?

88
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,130
Why did you not go in with Young Master?

89
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,370
W-Well, that's...

90
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,500
I suddenly had a nosebleed.

91
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,730
What? A nosebleed?

92
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:19,140
I-I thought it was a nosebleed, but it turned out to be snot.

93
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:23,810
Nosebleed or snot, I cannot show that in front of a distinguished guest.

94
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,840
Let me know when the guest leaves.

95
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,180
I shall tell Mother myself.

96
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,860
Yes.

97
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,890
Inspector is the Resentful Man...

98
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:40,690
and Geun Seok's private tutor...

99
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,700
What should I do?

100
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,760
It wasn't all that good that he could recognize my face without makeup.

101
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,450
 Young Madam, Madam is coming in.

102
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,960
Mother, why did you come all the way here instead of summoning me?

103
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:18,400
I heard you told Geun Seok not to study after the hour of the dog.

104
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,820
Well, Mother...

105
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,270
that was because Geun Seok had a nosebleed in the past.

106
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,280
Well done.

107
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,450
- Pardon? 
 - Studying is important.

108
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:32,900
What good is it if you are not healthy?

109
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:41,210
However, you should have told me first if such a thing had happened.

110
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,480
If people who are unaware of the truth hear this,

111
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,330
they would say Geun Seok is not your real son and that you are neglecting his education.

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,690
I did not think it through, Mother.

113
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,950
We shall order Geun Seok some medicine at the physician tomorrow.

114
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,740
Yes, I shall do so.

115
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:09,210
Also, Prince Gyeongwoonjae will be coming to our home to look over Geun Seok's studies.

116
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,700
- So be prepared for that. 
 - No!

117
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,850
I mean, Mother, you just said Geun Seok's health is the most important thing.

118
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:26,510
It would contradict what you said to add tutoring to his schooling.

119
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,500
It is only once every five days.

120
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:33,410
Let us try it first and then reassess if it is too overwhelming later.

121
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,410
Did everything go well?

122
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,480
I will be going to the Left State Minister's home to tutor their grandson once every five days.

123
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,660
Pardon? You hate the Left State Minister, so why teach their grandson?

124
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,220
 This child should grow up well

125
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,340
 in order to lead the Dongno Party founded by your father.

126
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,040
I tried to refuse all the way, but

127
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,020
I could not just sit and watch.

128
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,400
- Watch what? 
 - Get going now.

129
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,360
Yes, please rest well.

130
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,860

131
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,460
Why have you not taken care of Lee Cho Ok's case yet?

132
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,820
It's been months since the incident. How long will you drag this on?

133
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,160
Since Hwa Rok is only a pen name for the murder suspect,

134
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,020
it is not easy to capture him.

135
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:57,500
From what I hear, more than half the women in the city read his novels.

136
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,290
Even if he uses a pen name, you can't catch him?

137
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:04,610
Mayor sir, the investigation shows that Lee Cho Ok did not commit suicide but was murderedâ€”

138
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:08,670
Hey! It's been concluded that she suffered from pessimistic views on life and committed suicide.

139
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,300
Why do you investigate more on your own?

140
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:15,650
Use that time to hurry up and catch Hwa Rok!

141
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,170
People are asking when volume three of Madam's Private Life is coming out.

142
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,120
Everyone is already going crazy.

143
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,950
Volume three will take a bit longer due to personal issues.

144
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,140
Did Yeojudaek already find your match, Lady?

145
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,900
Eighty percent of my writing is based on my mood.

146
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:51,650
If I had found my match, I would have already finished volume three out of excitement.

147
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,880
I was the only one who didn't have one. Just me!

148
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,230
Didn't have? What did you not have?

149
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:02,720
Gosh... W-Why do you cry?

150
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,700
Stop. There, there.

151
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,240
Gosh, what's making you so sad?

152
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,360
Why am I the only one without one?

153
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,970
What is it again?

154
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:32,820
Can we talk for a moment?

155
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,560
Go ahead.

156
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,690
I cannot talk to you in this illegal state.

157
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:38,600
It is a legal situation now, so go ahead.

158
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,170
Did you not promise me that you would not write while disguising yourself as a man?

159
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:48,290
I only went to receive the payments for what I had already written.

160
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,900
I worked so hard on it that my head felt like exploding. I had to get the payment.

161
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,230
Are you saying money is more important than your life, Maiden?

162
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,070
Yes...

163
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,740
It is right now.

164
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,990
My house wall has collapsed, and you can see everything inside from outside.

165
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,760
Goodness...

166
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,810
Goodness...

167
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,480
My goodness...

168
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,220
Goodness...

169
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,480
One, two, three.

170
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,790
Why did you come out?

171
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,650
I heard a Hanseongbu officer is fixing the wall.

172
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,340
Well, it is a bit complicated...

173
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,230
Mother, you do not need to worry.

174
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:39,090
I have something to say to the officer.

175
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,650
My gosh, you really don't need to worry.

176
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,380
Greetings, ma'am.

177
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,420
The wall is a problem,

178
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,230
but the roof tiles also need to be redone.

179
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:57,020
When it rains, the water leaks in the room across.

180
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,270
M-Mother, why are you telling that to the officer?

181
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,490
Understood, Ma'am. Once the wall is fixed, I shall also fix the roof in a few days.

182
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:36,220
That officer must be married. Right?

183
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:39,820
Of course, he is. He's an officer.

184
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:45,280
It must be so nice for a lady who has a reliable man like him as her husband.

185
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:51,950
Sure. It must be very nice to have a husband who fixes other people's walls.

186
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,190
Father used to celebrate his master's wife's birthday

187
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:02,770
but never celebrated Mother's birthday.

188
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:06,790
A man like him is the worst kind of husband to have.

189
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:22,640
Tell me.

190
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:26,880
Sister, I think Shaman Do's predictions were wrong.

191
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,030
The places you mentioned, the princess's residence or wet nurse's home...

192
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,740
I can't find the crown prince's trace anywhere.

193
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,970
I discreetly asked Royal Consort Sookbin for help.

194
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,720
She thinks the crown prince is inside the Eastern Palace.

195
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,910
How could you do something so useless!

196
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,600
Well, with Brother, I mean...

197
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,180
please do not be so upset with the Defense Minster.

198
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:07,980
I also think something is wrong.

199
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,830
The queen still makes the crown prince's food herself.

200
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:17,110
The crown prince studies at the Shigangwon every day. 
  (An institute responsible for educating the crown prince)

201
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:22,160
So, I think it is useless to try to find the crown prince at the private residence.

202
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:26,610
Could you hear the sound of the crown prince reading?

203
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,670
I could not hear the sound of reading.

204
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:35,820
The queen must have sat a young eunuch of the Eastern Palace.

205
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,370
I have already found the private residence where the crown prince is staying.

206
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,460
Where is that place?

207
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,560
  Was there a house inside the city that suddenly purchased milk from you?

208
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,710
  Oh! Yes, there was. Yes!

209
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,400
  Where is that house?

210
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,960
  Your milk porridge is tastier than the one I had at the palace.

211
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,100
  I found out through a peddler, and it turns out Ms. Seo was the queen's nanny.

212
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,770
  She was exempted from her low class soon after the queen was installed.

213
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:26,110
There are two more men that they have never seen inside the house.

214
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:32,960
You must be in the dark regarding this, Royal Consort Sookbin.

215
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,380
So, please do not send a palace maid to look around the Eastern Palace.

216
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,260
I understand.

217
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,300
Calm down.

218
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:00,270
Nothing changes from the fact that he is the Resentful Man.

219
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,460
I just need to make sure not to get on his nerves.

220
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,890
You startled me...

221
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:22,780
I am not late, am I?

222
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:28,540
W-Well, I guess... I arrived... a bit early.

223
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:31,010
You have arrived early, Sir.

224
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,500
Why are you suddenly acting like this?

225
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:37,330
I had no idea you were His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae, a Royal Family member.

226
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,320
I feel as though I have been very rude all this time.

227
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,720
How did you find out that I was Gyeongwoonjae?

228
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,950
Well... the footman who follows you...

229
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,220
I guess Oh Bong said something unnecessary.

230
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,830
Just be the way you were.

231
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,710
I have become used to your loudness, making this uncomfortable.

232
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,530
Then I shall follow your orders.

233
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,710
Do as you please.

234
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,850
Wow, the drawings! Awesome!

235
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:10,740
T-They are amazing... Sir...

236
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,830
D-Did you draw them yourself, Your Excellency?

237
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:18,300
You said we would reenact the first sight at Temple Seonhwa to decide on suitable matches for them.

238
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,020
I drew them to increase the efficiency of our work.

239
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,200
You are even skilled at drawing.

240
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,130
There is nothing you cannot do, Your Excellency.

241
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:31,960
Well, shall we begin?

242
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,590

243
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,190
You remember all the old bachelors whom you saw from a distance?

244
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:49,330
I never forget anyone I have seen once.

245
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,290
 "Ssangyeonsulsa never forgets the face of a person she has seen once."

246
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:03,210
Let us begin with Lady Ha Na, who received all the bachelors' attention.

247
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,500

248
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,640
  It seemed too early to throw the stone in this game.

249
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,230

The eldest cares about family background and wealth.

250
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:23,500
She wants someone whom she can respect.

251
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,090
Number 15, Jang Cheon Bae, sounds like a fit since he runs a big school.

252
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,340
On the surface, bachelor number 15 is right.

253
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,810
But my intuition says bachelor number 12.

254
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,280
I shall put both bachelors on the list of groom candidates for Lady Ha Na.

255
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,110
Number 12?

256
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:46,080
Since number 12 was great at baduk, he should be very smart as well.

257
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,720
He may be smart, but did you not see number 12's old clothes?

258
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,700
The eldest, who cares about wealth, would not accept him.

259
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,140
How could you judge only from his old clothes?

260
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:59,520
Did you not see his delicate hands poking through his clothes?

261
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,370
And when he had his first sight with Lady Ha Na,

262
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,960
the shiny temporal bead under his worn-out gat. 
  (Hat worn by men during the Joseon Dynasty)

263
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:08,080
Did you not see that, either?

264
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,360
I am not sure why bachelor number 12 is hiding himself, but

265
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,470
I am most certain he is from a wealthy family.

266
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:18,790
I think Lady Ha Na also felt it instinctively

267
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,590
and probably gave him a hint in his favor.

268
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,140
Women's keen eyes...

269
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,780
are truly scary.

270
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,570
Also, number 12 is not from Hanyang.

271
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:35,840
So, he does not know about Lady Ha Na's rumors.

272
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,380
That might work out better.

273
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:40,800
All right.

274
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:45,250
Then, how about the second daughter, who asked for the most difficult criteria?

275
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:49,930
 My criteria for a suitable husband is very simple.

276
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:56,360
 Someone who can earn enough to feed himself with his own hands.

277
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,690
Lady Du Ri's criteria were a lot more difficult than expected.

278
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,860

Out of the old bachelors who showed interest in the second daughter,

279
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,660
I think number 16 is the most normal one.

280
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,270
He passed the state exam and is most likely to take office.

281
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:18,490

282
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,600
I shall go with bachelor number 24.

283
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,900
Number 24 is full of an inferiority complex.

284
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,560
And since he is a farmer, he does not seem to have any desire to take office.

285
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,880
That is exactly why they would be a perfect match.

286
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,410
Since he is a farmer, he is capable of working to feed himself.

287
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,390
Lady Du Ri would not be able to argue with that.

288
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:41,490
As a Ssangyeonsulsa, you bragged about being a great matchmaker.

289
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:44,730
But you look at criteria much more viciously than I do.

290
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,930
If you care about the future of the three daughters,

291
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:50,860
number 16 with the greatest potential to take office is better for her.

292
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,720
My real reason for selection...

293
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,100
was because of number 24's gaze and eagerness.

294
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,130
It was just for a moment, but I definitely saw it.

295
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,540
Number 24's gaze of love toward Lady Du Ri.

296
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:09,160
And unlike other old bachelors, his proactiveness to chase after her.

297
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,520
If you are going to decide all on your own, why bother having a meeting with me?

298
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,500
"Do every step with you."

299
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,370
That was the condition of our contract.

300
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:21,380
It is not too late to trust me and stay outâ€”

301
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:23,180
Enough!

302
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,340
Did the palpitations come to you again?

303
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,190
No. Also, it's not as if palpitations are people. How could they "come"?

304
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:48,690
You really do not know how to speak properly.

305
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:54,950

306
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,170
I see you are here again.

307
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,260
It is so fascinating.

308
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:08,650
I am definitely not here to see you, Maiden.

309
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:13,350
O-Over there! I am on my way home from visiting my friend.

310
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,050
I guess you are friends with a shaman.

311
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,620
Pardon?

312
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:43,510
And finally, Lady Sam Soon, who is like a lotus in the mud. Shall we start?

313
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,460
I think I understand your selection method.

314
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:51,650
You cannot learn intuitions of matchmaking by studying a book.

315
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:56,050
Please tell me which old bachelor you have in mind.

316
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:57,740
No, I do not want to.

317
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,070
What if you become jealous of my fast learning abilities

318
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:04,640
and lie and say I have picked the wrong person when I have picked the correct one.

319
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,990
Why would I?

320
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:11,160
I do not know, either. Why people are like that...

321
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,400
I guess that is why you became the Resentful Man.

322
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,360
What?

323
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:24,480
Actually, I became curious after learning that you were His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

324
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:28,110
Why someone as smart and honest as you became the Resentful Man.

325
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,510
But I just figured out why.

326
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:33,120
It is because you were surrounded by terrible people

327
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,490
who wanted to put you down to bring themselves up.

328
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:46,070
Then, why don't we both pick simultaneously on the count of three?

329
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,550
To avoid misunderstanding.

330
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,130
Fine.

331
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,540
One...

332
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,080
two...

333
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,910
three.

334
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:35,660
S-See! I told you I am a fast learner.

335
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,850
What is your reason for selection?

336
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:40,580
Like the youngest daughter who writes disguised as a man,

337
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:44,960
number 23 enjoys to cook, like a woman.

338
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,140
They are both opposites of the world...

339
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,010
so they might suit each other nicely.

340
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,460
Y-Your reason is wrong.

341
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,610
Lady Sam Soon is honest with her emotions

342
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,240
and bravely steps forward to wed.

343
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,800
Bachelor number 23 is suitable because he is the type who would do

344
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,890
what the woman says other than cooking.

345
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,200
T-Then... for me...

346
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:23,340
what kind of woman would suit me?

347
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,880
W-Well...

348
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,120
 Your Excellency.

349
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,870
Let's see...

350
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:00,340
Please have some snacks.

351
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:09,940
Then, Lady Sam Soon's candidate for husband shall be number 23.

352
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:16,410
As I have said, contact me once you have rallied the selected old bachelors.

353
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:21,030
Since we are done for today, I shall get going.

354
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:28,810
W-Wait, I have brought these, so have some before you leave.

355
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,030
Thank you, but I am in a rush.

356
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,960
Hold on...

357
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,600
What?

358
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,380
Why did you have to come now?

359
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:49,260
Your Excellency, you told me to bring snacks at a good time.

360
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,400
I've been busy since dawn preparing this by hiring someone.

361
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,370
How could you glare at me like that, just over a merchant like her?

362
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:59,560
I am very sad. Very.

363
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,860
Use these dishes for today.

364
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,760
I wonder where Young Madam is on a day like today.

365
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,600
Food is all about preparing with care. If there is no superior watching over,

366
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,050
subordinates will not cook it properly...

367
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,370
She acts like a madam when she's a slave, too.

368
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:36,340
Should I go and check out the annex?

369
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,650
Why are you all out here?

370
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,410
Prince Jin Seong loves ginger wine.

371
00:30:56,410 --> 00:31:00,550
It was very difficult to take it out because it was in the bottom of the shed.

372
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,630
Oh, right.

373
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:07,890
You said Prince Jin Seong is taking herbal medicine and cannot drink alcohol.

374
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:12,590
I forgot. I should put the wine back.

375
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,580
Have a maid do that later.

376
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,350
Finish preparing the food.

377
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,280
Yes, Mother.

378
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,950
Gosh, my goodness, Young Madam!

379
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:37,330
She came not too long ago, right?

380
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,070
Gosh, you really don't need to give them to me every time.

381
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,710
We have a lot of work today. Let's get started.

382
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,210
Should I taste the soup?

383
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,810
Prince Jin Seong is here,

384
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,120
so why did you come here instead of the men's quarters?

385
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:11,130
What I said was right!

386
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,400
Young Madam roams outside in secret.

387
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,750

388
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:18,600
What is she doing? Look at these vulgar clothes.

389
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,460
- What should we do? 
 - You wicked wench!

390
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:23,880
Can't you keep your mouth shut?

391
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:28,910
Do not speak of what you saw just now.

392
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:34,170
If I ever hear rumors about my daughter-in-law wandering about outside,

393
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,730
wherever the source may be, I will assume you spread the rumor.

394
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,630
I will sell Sam Wol to a rough place, so keep this in mind.

395
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,400
Y-Yes, Madam.

396
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,640
Yes, Madam.

397
00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:51,620
As for you, in secrecy,

398
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,730
find out what Geun Seok's mother is doing.

399
00:32:54,730 --> 00:32:57,300
Y-Yes.

400
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:12,020
Is there a reason to bring Prince Jin Seong all the way here?

401
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,740
We are the ones doing all the work anyway.

402
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,850
Of all people, Prince Jin Seong should know for himself

403
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,810
what it took for us to put him on the throne.

404
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,760
So that he will not be a tyrant after he takes the throne

405
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,230
and the Dongno Party can continue to gain power.

406
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:35,320
Of course. No one can match your insightfulness, Left State Minister.

407
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,980
 Prince Jin Seong has arrived!

408
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,590
 T-Then... for me...

409
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:01,820
 what kind of woman would suit me?

410
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,790
She obviously knows that I am a prince who cannot remarry.

411
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,820
She must have thought I was so immoral.

412
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,460
I am crazy.

413
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,790
I should have let go the moment our hands touched.

414
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,390
What if he thinks of me as a floozy woman?

415
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:32,300
Madam!

416
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:36,560
What are you doing right now?

417
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,150
What?

418
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,540
M-My gosh! Oh, no!

419
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,700
What do I do? Oh, no! What do I do!

420
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,610
It is better for me to do this by myself.

421
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:52,070
Madam, go rest over there.

422
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,390
Ten days until I get to see her,

423
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:16,780
and to think she must have misunderstood me all that time...

424
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,140
Is the stress causing a relapse?

425
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,730
This will not do.

426
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:28,690
I shall recruit groom candidates as soon as possible

427
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:32,860
and meet with Yeojudaek to clear up the misunderstanding.

428
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,420
 Sister! Open the door!

429
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:48,170
I am not even allowed time to regret alone.

430
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,430
 Sister! Hurry!

431
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,630
Yes, I am coming!

432
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,240
Wait, why did you bring this heavy thing here?

433
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,260
My life is over once I wed.

434
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:20,020
So, I want to drink lots of my favorite ginger wine before that.

435
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,040
Why is your life over once you wed? That's when your life begins.

436
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:30,180
Do you know that it does not sound convincing at all coming from you?

437
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,820
Wait, I will bring some snacks.

438
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:48,200
There was no need to do all this...

439
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,980
I thought you wanted to drink all the alcohol in this jar.

440
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,950
I also want to drink some today.

441
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,490
Did something happen?

442
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,930
Drink slowly.

443
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:11,120
I feel a little uneasy about something.

444
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,130
Can you tell me your opinion, Ye Jin?

445
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:16,240
Go ahead. Is it about you, Sister?

446
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,140
No!

447
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,320
It is not about me...

448
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,820
but about a married woman I know very well.

449
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,270
She...

450
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:33,970
She was picking out goods at the market and overlapped her hands with the man next door.

451
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,810
Is the man next door married?

452
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:37,750
No, a widower...

453
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,280
is what I heard.

454
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:46,920
A widower and a married woman...

455
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:50,510
- And? 
 - Anyway! What is important is...

456
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,680
that wife was so startled and did not take her hand straight away.

457
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,560
So, she was worried that the man next door would think of her as a floozy woman.

458
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:03,430
Because that wife is someone who only thinks of her husband.

459
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,710
Sounds like a lie.

460
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,050
That wife is lying that she only thinks of her husband.

461
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,390
It is not a lie...

462
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,730
I am sure that the wife has feelings for the widower.

463
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,260
No!

464
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,300
That is not true! I know that wife very well!

465
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,630
What do you mean she has feelings...

466
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:28,360
You know that I have been married three times. Right?

467
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,070
I do.

468
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:35,480
Listen. If something like that happens,

469
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,000
she should be worried others would see her as a floozy woman.

470
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,910
Why would she worry that he would see her as a floozy woman?

471
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:48,720
That would mean that the wife

472
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,790
wants to leave a good impression on the widower.

473
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,080
- Makes no sense... 
 - Wow!

474
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,770
- That does make sense. 
 - What do you mean...

475
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:04,890
No matter how much of a matchmaking goddess you are, Young Madam,

476
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:06,820
how could someone who matches virgin bachelors and maidens

477
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,680
know anything about mature love?

478
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:16,360
Do you know other stories of mature love?

479
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,130
Should I tell you?

480
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:21,040
Well, my second husband

481
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,140
fell in love with the madam and ran away at night.

482
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,650
Gosh! Tell me.

483
00:39:25,650 --> 00:39:28,560
- When was it... 
 - My goodness.

484
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,880
Just because you've been married three times, you act as if you know everything about love.

485
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,800
If I say it wasn't the case, then it wasn't.

486
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:38,510
You don't even know the full story, and you speak of love.

487
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,770
So to tell you when it was...

488
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:46,580

489
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:02,800
His Majesty has flu symptoms and has not yet woken up.

490
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,860
Is he very unwell?

491
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,950
I believe it is a light cold.

492
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:11,720
All right. Tell him I was here.

493
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:37,310
I think she has overcome the critical stage.

494
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:39,340
That is a relief.

495
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,570
I have something to ask this palace maid.

496
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:45,360
Whatever it takes, have her regain consciousness.

497
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,210
I will do my best.

498
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:52,560
Do not let anyone outside know that this girl is alive.

499
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,300
There shall always be a goal for learning.

501
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:09,350
What is your dream?

502
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:12,230
It is to become a chief state minister.

503
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,150
Why do you want to become a chief state minister?

504
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:18,290
It is to make my grandparents happy.

505
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:22,610
Taking office is to assist the king and work for the people.

506
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:25,570
It is not to make your grandparents proud.

507
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:28,600
By chance, do you know my mother?

508
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,220
What are you talking about out of the blue?

509
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,380
You are the first adult to say something like that other than my mother.

510
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,690
My mother also said it is okay if it is something I enjoy

511
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:42,150
but I do not need to force myself to study to make my grandparents happy.

512
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,930
It sounds like you have a great mother.

513
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,370
Which is why I am worried.

514
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:50,770
She seems to be so oblivious about the world.

515
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,180
How was the first class?

516
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,340
I would have regretted it if I had refused to tutor him.

517
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:16,680
Your grandson is very intelligent, so I think I will be the one learning.

518
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:21,960
I am glad you saw him in a good light.

519
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,770
By the way, is the matchmaking going well?

520
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,610
If you have any difficulties, feel free to tell me.

521
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:31,140
I shall help you.

522
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,180
Matchmaking is usually the job of women.

523
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:37,710
It should be fine since there is a very skilled matchmaker.

524
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:41,610
But I shall ask for help if there are any difficulties.

525
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:49,880
How was the private tutoring?

526
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,910
If it is overwhelming, make sure to tell me.

527
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,460
It was fun.

528
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,600
I especially like my master.

529
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,350
Really? In what way?

530
00:43:00,350 --> 00:43:03,070
Because he likes you, Mother.

531
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,460
What did you say?

532
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,120
There is something like that.

533
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,670
What did you learn today?

534
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:15,160
I learned the Analects of Confucius.

535
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,000
Analects of Confucius?

536
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:21,380
My son is learning the Analects of Confucius now. You're all grown up now.

537
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,530
How is it?

538
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,320
Do you go to school for this?

539
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,730
- Goodness... 
 - Here, here, here.

540
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:37,290
Gosh, sorry I am a bit late.

541
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:43,360
There were many students to look after at the institution, with the exam coming up soon.

542
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,280
I have gathered other scholars since the weather is so nice today.

543
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,540
The more, the merrier.

544
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:53,370
I am now realizing you are all the men-against-the-wall from Temple Seonhwa.

545
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,080
This hooraejasambae...

546
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,280

547
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,340
first,

548
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,140
please have some.

549
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,150
Oh, my goodness!

550
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:18,910
What did you do to the sotak! 
  (Soju and takju mix)

551
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:25,740
This is the best sotak I have ever had. 
  (Soju and takju mix)

552
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:32,190
It is so good that I would drink 10 of these.

553
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:36,410
Sure, please do. I am treating this gathering today,

554
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,220
so drink as much as you like and have a good time.

555
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:43,270
There, there.

556
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:46,820
Here.

557
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,570
There you go.

558
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,610
Where is the jeon? 
  (Korean pancakes)

559
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,400
How about the meat jeon?

560
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,740
- Pull out the grass over there. 
 - Yes.

561
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:59,150
Put the fish here.

562
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,140
Where is your mother?

563
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,830
- Mother. 
 - Stay seated.

564
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,080
There is still time.

565
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:40,110
The ground is dirty...

566
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,720
Must be hard...

567
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,380
to live without your husband.

568
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,420
My second son, who had been suffering from illnesses since birth,

569
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,340
laughed a lot after meeting you.

570
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:14,370
I probably laughed more than my dear husband.

571
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,680
It was much too short.

572
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,230
It is not as though love grows greater with time.

573
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,950
Although it was short, the love my husband gave to me was so great.

574
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:39,230
I think he has given me the happiness to last a lifetime.

575
00:46:41,610 --> 00:46:43,690
Thank you...

576
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:50,030
for loving my In Gook and raising Geun Seok well.

577
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:54,750
It must be frustrating to only stay at home right now.

578
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:56,850
But once Geun Seok grows up and weds,

579
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,800
you are the madam of our house, Soon Deok.

580
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:20,950
Oh, yes! Do you remember the lady who gave a tip for a baduk game?

581
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,700
Of course, I remember.

582
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,180
She never left my mind.

583
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,970
Do you know which family she is from?

584
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:34,650
 You cannot tell the bachelors that the women are old maidens before they fall in love deeply.

585
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:37,040
 Because prejudice arises from false rumors.

586
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,020
I thought you were looking for a lady

587
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:42,150
who will like you regardless of your wealth or family background.

588
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,920
Why are you asking about her family background?

589
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:52,020
As for me, I really do not care about a lady's family background.

590
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:56,720
Why? Because I am very wealthy.

591
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:02,130
It is very unromantic of you to buy love with wealth.

592
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:06,120
Come now. Are you still going on about romance?

593
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,130
Then, why don't you think of it this way?

594
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:12,740
The most romantic thing you can obtain with money

595
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,260
is a lady's heart.

596
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:24,400
Well, why don't you two continue your conversations?

597
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,160
Thank you very much for the delightful insights.

598
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:43,440
From what I saw that day, I did not think you would come to this "escaping old bachelor status" drinking party.

599
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,230
What do you think about this lady?

600
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:54,620
As long as she is fine with my situation, I do not mind whoever it is.

601
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,370
You must take accountability for saying

602
00:48:59,370 --> 00:49:02,520
you do not mind whoever it is. You must.

603
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:16,150
What are you doing here?

604
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:18,440
I looked everywhere for you.

605
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,990
Grilled minnow is a delicacy. I wanted to give you all a taste.

606
00:49:22,990 --> 00:49:25,660
Enough about grilled minnow. Take a look at this.

607
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:28,890
I have found a suitable lady for you.

608
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:32,060
Is there someone like that?

609
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:38,990
W-Wow, would a lady as beautiful as she is...

610
00:49:39,690 --> 00:49:42,200
like someone like me?

611
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:45,730
Did I accidentally show you the eldest?

612
00:49:46,870 --> 00:49:50,140
O-Oh... it is the youngest...

613
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,710
Yeojudaek must really be the Ssangyeonsulsa.

614
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:05,810
 I am sure that the wife has feelings for the widower.

615
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:11,960
Her blabbering without knowing the full story bothers me.

616
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:15,250
Forget it. I know my own feelings the best.

617
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,240
How would Gae Dong know?

618
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,280
 Young Madam!

619
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,870
Speak of the devil...

620
00:50:21,870 --> 00:50:26,280
Young Madam, this. I heard it was urgent.

621
00:50:34,210 --> 00:50:36,530
W-What is this about?

622
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,360
I will be right back.

623
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,630
Right now?

624
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:43,710
If anyone asks, tell them I went to go buy thread.

625
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,050
Wait! Y-Young Madam.

626
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:47,740
Young Madam!

627
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,580
Gosh, my goodness.

628
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:52,730
Busted!

629
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,520
Why is she so fast?

630
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:06,080
Goodness, move out of my way.

631
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,490
Where did she go?

632
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:22,150
Where has she gone?

633
00:51:33,430 --> 00:51:36,500
Why are you not waiting outside?

634
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:38,770
I told him to come inside.

635
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:40,830
I know the footman takes care of business,

636
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,990
so I thought there would not be any misunderstandings if we listened together.

637
00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:48,010
I think it would be best for the three of us to meet about matchmaking.

638
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,610
W-Well, but...

639
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:58,950
You did not forget that the contract says you will follow my matchmaking methods. Right?

640
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,910
I will sit on the side like furniture.

641
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,910
What is the serious problem you mentioned in your letter?

642
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,320
W-Well, that is...

643
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,220
Wait!

644
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:25,510
I cannot do this because of stress.

645
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,630
I must clear the misunderstanding, then talk about work.

646
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:38,290
That day, the reason I asked who would be a suitable woman for me

647
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,860
is because of a very complicated reason.

648
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,830
I shall explain it all later,

649
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:46,020
so do not mistake me for a weird person.

650
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,530
I never had such a misunderstanding.

651
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,270
Do not lie!

652
00:52:50,270 --> 00:52:52,980
If you did not misunderstand, why do you keep a distance from me?

653
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,360
You said to keep three footsteps apart from you at Mt. Mokmyeok.

654
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,340
Did you forget?

655
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,500
  There is a clear class difference between you and me.

656
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:03,720
  So maintain three footsteps of a distance from now on.

657
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,980
When did you start listening to me so well?

658
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,510
Gosh... she can see right through you...

659
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:15,230
So embarrassing. How are you going to face Yeojudaek now?

660
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:18,580
Please explain the problem. I am a bit busy.

661
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,170
I was going to now.

662
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,710
Abiding to your plans, I gathered the old bachelor candidates

663
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:26,740
and had a drink with them to instigate them with all my might.

664
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,490
The atmosphere was great at first.

665
00:53:30,490 --> 00:53:33,060
 Gosh.

666
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,960
 Gosh. There, there.

667
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,130
 Yes, yes.

668
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:41,300
 Inspector, thank you very much.

669
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:43,300
 Actually, in my situation,

670
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,370
 as long as she is not an old maiden, I am thankful to take anyone.

671
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:51,270
 Who would try to marry the old maidens?

672
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:54,790
 Scholar Kim, did you not say you were from a faraway province?

673
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:56,340
 You know of the old maidens?

674
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,520
 The rumors are very bad.

675
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:02,540
 Especially the eldest daughter, I heard a virgin spirit possesses her

676
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:06,360
 and brings different men every night.

677
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:09,700
 I heard the Defense Minister was also a victim.

678
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:10,950
 That is right.

679
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:12,750
 What do you mean it's right

680
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:17,270
 Everyone knows that the Defense Minister loves women.

681
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:18,740
 I...

682
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,570
 I have heard...

683
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:24,590
 something since I teach the Defense Minister's son.

684
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:28,680
 Apparently, the eldest daughter of the old maidens seduced the Defense Minister

685
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,750
 and rang the Sinmungo as revenge

686
00:54:30,750 --> 00:54:33,620
 when he did not give her enough money.

687
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,950
 Since the eldest is like that,

688
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,770
 it is obvious how the other two would behave.

689
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:41,040
 Did you see, Scholar?

690
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,060
 Her seducing the Defense Minister?

691
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:49,970
 Do I need to see to know that!

692
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:52,550
 Since there were rumors that even the dead Lee Cho Ok,

693
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:55,480
 who was friendly with the eldest, was very promiscuous and lewd,

694
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,800
 when no one showed interest in marrying her despite her age,

695
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,320
 she could not fight the embarrassment and drowned herself in the water.

696
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,310
 "Similar minds side together."

697
00:55:05,310 --> 00:55:08,040
 Birds of a feather flock together.

698
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,010
 "Rumors spread like wildfire. So watch what you say."

699
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:13,190
 Please be cautious of your words when you are unsure.

700
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:22,900
 I-In my opinion, I also think it is a false rumor.

701
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,270
 Gosh... it could be a false rumor.

702
00:55:26,270 --> 00:55:29,590
 For parents, it does not matter if the rumor is true or not.

703
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:33,580
 Although my parents have given up on me,

704
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,010
 if I tell them that I will marry an old maiden,

705
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:41,130
 they will probably disown me.

706
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,730
You should have seen the old bachelors stern faces!

707
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:51,540
Just playing ignorant and having them meet the three daughters will not do.

708
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:56,500
Especially! Especially, h-here this number 15.

709
00:55:56,500 --> 00:55:59,090
N-Number 15!

710
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:03,510
For someone who runs a learning institution, all he does is spread false rumors!

711
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,970
Even if the eldest daughter likes him, I oppose him.

712
00:56:07,970 --> 00:56:11,320
I guess the sex scandal was a greater obstacle than expected.

713
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,740
What? "Must have been an obstacle"?

714
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:16,970
What an irresponsible thing to say.

715
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:19,600
You spoke as if everything would work out at the first sight.

716
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:22,610
There is an exception to everything.

717
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,520
Now that things have come to this, I must dispel Lady Ha Na's false rumor.

718
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,840
How so?

719
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:31,020
I have a definite trick.

720
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:35,270
So, please find Lady Cho Ok's murderer, Your Excellency.

721
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,240
Why the sudden concern with Lee Cho Ok's death?

722
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,800
Because Lady Ha Na's sex scandal started from the rumor that Lady Cho Ok's ghost possessed her.

723
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:48,730
Cho Ok committed suicide. What do you mean by "murderer"?

724
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:52,180
That's what stupid investigators say.

725
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,720
As long as we know the truth about Lady Cho Ok's death,

726
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,320
Lady Ha Na's scandal can be eliminated.

727
00:57:01,710 --> 00:57:07,210
 "Ssangyeonsulsa's trick is never wrong."

728
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,000
You want me to tell you the murderer?

729
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,960
Were you not investigating Lee Cho Ok's case?

730
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,380

(Forensics)

731
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:40,380
You are covering for the culprit even when you know who it is, Officer.

732
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,360
You must know that covering for a murderer is a great crime. Right?

733
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,820
If I tell you who the murderer is,

734
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:49,870
do you have the confidence to punish him?

735
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:51,530
Why would I?

736
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,900
Please leave.

737
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,210
It is not something I can speak of just to entertain your curiosity.

738
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:03,800
Though it is not me, as long as we know the truth of the case,

739
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:08,760
there is someone who can punish only the culprit without anyone getting hurt.

740
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,090
Who is that?

741
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:20,270
You will find out if you come with me.

742
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,720
Gosh.

743
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,930
Go straight ahead. Watch your head.

744
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:42,940
Why are you here...

745
00:58:44,390 --> 00:58:47,930
I-I am a matchmaker...

746
00:58:55,700 --> 00:59:00,570
I am only here to wed my sisters and myself, so do not misunderstand.

747
00:59:00,570 --> 00:59:03,420
To wed?

748
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:10,370
I am glad he cannot recognize me,

749
00:59:10,370 --> 00:59:13,540
but he's starting to annoy me.

750
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:17,250
Why did you bring the youngest daughter?

751
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:23,110
Your Excellency Gyeongwoonjae, why did you bring Officer?

752
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:26,340
He knows the whole story and the culprit of Lee Cho Ok's case.

753
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,100
Oraâ€”

754
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,550
no Officer does?

755
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:38,560
Gosh, I feel a little better now.

756
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:48,330
Did you tell His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae that you could punish Lee Cho Ok's murderer?

757
00:59:48,330 --> 00:59:51,330
Yes, that is correct.

758
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,910
I have a question.

759
00:59:54,910 --> 00:59:57,870
Were you His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

760
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:02,270
Then... are you the famous Resentful Man?

761
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,490
I do live in Gyeongwoonjae.

762
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:13,490
Wow, I really wished to meet you. I never knew you were so close.

763
01:00:13,490 --> 01:00:15,980
You are less handsome than the rumors,

764
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,980
but you are much more normal than I expected.

765
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:28,720
I cannot even get angry because of this damned intermittent chest pain.

766
01:00:29,940 --> 01:00:32,710
- Are you okay? 
 - Three steps!

767
01:00:32,710 --> 01:00:34,460
Move away!

768
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,000
Do not mind me.

769
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,560
I think everyone has introduced themselves,

770
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:41,010
so move on to explaining the plan.

771
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:46,680
Goodness... way to hold a grudge...

772
01:00:54,020 --> 01:00:58,780
First, thank you for participating in the matchmaking mission of Master Maeng's daughters.

773
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:04,030
Our job is to get rid of the false rumor about Lady Ha Na.

774
01:01:04,030 --> 01:01:06,280
I have a question!

775
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:11,720
Is the scholar number 23 next to my drawing my match?

776
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,890
That is right. You can meet him on May 5th.

777
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:18,730
He is a kind Hanyang scholar, so you should like him.

778
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:24,240
Stop getting distracted, and quickly tell us the method.

779
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,950
There is a saying, "You stop rumors with new rumors."

780
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:33,420
We must tell people the truth and turn the false rumor into a commendable story

781
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,090
and even punish the most vicious murderer as well.

782
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,900
Who would believe the words of a merchant?

783
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,120
The murderer is someone with great power. You will be executed for slander.

784
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,810

785
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:48,580
G-Gosh, Yeojudaek, you should not take it that far...

786
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:53,230
Not me. The one who will spread the truth would be this person.

787
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,810
Y-You're telling me to go tell the government office?

788
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:04,560
This is different from what I was told!

789
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:08,370
You said you would only punish the culprit without harming others. How could you...

790
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:11,080
make Lady Sam Soon do such a terrible thing?

791
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:13,030
W-Well, that is...

792
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:17,040
P-Please d-do not yell...

793
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:19,030
Do not yell...

794
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,060
M-My...

795
01:02:24,290 --> 01:02:26,230
my h-heart...

796
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Your Excellency!

797
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,110
Please wake up!

798
01:02:55,970 --> 01:02:58,840

799
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:02,500
â™«  Strange emotions fill me and confuse me  â™«

800
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:08,070
â™«  Because of you, because of you, I've got a lot on my mind  â™«

801
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:11,270
â™«  Love is falling again, love is coming to me again  â™«

802
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:14,250
â™«  My heart is racing by itself  â™«

803
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:18,080
â™«  Because of you, because of you, I guess this is love  â™«

804
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,440
  Today is the day to enter the palace.

805
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,680
  I am very open-minded in those regards.

806
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:22,980
  Yes, of course.

807
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,190
  He fell for a woman, head over heelsâ€”

808
01:03:25,190 --> 01:03:29,630
  By the way, the Left State Minister has no idea. Right?

809
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:31,000
 He ran away!

810
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,890
  Did you say the crown prince got kidnapped?

811
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:36,590
  I shall change false rumors about Lady Ha Na into a commendable story.

812
01:03:36,590 --> 01:03:37,750
  How, you may ask?

813
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:39,870
  The murderer in this novel...

814
01:03:39,870 --> 01:03:40,850
  Who, you may ask?

815
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,510
  Are you in your right mind?

816
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:44,970
  I know of a way to punish the Defense Minister.

817
01:03:44,970 --> 01:03:47,980
  W-will that not be... a-a bit dangerous for Yeojudaek?

818
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:50,690
  I will kill you for good this time.

819
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:56,330
â™«  I am falling for you, I wonder if you know how I feel  â™«

820
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:04,490

821
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,210
