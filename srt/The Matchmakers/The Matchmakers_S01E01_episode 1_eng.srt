1
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,420

2
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,540

3
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:47,060

4
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,620
 One out of 10,000 people are born with the ability to recognize nuptial ties and

5
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,130
 people with this special ability existed in all ages.

6
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,510
 They were priests in the ancient times and

7
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,950
 they were called matchmakers in Silla.  
 (One of the three ancient kingdoms of Korea)

8
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,850
 They were known to have possessed great power and wealth.

9
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:33,750

10
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,490
 If you read Memorabilia of the Three Kingdom's separate volume on sorcerers,

11
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,390
 most matchmakers who had great influence over Goryeo were women.

12
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:46,730
 But they started disappearing as Joseon rose because of its Confucian social order.

13
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:51,760
 Their method of recognizing nuptial ties is unknown as it is not recorded.

14
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,310
 Even among matchmakers, those born more powerful than others

15
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,470
 would end up matching people without even realizing it.

16
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,520

17
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:47,800
 Matchmakers were known as sorcerers of loneliness, not love, by the people of Silla.

18
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,830
 This is because people who marry matchmakers live short lives without exception.

19
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:59,770
 Which is why many matchmakers are widows.

20
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:10,300

Couples I match up live happily and have many children.

21
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,800
So, families with daughters tend to come to me more often.

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,680
I can just see it.

23
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,250
Whether they are a match or not.

24
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:23,560
You can say I was born with the ability to recognize fate.

25
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:31,860

26
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:53,600
He is Shim Jeong Woo, who took first place in the Year of Yellow Rat's state exam.

27
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,420
I heard you are the youngest first place since Joseon was found.

28
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,980
And his looks are also just as great.

29
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,370
Yes, he scored much better than second place, too.

30
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,740
So we were also surprised while judging.

31
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,630
Oh, is that so?

32
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,870
Shim Jeong Woo, this year's first-place,

33
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:26,860
is to be appointed as deputy mayor at Pyeongyangbu, which is vacant at the moment.

34
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,520
Reflect on your young, innovative thoughts and do great things.

35
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,740
Your Majesty, that is too great of an appointment—

36
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,750
I will serve Your Majesty's words and turn the chaotic Pyeongyangbu into

37
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:48,420
a corruption-free city with my brilliance and ingenuity, Your Majesty.

38
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,240
Yes, go ahead.

39
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,370
Young ones these days just do not know how to be humble. Gosh.

40
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,720
Getting a high position at a young age has been said

41
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,620
to be the worst of the three misfortunes in life.

42
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,980
Watch your behavior so as not to buy unwarranted jealousy.

43
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,570
Rather than become a lowly third place at an old age,

44
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:46,880
I think living in misfortune with a high position at a young age is not bad.

45
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,570
Is that also because I am too young to know better?

46
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:19,520
Princess, you cannot be here.

47
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,460
Princess.

48
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,720
Princess!

49
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,390
 Why would I marry the princess?

50
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:30,130
I am bound to leave for Pyeongyangbu tomorrow, according to His Majesty's order.

51
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,640
A prince cannot take public office.

52
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:37,940
That position is assigned to In Hyeon now.

53
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:42,190
His Majesty will give you a big house in Bukchon as a wedding gift and

54
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,740
your brother will receive a public office.

55
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,360
So this is a great opportunity for you and your family.

56
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,380
Also, you will become a member of the Royal Family,

57
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,750
which will be a great support for us, Dongno Party.

58
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,960
Of course. It is all thanks to your help, Your Excellency.

59
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,150
If it is such a great opportunity, your unmarried second son,

60
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,500
Brother In Gook, can become a prince.

61
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,050
The princess has chosen you.

62
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,230
Book of Rites said marriage is taking the good parts of the two families,

63
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,830
serving the ancestors and continuing the lineage.

64
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:23,860
This means marriage is a matter between families.

65
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,710
So how can the princess decide who becomes prince, only according to her liking?

66
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,500
This is against the rites.

67
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,010
That is enough.

68
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:34,770
The marriage between you and princess is my will.

69
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,690
So, just submit and obey.

70
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:41,030
F-Father, do you not know my dream is to become Chief State Minister?

71
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:44,840
I will never become a prince who cannot take public office!

72
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:56,250
Are you happy to receive a big house in Bukchon by selling your son?

73
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,100
Watch what you say to Father!

74
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,530
Brother, you are unintelligent and greedy,

75
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,340
so you are easily prone to becoming a corrupt official.

76
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,630
W-What did you say?

77
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,520
Mark my words,

78
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,210
if you want to keep the position you got by selling your younger brother for a long time.

79
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,310
Bride and Groom, bow to each other.

80
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,630
Bride, bow to your right.

81
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,360
Groom, bow once to the bride.

82
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,420
- Princess! Princess! 
  - Princess!

83
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,450
 - Princess !
 - Princess!

84
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,610
 Princess!

85
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,740
Her Highness has passed away.

86
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:03,960
Her Highness passed away even before this sign board from His Majesty was put on.

87
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,760
How unfortunate.

88
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,630
She fainted during the wedding ceremony.

89
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:09,900
Wait, so they could not even spend the first night together?

90
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,700
That is right.

91
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,850
He is a complete widow of a prince.

92
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,390
A prince cannot even remarry or take in concubines.

93
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:21,430
What is the use of this gigantic house?

94
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,060

95
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,840

96
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640

97
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,920

98
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,580

99
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,900

100
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,190

101
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:49,300

102
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,810
It looks this beautiful from the outside.

103
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,870
Just how beautiful would it be inside?

104
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,970
- Goodness, you are here? 
 - Hello.

105
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,600
They are sure to prohibit marriages next month,

106
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
so it is a matter of time now.

107
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,360
So make sure to remember, everyone.

108
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,630
Let us share any information you have instead of holding onto

109
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,410
all of them for yourself and fail like last time.

110
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,150
My, I said I understand!

111
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,390
How long will you talk about that?

112
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:34,180
By the way, marriage prohibitions only last about a month. Right?

113
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,830
- Why are you so... 
 - Serious about it?

114
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,840
Because most families have to report their virgin daughters during marriage prohibition.

115
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,610
I know that, too.

116
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:48,120
But marriage prohibition is short, and it is a good thing to be chosen as a princess consort.

117
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,280
Are you from the countryside or something?

118
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,630
It's N.K.J.

119
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,140
N.K.J.?

120
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:03,900
It means the next king is Prince Jin Seong, Left State Minister's nephew, anyway.

121
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,960
Which means, even if you get married to the current crown prince, who is young and sick,

122
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,870
you are bound to become a deposed princess consort.

123
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:13,420
So, who would want their daughters to end up in that mess?

124
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,190
So, families with daughters will rush to engage their daughters to someone

125
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:20,120
before marriage prohibition, so we will be busy to set them up.

126
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,130
And we just have to strike the iron while it is hot.

127
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,300
There will not be a marriage prohibition this year.

128
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,790
What are you saying?

129
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:34,080
A palace maid I know said it is certain.

130
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,050
According to my intel, there will not be a marriage prohibition this year.

131
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:42,710
So do not embarrass yourselves trying to rush matchmaking for that excuse.

132
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,610
She is so awesome.

133
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,260
Who is that woman?

134
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,330
Awesome, my foot.

135
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,310
But if Yeojudaek is saying so, it means it is not happening. Right? 
  (A woman from Yeoju)

136
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,870
Exactly. Yeojudaek never misses.

137
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,760
Yeojudaek?

138
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,740
 That woman is the guaranteed sell-out who only serves scholar-officials of Bukchon,

139
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,310
the goddess of matchmaking. Right?

140
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,690
God, my foot.

141
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,950
Where are you going?

142
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,630
She said there is no marriage prohibition.

143
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:16,380
I need to go sell, then. Gosh, move it.

144
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,970
You will do as Yeojudaek says, anyway.

145
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:21,700
Gosh, wait for me!

146
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,720
Are you saying we need to postpone

147
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,310
Crown Prince's marriage because of the virgin ghost story?

148
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,020
Your Majesty,

149
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,610
there are record-high numbers of old maidens and bachelors in Hanseongbu right now.

150
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,400

151
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,440
What?

152
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,810
The virgin ghost story that spread within the capital is also

153
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,550
based on a virgin woman who took her own life out of pessimism.

154
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,140
So, I am concerned that her resentment will harm the nation's energy.

155
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,810
The untimely drought lately is also—

156
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,410
Are you saying the virgin women's resentments caused the drought?

157
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,610
W-Well, the thing is...

158
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:02,630
I was trying to say...

159
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,370
Because Heavens' way is too profound to be understood—

160
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,410
So what is your point, Minister of Defense?

161
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,580
Pardon?

162
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,800
R-Right, the point...

163
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,150
So what I am saying is...

164
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,830
W-Where, no— When men and women are like that, the nation's energy—

165
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,400
- What is he saying? 
 - Your Majesty.

166
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:29,250
The previous kings regulated getting married late because

167
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,790
neglecting young people who missed their marriable ages

168
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,120
caused catastrophes due to the broken balance between yin and yang.

169
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,920
We cannot say the recent drought is totally irrelevant to late marriages.

170
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,100
What you are saying is right, Left State Minister.

171
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,200
But it is not like the issues of old maidens and bachelors suddenly came upon us.

172
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,090
And we are discussing the crown prince's marriage right now.

173
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,280
That is why I am telling you this.

174
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,060
While a ghost story about a woman, who died because she could not get married, is spreading,

175
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,820
if there is a marriage prohibition for the young crown prince's marriage on top of that,

176
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:02,180
women within the capital cannot marry even if they want to.

177
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,490
That is only for a—

178
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:07,810
Although marriage prohibition is indeed temporary,

179
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:12,020
it has a very significant symbolic meaning.

180
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,700
When we should encourage people to marry, how could the country prohibit marriages?

181
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,610
It is irrational and impractical.

182
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:21,760
Please reconsider your decision.

183
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:25,420
 Please reconsider your decision.

184
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,430
They delayed the crown prince's marriage last year, saying he was too young.

185
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,720
And this year, they bring up an old issue of the old maidens and bachelors?

186
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,580
How outrageous.

187
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,340
Left State Minister is certainly stalling for time since he supports Prince Jin Seong.

188
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,770
But the crown prince's marriage seems difficult this year.

189
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,590
No!

190
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:01,180
I will marry off the crown prince by June as planned, and

191
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,560
obtain the crown prince's appointment letter in August when the ambassador goes to the Ming Dynasty.

192
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:10,000
- However— 
 - You think they will let Crown Prince marry next year?

193
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,920
I cannot delay it any longer.

194
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:16,350
Find a reason to marry off the crown prince by June.

195
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:18,350
Without fail.

196
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,790
It will not be easy to find a reason.

197
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,700
Even the previous king could not solve the issue of old maidens and bachelors.

198
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,920

199
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,880
It is still not over.

200
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,610
The crown prince's marriage is never going to happen now.

201
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,060
We cannot stop the crown prince's marriage next year with the virgin ghost story.

202
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:44,860
If the crown prince marries and gives birth to a son,

203
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:48,820
Prince Jin Seong's kingship becomes more difficult to realize.

204
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,470
So, we must get rid of the root of the problem within this year.

205
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:54,620
You want to get rid of the crown prince. Right?

206
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,340
Alas, Minister of Defense.

207
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,330
Watch your mouth, please.

208
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:09,170
I am a king who cannot even marry off my son as I wish.

209
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:12,730
I am embarrassed to face you, My Queen.

210
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,570
I did not request to see you to get an apology.

211
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,740
I think I found the person who will make the crown prince's marriage happen.

212
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,320
What?

213
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,060
Who is this person?

214
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,050
He is the Resentful Man.

215
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,700
The Resentful Man?

216
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,690
I also heard from Court Lady Choi recently.

217
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:45,720
You have no idea who His Excellency is. Why be so fearless and stare at him?

218
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,340
I was just looking because he is so handsome.

219
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,600
Who is he?

220
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:22,400
His Excellency is the most resentful man in Joseon, His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

221
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,720
 He was forced to be a widower for eight years because

222
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,910
 the princess passed away on the day of the wedding.

223
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:32,320
 The one who is living like a monk, except he gets to eat meat?

224
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:46,370

"Letter of Petition."

225
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,630
 What is marriage?

226
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,590
 Just as the name suggests, it means

227
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,310
 the groom marries the bride at her house in the evening.

228
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:01,080
 And it means the bride goes to her in-law's house with her groom.

229
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,450
 In the last year, the Year of Yellow Rat, I, Shim Jeong Woo,

230
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,470
 came to the palace to marry the princess.

231
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,140
 But the princess did not come to my family's house with me.

232
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,670
 Under the said circumstances, this humble one was made a prince.

233
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:19,200
 But to be treated as a prince, getting fed and clothed

234
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,080
 by the country, is an unjust matter.

235
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,840
 Therefore, I appeal for the annulment of my marriage to the princess to correct what is unjust.

236
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,250
Consistently for eight years. You just do not get tired.

237
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:47,860
Regardless of how long it might take, correcting what is wrong is a scholar's path.

238
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,930
It is just as you say.

239
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,020
I have misspoke.

240
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,710
Give me a brush and paper.

241
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,050
For what purpose?

242
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,880
It looks like appealing your neglect of duty is more urgent than my petition.

243
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,500
I must write it and send it at once.

244
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,300
- How can you say a slip of the tongue is neglect of duty? 
 - Now, now!

245
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:14,010
Are you thinking I am being petty and making a big deal out of what you said?

246
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,370
That is not it.

247
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,010
Of course, what you said is punishable.

248
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,180
But looking at your attire, you are not wearing your peaked cap correctly,

249
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,200
daring to wear a jade ring, which only junior third ranks and above can wear,

250
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,370
and your belt is supposed to be a finger's distance from your navel.

251
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,430
But yours is hanging as low as your knee.

252
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:34,870
Hygiene is a given for official attire, but you have dried ink on your sleeves.

253
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,010
How can I overlook it when the situation is this bad?

254
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:42,390
Bring me a brush and paper.

255
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,490
 He has memorized all regulations and conducts of Joseon,

256
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:52,210
 so if things go wrong, he can kick you out of the palace just for having looked at him.

257
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,180
 You can say he is a walking flesh of resentment.

258
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:02,570
Therefore, it is best not to be seen by His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

259
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:09,680
That is what I told an apprentice palace lady today who came into the palace a few days ago.

260
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,920
The Resentful Man?

261
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:20,420
That is a very fitting nickname for Prince Gyeongwoonjae.

262
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,730
The Resentful...!

263
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,570
They say Prince Gyeong knows everything.

264
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:31,510
So, could he not find a reason to marry off the crown prince as well?

265
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,160
Yes...

266
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:40,530
The queen, who knows nothing about politics, must have been so frustrated

267
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,260
to ask Prince Gyeong to find a reason.

268
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,960
Your Majesty.

269
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:50,580
I think Her Highness the Queen's idea is the best strategy.

270
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,800
Even you are saying that?

271
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,470
Prince Gyeong is a core individual of the Dongno Party along with the left state minister.

272
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,330
That is correct, but it turns out the virgin ghost story

273
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,770
Left State Minister used to stop the crown prince's marriage was Prince Gyeong's idea.

274
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,380
What did you say?

275
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,260
That is why Shim Myeong Woo, the prince's brother,

276
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:16,250
was a candidate for spring pardons that the left state minister submitted.

277
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,950
How brazen. Go to him right now—

278
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,290
That is all the more reason why he is the perfect person.

279
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,520
Since Prince Gyeongwoonjae excels at his studies, he will surely be able to

280
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,380
come up with a reason to marry off the crown prince, as the queen said.

281
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,540
Even if he fails,

282
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,180
if you blame the left state minister, the party's leader,

283
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:38,790
would you not be able to shake the influence of the Dongno Party?

284
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,460
Whoa.

285
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,770
All right.

286
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,630
Why is my ear so itchy?

287
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,650
My goodness.

288
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,160
Oh Bong!

289
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,200
You took a while today.

290
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,460
I had to spend some time weeding out incompetent officials.

291
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,600
Let us go to the merchants' inn.

292
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,170
 Madam, the peddler is here.

293
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:30,040
Since I am now in-laws with the principal of Sungkyunkwan,

294
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,160
I can put down those women who are prideful of how good their families were

295
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:38,470
in Goryeo when they don't even have money.

296
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,190
You got a deal. I will buy all of the foundations you brought.

297
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:49,490
Thank you.

298
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,980
So, what about your daughter?

299
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,900
I told her to come over, so she will be here soon.

300
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,670
Welcome.

301
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,410
 How unfortunate.

302
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,030
 She is trying to marry off her daughter on a pile of wealth

303
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:16,050
 into a renowned family so her son can have a connection for success.

304
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:20,140
 But this family's daughter is having a secret love affair at the mill.

305
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:25,270
 That is why the face of this bride-to-be looks so terrible.

306
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:30,000
 If she is timid enough to wear that tacky hair ribbon her mother chose for her,

307
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,490
 she surely could not have rebelled against the marriage.

308
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,190
Although you are only filling in the rest for a marriage I arranged myself,

309
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:41,030
I will be counting on you.

310
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:45,830
 I do not think I can just fill in the rest.

311
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:56,210
So, did you bring the sajudanja of Scholar Song's daughter? 
  (The groom sends the date of his birth on a blank sheet to the home of the bride-to-be)

312
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:09,730
I have a request to make before that.

313
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,620
Could I meet your son, please?

314
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:17,950
I did hear the rumor that you look at people's faces and connect people.

315
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:20,840
But this marriage has been arranged between the families already.

316
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,760
So I think we can skip that process since you are only for show.

317
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:31,160
 I know you are taking in Scholar Song's daughter for his wealth since he is a new rich.

318
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,010
 However, I do not do matchmaking where I only match the families.

319
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:41,920
Before coming into the inner courts, I was surprised when I saw His Lordship coming out.

320
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,280
I saw a character as fragile as porcelain.

321
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:51,130
I wondered how he became the principal with such a character,

322
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:54,390
but I realized His Lordship was able to get to his position

323
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,580
because of your iron—

324
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:02,130
A-All thanks to your wise assistance in the household.

325
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:03,780
Do not even mention it.

326
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,400
He is a man with a heart of paper.

327
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,460
Whenever he is told off outside, he comes home all ragged.

328
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:16,540
Mending his heart and making him into a principal, I really had...

329
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:22,400
You must have had a really hard time, Madam.

330
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,490
You understood my hardships at once like this.

331
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:28,770
You want to see my son?

332
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,350
Is anyone there?

333
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:50,040
Stand still in that position for a moment.

334
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,060
 He looks great, and he is smart enough to enter Sungkyunkwan at 19.

335
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,290
 He is surely Hanyang's best husband material.

336
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,770
Mother, what is the matter?

337
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:18,190
You should forget this marriage.

338
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,630
Forget it? I spent so much money on this marriage!

339
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:28,710
Madam, the principal's son, is a traditional mother's boy.

340
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,700
- Was it bad? 
 - Very bad.

341
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,020
If you marry your daughter off into his family, he will surely take your family's wealth.

342
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,620
But your son will not benefit at all from them.

343
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,740
 It's a lie.

344
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,160
 What I am certain of is that when a man and a woman, controlled by their mothers, meet,

345
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,740
 they will end up miserable.

346
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,610
I already told everyone we were becoming in-laws with the principal,

347
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:01,320
so canceling now is like breaking off the engagement.

348
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:05,580
Most crucially, if your daughter marries their son,

349
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,240
she will not be able to have a child.

350
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,770
That can never do! Never.

351
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,290
 Do madams really believe such bluffs?

352
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,560
My reasoning is almost as good as a shaman. How could they not believe it?

353
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:27,320
Madam, please put it down while talking so you do not break another one.

354
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:31,050
Okay, then.

355
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,300
But they called you only for justification after they arranged it this time.

356
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:43,260
Yes, I thought I was going to make easy money using my fame this time.

357
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:47,980
However, Scholar Song's daughter has a lover behind her mother's back.

358
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,760
It would be a different story if I did not know.

359
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,950
Her heart is elsewhere, so she has no love for him.

360
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:57,410
How can I match her with a young master who is not even her match?

361
00:30:57,410 --> 00:30:59,850
Does love feed you?

362
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,460
They are all arranged marriages.

363
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,800
Bok Hee, you would marry someone as long as they are rich, huh?

364
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,520
Why would I? I am not even a noble.

365
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,730
Gosh! How clever.

366
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,860
W-Wait! Is your chest hurting again?

367
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,000
It is fine if I do not look. Let us get out of here quickly.

368
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,430
Y-Yes.

369
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,860
- Geez. 
 - Hurry.

370
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,090
C-Come, come.

371
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,320
 So handsome!

372
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:52,630
 Did this woman protect me just now?

373
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:56,360
You almost ran into the chest.

374
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,870
All right, then.

375
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,670
- Good work. 
 - Thank you.

376
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,780
Take care now!

377
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,220
Goodness, welcome.

378
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,760
What book are you looking for this time?

379
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,360
It is not a book this time.

380
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,470

Gold silkworm's poison? What is this for?

381
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:50,330
It is a poison that comes out on Seuideukhyobang you got for me last time. 
  (A medical book)

382
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:55,520
Gosh, we do not deal with poison.

383
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,200
Did you not say you could get me whatever exists in the Ming Dynasty?

384
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,930
It does not matter how much it takes, so see if you can get it for me.

385
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,500
Gold silkworm's poison.

386
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,500
Madam's Private Life?

387
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,790
Written by Hwa Rok? 
  (Means sika deer)

388
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,830
Sika deer?

389
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,030
What a lowly and immature pen name.

390
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,460
 Madam sighed while looking at a flower in the corner of her yard.

391
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,870
 She sadly had to hide her identity and stay home

392
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:05,980
 because Hanyang was in commotion due to the rebellion.

393
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:09,760
 Through Madam's thin, unlined ramie jacket came in flowery scents.

394
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,660
 He hugged Madam in a rush.

395
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,860
 Madam's faint moaning spread and...

396
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:18,920
 it soon became quiet as if they had promised.

397
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,660
E-Excuse...

398
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:47,330
P-Pardon...

399
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:55,660
Dear husband?

400
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,040
 The sound of faint moaning filled the yard...

401
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,180
Oh, gosh!

402
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,340
Why are you reading such a thing?

403
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,090
What book is that?

404
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,510
It is a shoddy adult-rated novel women read.

405
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:10,780
I must find out who the author is.

406
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:15,570
By chance, do you like adult-rated novels?

407
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,380
How dare you! No way.

408
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:24,060
Judging by the scholar's attire in this story, he seems like a high-ranking official,

409
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,070
but he is seeking out the women's quarters in the morning instead of doing his job.

410
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,570
It is clear the author is mocking the nobility,

411
00:37:30,570 --> 00:37:33,160
so I must report this to the authorities and have him punished.

412
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,400
Sir, this book does not even deserve such attention.

413
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,640
I will judge whether it is deserving or not after reading the rest.

414
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,420
What do you mean by that?

415
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:47,190
If the novel ends by saying it was a foolish woman's dream, I will not be able to report it.

416
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:48,630
Gosh, seriously.

417
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,300
Why are you investigating this fictional novel

418
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,610
as if it was a real story?

419
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,820
Also, how could you assume from just the picture that it is morning?

420
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,400
In that novel...

421
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,560
well... um...

422
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,980
Seeing how morning glories have blossomed, it must be before 9 a.m.

423
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,900
Are you sure you mistook an apricot blossom?

424
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:26,150
Come now! It is difficult to mistake the two because they have very different leaves.

425
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,900
You have good eyes for no good reason.

426
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:34,990
An adult-rated novel is usually exaggerated.

427
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:39,390
So, you can think the pictures are also exaggerated.

428
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,600
Even if it's a made-up story, it must have a basis in reality.

429
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,520
I must find out and learn the intention of the author.

430
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:53,800
What an annoying prat...

431
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,480
W-What...

432
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,740
What did you just say?

433
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,700
I said you are too serious.

434
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,800
Which merchants inn are you affiliated with?

435
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,420
Tell me your name and age.

436
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,190
Seeing how you are uselessly seeking the source and meaning of a made-up story,

437
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:19,420
you must be a high-ranking noble.

438
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,610
Why...

439
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,590
are you drawing near to me?

440
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,730
Why are you harassing a married merchant?

441
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,600
Harassing? What nonsense!

442
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,930
Do you know who I am?

443
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,850
I do not know who you are.

444
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:45,520
But you are trying to get my personal info, though I have nothing to do with this book's author.

445
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,330
I cannot help but mistakenly think that you fell for me.

446
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,700
Fell for you...

447
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,640
Oh, my.

448
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,260
The hiccups of truth?

449
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:00,410
I guess it was not a mistake?

450
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,140
So vulgar.

451
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,260
No—

452
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,950
How dare he try to defeat me when he has never courted a woman before?

453
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:09,820
That is cute.

454
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,700
No.

455
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,670
You are mistaken. Wait.

456
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:25,040
Did you see where a merchant who just came out went?

457
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,290
Oh Bong!

458
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,570
You will go back home now. Right?

459
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,450
What do you do at night these days that you keep nodding off?

460
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,640
I recently got married, so take it easy on me.

461
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,080
What connection is there between getting married and nodding off all the time?

462
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,250
You do not know the connection. Right? That is all right.

463
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:53,820
What is with that blasphemous look...

464
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,860
Does your heart hurt again?

465
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,220
Let us...

466
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:02,170
Let us hurry home.

467
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:03,790
I must rest.

468
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:05,060
Okay.

469
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,250
Move.

470
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:09,630
Who upset my master again?

471
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,640

472
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,930
I had many days when I could not eat or sleep well,

473
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:32,020
but ever since I started reading these illustrated novels by Hwa Rok, I have gotten much better.

474
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,550
That is a relief.

475
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:40,420
By chance, have you ever met Hwa Rok in person?

476
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:45,830
It may seem like I am bragging, but I pretty much raised Hwa Rok.

477
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,110
I even came up with the pen name Hwa Rok.

478
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:52,340
I see. What kind of scholar is Hwa Rok?

479
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,290
Seeing how he understands the feelings of a woman this well,

480
00:41:55,290 --> 00:42:00,010
he must be a very sensitive and dignified man.

481
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,150
Damn it.

482
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,140
 Rather than dignified...

483
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:22,880
he is close to being mysterious.

484
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,250
Mysterious...

485
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,450
I will drop by five days later.

486
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,000
Oh, and try using the makeup I brought you.

487
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,930
Who will I put on the makeup for?

488
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:43,550
For yourself, Madam.

489
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:57,430
Madam, I brought hulled barley from Kim's place.

490
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,740
Please open the granary.

491
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,610
Wait just a moment.

492
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,270
Yes.

493
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,470
- Let us go. 
  - Rather than His Excellency, who is always out and about,

494
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,570
 those two look much better together.

495
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,790
 If there is a next life, I hope you two meet as the same class and share love.

496
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:32,820
It is so pretty.

497
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,810
Gosh, I am late!

498
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:19,640
Here. Check it.

499
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,090
Also, starting next time, pay me in advance for something this urgent.

500
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,760
I want to pay you in advance, too.

501
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,020
The madam who gave it to me is so busy.

502
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,370
Oh, there she comes.

503
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:35,810
Is what I gave you in the morning done?

504
00:44:35,810 --> 00:44:37,180
Please check.

505
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,620
You probably did well.

506
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:40,550
I am busy, so I will be going.

507
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,160
What family is she from?

508
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:58,020
I heard something.

509
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:01,660
I do not know if I should tell you this or not.

510
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,180
Just tell me.

511
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,760
Damn it, what do I do?

512
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,450
Choon Sam's father supposedly saw the little madam near Woon Jong's place.

513
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,850
Madam, be careful.

514
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:16,280
Choon Sam's father probably saw it wrong.

515
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:21,040
How could my sister, who spends all day sewing in the annex, be at Woon Jong's place?

516
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:29,450
My Lady, I thought he probably saw wrong,

517
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:32,760
but I did not see her all day in the kitchen.

518
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,870
I am afraid the little madam's old habits are—

519
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:37,360
Make known our presence.

520
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,750
Yes, Madam.

521
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:42,760
Little Madam, Madam is here.

522
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,530
Goodness, was Choon Sam's father right?

523
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,940
  Why is she not responding?

524
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,480
Little Madam!

525
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,350
Let us go up.

526
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,980
Why is she not making any sounds?

527
00:46:09,130 --> 00:46:12,830
Sister said she felt a cold coming on. I think she fell asleep.

528
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:14,590
Mother, let us just go.

529
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:18,930
Gosh, our lady is so naive.

530
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:24,560
Just looking at it, you can tell she rolled up blankets in there.

531
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,650
Pull aside the blanket.

532
00:46:27,650 --> 00:46:29,710
Yes, Madam.

533
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:42,550
M-Mother?

534
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,560
When did you come in?

535
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:49,350
W-Why is she here?

536
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:53,060
Are you talking to me?

537
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:59,980
No, why were you lying there like a pile of blankets?

538
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:05,840
Why did you not make any sound when you were here?

539
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,700
The thing is...

540
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:13,650
I mustered up all my strength to make Father's and Geun Seok's clothes

541
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:17,240
while being really sick, and I passed out.

542
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,920
I see. Rest up for today,

543
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:42,680
and do not come tomorrow to greet us and sleep in.

544
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:46,060
But, Mother,

545
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:51,640
why did you come to the annex before the greeting time?

546
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:00,510
 Based on Mother's personality, she would not have come here by herself.

547
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:02,590
 The culprit is Sam Wol's mother.

548
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:07,790
 I must make sure she never incites Mother to come to the annex again.

549
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:09,810
The winter is past,

550
00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,490
and we need to change all the blankets, so I came to discuss it with you,

551
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,360
but since you are sick, rest for a few days

552
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,390
and we will just have to change all the blankets by the 20th of this month.

553
00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:21,880
Pardon?

554
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,350
The 20th of this month?

555
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:28,440
Well, rest up then.

556
00:48:38,610 --> 00:48:41,520
If it is the 20th of this month,

557
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:45,460
only eight days are left.

558
00:48:46,630 --> 00:48:50,370
I made things worse by misspeaking.

559
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:54,340
Next time, get your facts straight before telling me.

560
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:59,540
Have you come home from work?

561
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:03,490
I have something to discuss with you regarding Ye Jin's marriage.

562
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,390
Let us go inside.

563
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,040
Today was a close call.

564
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:29,030
I managed it well quickly.

565
00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:33,860
Now, shall I organize everything?

566
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:36,560
Goodness, goodness.

567
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:47,290
It is true Choon Sam's father saw you at Woon Jong's place.

568
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:51,130
What a relief.

569
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:59,950
Sister-in-law, you should have stopped Mother from coming to the annex.

570
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:03,220
Sam Wol's mother kept making a fuss, saying it was true.

571
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:07,540
I will find some fault to punish Sam Wol's mother.

572
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:09,670
Do not do that.

573
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:12,960
Sam Wol's mother probably did that to look good to Mother.

574
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,280
I just need to be more careful.

575
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:20,700
This sister is generous for useless things.

576
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:28,560
Why are you taking the risk to do the lowly job of matchmaking?

577
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,290
Because it makes my heart flutter?

578
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:38,320
I have no reason to get fluttery now as a widow.

579
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,980
And I should not get fluttery.

580
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:47,070
But when I make a good match,

581
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:51,510
the thought that they will live happily together

582
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,810
makes my heart flutter and gives me joy.

583
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,200
Most importantly, I can earn money.

584
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,110
There are plenty of people who are good at sewing if I pay them,

585
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:04,100
so it is better to pay someone to do the sewing for me

586
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,640
than for me to try doing it myself when I am not good at it.

587
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,630
Do not pretend to help me, and tell me what you want to say.

588
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:22,580
Anyway, you are so quick.

589
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,530
What?

590
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,640
You want me to break up your marriage talks?

591
00:51:27,640 --> 00:51:30,710
Yes. He is supposedly the junior deputy minister's son.

592
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,530
He is the type I hate.

593
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,760
Oh, if it is the junior deputy minister's son,

594
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,200
I have heard many rumors that he frequents courtesan houses.

595
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:43,200
How did you know he is the type you hate?

596
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:47,540
By chance, you did not loiter around his house to see his face. Right?

597
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:48,950
You are crazy, crazy!

598
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:53,130
If a rumor like that goes around, you will really have to marry him!

599
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,700
Are you crazy?

600
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,570
I also heard it as a rumor from Gae Dong.

601
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,130
You sure?

602
00:52:01,130 --> 00:52:04,240
I will become a minister's wife someday, like Mom.

603
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:08,310
So, I do not want to marry a playboy like him.

604
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,230
But...

605
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:16,930
still, how could I break up your marriage talks?

606
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:25,530
I do not know, but Yeojudaek, the goddess of matchmaking, would know. Right?

607
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:33,120
If you do not help me, I will tell Mother that you are going around as a matchmaker.

608
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,790
I am still your sister-in-law.

609
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,440
You are so scary.

610
00:52:53,000 --> 00:53:00,700
There are many books in the market that mock the nobility, like "The Madam's Private Life."

611
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:05,360
So why is Hanseongbu not cracking down on it?

612
00:53:14,070 --> 00:53:16,060
Of course!

613
00:53:16,060 --> 00:53:19,380
That is the proper example of a married couple.

614
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,760
 I report Hanseongbu's lack of action despite the spread of novels

615
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:43,690
 that mock officials among ignorant women.

616
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:47,170
 Also, the rude book peddler...

617
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:51,430
 I cannot help but mistakenly think that you fell for me.

618
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,140
What...

619
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:06,930
What is wrong with me?

620
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:18,600
 I report Hanseongbu's lack of action.

621
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,840
 Also, the rude book peddler—

622
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,760
 You fell for me?

623
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:26,740
 Also, the rude book peddler—

624
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:58,320
Goodness...

625
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:01,350
Did you stay up all night again writing a petition?

626
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:04,090
Gosh.

627
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:09,380
Due to an unusual chest pain, I could not sleep.

628
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,950
Goodness, goodness.

629
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:26,920
I lived all my life with chest pain,

630
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:30,690
but it was the first time I felt pain while I was alone.

631
00:55:30,690 --> 00:55:33,560
Were there any other unusual things?

632
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,730
Unusual things...

633
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:44,090
Every time I remembered what happened at 6:00 p.m. yesterday, my chest pain continued.

634
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:47,880
If it was 6:00 p.m., you were at the merchants inn.

635
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:50,070
What happened?

636
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:57,570
What happened was so vulgar and unfair that I did not even want to speak of it.

637
00:55:57,570 --> 00:56:03,640
This chest pain does not seem to be from your illness but by suduraesu?

638
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,660
Suduraesu? This is the first time I am hearing of this.

639
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:12,450
Suduraesu stands for Worry Pox Come Head.

640
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:17,400
It is a psychosomatic ailment caused when one's experience clashes with one's beliefs

641
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:23,180
and the resulting worry manifests as physical pain.

642
00:56:23,180 --> 00:56:25,590
- So it is due to your bad temper— 
 - Geez...

643
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,780
Here, here.

644
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:32,780
Chest pain and headaches are common symptoms.

645
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:39,610
So, it is a psychosomatic disorder caused by bodily imbalance.

646
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:41,780
Then I think I know the cure.

647
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:44,700
Oh Bong, let us go to the merchants' inn immediately.

648
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:46,430
Yes, okay.

649
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:48,140
Thank you.

650
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:02,830

651
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,790
Why?

652
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,890
Is it not good?

653
00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:11,890
Forget it. Do not tell me.

654
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,700
I will rewrite it for you.

655
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:17,390
Gosh, why would you rewrite it?

656
00:57:17,390 --> 00:57:20,720
The first book was fun,

657
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,420
but the sequel is even more fun.

658
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:24,830
Hwa Rok, you must be a genius!

659
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,780
Gosh, what do you mean, genius?

660
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:34,570
Well, which part was particularly fun?

661
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:36,990
Oh, everything was good,

662
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:40,890
but the part where the madam escapes from the Royal Investigation Bureau was—

663
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,600
 Oh, that Yeojudaek?

664
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,120
 I do not know when she might come.

665
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:53,390
For what reason are you looking for Yeojudaek?

666
00:57:53,390 --> 00:57:55,200
What is wrong with you?

667
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,820
Lower your voice.

668
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:58,380
Your voice rings, and it is bothering me.

669
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,210
I am sorry.

670
00:58:02,130 --> 00:58:04,630
I have something to say to that peddler.

671
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:10,120
If you tell me, I will deliver the message to Yeojudaek.

672
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,950
All this happened because of a foolish mistake,

673
00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,910
so my intentions may be distorted if I go through someone else.

674
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:21,440
So, I must tell her straight to her face.

675
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,570
You are going to meet her directly?

676
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:26,110
Why? Is that not okay?

677
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:30,280
I mean, it is the first time you are picking a fight with someone who is not a nobleman.

678
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,070
When did I ever pick a fight?

679
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:42,780
 In any case, I will wait here until that merchant comes.

680
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,950
 She may not come today...

681
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:47,740
Sir.

682
00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:50,460
Your Excellency, just a second.

683
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,920
Owner, let us talk for a bit.

684
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:09,000
You may not know who His Excellency is since he only buys

685
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:13,150
medical books from the Ming Dynasty, but I do not want to imagine

686
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:16,100
what His Excellency might do here if he does not meet that merchant.

687
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,160
Like what?

688
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,360
He will first file a complaint about a merchant who lends books that mock the government.

689
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,130
Then, you will start with 20 beatings.

690
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:26,510
That is just the law.

691
00:59:26,510 --> 00:59:29,540
So, if that peddler is not coming,

692
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:32,670
you should go find her and bring her immediately.

693
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:42,900
He is an even worse prat than I thought.

694
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,280
Do you know him?

695
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,740
I told you earlier.

696
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:50,390
The nerd who wants to report "The Madam's Private Life" for mocking the nobility.

697
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:53,120
Then, are you saying he's here to report me?

698
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,540
Do not worry.

699
00:59:54,540 --> 00:59:57,540
If he were to turn this over to the government, he would have gone there first.

700
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,100
Would he be looking for me here while threatening the owner?

701
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:04,050
I see. Then, why did he come?

702
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,390
Most likely...

703
01:00:05,390 --> 01:00:07,940
 Sir, this book does not even deserve such attention.

704
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:12,240
 I will judge whether it is deserving or not after reading the rest.

705
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,920
 What do you mean by that?

706
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:19,210
 If the novel ends by saying it was a foolish woman's dream, I will not be able to report it.

707
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,120
He is curious about the ending of your first volume of "The Madam's Private Life."

708
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:26,350
Things should be resolved once we give him that book.

709
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,400
Really?

710
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,630
Just trust me.

711
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,470
Meow.

712
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,470
Goodness, now that I think about it,

713
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:44,670
Yeojudaek should be here soon to return the book.

714
01:00:44,670 --> 01:00:46,160
He says she will be here soon.

715
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:48,340
I heard, too.

716
01:00:48,340 --> 01:00:51,140
It so happens that she is coming now!

717
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:04,590
I do not see anyone.

718
01:01:06,990 --> 01:01:09,550
Gosh!

719
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,980
You were looking for me?

720
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:17,000
Where did she come in from?

721
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:21,400
I heard you had something to tell me, Sir.

722
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,590
Please give us space.

723
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,630
Pardon?

724
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:31,490
Oh Bong, you also wait outside.

725
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:34,070
- Me, too? 
 - Hurry!

726
01:01:34,070 --> 01:01:36,980
Gosh, goodness.

727
01:01:48,350 --> 01:01:50,530
Please go ahead.

728
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:04,950
It so happens I have something to give you.

729
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,710
I...

730
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,090
I...

731
01:02:21,730 --> 01:02:24,040
have fallen in love with you.

732
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,850
Oh my god!

733
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,450
Gosh, this is crazy.

734
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:34,200
- Did he just confess to her? 
 - Yeah.

735
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,560

736
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:58,160
W-What did I just say?

737
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:03,230
You said you fell in love with me.

738
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,080
I misspoke because I am ill. Forget it.

739
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:09,160
What I want to tell you is that...

740
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:11,180
I am...

741
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:13,620
not in love with you.

742
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:17,280
Gosh, what is he saying?

743
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,880
What is this?

744
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,530
Why would you say such obvious things?

745
01:03:21,530 --> 01:03:26,060
Did you not insist that I was in love with you yesterday here?

746
01:03:26,060 --> 01:03:27,690
Pardon?

747
01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:31,480
 But you are trying to get my personal info, though I have nothing to do with this book's author.

748
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:35,280
 I cannot help but mistakenly think that you fell for me.

749
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:39,340
You looked for me just to say that to me?

750
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:43,900
Resolving that ridiculous misunderstanding is very important to me.

751
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:48,370
 Wow, I thought he was just an annoying prat, but he is a crazy bastard!

752
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,040
 Things will get worse if I get involved with him more.

753
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:52,380
 What's necessary is a humble attitude and a speedy apology.

754
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:54,690
I guess I was mistaken because I was in a rush that day.

755
01:03:54,690 --> 01:03:56,970
I am sorry for upsetting you.

756
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:01,540
I will change my mind and say you are not in love with me, Sir.

757
01:04:02,850 --> 01:04:04,290
All right.

758
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:10,460
To atone for my sin, I will never appear before you again. Bye then.

759
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:30,830
She does not have to go that far.

760
01:04:30,830 --> 01:04:32,760
Does your chest still hurt?

761
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,210
No.

762
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:38,340
Now that I have fixed my body-mind imbalance, I have no reason to hurt anymore.

763
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,350
- I do not think it is resolved... 
 - Come on...

764
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:47,580
The major criminal is here.

765
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,480
Tie him up.

766
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,350
Sirs, there must be a mistake.

767
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,620
How dare you!

768
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:02,350
If you knew who I was, you guys would know that what you are doing right now is a mistake.

769
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:05,400
His Excellency is in a very bad mood right now.

770
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,040
Looks like he will be fired.

771
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,490
Seeing your attire, you are an official in the Royal Investigative Bureau,

772
01:05:10,490 --> 01:05:13,980
and since you are taking only a few subordinates, it must be a secret mission.

773
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:18,690
It is a shame you would act so foolishly without recognizing who I am.

774
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:22,500
While you are doing this, the man you are chasing probably already gained over 2 miles on you.

775
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,850
Your sins—

776
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:39,530
 Your Excellency!

777
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:12,170
You are not a street thug. This is the Royal Investigative Bureau.

778
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:16,570
How could you do this without due process and order?

779
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:18,000
Do you know who I am?

780
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,200
Are you not Prince Gyeongwoonjae?

781
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:25,810
Doing this while knowing who I am is mocking the Royal Family!

782
01:06:25,810 --> 01:06:29,140
Who is the one mocking the Royal Family?

783
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:32,660
Who are you?

784
01:06:42,390 --> 01:06:47,610
Oh, Y-Your Majesty! Your Majesty.

785
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:56,280
I ordered him to arrest you on charges of mocking the Royal Family and deceiving me.

786
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,110
Your Majesty, what you are saying is baseless.

787
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:08,380
You knew that in the history of Joseon, the prince was never allowed to remarry,

788
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,250
and yet you wrote all these petitions to me!

789
01:07:10,250 --> 01:07:13,660
If that is not mocking the Royal Family, then what is?

790
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:15,870
That is a just petition—

791
01:07:15,870 --> 01:07:18,300
- Shim Jeong Woo. 
 - Yes?

792
01:07:19,340 --> 01:07:24,020
You should have been prepared for something like that when you married my daughter.

793
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:29,210
Why do you keep sending petitions when even women keep their chastity?

794
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:35,210
Pardon me, but the most recent petition was not asking to allow a prince to remarry,

795
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:40,670
but was saying my marriage to the princess was invalid based on the marriage rites recommended by the royal house.

796
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:44,530
Did you not read it, assuming...

797
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:49,410
it would be the same content?

798
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:51,010
What?

799
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,370
I did not know this,

800
01:07:57,370 --> 01:08:00,410
but you are the type to earn punishments.

801
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:03,500
Bring it.

802
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:05,310
Yes, Your Majesty.

803
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,450
Chief Royal Secretary...

804
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:25,500
Your Majesty, this is not in line with the criminal law.

805
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:31,190
You should let me receive a just interrogation later—

806
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:37,080
So you will stall for time, I see.

807
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:44,570
Then, you will get out of this by using your sly brain to come up with some good reason.

808
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:49,540
Just like how you used the old maid and bachelor issue to stop the crown prince's marriage.

809
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:52,420
How do you know that—

810
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:56,020
As expected, you gave the left state minister

811
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,430
a just reason for stopping the crown prince's marriage!

812
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:04,950
Hurry up and force this traitor to drink the poison!

813
01:09:04,950 --> 01:09:07,920
Yes, Your Majesty.

814
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:29,120

815
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,540

816
01:09:30,540 --> 01:09:37,400

817
01:09:37,400 --> 01:09:40,430
♫  Love is falling again, love is coming to me again  ♫

818
01:09:40,430 --> 01:09:44,890
♫  Strange emotions fill me and confuse me  ♫

819
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:48,090
  How could Your Excellency be a traitor? What is happening?

820
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:50,280
  My path to take public office has finally opened.

821
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:51,880
 Have you heard of the Old Ladies?

822
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,560
  It is not that we could not wed but rather decided not to.

823
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,150
  What's with that geezer?

824
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:59,430
  I intend to wed Master Maeng's three daughters in Namsan Village within two months.

825
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:03,100
  I never take requests from people who have a mind like you, Sir.

826
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,800
  Why is everyone treating me this way?

827
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,300
  Could you act as Yeojudaek just this one time?

828
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,320
 You will not be able to leave easily today.

829
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,660
 You will regret it.

830
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:13,240
  For a noblewoman, there is only one husband.

831
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,770
  I miss you, my dear husband.

832
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:21,650
♫  Awkward tone, different from your usual  ♫

833
01:10:30,390 --> 01:10:33,350
