I made up a story to madam that Choi Kyu told me about him.

But I have known Monk Socheon since we were in Pyongyang.

I dared...

14
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:27,938
to have one-sided feelings for him.

15
00:01:30,598 --> 00:01:32,137

Not even her grandparents were high-ranking government officials.

20
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:55,997
So can she really be a noble?

She is a noble.

Gosh, you sure are impatient.

28

Do you...

42
00:04:05,557 --> 00:04:06,858
remember me?

43
00:04:07,388 --> 00:04:08,627
Of course, I do.

44
00:04:09,328 --> 00:04:11,567
Did I not save you in the go board game?

45
00:04:12,367 --> 00:04:14,397
Oh, yes. You did.

46
00:04:16,937 --> 00:04:20,038

something is just too good.

55
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:25,867
Great. Amazing.

56
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:28,037
Those are not enough to express it.

57
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:30,898
I see. But for an unmarried lady to say such a word.

58
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:32,937

61
00:07:14,718 --> 00:07:17,747
Goodness. I was not talking about our heights.

What is with that face?

68
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:40,507
What? Did you think I would fail to get married?

69
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:45,228
You do know I am making all of your wedding blankets, yes?

70
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:48,687
Keep getting on the wrong side of me,

71
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,788
and I might sew up your blankets with a needle inside.

72
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:55,858

78
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:28,158
were there before me?

79
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,358
Let me think.

80
00:08:35,497 --> 00:08:36,597
Four.

81
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:38,727
I see.

82
00:08:46,737 --> 00:08:50,077
Oh, but they all ended as unrequited loves.

83
00:08:50,178 --> 00:08:51,977
We never even had a conversation.

84
00:08:52,947 --> 00:08:55,977
But did you not propose to me?

85
00:08:57,347 --> 00:08:59,717
Well, you see...

86
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:03,018
You are the first man I confessed to.

87
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:05,788
I am not lying.

88
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:11,258
You are my first in everything.

89
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:16,567
Your novel was the first that relieved me...

90
00:09:16,898 --> 00:09:18,668
from my real-life worries.

91
00:09:20,638 --> 00:09:23,008
You took my first kiss.

92
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:27,947
You were also the first to propose to me.

93
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:32,418
And you are the first...

94
00:09:34,248 --> 00:09:35,618
I have come to like...

95
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,987
to the point my heart hurts.

96
00:09:44,967 --> 00:09:46,327
Lieutenant.

97
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,498
Out of all the men I know,

98
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:52,066
including the male characters in my novels,

99
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,868
you are the coolest.

100
00:10:02,748 --> 00:10:04,847
It is my first time enjoying the May Festival.

101
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:07,817

102
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,317
Your first time?

103
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:15,456
What did you do during the May Festival until now?

104
00:10:15,457 --> 00:10:16,956
I hated crowded places,

105
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,467
so I was at home reading books alone.

106
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:22,398
That, too, is not as bad as you think it is.

107
00:10:24,768 --> 00:10:26,538
Since you came this year,

108
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:29,307
you should continue to do so starting next year.

109
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:35,309
My plan is to enjoy the May Festival with you from next year onwards.

110
00:10:40,118 --> 00:10:42,557
After marrying off all three of Erudite Maeng's daughters,

111
00:10:42,888 --> 00:10:44,788
I will no longer be the King's son-in-law.

112
00:10:47,057 --> 00:10:48,158
In other words,

113
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:50,428
I can become a government official...

114
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:52,128
and also marry.

115
00:10:58,837 --> 00:10:59,868
Take this.

Why did you do this?

At Sunhwa Temple,

126
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:29,768
I said I would handle my love sickness.

127
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:31,097
Was that...

128
00:11:32,337 --> 00:11:34,768
not about forgetting me?

129
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:40,178
That would have been so if you were not interested in me.

130
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,918
But now I know you also have feelings for me.

131
00:11:43,248 --> 00:11:44,548

132
00:11:45,947 --> 00:11:47,587
Can you do that?

133
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,428
- But... - Do not forget your dead husband.

134
00:11:57,528 --> 00:11:59,227
I could not forget the princess.

135
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,298

136
00:12:02,298 --> 00:12:04,868

140
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:16,977
not like me too?

just save me?

What?

151
00:13:47,408 --> 00:13:48,878
Why did I say that?

152
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:20,368
What is it?

153
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:24,008
What happened?

154
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:29,678
Darn it.

155
00:14:54,508 --> 00:14:55,577
Where did she go?

156
00:14:55,837 --> 00:14:57,638
I think she came this way.

157
00:14:57,908 --> 00:15:00,277
I know now is not the time,

158
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:02,118
but the answer to my proposal...

159
00:15:03,347 --> 00:15:04,378
Very well.

160
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:21,227
Stay still for a while.

162

163
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:28,837
I will protect you.

164
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:34,908
Do not dare come any closer.

165

This woman...

166
00:15:36,947 --> 00:15:38,118
is my wife...

167
00:16:14,717 --> 00:16:15,857
You...

168
00:16:17,957 --> 00:16:20,288
You cannot look at me...

169
00:16:22,057 --> 00:16:23,158
with that look anymore.

170
00:16:32,668 --> 00:16:33,707
Lady Yeoju?

171
00:16:35,437 --> 00:16:36,638
Why is she back already?

172
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:38,508
Oh, no.

173
00:16:40,048 --> 00:16:41,107
What...

174
00:16:48,148 --> 00:16:49,158
Run away.

175
00:16:49,418 --> 00:16:51,258
He is a slave hunter here to get you.

176
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:55,128
It is fine, my lady.

177
00:16:56,998 --> 00:16:58,057
I came back...

178
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,428
to Hanyang...

179
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:03,138
to see him.

180
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:06,768
What do you mean?

181
00:17:08,908 --> 00:17:09,908
My lord.

182
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:12,447
I am sorry.

183
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,578
- Because of me... - Tae Ran, as long as...

184
00:17:20,088 --> 00:17:21,447
you are alive, all is well.

185
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,568
If she is Lady Yeoju and the Tae Ran the slave hunter was after,

186
00:17:34,197 --> 00:17:35,197
who are you?

187
00:17:39,868 --> 00:17:40,937
Well...

188
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:46,977
Gosh.

189
00:17:49,547 --> 00:17:51,377
- What was that? - Lady Ha Na.

190
00:17:51,378 --> 00:17:52,717
You rascals.

191
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:55,517
The Crown Prince?

192
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:10,737
Get rid of them both.

193
00:18:31,287 --> 00:18:32,487
Freeze, all of you!

194
00:18:45,338 --> 00:18:47,467
Stay out of it and go on your way.

195
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:49,036
You will only get hurt.

196
00:18:49,037 --> 00:18:51,637
How dare you? You would not do this if you knew...

197
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:53,108
who that young master is.

198
00:18:53,648 --> 00:18:54,677
Step aside.

199
00:18:54,678 --> 00:18:56,918
I was going to let you walk away if you did not know.

200
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:58,447
You unlucky soul.

201
00:19:04,257 --> 00:19:05,287
No!

202
00:19:14,598 --> 00:19:17,137
My gosh. Are you all right?

203
00:19:17,138 --> 00:19:18,536
What...

204
00:19:18,537 --> 00:19:22,107
I... I think I am all right. Are you?

205
00:19:22,108 --> 00:19:23,678
I am fine.

206
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:55,138
Why you...

207
00:19:59,477 --> 00:20:01,608
Darn you. Back down.

208
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:03,918
You little...

209
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:16,527
You!

210
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:18,527
Do not move!

211
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:21,328
Run away.

212
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:23,297
Get out of here, fool!

213
00:20:23,398 --> 00:20:25,097
You punk.

214
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,168
You...

215
00:20:39,118 --> 00:20:40,247
Gosh.

216
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:44,757
Are you okay?

217
00:20:46,027 --> 00:20:48,487
I did not know you could use a sword.

218
00:20:49,098 --> 00:20:51,927
I read how to in my free time to keep you safe.

219
00:20:51,928 --> 00:20:54,527
This was the first time I actually held a sword.

220
00:20:57,098 --> 00:21:00,467
You taught yourself how to fight through books to protect me?

221
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:09,148
Were you hurt?

222
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:10,818
I am fine.

223
00:21:11,447 --> 00:21:12,848
Are you?

224
00:21:14,888 --> 00:21:17,658
Why on earth did you come here?

225
00:21:18,687 --> 00:21:21,658
You sent a letter telling me to come.

226
00:21:23,128 --> 00:21:26,668
I never sent such a letter.

227
00:21:30,568 --> 00:21:31,598
Crown...

228
00:21:32,537 --> 00:21:33,608
Are you all right?

229
00:21:34,207 --> 00:21:35,237
Yes.

230
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:48,786
I will take the young master home.

231
00:21:48,787 --> 00:21:49,918
Wait for me at the inn.

232
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,767
We are not yet done talking.

233
00:21:59,997 --> 00:22:01,557
Do not disappear claiming you are busy.

234
00:22:25,217 --> 00:22:27,828
I said he should not go,

235
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:30,226
but he said he would return within two hours.

236
00:22:30,227 --> 00:22:31,597
(1 Sijin: 2 hours)

237
00:22:31,598 --> 00:22:32,897
Send out the Palace Guard...

238
00:22:32,898 --> 00:22:34,227
- to find... - Your Majesty.

239
00:22:37,497 --> 00:22:39,408
Department of Justice's lieutenant is here.

240
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,907
Lord Gyeongunjae and the Crown Prince...

241
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,148
are on their way here.

242
00:22:49,918 --> 00:22:51,418
He is with Lord Gyeongunjae?

243
00:22:52,487 --> 00:22:53,787
You do not let me down.

244
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,328
Lord Gyeongunjae came to the palace with the Crown Prince.

245
00:23:01,957 --> 00:23:04,158
Lord Gyeongunjae is one of us.

246
00:23:04,957 --> 00:23:07,898
Did he switch sides to serve the Crown Prince?

247
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,967
So Hyun, we will not be found at fault, will we?

248
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:14,908
Do not worry.

249
00:23:16,878 --> 00:23:19,747
It is late. I must leave.

250
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,318
You can lower your arms.

251
00:23:34,957 --> 00:23:37,697
You fell into great danger when you last left the palace.

252
00:23:38,358 --> 00:23:40,068
And you snuck out in secret?

253
00:23:43,398 --> 00:23:46,467
What were you thinking, Crown Prince?

254
00:23:47,168 --> 00:23:48,408
It will not...

255
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:51,108
happen ever again.

256
00:23:51,338 --> 00:23:53,348
With Mount Nam Valley's Maeng Ha Na.

257
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:56,148
Have you been exchanging letters since?

258
00:23:56,618 --> 00:23:57,747
I asked her...

259
00:23:58,277 --> 00:24:02,088
to tell me about news going about town.

260
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:04,888
Even so,

261
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:08,928
I gave her hints that you had been in danger.

262
00:24:09,098 --> 00:24:11,197
The woman should be ashamed.

263
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:16,168
How could she write to you asking you to come see her?

264
00:24:16,598 --> 00:24:18,398
- I should... - Mother.

265
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:22,037
Lady Ha Na did nothing wrong.

266
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,848
She said she did not send this letter.

267
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:30,648
If you want to punish someone, punish me.

268
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,848
I cannot lose my only friend.

269
00:24:36,088 --> 00:24:37,118
Your friend?

270
00:24:37,457 --> 00:24:38,517
Lady Ha Na...

271
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:41,227
does not know I am the Crown Prince.

272
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:45,727
Lady Ha Na seemed to know who he was.

273
00:24:47,628 --> 00:24:49,167
She knew he was the Crown Prince...

274
00:24:49,168 --> 00:24:51,398
and wrote him to say he come and see her?

275
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,338
I do not think that is it.

276
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,276
If it were, she would not have...

277
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,678
risked her life to protect the Crown Prince.

278
00:25:01,378 --> 00:25:04,118
Someone knows he writes to Lady Ha Na,

279
00:25:04,447 --> 00:25:06,588
and to lure him out of the palace,

280
00:25:06,848 --> 00:25:09,888
they wrote a letter pretending to be Lady Ha Na.

281
00:25:11,118 --> 00:25:12,558
Do you have an idea who?

282
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,297
The thugs...

283
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:23,368
were sent away, so they will not be a problem.

284
00:25:27,537 --> 00:25:29,808
The problem is that it went wrong.

285
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,378
Why are you always...

286
00:25:33,047 --> 00:25:34,078
Yes.

287
00:25:34,878 --> 00:25:35,878
He is right.

288
00:25:36,477 --> 00:25:38,878
Even if Lord Gyeongunjae got in the way,

289
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:42,216
not being able to take out that nerd?

290
00:25:42,217 --> 00:25:43,757
Lord Gyeongunjae was not alone!

291
00:25:44,658 --> 00:25:47,128
He was with a skilled fighter.

292
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,628
Do you think...

293
00:25:50,457 --> 00:25:52,967
Lord Gyeongunjae knew about it and was prepared?

294
00:25:53,767 --> 00:25:55,668
If so, the Palace Guard would have been there.

295
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:58,868
He would not have let the crown prince leave the palace.

296
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:01,168
The point is,

297
00:26:01,908 --> 00:26:04,437
now that Lord Gyeongunjae clearly took sides with the King,

298
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:07,108
we cannot just sit and watch.

299
00:26:11,648 --> 00:26:14,148
It must be the same people...

300
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:16,456
who poisoned the Crown Prince's court maid...

301
00:26:16,457 --> 00:26:18,016
and made the Crown Prince...

302
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:20,287
leave the palace so they could kidnap him.

303
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:24,928
Is the court maid still unwell?

304
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:26,828
I am sorry to say...

305
00:26:26,967 --> 00:26:28,898
she is still unconscious.

306
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:31,668
But...

307
00:26:32,098 --> 00:26:33,808
while looking into something else,

308
00:26:34,237 --> 00:26:37,777
I traced the man who brought golden silkworm poison to Joseon.

309
00:26:39,277 --> 00:26:40,378
And who is that?

310
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:45,578
I will report to you soon when I am sure.

311
00:26:57,558 --> 00:27:00,128
I am sorry I could not tell you.

312
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:02,797
I came to Hanyang...

313
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:05,467
only to find out you had married Lord Jo's son.

314
00:27:07,308 --> 00:27:09,338
I could not find the courage to tell you.

315
00:27:10,878 --> 00:27:11,878
I get it.

316
00:27:12,408 --> 00:27:14,568
I probably would not have been able to explain either.

317
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:16,947
Let us go outside and play a game.

318
00:27:31,297 --> 00:27:32,428
What happened?

319
00:27:33,898 --> 00:27:36,337
Eight years ago, that officer did not...

320
00:27:36,338 --> 00:27:38,537
fail to catch you. He let you go.

321
00:27:41,937 --> 00:27:44,707
I had no idea and wrote telling you to flee.

322
00:27:47,148 --> 00:27:48,307
He should have said so.

323
00:27:48,308 --> 00:27:50,378
Why carry this around and confuse me?

324
00:27:51,517 --> 00:27:53,618
Do you really not know why he had this?

325
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:56,307
You saw the drawing, and you did not get it?

326
00:27:56,517 --> 00:27:57,558
Did you not?

327
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:01,128
He kept it because it had a drawing of her face.

328
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,628
He looked fierce,

329
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:07,668
but he was loving.

330
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,118
When I first got into matchmaking,

331
00:29:00,017 --> 00:29:02,447
I did not think I would propose to you in writing.

332
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:05,757
Of all people...

333
00:29:06,987 --> 00:29:08,588
to you who speaks freely to me,

334
00:29:10,027 --> 00:29:11,558
always tries to lecture me,

335
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,297
and walks frivolously fast.

336
00:29:15,697 --> 00:29:17,838
A lowly widow and peddler.

337
00:29:21,537 --> 00:29:22,878
But if I think about it,

338
00:29:24,178 --> 00:29:26,277
it was meant to be.

339
00:29:27,578 --> 00:29:29,818
When I first saw you at the book rental shop,

340
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,378
my dark life...

341
00:29:33,247 --> 00:29:34,717
became brighter.

342
00:29:38,017 --> 00:29:39,928
As you said, in that short moment,

343
00:29:41,358 --> 00:29:42,828
you came into my heart.

344
00:29:45,128 --> 00:29:47,668
At first, you were unfamiliar and I tried to push you away.

345
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:50,967
But I realized my will was not enough.

346
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:53,707
And so...

347
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,777
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

348
00:29:58,838 --> 00:29:59,848
So...

349
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:01,848
I hope you think well of me...

350
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:04,647
and accept me as your spouse.

351
00:30:04,648 --> 00:30:05,878
(From Sim Jung Woo)

352
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:30,477
Is Lady Yeoju here?

353
00:30:36,977 --> 00:30:39,148
Why ask if he will not hear the answer?

354
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:59,908
Lady Yeoju, is that you?

355
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:29,767
Did you take...

356
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,638
the young master home safely?

357
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:51,088
I wish to...

358
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:56,257
spend the rest of my life with you too.

359
00:31:58,957 --> 00:32:02,797
Just as you did not think you would propose to me,

360
00:32:04,368 --> 00:32:05,467
I also...

361
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:11,638
did not think I would fall in love again.

362
00:32:14,477 --> 00:32:16,217
My first love was so great,

363
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:19,247
I was sure...

364
00:32:21,047 --> 00:32:23,618
it would last me the rest of my life.

365
00:32:30,658 --> 00:32:32,727
But before I even realized it,

366
00:32:35,227 --> 00:32:37,838
I had fallen for you.

367
00:32:46,408 --> 00:32:47,908
I appreciated you telling me...

368
00:32:50,148 --> 00:32:52,817
that I was not betraying my late husband...

369
00:32:52,818 --> 00:32:54,588
by letting myself develop feelings for you.

370
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:03,257
But...

371
00:33:05,328 --> 00:33:06,398
However,

372
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:11,338
I cannot accept your proposal.

373
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:15,267
What? Why not?

374
00:33:18,007 --> 00:33:19,037
I am...

375
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:25,078
not the peddler you know named Lady Yeoju.

376
00:33:28,348 --> 00:33:29,517
My name is...

377
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:33,658
Jung Soon Duk.

378
00:33:36,257 --> 00:33:38,598
I am a noblewoman who has a son.

379
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:47,537
At first, you said you were a widow and a matchmaker.

380
00:33:50,138 --> 00:33:51,207
Then...

381
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:55,547
you became a murder suspect suffering from amnesia.

382
00:33:57,517 --> 00:33:58,547
And now,

383
00:34:01,187 --> 00:34:02,347
you say you are a noblewoman?

384
00:34:04,618 --> 00:34:07,088
I could not be a matchmaker as a member of a noble family.

385
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:11,457
I borrowed Lady Yeoju's identity, so I am in this mess now.

386
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,438
Now that we know how we truly feel about each other,

387
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:28,947
we should...

388
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:32,817
never meet again.

(Inyang Heo Clan Genealogy)

391
00:35:03,248 --> 00:35:04,277
I did the right thing.

392
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:08,687
If I keep seeing him, I will not be able to forget him.

393
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:13,757
Mother!

394
00:35:14,857 --> 00:35:15,857
Hey.

395
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:19,868
Did you have a fun day with your aunt?

396
00:35:20,268 --> 00:35:21,928
Yes, we had so much fun.

397
00:35:22,297 --> 00:35:23,297
You did?

398
00:35:24,098 --> 00:35:25,658
What did you think of your uncle-to-be?

399
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:28,438
The thing is...

400
00:35:29,808 --> 00:35:31,908
Why must you ask him such a question? He is a child.

401
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:33,518
I met him, and everything went well.

402
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:36,578
He even gave me a gift.

403
00:35:37,317 --> 00:35:38,717
So? What did you think of him?

404
00:35:42,618 --> 00:35:45,888
He was polite and elegant.

405
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:48,428
I was more impressed than I had expected.

406
00:35:49,928 --> 00:35:52,058
I knew he would be your type.

407
00:35:52,428 --> 00:35:54,097
Was it not a good thing that you met him before your wedding?

408
00:35:54,098 --> 00:35:55,098
Yes.

409
00:35:56,098 --> 00:35:57,897
Had I not met him today,

410
00:35:58,498 --> 00:36:00,498
I would have regretted it for the rest of my life.

411
00:36:02,638 --> 00:36:04,678
Let us go inside, and you can tell me all about it.

412
00:36:05,438 --> 00:36:07,348
- Let us go inside. - Let us go.

413
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:25,458
My lord!

414
00:36:26,598 --> 00:36:28,397
Where have you been?

415
00:36:30,998 --> 00:36:33,767
Well, I failed to find Bachelor 23, but...

416
00:36:33,768 --> 00:36:36,007
- It is this way. I will... - Wait.

417
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:53,986
My goodness. Finally, there you are.

418
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:56,087
I looked everywhere for you.

419
00:36:59,428 --> 00:37:01,567
By the way, who is this lady?

420
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:07,567
Well, Lord Gyeongunjae.

421
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:12,478
Today, I met this awkward lady whom I could not help but pity.

422
00:37:12,538 --> 00:37:14,498
If I do not take care of her right by her side...

423
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:19,417
She will not be okay.

424
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:23,857
So about marrying Erudite Maeng's youngest daughter...

425
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:27,257
I cannot do it. I am sorry.

426
00:37:30,558 --> 00:37:31,598
I understand.

427
00:37:36,167 --> 00:37:39,368
I must say, the two of you look quite lovely together.

428
00:37:43,007 --> 00:37:44,038
All right, then.

429
00:37:49,877 --> 00:37:52,277
My lord, is it okay to let him walk away like this?

430
00:37:55,647 --> 00:37:56,688
My goodness.

431
00:37:59,188 --> 00:38:02,888
What? Is he not Bachelor 12, the eldest daughter's partner?

432
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:08,368
I travelled the country, looking for my soulmate.

433
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,237
I found her, at last.

434
00:38:16,938 --> 00:38:19,478
Like you said, I will never lose her.

435
00:38:20,908 --> 00:38:22,308
You made a wise decision.

436
00:38:27,217 --> 00:38:28,217
Come along.

437
00:38:31,487 --> 00:38:33,757
What? "A wise decision," seriously?

438
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:35,368
What about the eldest daughter, then?

439
00:38:36,127 --> 00:38:38,247
The eldest daughter is meant to be with someone else.

440
00:38:38,757 --> 00:38:39,757
Who might that be?

441
00:38:42,228 --> 00:38:44,737
- What do you mean? - Who is Lady Ha Na's man?

442
00:38:46,197 --> 00:38:47,237
My goodness.

443
00:38:49,368 --> 00:38:50,377
What?

444
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:52,736
No way.

445
00:38:52,737 --> 00:38:54,547
Not again. Absolutely not.

446
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:56,717
He is not with a lady.

447
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,788
I was on my way to Gyeongunjae to speak with you.

448
00:39:03,288 --> 00:39:04,608
I did not expect to see you here.

449
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:10,098
There is...

450
00:39:11,627 --> 00:39:13,228
someone I fancy.

451
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:18,598
My gosh. Everyone is in love.

452
00:39:18,868 --> 00:39:21,007
Is love in the air now?

453
00:39:21,507 --> 00:39:25,277
I am afraid I cannot marry Erudite Maeng's second daughter.

454
00:39:26,078 --> 00:39:27,107
I am sorry.

455
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:30,618
It cannot be helped.

456
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:40,788
"It cannot be helped?"

457
00:39:41,027 --> 00:39:43,067
Will you not help the spinster sisters get married?

458
00:39:43,357 --> 00:39:44,498
It is all pointless.

459
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:46,058
My lord!

460
00:39:48,627 --> 00:39:52,336
It looks like the spinster sisters' wedding plans fell through.

461
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:53,408
Yes, it seems so.

462
00:39:53,567 --> 00:39:56,908
"It seems so?" No. It is obvious that it completely fell through.

463
00:39:57,678 --> 00:39:59,777
I am suddenly in such a good mood.

464
00:40:00,078 --> 00:40:01,747
We should tell everyone!

465
00:40:01,748 --> 00:40:02,978
Yes, scurry along!

466
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:24,744
If you do not succeed in helping them get married,

467
00:40:24,768 --> 00:40:27,408
you will have to give up on the government post and your marriage.

468
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:29,368
So, why are you doing this?

469
00:40:29,737 --> 00:40:32,237
- Please tell me... - Lady Yeoju is a noblewoman.

470
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:36,547
So even if I could remarry, what is the point?

471
00:40:36,917 --> 00:40:39,147
Pardon me? Lady Yeoju is what?

472
00:40:41,118 --> 00:40:42,388
I wish to be alone.

473
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,388
Get out at once.

474
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:27,467
Bachelor 12,

475
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:29,428
do not ever let this woman go.

476
00:41:29,728 --> 00:41:30,737
What?

477
00:41:32,138 --> 00:41:33,138
What?

478
00:41:49,618 --> 00:41:51,717
Now that we know how we truly feel about each other,

479
00:41:53,158 --> 00:41:55,127
we should never meet again.

480
00:43:01,627 --> 00:43:04,388
Everyone in town is talking about how our wedding plans fell through.

481
00:43:04,897 --> 00:43:06,897
What did you do that the plans fell through?

482
00:43:10,237 --> 00:43:11,767
I did exactly as I was told,

483
00:43:11,768 --> 00:43:14,167
but Bachelor 24 did not come to the ssireum match.

484
00:43:14,868 --> 00:43:17,308
So, it is not my fault that the plans fell through.

485
00:43:21,647 --> 00:43:22,947
Then what about you, Ha Na?

486
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:29,087
While I was busy doing something important for our country,

487
00:43:30,158 --> 00:43:31,958
he met another woman.

488
00:43:33,118 --> 00:43:35,288
They say a man's feelings are fickle.

489
00:43:35,388 --> 00:43:38,527
To tell you the truth, he was not really my cup of tea,

490
00:43:39,058 --> 00:43:40,268
so do not worry about me.

491
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:42,768
You two, seriously.

492
00:43:43,567 --> 00:43:45,367
Do you not care about me, your little sister?

493
00:43:45,598 --> 00:43:48,837
Sam Soon, it is not our fault that the plans fell through,

494
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:51,187
so you will not be dragged to the government office.

495
00:43:51,377 --> 00:43:52,607
You are right.

496
00:43:53,208 --> 00:43:54,248
Do not worry.

497
00:43:58,217 --> 00:44:00,147
That is not important right now.

498
00:44:00,917 --> 00:44:02,816
If you girls do not get married,

499
00:44:02,817 --> 00:44:04,987
how could I get married?

500
00:44:06,817 --> 00:44:09,527
We are back to square one.

501
00:44:09,958 --> 00:44:12,058
"Good things are followed by obstacles?" As if.

502
00:44:12,797 --> 00:44:15,697
My life is just one obstacle after another!

503
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:16,967
My goodness.

504
00:44:17,397 --> 00:44:20,138
Sam Soon, do not cry.

505
00:44:20,737 --> 00:44:23,037
Why are you crying over not being able to wed?

506
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:24,138
Hey, Maeng Sam Soon.

507
00:44:24,607 --> 00:44:26,137
We promised that we would stay single...

508
00:44:26,138 --> 00:44:28,506
and live happily together with Mother until the day we died.

509
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:30,353
We wrote the written pledge. Do you not remember?

510
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:31,478
No, I do not!

511
00:44:32,047 --> 00:44:34,047
You know nothing about love!

512
00:44:43,127 --> 00:44:46,027
(Spouse Candidate Confirmed)

513
00:44:50,837 --> 00:44:53,807
You were sure the May Festival plan would work, but it did not.

514
00:44:53,808 --> 00:44:55,268
What will you do now?

515
00:44:57,877 --> 00:44:59,237
Do not worry.

516
00:44:59,678 --> 00:45:02,308
I am Lady Yeoju, the master of matchmaking.

517
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:12,127
Now that we know how we truly feel about each other,

518
00:45:13,857 --> 00:45:14,888
we should...

519
00:45:16,998 --> 00:45:19,098
never meet again.

520
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:25,337
I will wrap up the matchmaking project on my own...

521
00:45:26,868 --> 00:45:28,708
and send you a letter to inform you.

522
00:45:40,018 --> 00:45:42,217
I told him that we should never see each other again.

523
00:45:46,317 --> 00:45:47,888
Why am I waiting for him?

524
00:45:58,868 --> 00:46:00,788
I understand that he left seeking enlightenment,

525
00:46:01,268 --> 00:46:03,344
but you are struggling to find a mere mortician monk?

526
00:46:03,368 --> 00:46:05,877
I apologize, my lord. We are trying to track him down.

527
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:08,947
You fools cannot do anything right.

528
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,147
He disappeared after meeting Lord Gyeongunjae?

529
00:46:14,647 --> 00:46:17,058
It cannot be a coincidence.

530
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:19,693
I managed to find the true identity of the mortician monk.

531
00:46:19,717 --> 00:46:21,627
Who cares who that monk is?

532
00:46:21,757 --> 00:46:24,098
- Go and find him now. - Such insolence.

533
00:46:27,127 --> 00:46:29,828
Who is the mortician monk? Tell us.

534
00:46:30,868 --> 00:46:32,237
He is the son...

535
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:34,537
of Lord Min Seung Kwan, who died seven years ago.

536
00:46:34,538 --> 00:46:35,567
What?

537
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:37,438
Why are you telling us this now?

538
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:42,007
So, Lord Gyeongunjae met Min Seo Jun.

539
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:45,376
That means he knows all about what you did...

540
00:46:45,377 --> 00:46:47,348
to your son eight years ago.

541
00:46:48,647 --> 00:46:51,217
Must you run your mouth so thoughtlessly?

542
00:46:51,618 --> 00:46:52,888
Well...

543
00:46:53,487 --> 00:46:55,527
I said it out of concern. That is all.

544
00:47:06,138 --> 00:47:11,877
(Pyongyang, 8 years ago)

545
00:47:26,817 --> 00:47:28,288
In Hyun is dead?

546
00:47:29,357 --> 00:47:30,728
What happened?

547
00:47:31,527 --> 00:47:32,928
Lord Min sent someone...

548
00:47:33,158 --> 00:47:35,967
to find the letters exchanged between him and the translator.

549
00:47:36,797 --> 00:47:38,667
I believe In Hyun got hurt while trying...

550
00:47:38,868 --> 00:47:40,408
to stop them from taking the letters.

551
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:45,578
My goodness, So Hyun.

552
00:47:53,377 --> 00:47:54,848
In Hyun...

553
00:48:15,038 --> 00:48:16,566
That means he knows all about what you did...

554
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:18,007
to your son eight years ago.

555
00:48:32,058 --> 00:48:33,658
That young master from the May Festival?

556
00:48:35,357 --> 00:48:37,158
I do not know who his parents are.

557
00:48:39,627 --> 00:48:42,998
Are you saying you saved a complete stranger?

558
00:48:59,848 --> 00:49:02,288
I think she knows who he is but does not want to tell me.

559
00:49:03,688 --> 00:49:05,388
Shall I ask Lord Gyeongunjae?

560
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,328
No, I can figure it out on my own.

561
00:49:18,938 --> 00:49:20,138
Oh, dear.

562
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,038
What is wrong with him?

563
00:49:24,377 --> 00:49:26,937
He was fine when he got home on the evening of the May Festival.

564
00:49:28,478 --> 00:49:30,646
Love sickness can suddenly get worse...

565
00:49:30,647 --> 00:49:33,678
when you think you have no hope.

566
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:37,118
Then you would let yourself go, like this.

567
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:40,457
"Let yourself go?" What exactly do you mean by that?

568
00:49:40,458 --> 00:49:41,657
What do you think it means?

569
00:49:41,658 --> 00:49:46,058
Those who are faint-hearted cannot take it and may die.

570
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:47,828
What? He will die?

571
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:51,367
Do you think your master will die over this?

572
00:49:51,368 --> 00:49:53,167
This cantankerous man? My goodness.

573
00:49:53,697 --> 00:49:56,808
I shall send him some medicine to help energize his body and mind.

574
00:49:57,138 --> 00:49:58,876
Make sure he takes the medicine...

575
00:49:58,877 --> 00:50:00,947
with some warm wine.

576
00:50:01,578 --> 00:50:04,817
Butler, a letter arrived from the inn.

577
00:50:05,348 --> 00:50:07,017
You may leave it on the table.

578
00:50:07,018 --> 00:50:08,047
Sure.

579
00:50:16,857 --> 00:50:17,928
- Goodness! - Gosh.

580
00:50:18,328 --> 00:50:19,658
My goodness.

581
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,667
My lord, you woke up.

582
00:50:22,998 --> 00:50:24,998
You were unconscious for three days.

583
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:27,737
See? He will not die. My goodness.

584
00:50:41,018 --> 00:50:43,288
A letter arrived from the inn.

585
00:50:43,618 --> 00:50:44,688
Bring it to me.

586
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:46,388
Pardon me?

587
00:50:46,917 --> 00:50:48,458
Oh, right. Yes, my lord.

588
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:58,438
Well, I suppose the letter from the inn is your medicine.

589
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:28,067
All you had to do was write me back and tell me about his family.

590
00:51:29,098 --> 00:51:30,127
We did not have to meet.

591
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:32,998
Not that young master.

592
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:36,567
What do you mean?

593
00:51:37,308 --> 00:51:38,907
You tried to set Lady Ha Na up...

594
00:51:38,908 --> 00:51:41,107
with the young master spotted at the May Festival.

595
00:51:43,078 --> 00:51:44,618
We should look for someone else.

596
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:46,717
But I said...

597
00:51:48,118 --> 00:51:50,248
I would find their matches on my own.

598
00:51:50,447 --> 00:51:52,157
I never agreed to it.

599
00:51:52,158 --> 00:51:53,158
Working with you...

600
00:51:53,618 --> 00:51:55,928
makes me uncomfortable.

601
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:00,958
Even if you feel uncomfortable, deal with it.

602
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:03,768
You feel that way because you deceived me from the get-go.

603
00:52:06,467 --> 00:52:09,138
Once we marry them off, I will not ask you to meet me again.

604
00:52:09,908 --> 00:52:13,337
So let us wrap it up together, as promised.

605
00:52:21,717 --> 00:52:22,788
Then...

606
00:52:24,817 --> 00:52:26,937
about what happened on the day of the May Festival...

607
00:52:29,328 --> 00:52:30,897
Let us say it never happened.

608
00:52:34,368 --> 00:52:37,567
Sure, if it makes you feel better.

609
00:52:41,467 --> 00:52:44,078
And please treat me like before, as a peddler.

610
00:52:45,978 --> 00:52:48,023
It makes me uncomfortable to hear you talk so politely.

611
00:52:48,047 --> 00:52:51,248
How could I talk down to you, knowing that you are a noblewoman?

612
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:54,348
Deal with it even if it makes you uncomfortable.

613
00:52:59,518 --> 00:53:02,387
Among the scholars who showed interest in Lady Ha Na...

614
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:05,297
Why can we not set her up with that young master?

615
00:53:06,627 --> 00:53:08,297
I am aware of the age gap,

616
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:10,428
but I believe they would make a lovely couple.

617
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,078
My gosh.

618
00:53:29,647 --> 00:53:31,317
Is your chest hurting again?

619
00:53:32,558 --> 00:53:33,817
I am all right.

620
00:53:34,688 --> 00:53:37,328
It is not because I do not think they would make a good couple.

621
00:53:38,027 --> 00:53:41,697
That young master and Lady Ha Na are surely meant to be.

622
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,498
However,

623
00:53:43,897 --> 00:53:46,697
his family would not approve of us as his matchmakers.

624
00:53:47,138 --> 00:53:48,808
- Hence... - Hold on.

625
00:53:49,638 --> 00:53:52,138
You just said they were surely meant to be.

626
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:54,808
Why do you think that?

627
00:53:58,618 --> 00:53:59,678
That is...

628
00:54:01,248 --> 00:54:02,748
When I saw them together,

629
00:54:05,487 --> 00:54:06,688
I could just feel it.

630
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:12,427
Some Agents of Love hear a sound,

631
00:54:12,428 --> 00:54:15,327
and some feel a certain energy.

632
00:54:15,328 --> 00:54:17,397
I wonder how you recognize a match.

633
00:54:19,438 --> 00:54:20,438
My gosh.

634
00:54:22,538 --> 00:54:23,567
By any chance,

635
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:27,006
does your chest hurt when you see Lady Ha Na...

636
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:28,377
and the young master together?

637
00:54:28,678 --> 00:54:31,417
Just like when you see Lady Sam Soon and Lieutenant Jung together.

638
00:54:38,618 --> 00:54:40,217
Based on the symptoms,

639
00:54:40,987 --> 00:54:42,928
I believe you are the Agent of Love.

640
00:54:44,058 --> 00:54:45,857
That is utter nonsense.

641
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,127
Most Agents of Love are women.

642
00:54:49,467 --> 00:54:52,368
I heard a man could be one too, although it is not common.

643
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:56,966
I heard the Agent of Love...

644
00:54:56,967 --> 00:54:59,106
was supposed to bring destined couples together,

645
00:54:59,107 --> 00:55:01,777
but I have never done that in my life.

646
00:55:02,178 --> 00:55:05,317
It sounds like you have done a lot of research about the Agent of Love.

647
00:55:06,147 --> 00:55:07,477
That, too,

648
00:55:07,478 --> 00:55:10,118
is what most Agents of Love do.

649
00:55:10,717 --> 00:55:13,558
They wish to know why they are behaving in such a manner.

650
00:55:16,828 --> 00:55:20,757
Based on that logic, I should be the Agent of Love.

651
00:55:21,467 --> 00:55:22,928
After falling ill and overcoming it,

652
00:55:23,498 --> 00:55:25,898
the destined ties that you can see will become even clearer,

653
00:55:26,167 --> 00:55:28,687
and there will come a time when you will have to match them up.

654
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:31,138
Has that ever happened to you?

655
00:55:36,248 --> 00:55:38,377
If I truly am the Agent of Love,

656
00:55:39,147 --> 00:55:41,618
I must know how to match the two people who are meant to be.

657
00:55:42,348 --> 00:55:45,417
But I do not know how I can match Lady Ha Na with that young master.

658
00:55:47,217 --> 00:55:49,987
Getting the Crown Prince to wed is easy.

659
00:55:50,658 --> 00:55:51,728
Tell us.

660
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:53,696
The Crown Prince's marriage...

661
00:55:53,697 --> 00:55:55,737
was stopped because of the spinsters and bachelors.

662
00:55:55,897 --> 00:55:58,567
If we get rid of those spinsters, everything will be settled.

663
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:01,208
This all began...

664
00:56:01,837 --> 00:56:04,837
to marry off the Crown Prince.

665
00:56:08,308 --> 00:56:11,717
I think I can find a way to match them.

666
00:56:19,558 --> 00:56:21,928
Lord Park, it saddens me that...

667
00:56:23,127 --> 00:56:25,607
our plans for the May Festival failed because of your mistake.

668
00:56:25,658 --> 00:56:27,328
Why is that my fault?

669
00:56:28,098 --> 00:56:29,567
Blame it on Lord Gyeongunjae,

670
00:56:30,067 --> 00:56:32,067
who deliberately stepped in and ruined everything.

671
00:56:34,438 --> 00:56:35,438
That said,

672
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:38,708
before Lord Gyeongunjae uses those spinsters...

673
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:41,208
to get the Crown Prince to wed,

674
00:56:41,607 --> 00:56:43,578
we should eliminate the source of the problem.

675
00:56:45,478 --> 00:56:47,947
"Eliminate the source of the problem?"

676
00:56:49,688 --> 00:56:51,518
Do you mean you plan to get rid of him?

677
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:54,828
If it is necessary, it shall be done.

678
00:56:56,228 --> 00:56:57,658
I am against it.

679
00:57:06,697 --> 00:57:09,567
The King is on edge at the moment because of the crown prince.

680
00:57:10,368 --> 00:57:12,777
Would it truly be necessary to draw his attention now?

681
00:57:13,478 --> 00:57:17,248
Also, the wedding plans of Erudite Maeng's daughters fell through.

682
00:57:17,578 --> 00:57:19,377
So instead of Lord Gyeongunjae,

683
00:57:20,248 --> 00:57:22,287
we should find out what the King is up to.

684
00:57:22,288 --> 00:57:23,817
I believe that is our priority now.

685
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:26,987
Do you think he is up to something?

686
00:57:27,317 --> 00:57:28,557
On the day of the May Festival,

687
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:31,233
the Crown Prince nearly died at the hands of some bandits,

688
00:57:31,257 --> 00:57:32,896
although I understand he went off on his own.

689
00:57:32,897 --> 00:57:35,667
But the King did not do anything about it. Is it not strange?

690
00:57:36,428 --> 00:57:37,567
Right.

691
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:45,877
In front of everyone,

692
00:57:46,808 --> 00:57:49,007
you explicitly disagreed with me.

693
00:57:49,447 --> 00:57:52,447
Would it not make people think that our family lacks discipline?

694
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:01,627
It is important to find out what the King is up to,

695
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:04,458
but to warn the others...

696
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,498
and to unite the Dongro Faction,

697
00:58:07,498 --> 00:58:10,228
we should get rid of Lord Gyeongunjae now.

698
00:58:12,768 --> 00:58:14,938
I thought we were done talking about this.

699
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:24,478
Is there...

700
00:58:25,848 --> 00:58:28,118
something I do not know among the reasons...

701
00:58:30,817 --> 00:58:32,857
you must get rid of Lord Gyeongunjae?

702
00:58:35,288 --> 00:58:37,728
Of course, that is not the case.

703
00:58:43,197 --> 00:58:44,938
If there is nothing you are hiding from me,

704
00:58:46,297 --> 00:58:48,607
please do not bring it up again...

705
00:58:50,708 --> 00:58:52,337
for I will not change my mind.

706
00:59:06,357 --> 00:59:08,927
I suppose Operation May Festival failed...

707
00:59:08,928 --> 00:59:10,788
because of you.

708
00:59:13,098 --> 00:59:15,666
You are the Agent of Love, not I.

709
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,827
And you will match those who are meant to be together.

710
00:59:20,998 --> 00:59:24,166
My lady, I am not the Agent of Love.

711
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:25,978
I hate to admit it.

712
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,977
But considering all circumstances,

713
00:59:27,978 --> 00:59:30,277
I am sure you are the Agent of Love.

714
00:59:31,478 --> 00:59:34,517
I know a lot about the Agent of Love for I have done extensive research.

715
00:59:34,518 --> 00:59:36,847
That is one of the characteristics of the Agent of Love,

716
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:39,618
according to Erudite Maeng's wife. You heard it too.

717
00:59:44,697 --> 00:59:45,697
Gosh.

718
00:59:51,538 --> 00:59:53,138
It is slippery.

719
01:00:19,127 --> 01:00:22,297
I only looked into it for you said you wanted to know more about it.

720
01:00:24,967 --> 01:00:26,237
Then show me.

721
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:29,607
If you did the research to help me.

722
01:00:46,817 --> 01:00:48,727
Except for seeing the red thread...

723
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,228
and the heart flutters, this describes me.

724
01:00:51,897 --> 01:00:52,928
Especially this part.

725
01:00:53,357 --> 01:00:57,328
"Every Agent of Love possesses a unique matchmaking skill."

726
01:00:58,067 --> 01:01:00,137
Whenever I see a man and a woman who would make a good couple,

727
01:01:00,138 --> 01:01:02,058
I instantly come up with a way to match them up.

728
01:01:04,708 --> 01:01:07,408
Are you upset that you are not the Agent of Love?

729
01:01:11,917 --> 01:01:12,917
Yes.

730
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:15,987
Why did you wish to be the Agent of Love?

731
01:01:19,257 --> 01:01:21,328
I am doing this because I enjoy it,

732
01:01:22,158 --> 01:01:24,198
but I needed a legitimate reason as to why I was...

733
01:01:24,288 --> 01:01:27,049
deceiving the elders in the family for my obsession with matchmaking.

734
01:01:27,397 --> 01:01:29,967
If I were the Agent of Love, that would solve all my problems.

735
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,868
If I were fated to be a matchmaker,

736
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:36,268
I would have no reason to hesitate.

737
01:01:40,078 --> 01:01:42,178
Do you believe in fate?

738
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:50,817
Yes.

739
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,058
Love between a man and a woman...

740
01:01:54,058 --> 01:01:55,928
is like fate, after all.

741
01:01:59,797 --> 01:02:00,857
If...

742
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:04,397
I am the Agent of Love,

743
01:02:07,368 --> 01:02:10,067
the fact that my heart flutters like this whenever I see you...

744
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:15,578
could mean that you are my destiny.

745
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:24,757
No.

746
01:02:25,857 --> 01:02:27,687
Erudite Maeng's wife saw...

747
01:02:27,688 --> 01:02:30,888
that my late husband and I were soulmates,

748
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,058
which means...

749
01:02:37,268 --> 01:02:38,938
our feelings for each other...

750
01:02:41,408 --> 01:02:43,337
are probably like a fleeting wind.

751
01:02:46,277 --> 01:02:47,708
After some time,

752
01:02:49,348 --> 01:02:51,377
these stormy feelings...

753
01:02:53,547 --> 01:02:55,087
will die down too.

754
01:02:58,158 --> 01:02:59,458
Are you sure about that?

755
01:03:05,158 --> 01:03:06,197
Probably.

758
01:03:53,607 --> 01:03:55,507
Tell me about your husband's family.

759
01:03:57,377 --> 01:04:00,478
Find the matchmaker Lord Gyeongunjae was sighted with...

760
01:04:01,078 --> 01:04:02,348
and bring her to me at once.

761
01:04:03,288 --> 01:04:04,647
I am sorry.

762
01:04:05,257 --> 01:04:07,018
You were right.

763
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:09,164
The merchant selling the golden silkworm poison...

764
01:04:09,188 --> 01:04:10,356
That incident...

765
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:13,027
was what caused the Crown Prince to be kidnapped.

766
01:04:14,027 --> 01:04:15,307
Since this has already happened,

767
01:04:15,797 --> 01:04:17,396
we should get rid of Lord Gyeongunjae on our own.

768
01:04:17,397 --> 01:04:19,967
The moment I first met you, I knew...

769
01:04:21,138 --> 01:04:23,107
I would never forget you.
