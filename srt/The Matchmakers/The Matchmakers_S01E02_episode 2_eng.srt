2
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,350

3
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,370

4
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,870

5
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,270

6
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,680

7
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,570
The reason I am petitioning to invalidate my marriage to the princess

8
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:11,920
is because my inability to take public office is the greatest waste of Joseon's resources.

9
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,110
My life, besides making appeals, is that of a scholar-official.

10
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:22,650

(Government office for music and dance during the Joseon Dynasty)

11
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:43,760
 I am diligent not only in academia but also in art and culture.

12
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,200
I am very impressed.

13
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,880
You have reached the same level of skills as me in only six months of learning.

14
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,470
I would say it is not exactly the same.

15
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,650
You mentioned that the basics of playing the daegeum

16
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,850
are the correct tempo and controlling your breathing.

17
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,850
And didn't you say that the perfection of a performance is having your own color?

18
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,900
You are correct.

19
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,440
But your performance lacks your own personality.

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,890
So, how could you say your performance is as perfect as mine?

21
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,410
I no longer have anything to learn from here.

22
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,740
I will not be coming to Jangakwon any longer.

23
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,580

(Institution for drawings for Joseon Dynasty)

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,550
The way the sunlight shines in the picture. It is as if the sunlight is alive.

25
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:44,640
Do not just sit in the corner of your room and draw with your imagination.

26
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,340
I advise you to come outside and capture Joseon's light and scenery.

27
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,560
Although I believe it would not be easy for a drastic shift in thinking.

28
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,840
Good luck.

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,690
I think it's a little lower. Should I give it a go?

30
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,400
He's alive.

31
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,130
- Are you not too hot? 
 - I am okay.

32
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:38,810
- Why don't you rest for a while? 
 - No, I really am fine.

33
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,630
Geez!

34
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,620
Gosh, I am stressed.

35
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,780
You cannot learn to give acupuncture after teaching you all these years.

36
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,280
I wonder why you're so good at love, you rascals!

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,410
What could they do?

38
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:57,750
Love is for those foolish and lowly people who cannot control their own hearts.

39
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,440
Your Excellency, why do you learn such a foolish study of medicine?

40
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,760
Are you looking for the cause of what happened eight years ago?

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,210
No. Since there is no physician in Joseon who can cure my chronic abdominal pain.

42
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:20,440
I am in search of a cure myself.

43
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,570

44
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:33,400
I order this traitor the punishment of poison!

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,430
T-This is...

47
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:44,440
This is unfair, Your Majesty.

48
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,300
If you deem this unfair, shall I give you a chance?

49
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:17,230
It is rather simple to wed His Highness the Crown Prince.

50
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,260
Since the old maidens in the city were the excuse to hinder His Highness to wed,

51
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:26,070
I believe the problem will be resolved by getting rid of the old maidens.

52
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,260
I see...

53
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:30,190
Our late king...

54
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,330
The king before him, and the one before him...

55
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:38,160
The problem of old maidens and old bachelors that all these previous kings could not resolve.

56
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,480
I should solve it within two months?

57
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,270
You...

58
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,580
Everyone in Joseon knows that this problem cannot be solved immediately.

59
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,290
By quickly marrying a few exemplary old maidens to old bachelors and using them as examples,

60
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,330
you can announce that the Royal Court is concerned about the issue of old maidens and old bachelors

61
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,980
and proceed with the wedding for His Highness, no one would be able to stop it.

62
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:08,610
He's suggesting window dressing!

63
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,030
What are you nodding for?

64
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,870
If you continue to express concern, it would not be for a mere display.

65
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,800
You would not ignore the issue of old maidens and old bachelors, right?

66
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,130
Huh?

67
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,650
Yes.

68
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,640
That is right.

69
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,990
But the idea of an "exemplary old maiden" is much too abstract.

70
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:33,400
Your Majesty!

71
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,980
I, your humble servant, have a few old maidens who come to mind.

72
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,690
- Chief Royal Secretary, you? 
 - Yes.

73
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,440
The three daughters of Maeng Sang Cheon, who live in Namsan Village, are all old maidens.

74
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,490
- Three? Maeng Sang Cheon? 
 - Yes.

75
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,550
Maeng Sang... It sounds familiar.

76
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,880
He was your childhood friend when you were the crown prince.

77
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,840
O-Oh yes, I know!

78
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:57,460
Gosh, that fellow really loved to study.

79
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:01,080
I heard he passed away five years ago or so.

80
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:04,130
Why have all three daughters not been able to wed?

81
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,060
I am not sure about the details.

82
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,100
Since it is very rare for all three daughters to be old maidens,

83
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,690
people call them the "Old Maidens of Namsan Village."

84
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,900
Seeing that such rumors have reached my ears,

85
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,580
I believe they will be perfect as exemplary old maidens, as His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae mentioned.

86
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:28,260
However, if a king specifically picks those daughters to help them wed,

87
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,360
would that not cause a commotion about fairness?

88
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:32,330
Yes, about that...

89
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:35,090
- Oh... 
 - "Oh"?

90
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,230
Oh, yes. Well...

91
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,490
"Trust is essential between friends."

92
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:47,650

Not only one, but three. It is rather immoral to watch your friend's daughters live as old maidens.

93
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,960
Your Majesty, you have the full right to specifically choose and help those sisters.

94
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,950
This kid is very smart.

95
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,750
Yes.

96
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:07,370
Then, Jeong Woo, you shall have all three daughters of Master Maeng wed within two months.

97
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:10,730
Pardon? How could I marry them off...

98
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,860
When I look at the appeals you have submitted so far,

99
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:19,680
there is no one in Joseon who knows more about the wedding and its procedures than you do.

100
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,430
If you succeed, I will examine this appeal you have made optimistically.

101
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:32,280
However, if you fail, I will punish you for deceiving the royal family,

102
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,920
and you shall be doomed to drink this poison.

103
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,830
Keep this poison safe and sound!

104
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,260

105
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,850

106
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,040
Your Excellency!

107
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:14,290
How could Your Excellency be a traitor? What is happening?

108
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:19,670
Oh Bong, my path to take public office has finally opened.

109
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,700
Has the appeal been accepted?

110
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:27,730
Not right away. But it is no different than saying it has been accepted.

111
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,680
For someone as outstanding as I am...

112
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,250
there is no reason I cannot be a matchmaker.

113
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,130

(Also know as Throne Hall, center of Gyeongbok Palace)

114
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:44,590
If this is a success, will you permit Prince Gyeongwoonjae's marriage annulment?

115
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,260
You are speaking nonsense.

116
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:52,740
I am sorry that my princess passed at such a young age.

117
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,980
I must not make her a virgin spirit.

118
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,910
I cannot breathe thinking that I cannot see you after marriage, Young Master.

119
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,020
Maiden, we can be together forever.

120
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,420
If we drink this, we can sleep painlessly forever.

121
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:44,580
I would like to, Young Master.

122
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,800
Are you two crazy?

123
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:56,880
What is this?

124
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,970
What would've happened if I had not come here today?

125
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,960
Yeojudaek?

126
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,790
Please keep this a secret from my mother.

127
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:13,910
For someone considering to die, are you scared of your mother?

128
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,420
I hoped that the person you were seeing was a nobleman.

129
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,840
He is of a much higher class.

130
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,320
Maiden, who is she?

131
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,040
The second son of Chief Royal Secretary, Young Master Kim Ho.

132
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,280
Right?

133
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,240
The deductive method you use to find a spouse you speak of.

134
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:46,070
Can you tell someone's family background and name just by their appearance?

135
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,510
Of course...

136
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,850
I-I cannot know their names.

137
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,920
The way he was dressed was exactly like the son of a high official.

138
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,000
 Since he could easily come and go to the biggest mill in the capital, I thought he must be wealthy.

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,610
I saw the identity tag dropped on the ground.

140
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:09,320
But if it is Chief Royal Secretary, is not the gap with the lady's family too great?

141
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,860
That's the problem.

142
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:14,850
Even if Scholar Song is wealthy,

143
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:20,480
Chief Royal Secretary will only see them as new money. He would not wed them.

144
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:26,280
But I am not the one to give up on such a good-looking couple like them.

145
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,480
Why do you work so hard?

146
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,240
Huh?

147
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,640
It's not as if you earn more money when you match a good couple.

148
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,040
You always overdo it every time.

149
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,960
Because it's only once.

150
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,280
For a noblewoman, there is only one husband.

151
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,250
So, whatever means it takes, she must wed someone of good fate.

152
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,050
Marriage is to bring the good of two households together

153
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,210
to support the nation and royal family and produce the next generation.

154
00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:06,400
But still, do you not think you need to meet the ladies you need to wed?

155
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,240
Come now. I wrote appeals about marriage for eight years.

156
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,260
There's nothing I do not know about marriage.

157
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,920
According to the family rites,

158
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,560
the marriage ritual begins with inquiring matchmakers to match the families.

159
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,100
We can just use matchmakers to meet with the old maidens.

160
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:31,320
Therefore, I will not need to meet with the old maidens of Namsan Village until they are wed.

161
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,250
Eyes, nose, mouth. Everything is perfect.

162
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,720
I have never seen a man this handsome.

163
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,420
Gosh, how beautiful he looks.

164
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,360
Are you here to buy makeup for your wife?

165
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,690
How come a man's hands are so pretty?

166
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:52,600
My gosh! Come on now!

167
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,850
Stop and step aside!

168
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:00,260
He's not someone you can speak so carelessly!

169
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:05,910
It's because he has not said a single word, gathering us busy people here.

170
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,770
Shall I do the talking?

171
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:14,370
No, it is my job.

172
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,220
I have to have three of my teacher's daughters wed before the end of May.

173
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,850
Gosh, three of them?

174
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,360
If by May, it is a little tight.

175
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:35,240
Well, you can say it's nearly impossible.

176
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,400
The pay will be twice the municipal rate!

177
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:43,210
- It's not your money. 
 - It should be at least that much.

178
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,380
If professionals like us come together and divide the work, two months is plenty of time.

179
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:55,160
That is right. It's actually more than enough time.

180
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,780
But which ladies from what family?

181
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:04,060
They are the daughters of Master Maeng, who live in Namsan Village.

182
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,810
Sir, we do not set up old maidens.

183
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,120
We just wasted our time.

184
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,160
Come now. How could matchmakers refuse to set people up?

185
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,430
It is not that we will not do it. We cannot, Sir.

186
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:29,540
Why so?

187
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,600
Gosh, where shall I even start?

188
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,830
I worked as a matchmaker for their second daughter when I first started the job.

189
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,920
Do not even get me started. She has such a dirty mouth.

190
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,020
They say if you are unlucky, you can get pregnant by drinking rice water.

191
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,470
Gosh! What idiot steals only one shoe?

192
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:54,260
This would be settled if you just show me what's inside that basket.

193
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,260
Why should I?

194
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,110
You are a thief!

195
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:21,180
If not, why are you trying to hide this so much?

196
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,800
What is this commotion?

197
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,570
 She doesn't just have a bad mouth, but she's also very physical.

198
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,170
She's a fighter.

199
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,040
The first daughter has such a pretty face. Why couldn't she marry?

200
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,130
She relied too much on her face and was too picky.

201
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,740
So what if she has a pretty face? She's not smart.

202
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,750
If you look at her face, she looks so dense.

203
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:07,930
Is the dense because of her name? 
  (Sounds like "Maeng" in Korean which is their last name)

204
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:12,250
That is old news.

205
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,570
According to recent rumors...

206
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,620
Maiden Cho Ok's been possessed by a ghost.

207
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,870
- Really? 
 - Is that true?

208
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,940
I guess the protagonist of the vulgar rumor was their first daughter.

209
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:49,770
What in the world! You scared me! Seriously!

210
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,510
Cold, cold!

211
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:59,080
Stop it!

212
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,680
Wait... Where is she?

213
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,670
So, every night, she hunts on any guy that comes by the stream.

214
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:35,280
They say birds of a feather flock together.

215
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,850
Maiden Cho Ok was close with older maidens.

216
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,940
It'll be impossible for their first daughter to wed because of such a horrible rumor.

217
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,080
Exactly! She should have agreed to be the Defense Minister's mistress last year.

218
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
Gosh, you've gone too far.

219
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
Then, what about the youngest daughter?

220
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,620
She's also an odd one.

221
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,200
One time, she apparently dressed up as a man.

222
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,740
Oh, t-that millstone girl that I've only heard of? 
 (Androgyny)

223
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,190
Millstone girl!

224
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,140
Goodness, you must be dizzy, Sir.

225
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,350
So, to organize what's been said...

226
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,100
The oldest is pretty but has high standards,

227
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,340
possessed by a virgin spirit and behaves promiscuously.

228
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:19,880
The second is good at sewing but verbally vulgar and vicious.

229
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,680
The youngest has questionable sexual preferences.

230
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,760
A nobleman is definitely different.

231
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,740
You organized that at once.

232
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:38,000
So, there is no one who will take on this matchmaking?

233
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,930
Sir...

234
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:48,460
Yeojudaek might be able to take on this matchmaking.

235
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,530
Yeojudaek?

236
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:56,240
She will do anything, regardless of means or method for her case.

237
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,770
I need to shave my head?

238
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,860
They say taking care of oneself is the beginning of filial duty.

239
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:02,710
I cannot do that.

240
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:08,930
You know that taking care of your body is the beginning of filial duty.

241
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:16,020
Do you not know dying before your parents is the worst thing you can do to them?

242
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,380
You know a lot about manners, Merchant.

243
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,750
After you two wed, gifting your parents with a grandchild

244
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,950
seems like the way to make up for shaving your head, a small act of impiety.

245
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,270
No matter how much you stop me, I will become a monk.

246
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:48,430
You cannot! N-No! You cannot!

247
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,700
Do not stop him!

248
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,820
Taking care of oneself is the beginning of filial duty. You bastard!

249
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,040
Good job. Now, just believe in me.

250
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,680
You cannot go! No!

251
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,360
There is a lady who will quell your son's sudden shift to Buddhism.

252
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:17,390
Shall I set them up?

253
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:23,840
Does Yeojudaek happen to be the—

254
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,080
Is she the one with a mole under her eye?

255
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,750
That's right.

256
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:32,600
She has that mole and cannot join our group because her looks are not up to our standards.

257
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,710
We must qualify in many ways to do the job that we do.

258
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:41,510
That man over there asked for geumjam poison? 
  (Golden silkworm)

259
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,530
What does he do?

260
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:45,970
I am not quite sure.

261
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,140
An idler? A rich one.

262
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,580
Has a lot of money...

263
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,890
Are you going somewhere?

264
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,290
Yes, outhouse.

265
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,510
 Yeojudaek doesn't come to the merchants' inn every day.

266
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,170
 If you're in a hurry, go to the Namchon house.

267
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,940
Sir!

268
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,380
Sir, the donkey...

269
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,380
After shaving the Young Master's hair and showing Maiden Yeon Hui,

270
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,860
they approved right away.

271
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,400
They were ready to say yes to any ordinary woman.

272
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,790
I am so happy to think that they will live happily ever after.

273
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:23,120
This is why I cannot stop matchmaking.

274
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,310
Then, what happens to the young master, who is a mama's boy, the maiden's original match?

275
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:29,190

276
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,450
That good-looking young master?

277
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,420
 I only said he was a mama's boy to break the match.

278
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,210
He's not a mama's boy but more a model young master.

279
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,940
Luckily, there's a lady who is perfect for him.

280
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,670
Who is that lady?

281
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,870
- This is crazy. 
 - How malicious.

282
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,110
- How could they end it like this? 
 - This is the end?

283
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,930

284
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:05,490
 She's a perfect match with her future mother-in-law.

285
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:08,000
A lady who is even more perfect for the young master.

286
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,650
How are you sure they will be a good match or not, Madam?

287
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:15,910
Should I tell you my secret to recognizing a good match?

288
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,350
Yes!

289
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:23,480
I don't tell this to anyone, so listen carefully.

290
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,480
You need to look at the young lady and young man closely with affectionate eyes.

291
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
What is that?

292
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You can deduce if you look very closely with affectionate eyes.

293
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,530
Well, the fact that the model young master is wearing his Confucian scholar outfit at home means

294
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:42,970
it probably means his mother likes her son wearing that.

295
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:48,670
 That would mean he grew up looking up to his father being considerate toward his mother.

296
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,350
Considerate men like him are devoted-husband types

297
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,950
and are well-suited with independent and strong-minded ladies.

298
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:06,630
You still have something to say to me?

299
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,350
I called for a palanquin.

300
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,510
Please wait and ride it home.

301
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:12,320
What are you saying?

302
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,680
Anyone would have been suspicious of thou in that situation.

303
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:22,740
However, I hastily judged thou as a thief without concrete evidence

304
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:26,220
and caused thou to hurt thine foot. So, please take the palanquin home.

305
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,120
Thou, bullshit.

306
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,410
You treated me like a thief a minute ago!

307
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:34,350
On top of that, you don't admit your wrongs.

308
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:37,320
Anyone could've doubted me? Bullshit!

309
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,670
It pisses me off the more I think about it.

310
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,960
M-Maiden, I would be sorry if you just left.

311
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,760
Where do you think you're touching!

312
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,890
I-It's just that—

313
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,630
What do you think you're doing in broad daylight?

314
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,040
A man and a woman should be separated.

315
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,940
How pathetic you two look.

316
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,500
Which families are you two from?

317
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,720
That is...

318
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,440
What's with that geezer?

319
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,240
Geezer?

320
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,530
This is why I don't like coming to Bukchon.

321
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,870
Why not you get on the palanquin first and avoid that geezer?

322
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,330
Follow me.

323
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:23,710
Goodness, Sir...

324
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,740
I apologize for suspecting you.

325
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:48,640
Oh, does it hurt again?

326
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,720
Take the lady to her home.

327
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:02,500
I apologize for causing a commotion.

328
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,450
The commotion is not the point of your wrongdoings.

329
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,410
The problem is...

330
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,720
Gosh! You are not well!

331
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,300
Do you know how rough the young masters are nowadays? Why would you meddle?

332
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
"Why would you meddle"?

333
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,050
Is that how you should talk to me?

334
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,510
Goodness...

335
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:30,450
Even the children of nobles are fiddling foolishly. I worry for Joseon's future.

336
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,360
G-Goodness...

337
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,790
Goodness...

338
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,370
Goodness.

339
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:39,330
Madam, will you find my match in the future?

340
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,530
Of course.

341
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,520
I won't take matchmaking fees from you, Bok Hee.

342
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,220
Can you write what you just said on paper?

343
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,980
With your signature, Madam.

344
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,520
You raised your daughter so smartly.

345
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,090
She'll grow up to be rich.

346
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,120
That would be nice.

347
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,970
I'm going to the merchants' inn to deliver something. Let's go together.

348
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:59,430
Huh?

349
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:03,530
I'll go a little later.

350
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:05,980
The weather is too nice to go home early.

351
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:09,750
All right. Bok Hee, let's go.

352
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,750
The sun is so warm.

353
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:43,710
 Twenty years had passed. How could she have sat in the same place?

354
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,600
 Please be patient.

355
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,650

You will know the reason when I read the end.

356
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:54,000
 Apologies, I was just too curious.

357
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,590
 I will continue to read.

358
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:05,420
 Looking at the bride sitting the same way she was the first night twenty years ago,

359
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,110
 I felt more worried than scared.

360
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,530
 The scholar caressed her shoulder.

361
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:17,380
 At that moment, the bride turned into ashes and broke into pieces.

362
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,050
 The ashes turned into a white butterfly

363
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:24,460
 and flew away after wandering around the scholar.

364
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:34,650
 The end of this story is always sad yet beautiful to read.

365
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,580
O-Oh over there.

366
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,200
It must be that house.

367
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,780
Yes...

368
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,450
Go and bring the donkey.

369
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,920
All of a sudden?

370
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,460
Yeojudaek's house is right in front of us.

371
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,720
Listen! We cannot walk back on our way home.

372
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,020
This is why I asked you to wait earlier.

373
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,450
Also, I can meet with Yeojudaek alone.

374
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,430
I understand, Sir.

375
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:52,280
What's this? This doesn't feel like the first time I've felt abandoned.

376
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,580
I'm probably mistaken to think that His Excellency seems very excited.

377
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,970
Is anyone there?

378
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,690
Did you wake up because of me?

379
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,720
What is this?

380
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,070
A dream?

381
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,540
I want to go back to sleep if it's a dream.

382
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:23,030
I miss you, my dear husband.

383
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,580
This...

384
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:54,690
is too realistic...

385
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,810
What is it?

386
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,250
Gosh.

387
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,710
Merchant, sir? What are you doing right now?

388
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:13,820
I have done nothing!

389
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,990
I only grabbed your belongings just in case they fell.

390
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,830
Why? For what reason?

391
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,360
What did you do while I was nodding off?

392
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,440
You tried to do something! Not me!

393
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,770
No matter how uneducated a merchant you may be,

394
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:30,300
a man and a woman should be separate, and ethical codes are strict.

395
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:33,160
How could you dare touch a stranger's neck?

396
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:40,470
T-Then, why have you come into a widow's house like a stray cat, Sir?

397
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:43,840
I am not a stray cat. Well!

398
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,200
I-I came here...

399
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,770
to request a matchmaking.

400
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,120
Matchmaking?

401
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:59,450
You don't seem that way, but do you have a child old enough to wed?

402
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,070
I do not have children!

403
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,650
Then, for yourself?

404
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,340
I am already wedded.

405
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:08,350
Then, who are you asking for?

406
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,910
Goodness. How long was I asleep?

407
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:17,660
I intend to wed Master Maeng's three daughters in Namsan Village within two months.

408
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:24,640
Did you say marry off not one but all three improbable daughters of Master Maeng?

409
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,170
Within two months?

410
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:31,440
Not "improbable." You mean "impossible." As in not possible.

411
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:35,980
 I've always wanted to match make the daughters of Master Maeng...

412
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,940
 What should I do?

413
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:42,520
 No. It's dangerous to get involved with an annoying nobleman like him.

414
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,100
 What's more dangerous is that the sun is going down right now.

415
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:51,220
I apologize, but I cannot accept any more requests due to ongoing matches.

416
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,470
Also, I must hurry somewhere now.

417
00:33:54,470 --> 00:34:00,060
The merchants at the inn said you would be very capable of accomplishing the task.

418
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,330
Sir, why do you want to wed Master Maeng's daughters?

419
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,150
I am an inspector, and it is a royal order to abolish old maidens.

420
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,820
What did you say right now?

421
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:24,840
No need to feel pressured since it's a royal order.

422
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,700
You just need to do as you always do.

423
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:33,000
Hold on, before that. What, abolish old maidens?

424
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,390
Are old maidens some kind of bandits? To abolish?

425
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:42,100
I never take requests from people who have a mind like you, Sir.

426
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,450
I am in a hurry, so goodbye.

427
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,350
I mean...

428
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,970
It's not "a mind like me," but this is a royal order!

429
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:56,330
Come now, how rude of you to just leave after saying your say.

430
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:00,570
Stop right there.

431
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:04,060
I said stop right there.

432
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,410
I have not yet finished talking!

433
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,130
I should make sure to tell you this, Sir.

434
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:21,160
Old maidens are women, too. And marriage is as important to them as it is to other ladies.

435
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:27,010
Therefore, you cannot approach them as subjects to abolish!

436
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:34,160
Marriage is the biggest event in a person's life!

437
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,730
Not "biggest." "Important."

438
00:35:39,390 --> 00:35:40,270
Pardon?

439
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,210
You're an idiot who can't even decipher words.

440
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,610
Who do you think I am that you are attempting to teach me?

441
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:49,520
Everyone should learn if they are ignorant.

442
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,460
I am not the ignorant one here!

443
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,210
Stop right there! Where are you going? I am not finished talking!

444
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,790
Move aside!

445
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,810
Open your eyes wide.

446
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:02,740
W-Wait... Where did she go...

447
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,270
Where are you?

448
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,550
Am I the only one who cannot see you?

449
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,030
Reveal yourself!

450
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,130
Where did you go?

451
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:15,590
You want to catch me with that running skill?

452
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,290
Your Excellency!

453
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:32,770
Did the conversation with the merchant go well?

454
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:35,520
Why is everyone treating me this way?

455
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,410
Pardon?

456
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:42,390
I am trying my best to demolish the curse of old maidens with a royal order.

457
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:46,820
Neither above nor below, no one abides by their duty.

458
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,570
What use is it if I am the only one abiding by the laws and principles?

459
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,580
 That's probably what he would say.

460
00:36:57,850 --> 00:37:00,510
It is very dangerous. Please take a different route.

461
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,750
He is Your Excellency Gyeongwoonjae!

462
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:05,590
Don't become a victim of his resentment! Retrieve!

463
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:09,040
Resentful Man!

464
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:20,030
I definitely think I saw a few Confucian students who weren't focusing on their studies.

465
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,040
I haven't seen them.

466
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,220
You did not see, Oh Bong.

467
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,320
Please get on the donkey. I will bring it over.

468
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,370
Sure.

469
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:31,940
I can see everything, Oh Bong.

470
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:37,600
Oh Bong, follow me slowly.

471
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:45,370

472
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,220
Come on.

473
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,720
Okay, come now.

474
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,580
Is it done?

475
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:38,020
It's good.

476
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,520
Geun Seok, mother's coming in.

477
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,740
Mother, I am heading to school now.

478
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Don't study too hard. You won't grow tall.

479
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,910
It's a great day for matchmaking.

480
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,700
Why are you suddenly going to Hanseongbu?

481
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:08,350
I had not thought it through.

482
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:11,780
This case is not an ordinary marriage but an official duty.

483
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,520
Therefore, I need to follow the necessary procedures.

484
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:26,290
Go slowly. Slowly.

485
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,020
I am going slowly.

486
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,340
Have you lost your mind?

487
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,130
Since she is the only daughter of the Left State Minister,

488
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:39,010
she has both the wealth and reputation that you seek, Madam.

489
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,450
What's holding you back?

490
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:44,520
Do you not know that the Left State Minister and our family are political opponents?

491
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,470
Three years ago, I linked Joseon's greatest political opponents, His Excellency Ha and An, through marriage.

492
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:56,050
Remember? Those two families are the only ones who survived the great purge quietly.

493
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,880
The Left State Minister's daughter is wise and bold.

494
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,000
She will become the wings to your son, who is fragile like his father.

495
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:07,790
More importantly...

496
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,910
The Left State Minister was the one who initiated this matchmaking.

497
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:13,360
Is that true?

498
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,900
How could I tell such a lie to you, Madam?

499
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:28,890
They have even sent the lady's sajudanja.

500
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:31,790
Did you already receive permission from the bride's side?

501
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:35,180
Not even close. I haven't even spoken about it.

502
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:38,740
How did you get her fortune without getting permission?

503
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:42,300
The lady is actually my sister-in-law, so I just paid to have it made.

504
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,000
I see.

505
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,380
You are matchmaking for your sister-in-law?

506
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,450
With that said, could you act as Yeojudaek just this one time?

507
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,640
What?

508
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,640
You would not be pretending because you are Yeojudaek.

509
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,530
People cannot tell who I am with makeup.

510
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:08,800
I cannot openly act as a matchmaker in front of my mother-in-law.

511
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,720
I cannot, either.

512
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,140
Do not say no without trying.

513
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,890
It is not difficult at all.

514
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,620
What if I get caught?

515
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:22,080
Are you okay, Madam?

516
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,170
Why would we get caught?

517
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,570
To the chancellor's wife, I am Yeojudaek.

518
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:29,320
To my mother-in-law, Yeojudaek will be Yeojudaek.

519
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,340
In-laws seem close, but they are actually very far and complicated.

520
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:38,170
Would prospective in-laws meet and check the matchmaker's face?

521
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:44,430
Anyway, I cannot go to your house, Madam.

522
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,390
That's my answer.

523
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:48,950
Please, Yeojudaek.

524
00:42:49,970 --> 00:42:51,450
Please?

525
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:58,330
Yeojudaek?

526
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:05,490

527
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,500
- Wait here. 
 - Yes, Sir.

528
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,690
The children of the noble class are the problem.

529
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:19,290
They never listen.

530
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:22,950
They think they are the best in the world.

531
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:27,460

But think they were born in the wrong generation.

532
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,990
Just answer my question, please.

533
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:34,530
The problem of old maidens and old bachelors is Hanseongbu's jurisdiction, right?

534
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:39,120
T-T-That is the case.

535
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,630
Not one, but three daughters of my Master Maeng from

536
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,880
Sungkyunkwan are aging as old maidens.

537
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:52,380
How could you neglect the poor women who are to live in this cruel world alone?

538
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:55,910
You really are clueless.

539
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,260
Hanyang is the city of administration and consumption.

540
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:04,190
Even if you're a woman, if you're good at sewing, cooking, or anything professionally,

541
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:08,730
she would not have problems living alone, although she might not wed.

542
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:13,370
How could you know the way of the world when you haven't taken public office?

543
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:16,090
What did you just say?

544
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:19,950
If you're concerned about the old maidens' hardships of life,

545
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:22,100
look into their family situation first.

546
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:27,440
If their sick mother is getting treatment in an expensive curing room every day,

547
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,590
it means they are unable to wed because of their reputation, not their circumstances.

548
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:40,900
Mayor sir, Hyeminseo administrator is urgently asking to see you. 
  (Public health center)

549
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:42,840
All right.

550
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:48,570
I do not know why you're suddenly concerned about the Master's daughters.

551
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:52,750
How about finding a match in this list of old bachelors?

552
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:58,370
As you can see, I am busy governing the country. All right, then.

553
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,340
"Busy governing the country? All right, then"?

554
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:15,430
He's a lot lower in class than I am as a prince, but he habitually cuts me off.

555
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:20,080
And he fell much behind than I did on the State Examination. He is full of himself.

556
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:30,530

557
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,180

558
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:02,820
 Madam, who is barely showing her eyes through her long hood,

559
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:07,730
 is sitting mysteriously under the light coming through the small side window.

560
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,550
 With her gaze fixed on the chief of the Royal Investigation Bureau,

561
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:16,410
 she slowly took off her long hood.

562
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,690
 The fabric was see-through, showing her skin.

563
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:24,450
 The madam's long hood dropped to her shoulder and down to her chest, hip, and legs...

564
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:28,210
 Her silhouette showed clearly.

565
00:46:44,410 --> 00:46:47,820
 You will not be able to leave easily today.

566
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:51,900
 I need to confirm your face. So take off your long hood.

567
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,250
 You will regret it.

568
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:59,720

569
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,750
 T-This is how it ends?

570
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,400
 How malicious!

571
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,370
What are you peeking at?

572
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,210
From your uniform, I can tell you are a Hanseongbu officer.

573
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:42,510
If you do not explain why this vulgar book is here,

574
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,490
you will not be able to keep your position.

575
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:46,490
You should reveal who you are first.

576
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:50,200
I am Shim Jeong Woo from Gyeongwoonjae, Bukchon.

577
00:48:51,150 --> 00:48:53,140
Your Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

578
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,080
These books are evidence.

579
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:02,670
What a poor excuse.

580
00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:08,570
How could such adult-rated novels women read be evidence for what case?

581
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:14,520
It is evidence to capture the culprit behind Lee Cho Ok of Pildong's suicide by drowning.

582
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,680
Was he appointed through nepotism?

583
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:21,830
What family do you belong to?

584
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:29,300
I'm Jeong Soon Goo, the eldest son of Jeong Yeon Moo, the border security officer.

585
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:34,160
Right. You must be in-laws with the rumored Left State Minister.

586
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,530
If you gained an office by selling off your sister, you should study even if you made it in.

587
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:42,030
If she drowned herself, then what culprit are you speaking of?

588
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:46,420
And the evidence for that is a novel? None of that makes sense.

589
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:51,200
No one in this world would willingly drown themselves.

590
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:56,500
Tens of Hwa Rok's novels were found in the late Lee Cho Ok's room.

591
00:49:56,500 --> 00:50:01,480
There is nothing odd about a woman enjoying novels.

592
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,600
Hwa Rok's novels depict stories of noblemen disguised as servants

593
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:08,170
or about falling in love with the crown prince who is incognito. They're absurd.

594
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:12,330
Therefore, Lee Cho Ok avoided marriage due to her high standards.

595
00:50:12,330 --> 00:50:16,090
Judging that she committed suicide due to her pessimistic views of being an old maid

596
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:20,260

so we are looking for Hwa Rok for unlawful death.

597
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:25,670
Do you truly believe that Lee Cho Ok committed suicide because of a novel?

598
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:30,050
I am only obeying orders.

599
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:34,020
How could one work without thinking?

600
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,950
Bring me Lee Cho Ok's investigation records.

601
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:54,220

(Forensics)

602
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:02,580

(Forensics)

603
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,780
Here are Lee Cho Ok's investigation records.

604
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:35,230
Why are there so many wounds on someone who committed suicide?

605
00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:39,260
The autopsy states they were wounds from the river.

606
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:42,130
They are clearly stab wounds in my eyes.

607
00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:45,260
The depth of the wound is 1.8 poon.

608
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:47,550
A depth capable of immediate death.

609
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,710
Do you know a lot about autopsies?

610
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:59,620
I am the one who wrote the footnotes to that Sinjumuwonrok you so cherish.

611
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:04,750
Unlike the autopsy report, you believe that Lee Cho Ok did not die from suicide by drowning

612
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:08,740
but was stabbed to death and thrown into the river,

613
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,200
according to what you wrote on that paper.

614
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:15,260
Since you're investigating independently, you're not as incompetent as I thought.

615
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:17,860
That is a relief.

616
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:42,430
I have heard that Master Maeng's wife Jo is visiting this place.

617
00:52:42,430 --> 00:52:44,900
Inform her that I am asking to meet with her.

618
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,510
Please wait for a moment.

619
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:50,140
When did you look into that?

620
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:53,050
I find out through my wisdom.

621
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,140
Parents are most responsible for their children's marriages.

622
00:52:56,140 --> 00:53:00,700
If I tell the old maidens' mother that I will wed them to decent old bachelors,

623
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:03,390
I believe the problem will be resolved.

624
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:20,570
Are you Master Maeng's wife Jo of Namsan Village?

625
00:53:24,260 --> 00:53:26,050
Goodness.

626
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:31,570
In what way do I look like a wife?

627
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:36,080
No, I requested to meet with Madam Jo.

628
00:53:43,980 --> 00:53:47,220
I am his eldest daughter, Maeng Ha Na.

629
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:50,070
My mother is inside receiving acupuncture.

630
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:53,000
She is unwell and cannot meet with any outsiders.

631
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,120
She told me to ask what the matter was about.

632
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:59,180
I am an inspector who received royal orders to arrange marriages for you ladies.

633
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:03,460
I am here to relay the good news that

634
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:06,420
I am here to arrange marriages to good men for you.

635
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,980
 She's moved that she'll marry thanks to royal orders.

636
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:15,750
 She must have wanted to marry so much.

637
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:21,300
Are you saying that an outdated list of old bachelors is a list of good matches?

638
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:27,610
You're knowledgeable on Chinese characters for a woman.

639
00:54:27,610 --> 00:54:29,490
There must have been a misunderstanding.

640
00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:33,420
It is not that we could not wed but rather decided not to.

641
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,120
We do not need any help.

642
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,200
Come now. It's pitiful to see that a daughter of nobility is causing her parents agony.

643
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,540
What do you mean?

644
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:46,690
If not for disrespecting your parents, what would you call refusing to wed at an old age?

645
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:49,960
I can feel your mother's concern.

646
00:54:50,610 --> 00:54:54,740
Mother also does not desire for us to wed.

647
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:57,350
What kind of nonsense is this?

648
00:54:57,350 --> 00:55:01,920
What parent in all of Joseon wishes their children not to wed?

649
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,130
Sis.

650
00:55:06,910 --> 00:55:09,210
Mother is looking for you.

651
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:10,250
Yes, let's go.

652
00:55:10,250 --> 00:55:14,140
I am still speaking! Where are you going?

653
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:26,970
Sir, the only principle that comes before the principle of patriotism in Confucianism is filial duty.

654
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:30,300
To listen to a strange man who doesn't believe my words,

655
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:33,740
how could I delay tending to my sick mother?

656
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,200
It would be wrong.

657
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,420
Do you know that you are committing high treason?

658
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,930
According to the law, when a woman does not marry before she turns 24,

659
00:55:43,930 --> 00:55:48,170
unless you are impoverished, the parents are to be punished.

660
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:53,330
So, if you want to do due diligence for your parents,

661
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:58,070
you will need to wed the person I choose.

662
00:56:00,430 --> 00:56:03,150
Please do try.

663
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,120
Let's go.

664
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:23,790
That foolish lady put her pride first and continued to lie.

665
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:29,570
And the mayor simply accuses the issue of old maidens as society's structural problem!

666
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:33,730
The current state of Joseon is more than heartbreaking!

667
00:56:36,410 --> 00:56:38,210
Well, now what?

668
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,890
What do you mean now what?

669
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,550
I shall show them the severity of the law.

670
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,990
W-What is the matter?

671
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:03,930
We need to go somewhere together.

672
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:05,640
Oh, I see.

673
00:57:14,570 --> 00:57:16,860
Just come in. Come.

674
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,000
Y-Your Maj—

675
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,580
Y-You! Y-Your!

676
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,150
We are incognito right now. Just come in and sit.

677
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:30,020
Good god...

678
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,550
Pour.

679
00:57:48,550 --> 00:57:51,450
Oh, yes.

680
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,690
I really don't like him.

681
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:09,060
I said to take care of it quietly.

682
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:12,100
But you went to the mayor and just babbled away.

683
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,780
I was only following the order of the matter...

684
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:17,070
Are you talking back?

685
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:23,110
If I thought the mayor could do the job, why would I have ordered you?

686
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:27,040
Hey! I'm the king!

687
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,300
What am I saying?

688
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,730
The mayor is the right-hand man to the Left State Minister.

689
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,860
But how could you show all of our cards to him?

690
00:58:47,860 --> 00:58:50,210
You can rest assured about that.

691
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:56,430
They are foolish, so they would never think that I am working to hasten the crown prince's marriage.

692
00:58:56,430 --> 00:59:00,070
Prince Gyeongwoonjae came to me out of the blue

693
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:03,590
and suddenly made a fuss about marrying off the old maidens.

694
00:59:03,590 --> 00:59:06,280
What a mess it was.

695
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,370
Why does he care about marrying off the old maidens?

696
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,020
"Old maidens"?

697
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:17,370
That's what people call the daughters of Master Maeng Sang Cheon of Sungkyunkwan.

698
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,020
All three daughters are unwed old maidens.

699
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:25,440
So why is Gyeongwoonjae suddenly out to wed Maeng Ha Na?

700
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,340
Is there a reason for what Prince Gyeongwoonjae does?

701
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:32,310
He has a lot of time but nothing to do.

702
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:37,430
It is his hobby to go around the office and make appeals.

703
00:59:37,430 --> 00:59:42,600
But why is he so focused on Maeng Ha Na?

704
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,980
I am merely curious.

705
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,930
If you say you're an inspector and threaten her with the law,

706
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:01,570
you might be able to wed the first daughter.

707
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:06,700
Then what about the other two daughters? Are we to wait until they turn 24?

708
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,780
I gave you two months.

709
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:16,290
Well, from what I hear, the skilled matchmaker

710
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:20,840
could find a noble widow a virgin to wed.

711
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:26,480
How could a noblewoman vowed to monogamy remarry?

712
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,590
On top of that, with a virgin?

713
01:00:29,590 --> 01:00:33,260
I was just saying this as an example. What!

714
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:37,510
Don't you dare look me straight in my eyes!

715
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:47,410
Anyway, you are too inflexible and unaware. So useless.

716
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:51,990
You. Let's say your appeal gets accepted and you take public office.

717
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:55,960
Do you think you can make it out alive in this rough political world?

718
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,990
Good grief...

719
01:01:01,910 --> 01:01:03,570
Look.

720
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:07,120
If I had given you the poison that night,

721
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:10,330
incriminated Left State Minister and sent him to exile,

722
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:13,500
I could have had the crown prince marry.

723
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:19,110
But had I done that, I would have lost a lot more.

724
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,990
Jeong Woo...

725
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:24,610
Politics...

726
01:01:24,610 --> 01:01:29,110
is about losing less and gaining what you want.

727
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:32,980
Keep that in mind.

728
01:01:37,960 --> 01:01:40,640
Goodness, looks good.

729
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:44,260
The fire seems weak. They should replace the coal.

730
01:01:46,180 --> 01:01:49,820
Among the peddlers at the Hongwol merchants' inn, there is a skilled matchmaker.

731
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:52,180
 It couldn't be...

732
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:54,350
Yeojudaek.

733
01:01:54,350 --> 01:01:59,100
She is a talent who married off my troublemaker second son.

734
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:02,450
 A bad feeling is never wrong.

735
01:02:02,450 --> 01:02:04,400
I have asked her especially.

736
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,130
So go and meet her at the inn tomorrow.

737
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,210
- I will figure that out. 
 - How so?

738
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,580
Listen to me this time.

739
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:16,190
I especially asked Yeojudaek, who is very busy.

740
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:19,980
Make sure to recruit her even if you must pay extra.

741
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:27,280
Come and grill this meat.

742
01:02:29,470 --> 01:02:32,160
We need more coal.

743
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:39,110
Hwa Rok.

744
01:02:39,110 --> 01:02:42,490
I have plans, so please just tell me quickly...

745
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:45,540
or should I hear it next time?

746
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,580
Please be a matchmaker.

747
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:03,050
For whom?

748
01:03:05,870 --> 01:03:11,090
Have you heard of the old maidens of Namsam Village?

749
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,170
I have.

750
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:19,670
I ask that you wed the first and second daughters.

751
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,440
Wow...

752
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,410
What could this be?

753
01:03:23,410 --> 01:03:27,970
I cannot believe I was asked to set up old maidens this many times in the past two days.

754
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,990
You are the third person, Hwa Rok.

755
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:31,870
Who else asked?

756
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:35,570
  I ask that you help the inspector.

757
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,620
  How could a matchmaker like me help the inspector?

758
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,860
  The task is to wed the old maidens of Namsan Village.

759
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:45,500
  You can definitely help.

760
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,860
 A bad feeling is never wrong.

761
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,040
Could you tell me why you're requesting this matchmaking, Hwa Rok?

762
01:03:56,040 --> 01:04:01,460
O-Oh well, I know Maiden Maeng Ha Na quite well.

763
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:03,850
The nobleman who didn't fall for you

764
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:09,590
said he was an inspector fulfilling royal orders and said to wed any old bachelor he chooses.

765
01:04:09,590 --> 01:04:13,670
My sister reassured me that there would be no man who would want to wed her.

766
01:04:13,670 --> 01:04:17,050
But Sis is too clueless about the world.

767
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,390
Sis...

768
01:04:21,130 --> 01:04:26,040
Hwa Rok, are you an "old maiden"?

769
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,220
I knew you were a woman from the start.

770
01:04:29,220 --> 01:04:33,450
Whoa, Hwa Rok, you were an old maiden.

771
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:35,750
Well, then—

772
01:04:35,750 --> 01:04:39,090
O-Oh Hwa Rok...

773
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:40,450
why are you crying?

774
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:49,070
I am so surprised and worried that you spotted me right away.

775
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:56,010
I will keep the secret that you are Hwa Rok, so please do not worry.

776
01:04:56,010 --> 01:05:00,220
So to organize, since the lord who did not fall for me

777
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:03,110
said that he would wed your first sister to anyone,

778
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:07,670
you are requesting matchmaking because you are worried about your sister. ight?

779
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,430
Maiden?

780
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:18,920
Actually, that's not it.

781
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,230
It's because I want to wed!

782
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:27,860
My older sisters should get married, so I can also get married since I'm the youngest.

783
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:30,960
My sisters didn't even budge when an inspector threatened them.

784
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:34,320
I am here out of frustration!

785
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:38,290
Please marry off my older sisters.

786
01:05:38,290 --> 01:05:45,280
Also, please keep it a secret from my family that I requested the matchmaking.

787
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,400
Why so?

788
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:52,730
When I was 16, I wrote an agreement that I would never get married and live with them forever.

789
01:05:52,730 --> 01:05:55,740
Doesn't everyone think that when they are young?

790
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:00,730
But I don't want to die a virgin...

791
01:06:00,730 --> 01:06:03,920
without getting married.

792
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:09,220
Of course. You should wed.

793
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:12,650
That means you'll set up my sisters. Right?

794
01:06:12,650 --> 01:06:17,230
I will look for good matches for the three of you, including you, Hwa Rok.

795
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:19,100
Thank you.

796
01:06:21,550 --> 01:06:23,490
Just trust in me.

797
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:29,740
Gosh...

798
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:35,860
She would refuse if she saw me.

799
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,540
I wonder how rude you were to her...

800
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:41,420
I should have gone with you then.

801
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,980
First, please apologize when the matchmaker comes.

802
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,800
Why should I? I did nothing wrong!

803
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:54,020
Please do as I say.

804
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,230
You probably are not very aware, Your Excellency.

805
01:06:56,230 --> 01:07:01,010
Most women forgive as long as you apologize. So...

806
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:04,370
How dare you say I am unaware.

807
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:09,420
Who is really the one who does not know the rules and boundaries?

808
01:07:25,330 --> 01:07:28,570
Enough! I immediately...

809
01:07:38,650 --> 01:07:41,140
would like to apologize. I am sorry about last time.

810
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:43,530
I will set up the old maidens.

811
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,750
♫  I don't know what's happening  ♫

812
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:07,180
♫  My world changed the day you arrived  ♫

813
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,430
♫  I don't know how I feel  ♫

814
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:15,300
♫  It's my first time, so I'm unsure of this feeling  ♫

815
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,620
♫  Is it love?  ♫

816
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,480

817
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:30,240
♫  My heart races and aches from the moment I met you  ♫

818
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,500
♫  To me, you're my other half  ♫

819
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:38,820
  The timeline is in two months, and I do every step with you, Sir.

820
01:08:38,820 --> 01:08:41,560
  Get away from me, please!

821
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,140
  I came to help your daughters get married.

822
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,330
  You came in vain.

823
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,050
  Do you know who Ssangyeonsulsa is?

824
01:08:47,050 --> 01:08:48,380
  Ssangyeonsulsa.

825
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,840
  I must be... Ssangyeonsulsa.

826
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:53,930
  I wondered if anyone had looked for geumjam poison in the past.

827
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:56,150
  Prince Gyeongwoonjae is definitely on our side.

828
01:08:56,150 --> 01:08:59,820
  The most definite people will also become our biggest foes if they turn their backs.

829
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,360
  I must search inside the house.

830
01:09:03,480 --> 01:09:08,310
♫  No matter how hard I try, in my head  ♫

831
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:15,870

832
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,730
