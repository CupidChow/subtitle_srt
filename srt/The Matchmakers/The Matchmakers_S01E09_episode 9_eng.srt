1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,960

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,420

3
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:24,800

4
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:47,040

5
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,430

6
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,800

When he wanted to see me at the ferry dock out of nowhere,

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,290
I actually was worried he might confess his love for me.

8
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,110
You know that feeling a dock gives.

9
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,710
Like love on the run.

10
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:15,200
How could I—

11
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,060
not know His Excellency likes me?

12
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,680
I am quite keen on those things.

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,810
Oh—

14
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,200
I do not though.

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,680
I cannot forget my late husband for the rest of my life.

16
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,430

The night the star fell,

17
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,080

at the inn,

18
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,600
she lied that I was the first man to ask her name.

19
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,240
I think this sense of betrayal shocked me

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,350
more than the fact that she was a murderer.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,380
Give her funds for her escape?

22
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,280
That was the rest of the payment for matchmaking!

23
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,130
A man's words are worth a thousand pounds of gold.

24
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,420
The contract did not say she would not get paid if she was a murderer.

25
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,420
The reason I did not report her is...

26
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,360
I do not know, either!

27
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,380

28
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,860
How long did you think you could hide your identity?

29
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,000
H-How did you find out?

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,200
- Well, the thing is... 
 - I really hoped it would not be true...

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,520
You made me feel extremely betrayed.

32
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,460
Our matchmaking contract is over as of this moment.

33
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,150
Your Excellency, let me explain—

34
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,420
What explanation?

35
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,470
What excuse can you give me when you are a murderer?

36
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,220
- Sorry? 
 - I told you I am matchmaking as per a royal decree.

37
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,310
But you dared to deceive an inspector?

38
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,720
Forget it.

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,600
It is my fault for choosing the wrong person.

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,860
Do not ever...

41
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:22,850
Do not ever show your face in front of me.

42
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,130
Wait, Your Excellency!

43
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,970
What is this?

44
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,450
The rest of the payment for matchmaking.

45
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,180
What—

46
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,040
Gosh, he is a complete fool.

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,250
His Excellency still had a soft spot for you,

48
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,100
so he did not report you and gave you a chance to escape.

49
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,900
So be thankful.

50
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:54,430
Right.

51
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,160
Everyone thinks I am Yeojudaek.

52
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,620
Wait! By the way, who did I murder, to be exact?

53
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,380
Are you acting like you do not know?

54
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,470
You planned the murder of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor with your husband eight years ago.

55
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:11,150
The bounty hunter even came to the merchants' inn to catch you.

56
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:17,100
Could you be talking about the incident where the Left State Minister's eldest son was killed?

57
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,830
Looks like you finally remember.

58
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:22,360
Now that you got paid, never show yourself again in front of His Excellency.

59
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,260
If you ever show up, I will report you then.

60
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,200
 Yeojudaek, listen.

61
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,540
 There is a bounty hunter who is looking for you.

62
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,860
 So, do not come back even after your job is done.

63
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:46,910
 I will make time and take Bok Hee to Hamgyeong-do soon.

64
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,230
Did you know all along, Boss?

65
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,950
Did you know Yeojudaek was the one who killed...

66
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,330
my husband's older brother?

67
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:07,500
You know better than anyone that Yeojudaek is not someone who can kill people.

68
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,570
I do.

69
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,970
But why is a bounty hunter looking for Yeojudaek?

70
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,120
She was falsely accused, so her husband died,

71
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,220
and she escaped prison by Heaven's luck one day before being sent to Hanyang.

72
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,880
That is all I know.

73
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:27,800
That means the actual murderer was not caught.

74
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,880
Exactly.

75
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,300
Where can I look into what happened eight years ago?

76
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,290
Do not worry!

77
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:46,230
I only got help from a skilled veteran since I have never done matchmaking.

78
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:51,680
I know the method and the principle now, so I can make it work by myself.

79
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,300
I told you not to worry, but you are looking at me with pity.

80
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,980
Why? What is it?

81
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,240
Well, I am worried about your feelings.

82
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:11,330
M-My feelings?

83
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:16,680
Are you mistaken in thinking I gave my personal feelings to Yeojudaek?

84
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,960
That is complete nonsense!

85
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,660
Your Excellency, wait for me!

86
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,200
Gosh, what are you going to ask me this time?

87
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,460
Tell me about when my brother-in-law passed away eight years ago.

88
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,150
You finally heard that rumor, huh?

89
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:48,880
What do you mean by "that rumor"?

90
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:54,500
H-How Madam received the Virtuous Woman's Memorial Gate by killing her oldest daughter-in-law.

91
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,150
Gosh, how frightening.

92
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:58,430
Not that nonsense of a rumor.

93
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,210
Do you know anything about the murder of my brother-in-law?

94
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,370
Not sure.

95
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,320
It has been too long, and it happened in Pyeongyang.

96
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:16,800
I heard a merchant couple killed him while trying to steal silver ingots.

97
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,720
A merchant killed a government official in his official residence for silver ingots?

98
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,120
This is very strange.

99
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,200
 There is nothing better for inner peace than drawing orchids.

100
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,050
  Wow, the drawings! Awesome!

101
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,220
  You are even skilled at drawing.

102
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,270
  There is nothing you cannot do, Your Excellency.

103
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:16,300
 According to Sir Yulgok's "Battling Foolishness,"

104
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:22,130
 he said to organize your thoughts by reading "Great Learning" when your mind is chaotic.

105
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,740
The murder of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor from eight years ago is...

106
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,820
Right. The case where my brother-in-law was murdered when he was Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor.

107
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,690
Why are you curious about it suddenly?

108
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:54,890
Do you remember saving a newlywed bride, a peddler, when we were coming back

109
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:58,610
from meeting Father at Hamgyeong-do by Taedong River eight years ago?

110
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:02,800
 Orabeoni! Look, wake up! Oh, no...

111
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,050
That peddler is the murderer of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor from eight years ago?

112
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,700
No, but she was falsely accused.

113
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,830
Where is that merchant right now?

114
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,110
Well...

115
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:19,330
When my husband passed away,

116
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,880
I was staying at our parents' house briefly. Right?

117
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,160

Back then, I could only think about wanting to die every day.

118
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,140
If I die, I thought I could meet my husband again.

119
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,120
You are...

120
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,440
That child is...

121
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:58,070
the one I had in my womb when you saved me in Pyeongyang.

122
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,670
You are pretty, just like your mother.

123
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,120
Now that my husband has passed away,

124
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,030
for whom would I put on makeup?

125
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,840
For yourself.

126
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:41,320
I consider Yeojudaek to be a gift from my late husband.

127
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,420
That is when it started.

128
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,480
My matchmaking business in Yeojudaek's name.

129
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,920
Where is Yeojudaek right now?

130
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,040
I cannot tell you.

131
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,260
However, she is not in Hanyang, fortunately.

132
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,640
How did you know she was the culprit of the case from eight years ago?

133
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,710
I think a bounty hunter is after her.

134
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,330
You met a bounty hunter?

135
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:06,860
It would have been better if I met the bounty hunter.

136
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,710
Prince Gyeongwoonjae found out.

137
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,220
Prince Gyeongwoonjae thinks you are a murderer

138
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,710
and he just let you go?

139
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:19,400
Orabeoni, I will take care of that, so just look into the murder case from eight years ago.

140
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,270
If Yeojudaek was falsely accused, it means the real culprit was not caught.

141
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,560
Should I bring you dinner?

142
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,450
No need.

143
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,520
I think the breakfast is still sitting in my stomach.

144
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:46,910
You did not even have breakfast!

145
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,060
If you quit eating like that, you will be in big trouble!

146
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,710
Gosh, take your leave!

147
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,110
I want to be alone.

148
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:03,290
I said I want to be alone, so why are you bothering me like this?

149
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,600
Oh, my. My goodness.

150
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,060
In my opinion,

151
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,560
I think you are lovesick.

152
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,540
You were also aware of your illness, right?

153
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:25,330
Lovesickness is also a sickness, so there must be a cure.

154
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:29,830
You think too much about the person in your head because you cannot see her even if you want to.

155
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,160
So it gives you a hard time.

156
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,250
It is that kind of sickness, so there is no cure besides going to

157
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,070
the person and meeting her in person.

158
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,060
I-It really cannot be treated with medicine and stuff?

159
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,550
That is enough. I am okay.

160
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,770
If it worsens, you will die.

161
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:52,940
So, if it is not too much trouble, your h-hand, your hand...

162
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,190
Your hand. Right here.

163
00:12:55,190 --> 00:13:00,880
Go and meet the person who gave you the balsam nail dyeing here.

164
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,550
That is the cure.

165
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,870
Sister,

166
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:14,120
you said you can tell if two people are a good fit or not when you see them. Right?

167
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
Yes.

168
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,640
Why did you connect the second eldest daughter of Master Maeng with a farmer?

169
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,890
- Because they are a good fit. 
 - In what way and how?

170
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,110
- Because they are a good fit. 
 - In what way and how?

171
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,710
What is with this sudden interest?

172
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,670
Well, it is just because she is notorious for having a bad temper.

173
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:42,210
So, I was curious.

174
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:46,080
That is what the rumor says, but when you meet her in person,

175
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,060
she is very much like you.

176
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,350
Like me? No way.

177
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,620
I only say the most polite things.

178
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,510
She is assertive and wise like you.

179
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,070
The scholar who farms might look brusque, but he is considerate and understanding.

180
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,410
So they are a good fit.

181
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:08,310
If that is the case, he would have also been a good fit for me.

182
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,190
You would not endure it, Ye Jin.

183
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:15,580
So do not be too upset about it.

184
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,500
Wait! Did you know about it already?

185
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,440
About what?

186
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,320
That you like the scholar who farms?

187
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,650
In fact, I did feel there was something between you two.

188
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,090
 But when I saw you at the inn that day...

189
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,760
C-Congrats.

190
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,190
You are finally getting married.

191
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:36,660
At least you did not become an old bachelor.

192
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,680
 I thought it strange and looked at the list of old bachelors.

193
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,560
 And that scholar lived next to your maternal grandparents' house.

194
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,210
That is how I found out.

195
00:14:47,210 --> 00:14:50,110
But why did you pretend not to know?

196
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:53,690
Because you already decided your heart.

197
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:55,500
Am I wrong?

198
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:01,890
It might feel sadder and more regretful because you two cannot be together.

199
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:20,760
Where are you headed when you are sick?

200
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,180
To the swings at the marketplace.

201
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,890
Why the swings this early in the morning?

202
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:26,690
Why else would I go to the swings other than ride the swings?

203
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:28,570
Gosh, you even let go of your sanity now.

204
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:32,000
I will find and bring Yeojudaek, so pull yourself together, please!

205
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,560
You will bring who?

206
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:35,540
Well, the thing is...

207
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,590
t-this is the rest of the payment I gave Yeojudaek at the dock.

208
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:45,420
But Yeojudaek gave it to the innkeeper to be returned to you.

209
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:48,090
Are you saying Yeojudaek is still in Hanyang?

210
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,800
Did you not say the bounty hunter is camping outside her home and the inn?

211
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,780
Yeojudaek is so well-trusted by Bukchon madams,

212
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,120
so she must be hiding in one of their homes.

213
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,300
- So I will find her and— 
 - No need!

214
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,460
Why would I meet a criminal?

215
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,350
We need to fix your sickness!

216
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,870
Physician Yu said you might die if you do not see her!

217
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,210
Who are you saying will die?

218
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,500
I studied medicine longer than Physician Yu did.

219
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,340
Lovesickness is a sickness of the heart.

220
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,760
If I make myself busy enough not to think about Yeojudaek,

221
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,810
lovesickness can be cured.

222
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,250
Gosh.

223
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,600
Goodness.

224
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,610

225
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:33,360
No, I told you to fold your knees when going back, did I not?

226
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,090
Going back?

227
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,140
I did not know when I was watching, but it is harder than I thought.

228
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,370
Do you not really want to marry Lady Ha Na?

229
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:48,170
I do want to, but...

230
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:50,470
I am glad I did not get the swings.

231
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:53,270
I am terrified of high places.

232
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:56,710
Oh, I see.

233
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,990
Let's give it a go with me.

234
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:03,540
If your body gets used to the feeling, it will help get rid of your fear.

235
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,420
Sit and stand! Sit now.

236
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,110
Stand up! Sit down!

237
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:13,380
Lean back, and now sit down!

238
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,500
This time, stand up. It is not over yet.

239
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,690
- I understand how it works! 
  - Sit down.

240
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,120
 - You can stop! 
 - Sit down!

241
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,740
Wait.

242
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,180
One of the two men riding the swing together,

243
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,920
- is it not Gyeongwoonjae? 
  - Stand up!

244
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,370
He looks very happy.

245
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,510
- Do you happen to have a sword? 
 - A sword?

246
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,860
- I-I do not. 
 - Wow...

247
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,980
Seeing such a thing does not shock me anymore now.

248
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:39,840
Goodness, I need to close my eyes and walk for a moment.

249
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,040
- Yes. 
 - Hurry up now.

250
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,090
I do not fear anything anymore!

251
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,720
No more!

252
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,090
To the Madam's house?

253
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,210
All right.

254
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:54,280
Also, among the matchmakers,

255
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,970
there is a rumor that His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae will marry off all the old maidens by May.

256
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,650
All three of them?

257
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,090
Oh, that's right!

258
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:05,560
The one helping His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae with matchmaking

259
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,790
is Yeojudaek, who set up Lady Ye Jin.

260
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,410
I heard all of their matches were chosen.

261
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:20,320
After Dano, the grooms will send the acceptance letters.

262
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:25,640
I was worried because I could not make connections for my daughters.

263
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,530
Thank you.

264
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,900
Did you also do matchmaking in secret for your family like me?

265
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:37,660
Since it is noticeable, it cannot be helped.

266
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:42,810
You are right. It is hard to just pass by after seeing a good connection.

267
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:47,960
Do you also see the string between a man and a woman who are destined to be together?

268
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,820
- Sorry? 
 - Other matchmakers hear sounds or

269
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:54,750
recognize fate with energies from their bodies.

270
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,650
I was wondering how you recognize them.

271
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:02,240
I recognize them with reasoning.

272
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:09,450
Is one able to find out if they are a matchmaker or not?

273
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,450
You cannot be unaware,

274
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,210
fter you've been through so much...

275
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,370
you cannot refuse to match people because you cannot get it off your mind.

276
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,210
Is it not so?

277
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,910
It is true I cannot stop matchmaking, but...

278
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,630

Gosh, you should not have gone all-out.

279
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,900
Must we go this far?

280
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,020
Earning a woman's heart is not so easy.

281
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,860
You just need to teach this man the techniques of wrestling.

282
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,930
He cannot practice with me right away.

283
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,680
He needs a partner to practice with.

284
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,090
I am also not a novice because I learned from the books.

285
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,250
Do I have to do it?

286
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,960
In that case, could I try wrestling against him?

287
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,400
I plan to compete at the wrestling competition this coming Dano.

288
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,390
But I only watched people compete and never participated.

289
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,150
You are the one who was dating in broad daylight at Bukchon...

290
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,670
Do you know me?

291
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,380
Never mind.

292
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:25,040
I am the only one smart enough to remember.

293
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,710
Well, then. You two can go ahead.

294
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,670
Ready.

295
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:36,250
Is this also your first time at wrestling?

296
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,590
Start!

297
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:41,700
- Hold on tight and... 
 - Grab his waist and...

298
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:48,470
This man is a professional.

299
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,130
I was the only first-timer, huh?

300
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:04,480

He only has to sit and watch women washing hair from here?

301
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,090
I am really envious.

302
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:12,510
I fear heights, so I am unsure if I will do well on Dano.

303
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,510
Fear of heights can be treated with exposure therapy.

304
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,320
So practice looking down from this place twice a day, starting today.

305
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,920
Oh, did I tell you about the wedding day?

306
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,500
According to an official who works in Gwansanggam I know well, 
  (Joseon's government body that read fortunes and astrology)

307
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:32,530
this year's May 25th is a fortunate day that comes every 300 years.

308
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:36,460
If you marry that day, three generations will prosper, so I thought you should get married that day.

309
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,930
What do you all think?

310
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:43,250
If it is from Gwansanggam, it must be certain.

311
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:50,080
The date does not matter to me.

312
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,620
Well, even if it is a fortunate day,

313
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,460
next month's 25th day is too soon.

314
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,530
That's right! You said your home is in the countryside.

315
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,040
Yes.

316
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,820
Gosh, do I have to tell you this?

317
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,300
I had the Gwansanggam read your fortunes to help your marriages.

318
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:16,020
Number 12, if you do not get married by June this year,

319
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,390
you will not meet another match for seven years.

320
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:25,890
After s-seven years, I will be almost 40.

321
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,690
Now that I think about it, if I make an urgent request to the mail carrier,

322
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,900
I can notify my home in five days.

323
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,670
So, May 25th should be no problem for me to get married.

324
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,230
Yes...

325
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,310
Sir, you did really well.

326
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:50,040
I can be good at anything once I get a hang of it.

327
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,520
Gosh!

328
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,400
Gosh, seriously!

329
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,560
Goodness.

330
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,510
Forget her. I can forget her.

331
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,520
I can forget her. Yes, I can erase her.

332
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,860
- G-Gosh, gosh. 
 - I can erase her. Yes, I can!

333
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,430
I can forget her, I can.

334
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,720
You can go ahead and tell me.

335
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,470
According to an official who works in Gwansanggam I know well,

336
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,960
this year's May 25th is a fortunate day that comes every 300 years.

337
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,600
If you marry that day, he said three generations will prosper.

338
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,870
- So that day should be— 
 - He is a fraud.

339
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,520
Getting married on a fortunate day will let three generations prosper?

340
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:51,560
Inspector, sir, you did not pay to hear such nonsense, did you?

341
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,210
No way. I am sure he is not that naïve.

342
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,360
I told you the Gwangsanggam story will not work for the maidens.

343
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,770
Did you forget?

344
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:15,330
Why did you come only now?

345
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,960
Do you know how hard it was for me alone—

346
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,110
Goodness, goodness, again.

347
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:25,710
I am seeing things again.

348
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:30,990
By the way, why are you not with Yeojudaek?

349
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,800
Are you crying right now?

350
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,500
Who are you saying is crying?

351
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,690
Something went into my eyes and made me cry. That is all.

352
00:24:55,690 --> 00:25:00,460
Anyhow, the wedding will take place on the 25th day of next month, so keep that in mind!

353
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,740
Your Excellency!

354
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:15,760
He cried?

355
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,870
He really cried.

356
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,880
He cries too easily for a man.

357
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,370
The inspector left just now in tears.

358
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,240
In tears?

359
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,790
I mean, he said something went in his eye.

360
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:38,320
I got it, so you can go back outside now.

361
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,410
I still have things to discuss with Yeojudaek.

362
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:46,220
Oh, okay.

363
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,970
The wedding will take place on the 25th day of next month?

364
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,090
That is correct.

365
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:02,920
I cannot accompany the Inspector due to personal circumstances,

366
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,440
but I will make sure the maidens' marriages will not be affected.

367
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,210
Which family are you from?

368
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,000
I will keep your secret, so do not worry.

369
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:25,190
I am the Left State Minister's second daughter-in-law.

370
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:29,740
From the first time I met you, I was wondering.

371
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,930
But I was right.

372
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:34,030
Do you know me?

373
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:39,330
Before I lost my sight, you were the last pair I matched.

374
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:42,970
I did not marry my husband through matchmaking.

375
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:48,440
You met your husband at the bookstore for the first time, did you not?

376
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,390
Scholar, sir.

377
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,890
Someone is waiting for you inside the bookstore.

378
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,610
B-Book—

379
00:27:55,950 --> 00:28:01,220
 You two were such a perfect pair, so I had to connect you two.

380
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:21,840
 Back then, I did not realize you would be the last couple I would match as a matchmaker.

381
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:37,570
 [Gyeongwoonjae

382
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,060
 My husband is certainly my destiny.

383
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:45,460
 So, I am sure I am a passing wind for you as well, Your Excellency.

384
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:50,980
 So, please do not struggle too much because of me.

385
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,690

386
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:27,490
  If all the weddings do not take place by the end of May,

387
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:31,050
  you will have to pay back twice the signing fee you received.

388
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,170
  Do you understand?

389
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:36,690
  Let us chant the operation's name to wish for success.

390
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:49,670
 Though I do not want to admit it,

391
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:55,640
 my life has been completely destroyed because of Yeojudaek.

392
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,950

393
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,140
What brings you all the way here this early in the morning?

394
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,290
Huh?

395
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,620
You also know about Ssangyeonsulsas, Your Excellency?

396
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,880
I thought only my mother knew about them.

397
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,990
Goodness, forget that.

398
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:20,520
Explain why you came first because I am a bit tired.

399
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:24,840
Why did you fight with Yeojudaek?

400
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:30,410
Am I in the position to fight with Yeojudaek?

401
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,110
I told her to stay out of matchmaking due to complicated circumstances.

402
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,450
So, I will do it alone until the wedding day.

403
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:39,100
That is not true.

404
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,130
When you came by, Yeojudaek was also at my house to tell us the wedding date.

405
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:50,760
The day I went to your house, Yeojudaek was also there?

406
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,420
You two did fight, seeing how you are both avoiding each other!

407
00:30:56,360 --> 00:31:00,820
If it is because you are being prideful since Yeojudaek is coming to my house today,

408
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:04,450
you should also pretend not to know, come to apologize, and makeup with her.

409
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:08,200
Why would I apologize when Yeojudaek is the one to blame?

410
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,270
You miss her.

411
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,880
Enough to make you cry.

412
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,150
Your Excellency.

413
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,970
What?

414
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,260
Man, this is going to get cold.

415
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:45,440
Gosh, he is not here, either. Where the heck did he go? I am so anxious—

416
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:50,190
 Hyungnim. Hyungnim.

417
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,630
Wait, that man— He came again.

418
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:59,300
Excuse me, I heard you are looking for Yeojudaek.

419
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,580
Do not hang out here and go to the old maidens—

420
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,990
Try Master Maeng's home in Namsan Village.

421
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:08,410
Yeojudaek is matchmaking that family's maidens.

422
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,660
Why is he so serious?

423
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,990
To turn your first-sight fates into destinies,

424
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:31,610
you will ride the swings, watch wrestling, and wash your hair in sweet flag water on Dano.

425
00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:35,520
Why make such a big deal out of things we have always been doing on Dano?

426
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,620
You have been doing them all the time but need skills this time.

427
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,110
Lady Du Ri, hand honey water to Number 24 after watching wrestling matches.

428
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,510
 [A summer thirst-quenching drink made by mixing herbal medicine and honey.)

429
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,070
Gosh, ew!

430
00:33:00,070 --> 00:33:01,650
I think my body is already petrified.

431
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:05,740
But a promise is still a promise, so you must do it.

432
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,600
Poor me.

433
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:13,690
Lady Sam Soon, you will be washing your hair in Suseongdong Valley.

434
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:16,270
I told Yeojudaek I would do the hairwashing.

435
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:21,240
I always wanted to try washing my hair in Suseongdong Valley before getting married!

436
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,040
Sam Soon, should I teach you how you can do everything you want before getting married?

437
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,770
Yes, teach me.

438
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,040
Just don't get married.

439
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,650
Washing your hair at Suseongdong Valley is the hardest skill.

440
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,910
So, you will be practicing hard with me starting today.

441
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:45,850
Yes, I am completely ready. What should I do first?

442
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,400
For now, I will tell you after the water is ready.

443
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,680
When you wash and comb your hair...

444
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,310
- You are confident you will do well. Right? 
 - Yes.

445
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,720
- My, my! 
 - Hurry up and run away!

446
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:24,850
The bounty hunter is coming here to get you!

447
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,800
Bounty hunter?

448
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,060
Hide in that room.

449
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:36,310
What are you doing standing around? Hurry up!

450
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:39,490
Wait! She cannot go in that room—

451
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,800
I guess there is no reason she cannot...

452
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,650
 Who are you?

453
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,850
 W-Who is it?

454
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,880
I am okay.

455
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,360
Do you think I am worried about you?

456
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:03,860
Don't drive His Excellency crazy by getting caught by the bounty hunter before these marriages are set!

457
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,380
This place is just as dangerous.

458
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:09,230
Great. Hide in there.

459
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:12,790
Hurry up now! Quickly! Go in!

460
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,970
The thing is—

461
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:23,150
Do not get any weird ideas.

462
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:26,110
I am only doing this to save myself.

463
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,740
I will go outside.

464
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,480
W-Wait! Where do you think you are going?

465
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,140
He said the bounty hunter is outside right now.

466
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,660
Do not be hasty.

467
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,380
Is your chest hurting again?

468
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,840
Rather than die without seeing you,

469
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,760
I would rather die after seeing you.

470
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,990
Who the heck is that nobody?

471
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,670
W-Where do you think you are barging into?

472
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,420
Before I report you to the government office—

473
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,760
Leave, please.

474
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,420
I am looking for a person.

475
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,690
Y-Yeojudaek is not here.

476
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,130
Did you not say you did not know Yeojudaek at the inn before?

477
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,650
W-Well...

478
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,460
t-the thing is...

479
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,250
Back then—

480
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:12,130
Move aside, or you will get hurt.

481
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:14,770
There is really no one inside. Really.

482
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,620
Who is causing this commotion in my house?

483
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:26,830
Mother, I saw Officer on the way.

484
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:29,080
I will bring him here.

485
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,650
Looks like today is not the day.

486
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,320
Gosh, that scared me.

487
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,650
The bluff about the Officer was pretty good.

488
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,550
It was not a bluff.

489
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,590
I saw the Officer on the way home.

490
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:54,390
The Officer is in our neighborhood?

491
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,580
No, I forgot it all.

492
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,130
I plan to fall for Scholar Number 24.

493
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:02,800
No, I already fell for him.

494
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,570
Why is a bounty hunter after Yeojudaek?

495
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:10,120
Looks like there is a misunderstanding, so no need to fuss about it.

496
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:27,340
I think the bounty hunter left.

497
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,290
Why did you not leave Hanyang?

498
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:49,590
Because the maidens' matchmaking is not over.

499
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:55,530
If you look the other way, I will leave right after this match is over.

500
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:02,170
For a mere murderer, you seek to keep your word?

501
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,430
I was wrong for hiding my identity with you,

502
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,900
but I did not commit murder.

503
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:13,600
I was falsely accused.

504
00:39:16,010 --> 00:39:21,750
If you want to continue the matchmaking, come and reside at Gyeongwoonjae.

505
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:26,140
- What do you mean— 
 - I heard you cannot even go home because of the bounty hunter.

506
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,920
I have a safe place to stay, so do not worry.

507
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,150
It is because i-it is killing me. It is me.

508
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:37,620
Will you trust me when I say...

509
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:42,830
I became lovesick because I fell in love with you?

510
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,080
There is no cure for lovesickness other than seeing you adequately.

511
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:10,040
If a talented person like me dies from missing you, what a loss would it be for Joseon?

512
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,490
Your Excellency, I am—

513
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:15,450
Since you were falsely accused, I will not pry about your past.

514
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:17,940
I will also take care of the bounty hunter.

515
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,900
You just need to...

516
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:23,430
come to Gyeongwoonjae.

517
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:30,110
I will not go there.

518
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,440
F-For what reason?

519
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,500
Because I do not...

520
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:42,870
have romantic feelings for you.

521
00:40:45,730 --> 00:40:48,180
Oh, w-well...

522
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,870
Y-You do not like me?

523
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,660
Do you really want to see me die from being lovesick for you?

524
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:02,900
Your Excellency, are you not Joseon's smartest and most righteous scholar?

525
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:08,360
So, I am certain you will overcome lovesickness for someone like me.

526
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:25,100
I will go home for the day.

527
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,600
Please tell Madam I will stop by again next time.

528
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,540
Yes, get home safe.

529
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,660
Why are you certain about my feelings as you please?

530
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,170
W-Whoa, Your Excellency, are you okay?

531
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:01,490
Gosh, how could he be okay?

532
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:06,510
He was rejected way more harshly than the way Officer rejected me.

533
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,730
Maeng Sam Soon, are you getting rejected here and there?

534
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,640
I-It is not like that!

535
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,720
Inspector, Mother wants to see you.

536
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,140
You were startled by the bounty hunter who came to your house. Right?

537
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,710
I will make sure this will not happen again.

538
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:35,720
I heard from my daughter that Yeojudaek is suffering from a misunderstanding.

539
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:39,150
About that... it's okay, so do not worry.

540
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:45,080
Could I ask you why you trust Yeojudaek so much?

541
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:50,880
She is a Ssangyeonsulsa who recognizes fates.

542
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,970
Do Ssangyeonsulsas never commit crimes?

543
00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:00,270
The reason I wanted to see you is

544
00:43:00,270 --> 00:43:04,270
to tell you not to interfere and just watch since my daughters' matchmaking

545
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:08,480
was entrusted to Yeojudaek in the first place.

546
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,200
This matter was bestowed upon by His Majesty in the first place.

547
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:16,930
- I cannot help but get involved. 
 - In that case, just do your job.

548
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,770
Get rid of your feelings for Yeojudaek.

549
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:29,370
You know better than anyone that you two cannot be together.

550
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:36,340
Most of all, forcing your feelings on the other person is not love.

551
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,860
  Y-You do not like me?

552
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:56,720
  Do you really want to see me die from being lovesick for you?

553
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,440
He would not actually die and stuff. Right?

554
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:05,470
No way.

555
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,490
He has always been dramatic.

556
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:13,750
Who are you calling dramatic?

557
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,630
Gosh, you scared me!

558
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,520
What are you doing?

559
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,600
Why are you wiping the floor so much?

560
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:25,490
You are not even letting me take a break in secret.

561
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,700
Gosh.

562
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,970
Just how much did she hear?

563
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,760
Where are you going at this hour?

564
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,630
I am going to the Royal Justice Bureau.

565
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,000
Why are you going there?

566
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,300
I will look into the murder of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor from eight years ago.

567
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:50,720
I hoped he gave up after being rejected harshly, but I was wrong.

568
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,050
Your Excellency!

569
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,350
What brings you here, Your Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

570
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,440
There is something I must look into.

571
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,900
So, bring me the interrogation documents for the case of Jo In Hyeon from the Year of the Yellow Rat.

572
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:09,600
Well, the thing is...

573
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:20,960
Hanseongbu's Officer asked for the same document. What should we do?

574
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:30,450
Why are you looking into an incident from eight years ago?

575
00:45:30,450 --> 00:45:33,900
I do not think there is a reason I must answer you.

576
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Did Yeojudaek ask you to look into the murder of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor from eight years ago?

577
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,180
Your face says I am right.

578
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:48,680
You must also know Yeojudaek is the culprit of the said case, then?

579
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:53,440
I am trying to look into it because it seems Yeojudaek was falsely accused.

580
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,020
What exactly is your relationship with Yeojudaek that you are going this far?

581
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,510
I saved that merchant's life eight years ago in Pyeongyang.

582
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:09,080
So, you lied about not knowing Yeojudaek during Lady Ha Na's Sinmungo incident.

583
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:15,570
I also have something to ask.

584
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,320
You believe principles to be of utmost importance,

585
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:23,240
why are you investigating separately like this instead of reporting Yeojudaek,

586
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,440
who you know is a criminal?

587
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:32,300
That reason requires a complicated personal explanation, so I will not answer.

588
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:39,400
However, since we seem to have the same objective, let us work together on this case.

589
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,260
I will be counting on you, then.

590
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,420
Thank you.

591
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,630
Thank you!

592
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:57,200
Madam! Young Madam!

593
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:01,450
Here.

594
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,280
 Yeojudaek, listen.

595
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,950
 Normal people would have lost their minds and be physically ill at your evil behavior.

596
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:17,540
 But I lived 25 years with the upright mind of a scholar, so I did not falter.

597
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:19,290
 I digress.

598
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:21,260
 I am sending you this letter

599
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:25,260
 to give you a chance to explain why you claim you are not guilty.

600
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:28,770
 Come to Gyeongwoonjae tomorrow.

601
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,680
Come to Gyeongwoonjae, not even the inn?

602
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,490
It looks like an excuse to see me.

603
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:46,060
It would be better not to go, right?

604
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:49,150
It will be harder for him to forget me after seeing me.

605
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,930

606
00:47:56,930 --> 00:48:00,110
M-Mother, what brings you here?

607
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,850
I heard you found

608
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:08,250
small plots of farmland that have been missing after seeing the farmlands in person.

609
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:10,650
I found out after taking a look because

610
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:13,010
its shape was different from what was on the property deed.

611
00:48:13,010 --> 00:48:16,470
And how did you take care of it?

612
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,250
First off, I only told the tenant farmer I am aware and

613
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:26,160
told him to use the small plots as he has been using them.

614
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,190
Why did you do that after going through the trouble to find out?

615
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:34,970
I looked at the past ledgers, and the harvest would not differ much without the said plots.

616
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:40,350
And it looked like he worked harder because of those small plots.

617
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,940
I understand.

618
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,330
However, you must manage it to the end without forgetting.

619
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,330
Yes, Mother.

620
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:00,790
Orabeoni.

621
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,320

622
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:07,930
Why would you tell me to come to this place, too?

623
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:12,310
His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae said he will report you if I did not bring you over.

624
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:14,790
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

625
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,820
I go through so much not to run into him, even during matchmaking.

626
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,250
Why?

627
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,920
Huh? I mean—

628
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:26,700
Never mind. Just go and tell him you do not remember, and come out quickly.

629
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:30,140
All right.

630
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:39,220

631
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:09,610
Officer, please take a seat.

632
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,770
You should also sit.

633
00:50:14,790 --> 00:50:17,450
The reason I called you over is

634
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:21,720
to find the real culprit of the death of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor in the Year of the Yellow Rat.

635
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,790
Yeojudaek, you claim to have been falsely accused. Tell me the full story about the incident.

636
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:37,460
Eight years ago, I fell into the Taedong River while running away.

637
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,400
I did survive, thanks to the Officer back then,

638
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,560
but I lost all prior memories,

639
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:46,590
so I do not know anything about the situation.

640
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:53,350
I thought memory loss only happened in novels.

641
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,650
How are you certain you are not guilty when you have lost your memories?

642
00:50:57,650 --> 00:51:01,690
Because Yeojudaek is not someone who can kill a person.

643
00:51:01,690 --> 00:51:04,250
I trust Yeojudaek.

644
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,660
Is she a three-year-old? Why is she saying she trusts herself?

645
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:14,080
You are giving me goosebumps.

646
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:20,480
Your Excellency, Yeojudaek has no memory, so you should send her back now.

647
00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:26,650
You may leave now.

648
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:47,460
If it is okay with Your Excellency, I would like to find the real culprit together

649
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:50,830
since it still is my past, even though I have no memory of it.

650
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,200
Do as you please.

651
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:04,090
Explain what you found out from your investigation.

652
00:52:04,770 --> 00:52:07,910
Let me tell you how the incident progressed first.

653
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:16,530
According to him, Gyeongwoonjae and the Justice Bureau

654
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,010
took all documents about Nephew's incident from eight years ago.

655
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,800
Why would Prince Gyeongwoonjae do that?

656
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,920
As for that...

657
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,690
I do not know why.

658
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:30,340
However, I have a bad feeling.

659
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,270
At this rate, there will be big trouble.

660
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,440
Should we ask Sister to come up with a reason to exile Gyeongwoonjae?

661
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,110
Do you not know your sister must not know of this matter?

662
00:52:45,110 --> 00:52:47,680
Oh, you are right.

663
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:56,970
According to the interrogation documents, Jo In Hyeon gets stabbed to death

664
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:01,860
by an unidentified person in his bed eight years ago, on April 30th, around midnight.

665
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:21,430
Based on witness testimonies from his father, Jo Young Bae, and his wife, Madam Yu,

666
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:25,150
His Excellency Min Seung Gwan arrested the culprit.

667
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:28,470
The culprit was Gwang Mu, who sold his goods to Pyeongyangbu.

668
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,490
His wife, Tae Ran, the peddler, was found to be an accomplice.

669
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:35,550
The wife of the man called Gwang Mu mentioned here is you.

670
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,620
What is the reason I was accused of being the culprit?

671
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:40,790
Because Jo In Hyeon's silver ingots were found in their house.

672
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:43,220
That makes no sense.

673
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,340
You said you have no memory, so how are you so certain?

674
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:53,140
What kind of fool would kill an official he sells his goods to for silver ingots?

675
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:58,440
W-Well, that's true. It does not make sense.

676
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,740
Officer, continue with what you found out.

677
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:07,090
After he was to be transferred to Hanyang, Gwang Mu died from an unknown cause.

678
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:12,370
And his wife, Tae Ran, escaped from prison.

679
00:54:12,370 --> 00:54:15,770
As a result, the captain who was guarding the prison was dismissed.

680
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,670
To catch Tae Ran, they put a bounty on her

681
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:21,700
and distributed a wanted poster all over Pyeongyang. However...

682
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:23,740
she could not be found even after a year,

683
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:27,690
so she was presumed to be dead, and the case was closed.

684
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:31,140
The bounty hunter who is after Yeojudaek right now

685
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:34,110
is the captain who was dismissed at the time.

686
00:54:57,650 --> 00:55:02,860
Why do you sit here all day instead of looking for the person you are after?

687
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,970
There is a person I want to meet,

688
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:12,650
but I am suddenly scared she might not be the one I am looking for.

689
00:55:12,650 --> 00:55:18,520
Can you show me the drawing of the face you showed me that time again?

690
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:33,850
She is prettier than this.

691
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,700
You know this person?

692
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,540

693
00:55:49,570 --> 00:55:51,470
You got a letter.

694
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,110
 Yeojudaek, listen.

695
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,400
 There is a bounty hunter who is looking for you.

696
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,640
 So, do not come back even after your job is done.

697
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,980
 I will make time and take Bok Hee to Hamgyeong-do soon.

698
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,500
 Hong Cheon Soo from Hanseong.

699
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,250
This interrogation document has many flaws,

700
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,510
but the oddest part is that the one who found the culprit was

701
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:26,230
His Excellency Min Seung Gwan, a noble of Pyeongyang back then.

702
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,770
What is odd about that?

703
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:31,800
His Excellency Min is a rigid member of the Namjang Party,

704
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:35,640
meaning he is a sworn enemy of Jo Young Bae, leader of the Dongno Party.

705
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:40,270
It would make more sense to hear that His Excellency Min killed Jo In Hyeon instead.

706
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:45,420
And the man called Gwang Mu, who died an unknown death in a jail cell after being accused as the culprit,

707
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:48,490
was His Excellency Min's right-hand man.

708
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,710
Did you also investigate this matter on your own?

709
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:56,750
Eight years ago, His Majesty appointed me as Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor

710
00:56:56,750 --> 00:57:01,470
so I can investigate Park Bok Gi, then governor of Pyeongyang, and His Excellency Min.

711
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:05,340
Because they both wrote appeal letters, reporting each other's corruption.

712
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,440
But you ended up marrying the princess,

713
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:13,380
so Jo In Hyeon, the Left State Minister's eldest son, was sent instead. Right?

714
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:18,180
His Excellency Min cooperated with his enemy, the Dongno Party,

715
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:21,160
because his daughter was involved.

716
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,990
His Excellency Min had a smart daughter.

717
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:27,950
That daughter disguised as a man and worked as Pyeongyangbu's judge

718
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,950
in her sick brother's place, with the unspoken permission of her father.

719
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:36,920
The problem is that the daughter fell in love with their enemy's son, who came from Hanyang.

720
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:57,230
  The numbers do not add up here.

721
00:57:58,650 --> 00:58:02,760
  Do you not know or are you pretending not to know?

722
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,790
  It is what your uncle ordered, using the customs as an excuse.

723
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:11,440
  I truly did not know because it was my first time,

724
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,810
 so follow the rules rather than customs if that is the case.

725
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:17,700
  I will take the responsibility.

726
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,920
 Jo In Hyeon was a loyal subject,

727
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,290
 so he did his best to uncover his uncle's corruption, who is Pyeongyang's governor.

728
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:28,420
 And Min Seung Gwan's daughter, who realized he was sincere, ended up cooperating with him.

729
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:33,600
In the end, the two expose Pyeongyang's governor's corruption.

730
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,900
In the process, Jo In Hyeon finds out that she is a woman and

731
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:40,110
the two start a dangerous love.

732
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:47,580
 After taking care of all matters, they commit a double suicide,

733
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:50,300
 realizing they cannot ever be together.

734
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,300
So, His Excellency Min must have cooperated with his enemy, the Dongno Party,

735
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,440
to hide his daughter's affair, do you not think so?

736
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:08,190
Did your memories come back now?

737
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:15,400
How do I know about this story?

738
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:22,040
That story is from the novel, "The Scholar's Man."

739
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,790
It was too similar to this case, so I got carried away.

740
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:29,260
Could that novel have been...

741
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:33,970
Could it be based on a true story like "The Madam's Private Life"?

742
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:38,520
The pen name is So Cheon.

743
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:42,350
And "The Scholar's Man" from eight years ago was the only book ever written.

744
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,840
So, not much is known about him.

745
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,500
Right, a book distributor I know said

746
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,750
he saw him living as a monk at Temple Seonhwa.

747
00:59:50,750 --> 00:59:53,920
But that is not certain, either.

748
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:58,380
At Temple Seonhwa...

749
01:00:17,590 --> 01:00:19,620
What brings you here, Your Excellency?

750
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:21,690
I heard from the innkeeper.

751
01:00:21,690 --> 01:00:24,380
That you were asking about the writer.

752
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,200
He said there is a monk whose name is So Cheon.

753
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:49,920
He should be back soon, so we will have to wait a little.

754
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,590
Gosh, seriously.

755
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:34,060
This place is empty right now. It will be perfect to take cover from the rain.

756
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:05,090
It is raining when there is not a single cloud.

757
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:08,300
A fox must be on his way to find his mate.

758
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:12,290
When a fox goes to find his mate,

759
01:02:12,290 --> 01:02:16,490
they say he sprinkles rain, so people do not realize it.

760
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:21,290
So people are mesmerized by the rain from a sunny sky.

761
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,720
We are being enchanted by a fox's trickery right now, huh?

762
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:34,310
A fox rain stops quite quickly.

763
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,970
So do not worry too much.

764
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:48,350
I will not raise an issue of what you say while we are enchanted.

765
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:50,370
So you should also...

766
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:55,090
answer me without minding the current situation.

767
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:02,200
Why did you lie...

768
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:08,600
saying you do not like me?

769
01:03:27,410 --> 01:03:32,120
♫  The moment you faced me like the bright sunlight  ♫

770
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,980

771
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:41,690
♫  You came down into me, blindingly  ♫

772
01:03:41,690 --> 01:03:47,600
♫  Among fates as countless as the stars  ♫

773
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:54,040
♫  I met you like a miracle  ♫

774
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:00,790
  It is about the murder of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor. Right?

775
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:05,580
  These letters contain not only evidence of stealing from the tributes but also of treason.

776
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,450
  What are you saying?

777
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:09,070
  Do not worry.

778
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:13,860
  The crown prince will not get married even if all the old maids in Hanyang get married.

779
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,160
  This is crazy.

780
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,560
  I am reminded of him every other moment.

781
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,110
  Did you not tell me

782
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,570
  that it only takes a moment for a man and a woman to fall in love?

783
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:27,600
 I also want to spend the rest of my life with you, Your Excellency.

784
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:32,360
♫  Can I love you now?  ♫

785
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:42,380

786
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:45,380
