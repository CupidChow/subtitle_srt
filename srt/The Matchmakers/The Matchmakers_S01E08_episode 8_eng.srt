1
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,400

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,450

3
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,030

4
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:02,340

5
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,820

Marriage is a matter between families.

6
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,180

So I just need to marry the woman chosen by my family.

7
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:12,070
This one will do.

8
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,930
Yes.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,450
The lady chosen by my mother is my ideal type.

10
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:24,140
Give me one more of the same kind.

11
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,260

12
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:34,480

My fiancé had been decided since I was born.

13
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,000
He would be a son from one of the top 10% of noble families or

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,900
he could have passed the state exam with top scores, even if his family is a bit lacking.

15
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,190
My ideal type?

16
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:52,210
The smartest one who fits the said criteria.

17
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,500
It is given that he would be well-mannered like me.

18
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,850

19
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,170
There is something my mother says all the time.

20
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:14,860
In the end, the only one protecting women is their family and

21
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,850
women are the ones who protect their families.

22
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,450
What?

23
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:23,930
Dating for marriage is a crazy idea.

24
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,900

25
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,720
You really did a great job.

26
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,160
After today, the Defense Minister will never be bothering you again.

27
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,820
It was nothing.

28
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,930
The Defense Minister's wife bought all the books, so I made quite the profit.

29
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,620
Speaking of, will you be okay since the Defense Minister is an elder in your family?

30
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,550
There is no chance of me getting caught, so why would I not be okay?

31
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,940
Also, I firmly believe those who committed a crime must be punished.

32
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:02,930
Whoa... It is the same belief as the madam in "Madam's Private Life."

33
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,770
I am nervous because today is d-day.

34
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,200
No one has come yet, right?

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,380
Everyone already stopped by and left.

36
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,430
What?

37
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,090
They said the plan was moved up two hours.

38
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,230
You did not hear?

39
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:20,950
Wait! What are they moving up without me knowing?

40
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,750
I will kill you for good this time.

41
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,570
Your Excellency.

42
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,730
Your Excellency! Your Excellency!

43
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:45,440
Please wake up, Your Excellency!

44
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,750
I-I am okay.

45
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,890
Your Excellency.

46
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:17,210
W-Why are you crying?

47
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,070
D-Did you get injured?

48
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:22,940
Have you gone mad?

49
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,010
Why would you jump in when you cannot even swim?

50
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,200
I mastered swimming last night.

51
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,210
Sorry?

52
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,490
Wait... So you are saying you learned how to swim

53
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:01,190
from a book?

54
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,950
I could have done it perfectly, only if I was not shot with an arrow.

55
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,970
I heard you have to stop the bleeding first from—

56
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:24,270
Did your orabeoni tell you so?

57
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,800
Yes.

58
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,790
You are right.

59
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,280
I am glad I got hurt...

60
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,460
instead of you.

61
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,150
Your Excellency!

62
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,640
Goodness, Your Excellency! I heard you got shot by an arrow!

63
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:04,020
Gosh, s-stay still for goodness' sake! It hurts.

64
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,290
Why would you insist you will jump instead of Yeojudaek and

65
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,060
have such a thing happen to you?

66
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,570
I am glad everyone is okay.

67
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,820
You...

68
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,370
Huh?

69
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,950
Wait, who are you?

70
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,990
What do you mean? She is Yeojudaek.

71
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,600
Sorry?

72
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,010
Where is she going?

73
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,210
Let me see! Let me see now! Gosh, what do we do?

74
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,470
Gosh, it was right here.

75
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,200
I told you not to touch me!

76
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,090
It's the left side... The left side, you idiot!

77
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,130
I'm done.

78
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,520
You are Soon Deok, right?

79
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,200
O-Orabeoni, I will explain everything later, so do not say anything right now.

80
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,840
If His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae finds out I am the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law,

81
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,300
I will get arrested.

82
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:04,260
Have you been pretending to be Yeojudaek all this time?

83
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:10,530
Exactly. You never recognized your only sister.

84
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,490
So why would you— Gosh, seriously.

85
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:18,930
Why are the Officer and Yeojudaek talking for so long?

86
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,380
- I am sorry— 
 - You are sorry, right?

87
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,820
Then, help me out this once, and please take care of His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

88
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,580
- I'm going. 
 - Hey.

89
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,500
Soon Deok.

90
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,630
Gosh, seriously.

91
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,640
Your Excellency, you must leave now.

92
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,230
Government troops will soon arrive, looking for Hwa Rok.

93
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,940
Okay.

94
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,860
Wait! Where is Yeojudaek going, by the way?

95
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,380
She said she had an urgent matter, so she was leaving first.

96
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,950
I request you to stay home and not gather until this incident is dismissed.

97
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,450
Y-Yes.

98
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,450
Just what on Earth are you doing these days

99
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,200
that you got shot by an arrow?

100
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,320
He fell for a woman, head over heels—

101
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,140
I cannot tell you the details, but I was not doing an evil deed—

102
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,800
My goodness, what is fortunate still is that

103
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,970
the unknown somebody did some great first aid.

104
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,820
So you will recover soon if you take your medicine well.

105
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,310
Goodness, goodness.

106
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:59,350
 I am glad I got hurt...

107
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,430
 instead of you.

108
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,420
 Geun Seok's mother, are you inside?

109
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,500
I stopped by to discuss something about Ye Jin.

110
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,170
What is the matter with Young Lady?

111
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:41,000
I am worried Ye Jin is on the edge these days.

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,860
One's feelings tend to differ day and night when facing marriage, do they not?

113
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,210
It would be fine if that was the case.

114
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,850
But I sense something different.

115
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,700
So, call her over and hear what is on her mind.

116
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,780
Since Ye Jin willingly tells you about her feelings, too.

117
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:02,310
Yes, I understand, Mother.

118
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,660
Hwa Rok, the one who wrote the novel, was killed during the arrest process?

119
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,690
I told you so many times to catch him alive so we can see if the rumors are true!

120
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,990
Hanseongbu's captain tried to arrest Hwa Rok by setting up a trap.

121
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:21,100
But the Defense Minister shot him with an arrow after suddenly showing up with his troops.

122
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,860
Hwa Rok's corpse, which fell off the cliff,

123
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,050
 was found around 6:00 today.

124
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,060

125
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,390
He is Hwa Rok.

126
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,150
Hold on.

127
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,850
Hanseongbu's captain is the Defense Minister's in-law. Right?

128
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,510
Yes, he is.

129
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:52,470
Also, since he shot dead the one who revealed his act of murder during arrest,

130
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,580
the Defense Minister himself proved the rumors to be true.

131
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,810
That is what the circumstances say,

132
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,810
but Hwa Rok, who wrote the novel, died.

133
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:04,120
So, it is not easy to prove if his novel was true.

134
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,750
With such a rumor, I think we can consider it a public opinion

135
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:09,900
and dismiss the Defense Minister, using the rumors as the basis.

136
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,720
- Do you not agree? 
 - However,

137
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,020
if we dismiss the Defense Minister using the novel as a basis, it will become a precedent.

138
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:23,700
I am worried there will be many who write provocative, false stories for their benefit.

139
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,100
- Is that so? 
 - Yes.

140
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:32,510
By the way, why do you always disagree with me?

141
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,440
I quit!

142
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,480
 Since the one who wrote the novel died,

143
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,770
there should not be any problems now.

144
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,270
I still believe you should resign.

145
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,060
Sister, everyone will forget about a mere novel after time passes.

146
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:53,980
The king looks unfavorably on us because of the incident with the crown prince.

147
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,870
At times like this, showing a regretful attitude by resigning voluntarily

148
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:05,540
is the way to restore the reputations of Royal Consort Sookbin and Prince Jin Seong you damaged.

149
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,030
Wife, my opinion differs from yours a bit.

150
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,780
It is because you do not know about politics,

151
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:18,600
but numbers are more important than public opinion in politics.

152
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,330
If the Defense Minister resigns now, he is more or less admitting he is guilty.

153
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:25,700
After that, his position will be filled by a person from the Namjang Party.

154
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,390
Such an event will weaken our power in the Royal Court, and

155
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:34,710
we will lack the power to make Prince Jin Seong the king at a decisive moment.

156
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:37,390
You cannot be more correct.

157
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:50,420
Quit the matchmaking business right away.

158
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,990
You brought a basketful of unripe plums to tell me that right now?

159
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,290
I did not start matchmaking secretly yesterday.

160
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,280
Do not worry.

161
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,430
Matchmaking is not the problem.

162
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,200
If what you did to the Defense Minister this time becomes known,

163
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,610
it will not end with you getting kicked out of this house.

164
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,690
How will it become known?

165
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,810
You did not know who I was until I fell into the water, either.

166
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:26,360
But I know now.

167
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,000
Quit it.

168
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,180
It is dangerous.

169
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,630
I will quit after this job is over.

170
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,600
This match is a really important matter for His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

171
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,740
He said it was a royal decree.

172
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,860
Do you actually like His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

173
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,620
Are you crazy, Orabeoni?

174
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:54,990
Even though I carry myself like this, I am a noblewoman who is married to one man for life.

175
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,330
My late husband is...

176
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,670
all I have for the rest of my life.

177
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:09,430
Sister-in-law!

178
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,320
Orabeoni stopped by for a moment to give me plums. He is leaving now.

179
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,790
Hello.

180
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:19,530
How have you been?

181
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,180
Sister, are you headed to the inner quarters?

182
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:25,540
Yes, to greet Mother.

183
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,350
You should just go back.

184
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,170
The atmosphere in the inner quarters is terrible right now.

185
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:34,630
Uncle is there because of the rumors going around.

186
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:37,420
I think it would be better to just go back today.

187
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,780
Thank you for letting us know.

188
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:43,310
Orabeoni, you should just go back today.

189
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,770
I will let Mother know you were here when the time is proper.

190
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,210
Okay.

191
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:54,090
Think carefully about what I said earlier.

192
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,840
When did you bring this here?

193
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:28,210
Young Lady, what is the problem, exactly?

194
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:36,140
I think I do not want to get married.

195
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,830
Why? There must be a reason.

196
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:42,930
The thing is...

197
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:49,430
I am a bit embarrassed to face the in-laws because of the rumors about Uncle lately.

198
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,510
Anyhow, just thinking about the marriage makes my chest heavy

199
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:58,040
and all I can think of is alcohol.

200
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,200
You have always been thinking of alcohol.

201
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,060
Just wait a few days. I will take care of it.

202
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:13,700
How will you take care of my feelings?

203
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:18,410
Once I have set up a match, I will not sit still and just watch a gloomy bride-to-be.

204
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:21,380
I will set you up naturally during Dano with your fiancé— 
  (Fifth day of May in Korean lunar calendar)

205
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:23,370
Forget it.

206
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:25,230
It is an arranged marriage anyway.

207
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:29,100
Even if I do not like him after meeting him, it does not mean I can get a different husband.

208
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:31,680
Why bother to meet him in advance?

209
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,900
Ye Jin, you are clueless.

210
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,090
The difference between meeting before and after marriage is as vast as the earth is from the heavens.

211
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,290
Look forward to Dano.

212
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,010
This case is an appeal letter asking for Defense Minister Park's dismissal

213
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,990
from the office due to the rumors about an unpleasant incident.

214
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,670
Your Majesty, I am regretful to inform you of this,

215
00:18:04,670 --> 00:18:07,800
but you cannot consider the false story from a novel

216
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,310
that only women read to be the public opinion.

217
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,890
Wait, Left State Minister! How are you certain

218
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,900
that I am questioning the Defense Minister because of the novel?

219
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,800
My, my.

220
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,570
There was an appeal letter on people of Namsangol having to make long, inconvenient detours

221
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:35,800
because of a no-go area created in the middle of Mt. Mokmyeok from last year.

222
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,690
 All right, what brings you here this late at night?

223
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:51,130
 When I was outside the palace, I saw a prohibition sign placed in the middle of Mt. Mokmyeok.

224
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,760
 Is that so?

225
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:58,760
 I saw the sign around over here.

226
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:05,230
 But there is no prohibited area designated by the government in Mt. Mokmyeok.

227
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,700
 It looks like someone is privately prohibiting the entry

228
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,880
 to that area and taking the pine trees from there to make a profit.

229
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,650
 Here.

230
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,980
 It must have been difficult enough to get over the unseen hardship.

231
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,460
 How did you come to look into such things?

232
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,340
  If this place is blocked off, people have to go a long way around it.

233
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,050
  If he did so knowing that, he did not think about public sentiment.

234
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,060
  And if he does not know about this, he is incompetent.

235
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:45,620
 I will look into it as soon as dawn breaks.

236
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,880
 So you can go rest now, Crown Prince.

237
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:52,200
 - Yes.  
 - And as per the investigations,

238
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,980
that place was not a prohibited area designated by the government.

239
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:02,900
It was found that the Defense Minister warded it off on his own accord.

240
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,910
Your Majesty, I do not know about this matter.

241
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:11,740
My underlings must have made a mistake, so I will look into it.

242
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:16,090
Royal Investigations Bureau confirmed that the pine trees from the said area

243
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:19,550
were planted in your garden!

244
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,450
If you still did not know,

245
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,710
your incompetence is more than enough reason to dismiss you from office.

246
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,140
Do you not agree, Left State Minister?

247
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,500
Am I the only one who took pine trees from there?

248
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,140
This is so unfair.

249
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,080
Gosh, I should have just listened to Sister.

250
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,850
Had I resigned, getting reinstated would have been easy.

251
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,730
But I was dismissed, so...

252
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:02,950
Let us first discuss who we should nominate for his successor.

253
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:08,800
W-Why don't we ask your wife...

254
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,120
for her opinion first?

255
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,450
You are here.

256
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:30,090
Is your injured arm okay?

257
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,470
Such a thing is nothing to a man—

258
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:38,480
I-It is nothing to me.

259
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,460
I got it, so you can stop.

260
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,510
You are making my arm hurt.

261
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:15,750
Did you meet the groom candidate scholars again?

262
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,150
Well, t-the—

263
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,440
We did.

264
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:29,230
They said they actually want the old maidens, influenced by the novel.

265
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,430
As long as the maidens decide, there should not be any issues now.

266
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:36,250
I do have a plan to finalize the maidens' decisions on Dano,

267
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,020
but I think we will have to change one of the groom candidates.

268
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,940
Who are you going to change without even asking me?

269
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,430
For Lady Sam Soon's match...

270
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,690
S-So, Officer, what brings you here?

271
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:09,940
I thought Operation Another Rumor we carried out was over now.

272
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:15,210
It looked like Your Excellency was doing a good deed,

273
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,190
so I will also help until this matchmaking is over.

274
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,920
What brings you here, Lady Sam Soon?

275
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,770
I told you to stay home for a while.

276
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,820
You were here, too, Officer.

277
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,540
W-Wait, please stay apart and talk.

278
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:54,050
Just how well will this matchmaking turn out for things to get so twisted?

279
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,080
This house must be the correct one.

280
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,790
This is a thanks for all the work you all have done thus far.

281
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:31,420
Rather than this, we just need you sisters to wed successfully as thanks.

282
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,670
Of course, we will also thank you by getting married successfully.

283
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:41,240
Now, though this is sweet wine, shall we toast since it is still wine?

284
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,590
For successful marriages, cheers!

285
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,490
 Cheers!

286
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,190
 He is more romantic than a male protagonist in a novel.

287
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:07,640
 What do I do?

288
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,580
 I like Officer so much.

289
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:17,730
Smiling at just about anyone for no good reason...

290
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,150
How dangerous.

291
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,250
Looks like he will explode soon.

292
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,330
One, two, three!

293
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,410
Officer, sit at a distance from Yeojudaek!

294
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:36,190
Is your chest in pain again?

295
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,890
Yes, it hurts!

296
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:43,300
You two seem to be in an inappropriate relationship.

297
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:51,290
Yeojudaek and Oh Bong, switch seats to be safe. That would be better.

298
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,430
My gosh, he is like an open book.

299
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,810
All right. This is way better.

300
00:26:09,670 --> 00:26:13,580
Your Excellency Gyeongwoonjae, do you like Yeojudaek?

301
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,150
Huh?

302
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:21,120
Lady Sam Soon, how can you say such an absurd thing?

303
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,810
Officer, do you also have feelings for Yeojudaek?

304
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:29,430
- I do not! 
 - Have you gone mad?

305
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:35,020
We can totally tell you two do not have feelings, so please calm down.

306
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,280
Officer, what do you think about me?

307
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,730
What... What do you mean?

308
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,930
 No way, is she trying to confess her feelings?

309
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,980
Do not confess, do not confess, do not confess.

310
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,720
What...

311
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,270
do you think of me as your bride, Officer?

312
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,250
It's over.

313
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,500
Officer...

314
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,010
please give me an answer.

315
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,700
Will you...

316
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,980
accept my proposal?

317
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,190
No.

318
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:36,750
I have no interest in marrying you.

319
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:45,110
Oh, I understand.

320
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:50,370
I forgot I have an urgent matter at home.

321
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,080
So please excuse me.

322
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,860
I told you I would set you up at Dano.

323
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,120
Why did you propose to him suddenly?

324
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,750
I could not hold it in anymore because I like Officer too much.

325
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:24,830
Also, I was certain Officer liked me as well.

326
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,690
So it happened before I knew.

327
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,680
What made you so certain?

328
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,340
It is just that you do not know.

329
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,960
He fixed the fences and replaced the roof tiles at my house.

330
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:41,160
Did you also not see him worrying I was going to jump off the cliff?

331
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,970
What else could those things mean besides liking me?

332
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:53,340
  W-will that not be... a-a bit dangerous for Yeojudaek as well?

333
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,910
  I am glad I got hurt... instead of you.

334
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:05,530
I am sorry for not having done as you told me.

335
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:12,700
However, hiding feelings of love is too hard for me.

336
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:22,690
It is so hard for a woman to say such a thing.

337
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,510
How can you reject her at once?

338
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:29,830
I also think Officer was a bit too mean.

339
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:33,370
Please be quiet. I cannot hear them.

340
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,670
My Lady, you do not need to apologize.

341
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:40,350
It is just that Officer has been needlessly stubborn since he was young.

342
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:45,090
He never overturns what he says, even if what he says is wrong.

343
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,860
I am not sure what to do from now on.

344
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,650
You do not need to worry anymore.

345
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:57,610
Just connect me to Scholar Number 23, who is a good cook, as it was to be originally.

346
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:58,510
Sorry?

347
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:02,180
Officer said he had no interest in marrying me.

348
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,750
My Lady, will you be okay?

349
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,950
You said you like Officer so much.

350
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:09,520
Do not worry.

351
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,900
I forget as quickly as I fall in love.

352
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,850
I can forget in just a few days.

353
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:19,410
My, oh, my.

354
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:23,540
How can love change so easily?

355
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:41,090
Once he gets married, his in-laws will make his clothes.

356
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,950
So this will be my last set of clothes to give to my son.

357
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:51,430
It is not like you made his clothes yourself all this time, either.

358
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,980
What?

359
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,070
It means even if his wife makes his clothes,

360
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,960
the fact Young Master is your son does not change,

361
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,100
so you should not be upset.

362
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,470
Yes, you are right.

363
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,890
I will be taking my leave, then.

364
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:20,300
Only if her family was a bit better, that smart one

365
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:23,810
would be the perfect partner for Shi Yeol.

366
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:35,360
Long time no see.

367
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,210
Will you be busy on the coming Dano?

368
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,280
What if I am not?

369
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,880
If you are not,

370
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,560
let us go watch wrestling together.

371
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:57,360
You are not competing in it, but you want to watch wrestling together like girls?

372
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,990
Of course, I will be competing!

373
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,150
I meant you should watch me compete.

374
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:07,430
You are getting mad for no reason.

375
00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:10,240
I can tell you never even held a satba before. 
  (A cloth band used in Korean traditional wrestling)

376
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,160
Gosh, I am good at wrestling.

377
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,000
Madam!

378
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,850
Please come out for a moment!

379
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,030
What is all this ruckus for?

380
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:27,200
Our madam has sent you this.

381
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:51,510
 I reckon your husband will need it soon,

382
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:53,980
 so I am sending an outfit.

383
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,890
Did Father get promoted to Defense Minister?

384
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:07,820
I did not hear such news.

385
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:15,430
 Postscript. A royal edict will be given in three days.

386
00:33:15,430 --> 00:33:20,280
 To congratulate you, I am also sending ginger wine that I made in season.

387
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,870
You are a good dutiful son,

388
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,670
seeing how we are already reaping the benefits of your in-laws before even getting married.

389
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,100
Your mother-in-law already knew your father would become the Defense Minister

390
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,390
and sent the uniform in advance.

391
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:38,370
Then, your in-laws must have made this happen.

392
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:40,510
O-Oh, right.

393
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,090
Yes.

394
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,540
He is crazy.

395
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,670
Why would a soon-to-be-married man suggest going to watch wrestling together?

396
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,910
Gosh, why did I smile at him and talk to him there?

397
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,340
Gosh, this is so annoying!

398
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,940
If 30% of a man's looks depend on clothing,

399
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,840
then 70% depends on hairstyle.

400
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,710
We will be getting haircuts to style your hair into the

401
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,570
hottest hairstyle right now, the egg topknot.

402
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,810
Come on now!

403
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:31,600
Are you saying you will shave my head?

404
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,260
It is said you should not get rid of any part of your body you inherited from your parents.

405
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,950
Staying unmarried is a worse thing to do as a son, is it not, Scholar?

406
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,730
And what do you mean, shaving your head?

407
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:43,230
We are going to trim your hair slightly to create the best top knot.

408
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:46,430
Do you not want to look good in front of the lady?

409
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:51,540
Give me back the hair you cut off.

410
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,460
I am fine without getting the haircut.

411
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,720
Geez, goodness!

412
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,960
Scholars, haircuts are not a choice but a requirement.

413
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,460
Well, then.

414
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:22,340
Show me some five-colored thread.

415
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:24,450
You are making jangmyeongru, right? 
  (Five-colored knot meant to drive out evil spirits on Dano)

416
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:26,660
Give me a second.

417
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,750
Here you go.

418
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,410
Thank you.

419
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:47,320
You had such perfectly good attire, so why have you been dressing so poorly?

420
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:55,860
I wanted to meet a woman who would love me for who I am and not for my family background.

421
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,320
Your family background is also part of who you are.

422
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,170
Is not Number 24 a bit too plain?

423
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:17,110
An attire that is not within your budget is deception.

424
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:21,510
Also, the Number 24 scholar has a handsome face and has a good fit in clothes, so it is fine.

425
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:24,700
Do you like that kind of face?

426
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,490
You just have to come on the day of Dano like this. kay?

427
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:33,830
You are all dismissed.

428
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:39,050
If we marry the old maidens, we will all become brothers-in-law,

429
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:41,130
so let us all be good friends.

430
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,950
Yes, Hyungnim.

431
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:47,460
Also, if you ever experience any hardships, let me know anytime.

432
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,440
Will I not be the eldest son-in-law once we get married?

433
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:52,260
Okay.

434
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:08,190
Orabeoni, you are getting married to the old maidens?

435
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,260
Yeah. I should get married now, too.

436
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,400
That is such good news!

437
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,520
I worried a lot about you growing old and dying as an old bachelor.

438
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:25,030
Whose family is the bride from?

439
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:30,870
Oh, right. It was the old maidens.

440
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,450
This is so good.

441
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,440
Do the two know each other?

442
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,470
Young Lady!

443
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,460
Sister?

444
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,550
Do you know that the spot under your eye looks bad?

445
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,440
Everyone else said it looks good.

446
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,970
But do you know the scholar you were talking to at the merchants' inn?

447
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,750
Who?

448
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,950
Oh, right.

449
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,450
Are you talking about the scholar who I asked where to buy this thread?

450
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,450
Was it?

451
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,840
Oh, you went to buy five-colored thread to make jangmyeongru, I see.

452
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,030
To give to whom?

453
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,710
You said you would let me meet my fiancé on Dano

454
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:38,410
so I am thinking of giving it to him as a gift.

455
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:44,600
You said you would not meet with him.

456
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,180
But I guess you were anticipating.

457
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,930
Is the matchmaking for the old maidens going well?

458
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,950
Of course, I am the one matchmaking for them.

459
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:54,800
Who did you decide as their grooms?

460
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,110
Would you know if I told you who they were?

461
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,260
You want me to find out who the old maidens will be marrying?

462
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,340
Yeah, find out each match that my sister-in-law has chosen for each sister,

463
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,290
from the eldest to the youngest.

464
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:16,290
Gosh! Do you think I am Sam Wol's mother?

465
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,810
I do not go around digging up info on people.

466
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,040
I guess it is an urgent matter. When should I find out for you?

467
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:29,430
I will go right away.

468
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,670
 Dear Lady Ha Na.

469
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,540
 Thanks to you, I arrived home safe and sound, Young Lady.

470
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:52,390
 My mother is sending you this silk as a token of gratitude,

471
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,350
 so please accept it.

472
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,800
 Thank you for letting me know by letter that

473
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,290
 the restrictions at Mt. Mokmyeok was lifted.

474
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:06,650
Now, we do not have to go around the long way.

475
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,670
- Gosh, it feels so good. 
 - That's right.

476
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,620
 My house is in a far-off region,

477
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,940
 so if you keep sending me news of Hanyang and your well-being by letter,

478
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:19,950
 it would be very useful to me when I get appointed to a government position later.

479
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:23,310
 I will await your reply.

480
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:35,310
If we meet again, I will not be able to call you little kid anymore.

481
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:52,250
Royal Chief Secretary, sir. If you let me know, I would have come to you. Why come all this way...

482
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,780
Move the critically ill patient first,

483
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,400
and let us go inside and talk.

484
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,070
Yes, sir.

485
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,610
There is a patient with the same symptoms as the princess? Tell me more in detail.

486
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:19,000
Please come this way.

487
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:39,230
Eight years ago, Her Highness the Princess also had the same spot under her collarbone.

488
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:44,870
At that time, I ignored it, thinking it was a skin problem that had nothing to do with the illness.

489
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:50,930
And that was one of the symptoms of geumjam poison listed in the medical book.

490
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,850
That is right.

491
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,300
She is a palace maid who suddenly got sick after eating the leftovers by the crown prince,

492
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:03,220
so she was officially declared dead and treated in secret in the palace.

493
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,330
If treating her according to this medical book is effective,

494
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:12,080
there is a good chance this court maid and the princess...

495
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,460
were both poisoned with geumjam poison.

496
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:21,210
  You must have done this work for a long time since you speak Joseon's language well.

497
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,860
  And if I have?

498
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:27,640
 I wondered if anyone had looked for geumjam poison in the past.

499
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:31,180
I feel like I know who purchased that poison.

500
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,600
Geumjam poison?

501
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:46,780
I remember the face of the man who purchased geumjam poison from the Ming merchant.

502
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,430
If you investigate that man, you can find out where the poison originated.

503
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:55,790
Have the Royal Investigation Bureau Chief come in immediately.

504
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,200
 Yes, Your Majesty.

505
00:43:02,170 --> 00:43:07,410
Why are you not searching for the man I told you about and instead bringing me here?

506
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:13,450
The Ming merchant that you mentioned has hidden himself.

507
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:19,950
Please confirm if that is the man you say purchased the poison.

508
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:39,290
It is a corpse found by a herbalist yesterday morning.

509
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:41,710
It is him.

510
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,360
Who killed him?

511
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:47,450
The ones who ordered the kidnap of the crown prince probably killed him.

512
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,300
To shut him up.

513
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,630
And?

514
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:06,190
Are you saying that corpse ended up in the Royal Investigation Bureau?

515
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,990
It appears that happened because he was dressed as a royal bodyguard and bearing an ID tag.

516
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,830
Why are you so bad at taking care of business?

517
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:17,980
You did not think to get rid of the clothes and the ID tag?

518
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,910
You nobility do nothing but talk.

519
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:25,240
- What did you say? 
 - He is already dead!

520
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,500
He is unable to talk, so what is the problem?

521
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,770
We will not get caught.

522
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,880
Do not worry.

523
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:38,820
Seeing how the crown prince is not displaying any symptoms of poison,

524
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:44,660
the Eastern Palace palace maid did not get sick after eating the crown prince's leftover food,

525
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:48,060
but took the poison herself...

526
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:51,630
in order to send the crown prince to his private residence.

527
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,950
I also feel that is the case.

528
00:44:53,950 --> 00:44:57,240
Because even if something happens to the crown prince living in his private residence,

529
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,240
the queen who sent him there will be held responsible.

530
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:05,930
If it is someone who would make such a plan, perhaps it is—

531
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,750
I need conclusive corroborative evidence instead of a hunch.

532
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:16,590
The only clue we have left is the palace maid of the Eastern Palace,

533
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:22,930
so I will make sure to restore her to health and find out who gave her that poison.

534
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,970
Do you trust His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

535
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,580
He has been looking into the death of the princess for the past eight years.

536
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:46,670
Even I, her father, have forgotten about it.

537
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:58,310
Mother, when I enter my in-laws' house, I want to take some plates with me.

538
00:45:58,310 --> 00:46:00,690
You will stay with us until you give birth to your first child.

539
00:46:00,690 --> 00:46:05,110
Let us start selecting the dishes you like from now on.

540
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,040
Oh, Mother, shall I put this aside as well?

541
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:14,040
Place it in the section to give to the tenant farmers.

542
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,020
Yes, Mother.

543
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:26,020
She walks so fast, so it is hard to find out what she is up to.

544
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,880
It was here.

545
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,430
I was sitting down for too long today.

546
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,520
Gosh, I am so tired.

547
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:22,080
What is it?

548
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,860
Did I leave the windows open earlier?

549
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,430
Gosh, whatever.

550
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,290

551
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:39,910
She is lending novels?

552
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:41,810
Yes, Madam.

553
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:47,860
Even though the Defense Minister went through so much trouble because of the novels.

554
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:51,730
You know how the Young Madam would always read novels to

555
00:47:51,730 --> 00:47:55,410
Young Master after she married him.

556
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,810

How could she still be sitting there even though 20 years had passed?

557
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:03,840
Just hold on for a little bit.

558
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:07,360
You will know the reason when I read the end.

559
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:11,040
Apologies, I was just too curious.

560
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,570
I will keep reading.

561
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:18,730
"That moment, the bride turned into ashes and broke into pieces..."

562
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:22,990
You can stop looking into what Geun Seok's mother is doing.

563
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:28,000
No, if I keep at it for a bit longer, I can catch her red-handed.

564
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,180
Do not make me repeat myself.

565
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,570
 Y-Yes, Madam.

566
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:38,830
 Please leave.

567
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:40,570
 Okay.

568
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,590
Mother found out?

569
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:50,040
Yes, Sam Wol's mother told on you about everything.

570
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:06,030
I thought something felt a bit off.

571
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:11,880
 Young Madam, Madam says you should come to the inner quarters.

572
00:49:31,370 --> 00:49:34,830
Mother, I heard you called for me.

573
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:01,970
It is the key to the shed and the list of names of the tenant farmers.

574
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:08,560
From now on, you should handle the tenant farmers and the grain supply in our house.

575
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:09,850
Me?

576
00:50:09,850 --> 00:50:13,780
Do you not feel suffocated from only sewing at home?

577
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,540
I have told Mister Kim, so you should look after our family's fields,

578
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:21,960
and check on the tenant farmers.

579
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,680
If the owner does not personally manage things and leave it to someone else,

580
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,750
it will not be run well.

581
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,080
I think it is a bit too early for me to manage it.

582
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,650
I handled it as soon as I married into this family,

583
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,580
so you can definitely do it, too.

584
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,790
It is about time you start preparing to become the headmistress of the Jo family.

585
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,250
Yes...

586
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,140
Mother.

587
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,250

588
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:07,810
Sam Wol's mother brought this to me, saying she found this in the backyard of the annex.

589
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:18,130
You need to work to get people on your side from now.

590
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:23,170
People typically do not know to be grateful and are whimsical.

591
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:28,200
They try to avoid danger but cannot give up on their own profit.

592
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,990
So if people think you are scary and provide benefits to them,

593
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:36,120
they will always take your side.

594
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:38,480
Keep that in mind.

595
00:51:46,590 --> 00:51:49,110

596
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,730
It makes me nervous that she did not scold me.

597
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:58,020
Mother is giving you time.

598
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,850
You know that Mother liked how you were wise and sensible from the start.

599
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,460
I know.

600
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:17,430
I also like Mother.

601
00:52:17,430 --> 00:52:21,950
I am relieved to know Mother has you.

602
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:32,010
You also do not like that I am doing matchmaking work, I see.

603
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:15,370
You never arrive first.

604
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:20,170
There are many places we must go to today, so we have to hurry.

605
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:21,830
Gosh, wh—

606
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,620
It is as if I am the one who arrived late.

607
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,980
Lady Ha Na loves to ride swings,

608
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:37,360
so make sure to tell Number 12 to ride a swing on the day of Dano.

609
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:38,410
Okay.

610
00:53:38,410 --> 00:53:40,830
It will not do for him to just ride it.

611
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:44,660
He must not fall behind Lady Ha Na, who won the swing riding contest for the past three years,

612
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:47,470
so tell him to practice with everything he has.

613
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:19,550
The coincidence of first-sight at Temple Seonhwa

614
00:54:19,550 --> 00:54:23,110
will be fulfilled as a connection here.

615
00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:34,030
Lady Du Ri will be watching wrestling.

616
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,580
Tell Number 24 to participate in the wrestling match,

617
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,390
and make sure to place and receive a prize.

618
00:54:39,390 --> 00:54:43,230
I did not know the second daughter liked men who were good at wrestling.

619
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:47,050
Is there a woman who does not like men who are good at wrestling?

620
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:52,990
Do you also like men who are good at wrestling?

621
00:54:53,870 --> 00:54:57,460
What I like is not important here.

622
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:17,680
Lady Sam Soon, who did not do first-sight at Temple Seonhwa, chose to wash her hair.

623
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,210
This is a famous spot that everyone knows about.

624
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:34,490
Make sure to save a spot early in the morning on the day of Dano and have Number 23 sit here.

625
00:55:34,490 --> 00:55:35,910
Okay.

626
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:39,190
- I get it, so let us rest here for a bit— 
 - We will go to Saongwon now.

627
00:55:39,190 --> 00:55:42,000
I guess we cannot.

628
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,560
Is there a woman named Yeojudaek who sells facial powder here?

629
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,880
Yeojudaek?

630
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:18,770

631
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,470
Is she someone you know?

632
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,150
I have never seen her before.

633
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,890
This is also my first time here. Why not ask the innkeeper in there?

634
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:54,670
She does appear to be the Yeojudaek who sells facial powder at our merchants' inn.

635
00:56:54,670 --> 00:56:58,560
But she comes and goes so freely, so I do not know when she will be here.

636
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,010
So it means she does come here.

637
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,380
Why did you lie when he was looking for Mommy?

638
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:09,540
Mommy went to Hamgyeong-do.

639
00:57:09,540 --> 00:57:13,020
He appears to be a bad guy, so I did not feel right about telling him.

640
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,680
It is just that he looks scary. He is not a bad guy.

641
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,170
How do you know that?

642
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,820
You can tell by looking at people's eyes.

643
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:23,540
It was the eyes of someone scared.

644
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:36,690
Tell Number 23 to bring Lady Sam Soon here after the hair-washing

645
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:39,040
and color her nails with garden balsam petals.

646
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,020
Lady Sam Soon dreams of romantic encounters,

647
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:44,220
so her affection will grow with garden balsam petals,

648
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,890
and it will become an unforgettable memory for them before they marry.

649
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:51,490
You should try it.

650
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:52,650
Pardon?

651
00:57:52,650 --> 00:57:57,800
I need to know how it is done to show the groom candidate how to do it.

652
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,310
Put one finger out for me.

653
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:18,280
Me?

654
00:58:18,830 --> 00:58:21,370
Aren't garden balsam petals for women?

655
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:25,440
To show you how it is done, I cannot do it on myself.

656
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:27,850
Hurry up, we do not have time.

657
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:30,840
Fine, here.

658
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:44,620
The thread.

659
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:46,330
Okay.

660
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,300
Legend has it that if the color remains until the first snow falls, your love will come true.

661
00:59:06,260 --> 00:59:11,430
Please tell the groom candidate to tell the lady that.

662
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,140
Okay.

663
00:59:17,370 --> 00:59:20,260
You know so much about romance,

664
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,180
so why are you living as a widow?

665
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,510
Is it similar to how a monk cannot shave his own head?

666
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:41,200
Though I was with my late husband for less than half a year,

667
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,220
I received so much love from him...

668
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:49,800
that there is no space in my heart to like anyone else.

669
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:57,990
 Now that I think about it, I think I knew the moment I said this

670
00:59:57,990 --> 01:00:05,050
 that I already gave my heart to His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

671
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,100
I can feel her pulse better than the first time.

672
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:24,940
If she continues to improve like this, I think she will be able to get up in a few days.

673
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,900
As we thought,

674
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:30,260
it was because of geumjam poison.

675
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,550
Your Excellency, we are in big trouble.

676
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,930
Gosh, seriously.

677
01:00:41,930 --> 01:00:45,110
What is it that you are making such a fuss?

678
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:49,490
I found out something about Yeojudaek.

679
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:51,190
Do not get too shocked.

680
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:55,840
Yeojudaek is supposedly the murderer who killed the Left State Minister's eldest son.

681
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,910
Did I just hear you wrong, or did you speak wrong?

682
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,390
Explain in a way I can understand!

683
01:01:03,390 --> 01:01:08,120
I met a slave hunter who was searching to catch Yeojudaek at the merchants' inn.

684
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,120
Her crime was murdering the deputy mayor of Pyeongyangbu.

685
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,780
And Yeojudaek's name is Tae Ran.

686
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:14,370
It was a wanted notice

687
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,240
with Yeojudaek's face on it.

688
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:20,780
You may not know this case well because you were in mourning for the princess,

689
01:01:20,780 --> 01:01:24,880
but it was an atrocious case that everyone in Joseon knows about.

690
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,980
How could the culprit of such a heinous crime be going around Hanyang as a merchant?

691
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:34,270
It is all the more possible because it is Hanyang!

692
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:38,340
Is it not where all the wanderers of this country gather?

693
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,370
I must go and personally check for myself.

694
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:12,260
What is it this time that you asked to see me at a place like this?

695
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:16,840
Is it true what you told me

696
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:21,750
about how your name is Soon Deok and that you became a widow five years ago

697
01:02:21,750 --> 01:02:23,960
after your husband died of illness?

698
01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:29,060
Yes. It is true.

699
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:33,790
Are you sure there is not one bit that is false?

700
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,020
How long did you think you could hide your identity?

701
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:47,030
H-How did you find out?

702
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,560
Well, the thing is...

703
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:51,970
I really hoped it would not be true...

704
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:55,340
You made me feel extremely betrayed.

705
01:02:55,340 --> 01:03:00,140
Our matchmaking contract is over as of this moment.

706
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:02,950
Your Excellency, let me explain—

707
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:05,120
What explanation?

708
01:03:08,890 --> 01:03:12,740
What excuse can you give me when you are a murderer?

709
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:30,560
♫  I don't know what's happening, my world changed the day you arrived  ♫

710
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:34,560

711
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:38,640
♫  So I'm unsure of this feeling  ♫

712
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,800
♫  Is it love? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah  ♫

713
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:46,180
♫  I really wonder if it is  ♫

714
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:54,020
♫  My heart races and aches from the moment I met you  ♫

715
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:59,090
  Are you mistaken in thinking I gave my personal feelings to Yeojudaek?

716
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,600
  - What? 
 - In my opinion,

717
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:05,130
  I think you are lovesick.

718
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:08,010
  I think Brother and I are also connected to that case.

719
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,250
  Since we seem to have the same objective,

720
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:13,050
  let us work together on this case.

721
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:17,000
  Find out in secret what Prince Gyeongwoonjae is doing.

722
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:22,600
  You know better than anyone that you two cannot be together.

723
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:29,460
♫  I ran away because I got scared, no matter how hard I try...  ♫

724
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:38,700

725
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:41,600
