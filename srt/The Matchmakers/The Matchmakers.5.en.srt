(The Matchmakers)

6
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,389
It is convenient to make a living on your own.

7
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:01,998
Why must I marry, support a husband,

8
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:03,529
and serve and cater to him too?

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,499
All men are the same.

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,169
Who has an ideal type?

11
00:01:11,669 --> 00:01:13,569
Yes.

12
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:19,080
She said I do not have to marry a man I do not like.

13
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:21,979
My ideal type is someone...

14
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,449
who uses his hands...

15
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,660
to earn enough money to buy the food he eats.

Mencius said...

18
00:01:38,429 --> 00:01:40,399
farming is the basis of a great nation.

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,069
It is not shameful for a nobleman to farm land.

20
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,479
My ideal type...

21
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,179
Even if I were to say,

22
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,690
would my heart count for anything?

23
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,429
(Episode 5: What Happened at Sunhwa Temple)

24
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:20,210
Stop being nervous.

25
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,979
Even my brother cannot recognize me before and after makeup.

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,310
Right.

27
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,699
What do I do?

28
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,569
Oh, no.

29
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:05,949
You...

30
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,759
What is with this outfit?

31
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,729
Do you recognize who I am?

32
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:15,900
How can I not recognize you?

33
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,539
I asked what this outfit was about.

34
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,069
Well...

35
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,168
To make my work easier,

36
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:28,139
I dressed as a Bukchon daughter-in-law.

37
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,809
A peddler pretending to be a rich noblewoman?

38
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:33,380
- I will... - Report me?

39
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,690
Seriously...

40
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,589
This work goes against my beliefs,

41
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,690
and it makes me feel miserable.

42
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,829
He feels miserable over this?

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Without the face full of makeup...

44
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,000
Do not say a thing.

45
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,309
I know I look common...

46
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,039
without the makeup and mole.

47
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,840
I am glad you know that,

48
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,250
but it is not a terrible sight.

49
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:09,079
I prefer this look on you.

50
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:15,889
What?

51
00:04:16,859 --> 00:04:19,329
Forget all that and explain...

52
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,700
why Sunhwa Temple is so special.

53
00:04:21,999 --> 00:04:24,869
Where are the superstar bachelors you spoke of?

54
00:04:25,369 --> 00:04:27,128
I will start by explaining...

55
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,039
Circling the Pagoda of Love.

56
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,249
This is...

57
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:05,970
Oh, dear.

58
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,678
The innermost circle...

59
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:18,489
consist of mothers and children with a purpose.

60
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,589
They check if their future son or daughter-in-law...

61
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,160
is physically well and able.

62
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:30,199
Seok Ho is the young man next to the lady...

63
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,499
in a long hood with a peony.

64
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:36,168
Some aggressive ladies dress up as peddlers...

65
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,539
to check their future children's spouse,

66
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,938
but that is a hassle, so if the timing is right,

67
00:05:40,939 --> 00:05:42,539
they prefer to do this.

68
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,118
There is an unspoken rule to circling the pagoda?

69
00:05:48,119 --> 00:05:49,178
I am surprised.

70
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:51,219
I am surprised you do not know of this...

71
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,350
when you are from Hanyang.

72
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:54,220
My family went to Yongmun Temple.

73
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,059
What a pity.

74
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,788
Then we shall...

75
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:01,429
move onto my favourite stage, the excitement stage.

76
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:03,559
The excitement stage?

77
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:06,700
Wait for me.

78
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,249
This is where people gather if they do not have partners.

79
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,020
It is where first eye contact happens most often.

80
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:57,580
Are you unwell?

81
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,520
When I am in a crowd,

82
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:40,129
my heart races for no reason.

83
00:07:40,559 --> 00:07:41,559
What?

84
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,099
You are speaking our language,

85
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,869
so why do I not know what you mean?

86
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:48,868
When there are too many people,

87
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,840
sometimes my heart beats fast,

88
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,809
and my chest hurts.

89
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,280
I calm down once people stop looking at me.

90
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,809
Stand still in front of me.

91
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,150
Will this...

92
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,049
kill you?

93
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,548
There is no medical solution,

94
00:08:06,549 --> 00:08:07,820
but it is not deadly.

95
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:12,229
Yes. I feel a little better now.

96
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:19,030
Just a moment.

97
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,238
I will make a path.

98
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:27,770
Stay close and walk with your eyes on me.

99
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,139
To put it simply,

100
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,780
use me as a shield and do not look at others.

101
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,580
Then your chest will no longer hurt.

102
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:38,619
Right.

103
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,259
Come along.

104
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,460
We shall go.

105
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:03,409
If we leave like this, we will not meet the bachelors.

106
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,009
The bachelors are not here.

107
00:09:06,249 --> 00:09:08,479
They gather somewhere else.

108
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:19,560
This is it.

109
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,460
Where the bachelors gather.

110
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,498
Matchmakers call it...

111
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:26,830
the Wall of Darkness.

112
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,369
I see no one.

113
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:32,170
Are you sure?

114
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,909
There will be many bachelors.

115
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:39,509
I feel very at ease because I see no one.

116
00:09:40,109 --> 00:09:42,779
Take a few more steps, then look again.

117
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:03,670
What is it now?

118
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,269
Does your chest hurt?

119
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,909
Do not make such a fuss.

120
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:11,080
I do not suffer whenever there is a crowd.

121
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:12,649
Do not treat me like a patient either.

122
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:14,009
Very well.

123
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,019
But tell me if you feel any pain.

124
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,290
I will be your shield.

125
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,060
Okay. I like that idea.

126
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,800
What is that way off in the darkness?

127
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,800
The poor souls who could not circle the pagoda.

128
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,498
Bachelors who came here...

129
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,369
with some kind of hope.

130
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:57,060
You can see more clearly if you step closer.

131
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,639
Come on.

132
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,439
- Goodness. - You play too slow.

133
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,309
Why did you play this move?

134
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,310
- Listen. - Yes?

135
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,950
How about the lady in the jade-coloured long hood?

136
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:22,649
She is too tall for me.

137
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,420
I did not like her that much either.

138
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:28,789
The left state councillor has one daughter,

139
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,358
- and the millionaire... - Lord Song.

140
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,488
Yes, Lord Song's eldest is of marriageable age.

141
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:35,329
What if both ladies were to propose to you?

142
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,099
Whom would you marry?

143
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,869
Wait. I need time to think.

144
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,170
It is not easy.

145
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,739
Why do they even wonder about such things?

146
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:49,809
Is the Bukchon housing price still not under control?

147
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:50,909
How frustrating.

148
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,148
I do not think any official...

149
00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,149
can get Bukchon's housing price under control.

150
00:11:58,119 --> 00:11:59,549
Will you take back the last move?

151
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,420
I was busy talking and did not look.

152
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,159
Once played, there is no going back.

153
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,519
Did you not want the lantern?

154
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,330
Yes, I did want it.

155
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:45,729
Goodness.

156
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,700
I need you...

157
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,799
to make notes of all the bachelors by the wall.

158
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,608
As promised, I will...

159
00:12:52,609 --> 00:12:54,840
bring the ladies here in an hour.

160
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,810
Very well. I will do that.

161
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,040
Is it because it is Buddha's birthday?

162
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:28,940
I look extra good today.

163
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,710
It is not a terrible sight.

164
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,080
I prefer this look on you.

165
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,320
He is the first person to recognize me...

166
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,859
without my makeup.

167
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,888
Come and take a seat.

168
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,920
Okay.

169
00:14:18,889 --> 00:14:22,300
I think Joseon is no longer fair or impartial.

170
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:24,299
If the father is not a high official,

171
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,429
his children have no chance...

172
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:28,200
at holding office or marrying well.

173
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,768
(Deep-seated sense of inheriting wealth)

174
00:14:32,769 --> 00:14:34,170
The type of woman I want...

175
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,379
is someone young and pretty.

176
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:42,950
Okay.

177
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:48,050
Even houses at the top of Mount Mokmyeok cost too much now,

178
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,560
so I could not marry.

179
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,159
I would like to marry a young and pretty woman.

180
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,940
A married man must buy a house within the four gates of Hanyang,

181
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,868
and travel the nation with friends...

182
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,840
once a year to boost their friendship.

183
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,809
I could not find a woman...

184
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:10,310
who would accept that.

185
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,210
The woman I marry must be...

186
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,179
- young and pretty. - Young and pretty.

187
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,220
Correct?

188
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:19,619
How do you know that?

189
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:22,519
It surprises me no longer.

190
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:23,790
O Bong!

191
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,229
The door to the petitioner's drum...

192
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,629
was unlocked by Lieutenant Jung Soon Gu.

193
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,499
- Are you sure? - Yes.

194
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,570
Very well.

195
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,639
Goodness.

196
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,940
So Hyun.

197
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:42,040
Keep your in-laws in line.

198
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,409
I asked around,

199
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,080
and your daughter-in-law's brother unlocked the petitioner's drum.

200
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,850
Why would he do that?

201
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,090
I have no idea.

202
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:55,290
He must have forgotten who made him a lieutenant.

203
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,018
I will scold him...

204
00:15:57,019 --> 00:15:58,119
I will look into it.

205
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,029
You keep quiet.

206
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,200
Very well.

207
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:04,560
By the way,

208
00:16:04,999 --> 00:16:07,729
I saw Lord Gyeongunjae on the way here.

209
00:16:09,739 --> 00:16:11,810
Lord Gyeongunjae is here?

210
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:13,310
Yes.

211
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,238
He is trying to marry off Maeng Ha Na.

212
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,639
That must be why.

213
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,950
Sunhwa Temple on Buddha's birthday is a matchmaker's favourite spot.

214
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,290
Lord Gyeongunjae is a matchmaker?

215
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:31,189
I came from far away because I heard Sunhwa Temple...

216
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,629
was exceptionally beautiful.

217
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:37,060
Regardless of riches or name,

218
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:40,830
I wish to find a woman who accepts me for who I am.

219
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,369
Does that make me a romantic?

220
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:48,269
Until a while ago, I would have said that were absurd.

221
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,509
But you seem more normal than most.

222
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,408
All men are here for the same thing.

223
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:54,710
I need not feel ashamed.

224
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,149
I am a second-hand single man.

225
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:00,790
Do you not know the meaning?

226
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:05,489
I was briefly married, but I am now single.

227
00:17:05,989 --> 00:17:07,090
"Second-hand single."

228
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,329
However, I do not have children,

229
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:13,869
so I am as good as a bachelor.

230
00:17:14,169 --> 00:17:15,300
Do you understand?

231
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,339
I managed a large village school in Myeongryun-dong for years,

232
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,609
so I have a lot of farmland beyond the fortress.

233
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:23,879
I would like a healthy, pretty, virtuous,

234
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,850
and young woman.

235
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:28,209
Do you understand?

236
00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:35,149
Hello. Take a seat.

237
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:43,600
Youth and good looks do not last.

238
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,869
Men grow old just the same.

239
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,270
People of similar age must marry...

240
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,010
if they are to be compatible.

241
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,449
(Normal)

242
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,419
Oh, sorry.

243
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:10,388
Would there be a woman...

244
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,489
(Bachelor 23, Office of Tributes and Food)

245
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,429
who would like a man like me?

246
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:15,559
There might be, so tell me...

247
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,000
your ideal type of woman.

248
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,300
Well...

249
00:18:22,939 --> 00:18:25,969
Any woman who can understand me will do.

250
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,050
Why must I be interviewed?

251
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,179
All the men here must be interviewed.

252
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,520
Whatever.

253
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,889
Bachelor 24, the last one.

254
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:49,330
Yoon Bu Kyum who hails from Sinchon?

255
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Yes.

256
00:18:50,801 --> 00:18:52,769
You got high marks...

257
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:55,000
on the initial state exam,

258
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,638
so why did you turn to farming instead of...

259
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,070
continuing to study?

260
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,879
As part of neither faction, even if I were to take office,

261
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,679
could I ever be successful?

262
00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:06,109
Before then,

263
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,679
could I ever pass the state exam?

264
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,780
Anyone with the necessary skills can pass the state exam.

265
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,689
If you believe so,

266
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,990
you must be in the Dongro Faction.

267
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,539
His distorted inferiority complex has got him...

268
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,969
all twisted inside.

269
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,810
No wonder he is single.

270
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,580
Oh, dear.

271
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,449
Goodness.

272
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,679
(Bachelor interview, done)

273
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,730
Put down your lanterns and gather round.

274
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:05,739
Pass through Iljumun Gate,

275
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:08,240
wear your long hood so no one can see your face,

276
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,209
and head straight to the main temple.

277
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,879
Then circle the two pagodas.

278
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,020
Do you like her?

279
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:23,459
She is over there.

280
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,290
The more you know, the more charms you see.

281
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,629
Circle the pagoda just twice.

282
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:35,398
Starting with Lady Ha Na, take about 50 steps to the left,

283
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:37,439
and stand under the tree with the fish-shaped lantern.

284
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,418
From there,

285
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,320
you can see the Event Horizon of Darkness I spoke of.

286
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,428
Starting with Lady Ha Na,

287
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:03,129
walk across the Event Horizon of Darkness.

288
00:21:03,459 --> 00:21:07,000
When you are about halfway through, use your first eye contact skill.

289
00:21:07,169 --> 00:21:08,530
I will go first.

290
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:17,179
Do as you practiced.

291
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,949
Shall we start with a chant?

292
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,020
Why should we chant?

293
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:24,619
How childish.

294
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,189
I love chants.

295
00:21:36,199 --> 00:21:38,929
Seize your fated match and live happily.

296
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:42,138
- Let us do this. - Let us do this!

297
00:21:42,139 --> 00:21:43,270
Let us do this!

298
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:45,510
Let us go.

299
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,820
Darn it.

300
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,689
Are you trying to show you are in the Namjang Faction?

301
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,019
Why bring that up when you ruined the game?

302
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,029
You know I am with the Dongro Faction.

303
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:09,299
You irritated me by saying the Dongro Faction...

304
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,060
is responsible for rising expenses!

305
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:13,770
That is just an excuse.

306
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:15,198
You thought you would lose,

307
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:16,999
- so you ruined... - Why are they fighting?

308
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,339
- Why? - You should be ashamed.

309
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,770
Do not even ask.

310
00:22:20,209 --> 00:22:22,109
They are fighting over a game of Baduk.

311
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,979
- What will you do, then? - How dare you...

312
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,249
Let us fight.

313
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:28,378
Physically? Do you think you scare me?

314
00:22:28,379 --> 00:22:30,319
- Come at me. - No, you come at me.

315
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,590
I really hate bachelors.

316
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,289
The sisters will pass through soon.

317
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:38,059
- Gosh. - That guy.

318
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,688
Do not stop me.

319
00:22:39,689 --> 00:22:41,859
- Bring it on. - Why you little...

320
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:44,530
I am done for.

321
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:25,399
The sound of a daegeum that brings love!

322
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,679
My lord.

323
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,189
That daegeum music is so annoying.

324
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:48,459
Do you not like it, Auntie?

325
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,330
I like it a lot.

326
00:23:51,959 --> 00:23:54,000
It is too nice.

327
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,439
Something nice is annoying?

328
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,340
If only she were here with us.

329
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,239
I will head back to the hall.

330
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,750
Watch Geun Seok for me.

331
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,580
Okay.

332
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:11,080
Poor her.

333
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:13,889
There is a reason for that.

334
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,138
This is a secret match,

335
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:33,409
so I cannot tell you the exact details,

336
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,608
but the left state councillor’s daughter...

337
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,739
will circle the pagoda with her 12-year-old nephew.

338
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:39,810
You should be able to recognize her right away.

339
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:44,949
How strange.

340
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,050
Why is she not here?

341
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:50,020
Mother. Who are you looking for?

342
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:54,459
I have not circled the pagoda with you in years,

343
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,699
and it makes me so happy.

344
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,030
Does it? I like it as well.

345
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:29,600
My lady.

346
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,030
Right.

347
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,810
Goodness.

348
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:46,810
What the...

349
00:25:59,459 --> 00:26:01,530
What did you just do?

350
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,530
All the men will notice Lady Ha Na's looks.

351
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:07,698
It is easier to find her match...

352
00:26:07,699 --> 00:26:09,270
if she is allowed to choose.

353
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:15,209
Agents of Love with a heightened level of skill...

354
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,080
are said to bring couples together without knowing themselves.

355
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:53,780
Awesome move.

356
00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:06,060
It seems too good a game to give up.

357
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,560
I saw a fairy.

358
00:27:36,459 --> 00:27:37,919
Wait, you...

359
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,070
Why are you banging on a drum?

360
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,639
Your heart pounds when you see the one you like.

361
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,780
The same happens when you hear a drum.

362
00:28:00,949 --> 00:28:02,779
I want to make the men think...

363
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,080
their hearts are beating because they saw Lady Doo Ri.

364
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,918
That is fraud.

365
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,618
Instead of calling it fraud,

366
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:11,359
we shall call it my skill to increase excitement.

367
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:14,490
Lady Doo Ri is not fond of the idea of marriage,

368
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,730
and she needs an enthusiastic bachelor.

369
00:29:36,409 --> 00:29:38,310
This is a spring flower essence.

370
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,080
Spray it on your wrists, neck, and skirt hem before you go.

371
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,149
It is made of flowers?

372
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:54,659
Let us do this.

373
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,839
What is that lantern doing there?

374
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,039
Unfortunately for her, the bachelors care about looks,

375
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,879
so I used the perfume to get their attention as I would a bee's.

376
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,408
The light from the fish lantern...

377
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:17,679
should exaggerate Lady Sam Soon's looks.

378
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,250
That is also fraud caused by an illusion.

379
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:25,320
I believe it is a matchmaking skill.

380
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,060
You are...

381
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,059
definitely more thoughtful.

382
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,060
Yes.

383
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,929
You call fraud a skill.

384
00:30:33,570 --> 00:30:35,800
The future of Joseon is so bleak.

385
00:30:40,209 --> 00:30:41,240
Look.

386
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,250
Oh, dear.

387
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,560
Pollen makes Lady Sam Soon sneeze?

388
00:30:58,719 --> 00:31:01,629
This is bad. She should have told me.

389
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:03,699
My goodness.

390
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,079
No one followed the youngest out.

391
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,080
What now?

392
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:19,480
Do not worry. I will not upset the wedding plans.

393
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:24,049
If we can stick to the plans even if first eye contact failed,

394
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:26,490
why did we go through all this trouble?

395
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:31,659
To find bachelors that the ladies like.

396
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:34,859
Poor Lady Sam Soon...

397
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,800
Darn it.

398
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,679
That sigh.

399
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,320
It was too long.

400
00:31:58,379 --> 00:31:59,449
Hey.

401
00:31:59,689 --> 00:32:01,189
You said you would not come.

402
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,629
I was in the area, so I stopped by.

403
00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:10,859
You are lying.

404
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,100
How is it possible that you happened to be around Sunhwa Temple?

405
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:14,600
I know you came to see me.

406
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:22,209
You brought this horse lantern instead of the turtle lantern.

407
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,540
It is pretty.

408
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,889
Oh, let me pour you one too.

409
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,619
This wine is very good.

410
00:32:37,419 --> 00:32:40,389
What man would want to marry a young lady who loves to drink?

411
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,358
Do not worry.

412
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,599
A handsome young master who studies at Sungkyunkwan...

413
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,060
already proposed to me.

414
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:56,480
That is great news.

415
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,179
So you will get married, kiddo. We should drink to celebrate.

416
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,080
Yes.

417
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:22,030
Goodness. Stop turning around, will you?

418
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,399
You will twist your neck.

419
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,638
Many scholars wanted to be matched with you two,

420
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:28,340
so you can call it a day without regrets.

421
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,009
Sam Soon.

422
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,980
If you are that worried, I suggest you go and ask Lady Yeoju about it.

423
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:35,579
Can I do that?

424
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,980
Doo Ri, go with her.

425
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:39,549
- I must give Mother her medicine. - No, what a hassle.

426
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,419
Come along. Please come with me.

427
00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:42,689
Please, Doo Ri.

428
00:33:48,389 --> 00:33:50,699
So? Was there someone you liked?

429
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:54,369
I could not even see anyone for I was too busy sneezing.

430
00:33:54,629 --> 00:33:57,240
I would like any scholar who finds me charming.

431
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,310
What? Anyone? Do you like men that much?

432
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,810
I know. What is wrong with me?

433
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:06,879
Why can I not maintain my dignity in front of men, unlike you two?

434
00:34:06,909 --> 00:34:09,850
Why do I like men so much and have such a dirty mind?

435
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,830
Hey, why are you running away?

436
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,969
Darn it. That fool.

437
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,619
Shoot.

438
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,190
"Shoot?"

439
00:34:57,799 --> 00:34:58,860
You scared me.

440
00:34:59,569 --> 00:35:00,798
Where did you come from?

441
00:35:00,799 --> 00:35:03,400
Oh, I was very surprised too.

442
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:05,540
I did not expect to see you again at a place like this.

443
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,170
This is nice.

444
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,480
Mind your own business, and just be on your way.

445
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:15,409
I guess you sprained your ankle again.

446
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,080
I cannot just leave, knowing that.

447
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,049
Please hold this for a moment.

448
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,850
And please excuse me.

449
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,230
Hey, put me down at once!

450
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,900
He is after me even on Buddha's birthday?

451
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,670
He is too diligent for his own good, is he not?

452
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,440
Hang on.

453
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:50,580
Is he persistently chasing me because it is me?

454
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:33,360
Hand over the petition in your chest, and I will spare you.

455
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,299
I knew it. You are a woman.

456
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:37,360
The soldier who took the petition...

457
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:40,230
and the assassin who got the petition taken away...

458
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:44,159
both stood there facing each other as if time had stopped.

459
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,270
Back then, they did not know that it was the beginning...

460
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,069
of their love, which would lead them through their long hard journey.

461
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,839
This is such a fantastic beginning.

462
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:07,889
Oh, no!

463
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,600
I knew you were Hwa Rok.

464
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,440
I will not arrest you.

465
00:38:33,509 --> 00:38:34,850
Do not worry.

466
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,560
If you are not here to arrest me,

467
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,400
hurry up and say what you need to say.

468
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,069
Stop writing those erotic romance novels at once.

469
00:38:58,139 --> 00:38:59,638
Corrupting public morals is not the only reason...

470
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,409
the Capital District Office is after Hwa Rok.

471
00:39:02,009 --> 00:39:04,480
They believe you broke the law and caused Lee Cho Ok's death.

472
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,009
I broke the law and caused someone to die?

473
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:09,509
If you get caught, you could face the death penalty.

474
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,350
So if you do not wish to die unfairly...

475
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,850
Well understood.

476
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:34,508
Once you hurt your ankle,

477
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:36,639
it is easy to get a sprained ankle again, so you must be careful.

478
00:39:37,339 --> 00:39:40,650
It will heal with time, so please make yourself at home.

479
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:49,889
I should have followed Sam Soon.

480
00:39:49,989 --> 00:39:52,520
Pardon me? I did not hear what you just said.

481
00:39:52,759 --> 00:39:54,029
I was not talking to you.

482
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:58,060
And did you think I would thank you for this?

483
00:39:59,869 --> 00:40:01,199
My father told me...

484
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:05,199
that the feelings of remorse, gratitude, and love...

485
00:40:05,699 --> 00:40:07,810
should be expressed without delay in order to avoid regret.

486
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,350
It sounds like you have a wonderful father.

487
00:40:17,279 --> 00:40:18,449
Okay, you do that.

488
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,460
There is something I have been curious about.

489
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:32,060
How old are you that you always talk down to me like this?

490
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,429
I am 23. What about you?

491
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,810
We are around the same age.

492
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:44,580
Around the same age? As if.

493
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,779
You look younger than my youngest sister.

494
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,460
If you have not walked around the pagoda yet,

495
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:09,299
how about we do it together?

496
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,569
I already did it.

497
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:24,049
So she already did it.

498
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:35,659
Oh, my. Who knew there was such a scenic spot at Sunhwa Temple?

499
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,230
What a nice view.

500
00:41:39,299 --> 00:41:40,299
Oh, right.

501
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,629
There is something I meant to tell you.

502
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,239
Your daegeum performance earlier was great.

503
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,210
Once I start something, I always excel at it.

504
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:53,880
By the way, will Sam Soon be all right?

505
00:41:57,819 --> 00:42:01,219
I know a rice cake vendor at the market.

506
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:03,289
They make injeolmi,

507
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:05,860
sirutteok, and mugwort jeolpyeon.

508
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,790
One day, they had a lot of sirutteok that did not sell,

509
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,730
but the batch of sirutteok tasted just fine.

510
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,699
I do not think...

511
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,040
that is sirutteok's fault.

512
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,109
You are trying to tell me...

513
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:25,238
that the situation was not in Sam Soon's favour earlier.

514
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:26,310
I knew you would get it.

515
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,610
You understand things very quickly.

516
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,250
Well, stop saying things that everyone in Joseon knows.

517
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,319
Here, take this.

518
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,229
It is the latest item imported from Ming.

519
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,488
Do you know what it is?

520
00:42:41,489 --> 00:42:43,190
- This is... - It is a sky lantern, is it not?

521
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:44,460
Yes, it is.

522
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:47,269
I flew one with my brother in Pyongyang.

523
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,028
You are talking about your brother again.

524
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:51,139
What does your brother do?

525
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:52,500
Goodness.

526
00:42:53,739 --> 00:42:54,969
Speaking of which,

527
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,880
how old are you?

528
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:59,139
You look much younger than me,

529
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:00,949
and yet you talk so casually to me.

530
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:03,210
There.

531
00:43:06,279 --> 00:43:08,520
Oh, no! I have to make a wish.

532
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,259
A wish? Come on. Are you a kid?

533
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:14,830
Here, you can have this.

534
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,130
May I? Truly?

535
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,690
Oh, right.

536
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,929
My goodness.

537
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,500
You really are making a wish?

538
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,239
Let me ask you.

539
00:44:02,409 --> 00:44:03,779
What did you wish for?

540
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,379
My brother told me that your wish would never come true...

541
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,909
if you told anyone what you wished for.

542
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:11,250
Must you talk about your brother again?

543
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,400
I read about this in the erotic romance novel.

544
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,429
This is what happens right before a kiss.

545
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,279
Why is the bell ringing already?

546
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:25,589
My lord, I will see you at the inn in three days.

547
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,060
I will be off, then.

548
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:38,770
After creating a situation like this,

549
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:42,239
you cannot just leave.

550
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,909
Oh, no.

551
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:18,710
Gosh, what should I do?

552
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,489
How come Soon Duk is not here?

553
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,029
I believe she is outside with Geun Seok.

554
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:45,500
I saw Geun Seok with his servant on my way here.

555
00:46:58,350 --> 00:46:59,350
Lady Park.

556
00:46:59,719 --> 00:47:01,949
You must watch your widowed daughter-in-law.

557
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,659
Shall I step out and look for her?

558
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,029
Gosh, you scared me.

559
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:09,889
Aunt, please lower your voice.

560
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:15,369
Why were you praying in the back?

561
00:47:17,339 --> 00:47:18,969
Because you were not here, Mother.

562
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,279
Never forget that you are a member of the Jo family.

563
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,278
Yes, Mother.

564
00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:29,408
You appeared out of nowhere.

565
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:31,020
You were not here even just a moment ago.

566
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,650
Aunt, you did not even look carefully.

567
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,659
My gosh, Ye Jin. You appeared out of nowhere too.

568
00:47:37,819 --> 00:47:40,859
Soon Duk was adamant about doing 1,000 bows,

569
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,629
so I could not go to the lotus lantern festival either.

570
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:43,929
I have been stuck here bowing all day.

571
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,940
Thanks for that.

572
00:48:09,549 --> 00:48:11,319
Oh, I see Uncle Soon Gu over there.

573
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:14,290
Soon Gu.

574
00:48:25,139 --> 00:48:26,969
How have you been?

575
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,170
I have been well, thanks to you.

576
00:48:29,509 --> 00:48:31,739
Your father is doing well too, right?

577
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,080
Yes, thanks to you.

578
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:36,549
Oh, right.

579
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,650
When there was the incident involving the petitioner's drum,

580
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:41,789
I heard you opened the door...

581
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,920
to the petitioner's drum. Am I right?

582
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:50,500
What brings you here at this time?

583
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:53,029
There is a lady who was treated unjustly.

584
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:55,199
Can you open the door to the petitioner's drum?

585
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:59,669
Mother, that was...

586
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:02,009
I did it because Lord Gyeongunjae asked me to.

587
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,380
The royal in-law at Gyeongunjae?

588
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,310
I apologize if it offended you in any way.

589
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,449
No, not at all.

590
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:17,860
Thanks to you, the Minister of Defence could clear his name.

591
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,589
Are you here to see Soon Duk?

592
00:49:23,389 --> 00:49:24,429
Geun Seok.

593
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,198
Soon Duk, I will look after Geun Seok.

594
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,299
You should catch up with your brother.

595
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,799
- You do not need to... - Thank you,

596
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:35,810
Mother.

597
00:49:53,589 --> 00:49:55,860
What is Lord Gyeongunjae up to?

598
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:03,868
I was going to take care of it.

599
00:50:03,869 --> 00:50:06,069
How could you tell a lie that would be exposed in no time?

600
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,540
Mother can ask the Man of Anger...

601
00:50:07,969 --> 00:50:10,810
I mean, she can ask Lord Gyeongunjae directly.

602
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,810
- I did not lie. - You did.

603
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,879
I was the one who asked you to open the door.

604
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:18,149
When the situation was almost sorted out,

605
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:19,750
Lord Gyeongunjae came to see me.

606
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,319
He told me to say he was the one who ordered me to open the door...

607
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,319
if anyone ever asked me.

608
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:27,020
Why did the Man of Anger say that?

609
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,929
Why are you telling me to say you did something you did not do?

610
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,000
The Minister of Defence is the one who did wrong.

611
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:35,500
I do not wish to see a bunch of innocent people being interrogated.

612
00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:36,929
As for me,

613
00:50:37,069 --> 00:50:39,369
I can avoid it, for I am a member of the royal family.

614
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:42,569
You see, this is how much I care for the people.

615
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:45,679
Anyway,

616
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,310
how do you and Lady Yeoju know each other?

617
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:52,020
Who is Lady Yeoju?

618
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:53,949
Oh...

619
00:50:55,449 --> 00:50:56,619
If you do not know her, forget what I said.

620
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:01,359
Just like the rumours, he can be cantankerous...

621
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:04,000
and has a lot of anger, but I do not think he is a bad person.

622
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,000
Does the inspector and Lord Gyeongunjae know each other?

623
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:14,040
No wonder he looked upset when I was bad-mouthing the Man of Anger.

624
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:17,940
What?

625
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:20,880
Nothing.

626
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:23,449
Anyway, I am relieved then.

627
00:51:30,889 --> 00:51:33,560
Can you please behave yourself and stay out of trouble?

628
00:51:34,989 --> 00:51:36,658
Look at you lecturing me after helping me just once.

629
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:39,060
I can take care of myself, so mind your own business.

630
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:40,830
Hurry up and go home.

631
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,630
Already? No, I do not want to.

632
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,770
I rarely get a chance to let loose and play like this.

633
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:48,540
I will play some more.

634
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:51,980
You are not a child.

635
00:51:53,009 --> 00:51:54,080
Come along.

636
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:04,060
I see two lanterns.

637
00:52:06,259 --> 00:52:07,989
Did someone else fly a sky lantern?

638
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,658
(1 hour ago)

639
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:13,899
Do not come here. Please wait there.

640
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:15,368
You will ruin your clothes, my lord.

641
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:17,569
Goodness. Just keep going, will you?

642
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,539
Yes, over there.

643
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,069
I see it right there.

644
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,839
Oh, boy.

645
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:39,460
What did you wish for?

646
00:52:39,889 --> 00:52:43,529
If you tell anyone what you wished for, your wish will never come true.

647
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,759
Says who?

648
00:52:46,299 --> 00:52:48,369
My brother... Goodness, must you ask?

649
00:52:51,139 --> 00:52:53,139
- My apologies. - What is with you?

650
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,529
What brings you here?

651
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,330
I am concerned as to what Lord Gyeongunjae may be up to,

652
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:20,400
so I came to speak with you.

653
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:22,568
If it is about the petitioner's drum,

654
00:53:22,569 --> 00:53:23,968
I will handle it.

655
00:53:23,969 --> 00:53:25,199
Beyond that,

656
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:29,009
his matchmaking for Erudite Maeng's daughters...

657
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,738
bothers me more.

658
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:33,309
So you heard about him being their matchmaker.

659
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:34,908
But this is not the first time...

660
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:37,949
Lord Gyeongunjae has done something weird, you know.

661
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:43,449
The spinsters allowed us to postpone the crown prince's marriage.

662
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,989
How can he matchmake for those model spinsters?

663
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:51,630
By any chance, is he working for His Majesty?

664
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:53,460
It worries me.

665
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,500
Once the upcoming ritual ends,

666
00:53:57,969 --> 00:53:59,838
I was planning to exile him...

667
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,839
by accusing him of bribery from his brother.

668
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,009
I shall bring it forward.

669
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,409
Instead of exiling him,

670
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:12,150
how about we make him Geun Seok's tutor?

671
00:54:14,089 --> 00:54:16,118
Lord Gyeongunjae is not someone...

672
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,489
who will quietly be exiled if he is framed.

673
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:20,860
He will not give up on the Dongro Faction either.

674
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,130
I want to keep him close to fathom his intentions.

675
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,569
Whether he is someone who can work with us...

676
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:31,170
or one we should...

677
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,869
get rid of entirely,

678
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,810
I will be able to decide then.

679
00:54:55,889 --> 00:54:58,060
My lord, it is O Bong.

680
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,869
I compiled a list of tenant farmers based on their farmlands.

681
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:06,699
The letter is from Lady Park, the wife of Lord Jo.

682
00:55:10,509 --> 00:55:11,639
Lady Park?

683
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,650
Why is she ordering me about?

684
00:55:25,659 --> 00:55:26,889
Oh, dear.

685
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,758
What should I do? What do I do?

686
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:31,799
I thought Lady Yeoju would handle everything.

687
00:55:32,029 --> 00:55:35,129
Why are you pacing about here? It is giving me a headache.

688
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:36,468
Back then, I had time...

689
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:38,040
so I thought I could play it by ear.

690
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:40,600
I need to get the wedding date tomorrow. What do I do?

691
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:42,869
Why not ask Madam Lee for help?

692
00:55:46,639 --> 00:55:47,750
Ask Madam Lee?

693
00:55:48,810 --> 00:55:52,150
The left state councillor’s daughter is marrying the headmaster's son?

694
00:55:53,449 --> 00:55:56,488
Of course, I will keep it a secret until their wedding day.

695
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:58,790
I am rather tight-lipped, you see.

696
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:03,860
No.

697
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,559
The moment she gets involved,

698
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,830
the entire city will find out.

699
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:10,839
That is true. The wedding will only be called off.

700
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,540
Why, you...

701
00:56:15,969 --> 00:56:19,609
What if I put on heavier makeup...

702
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:22,080
and go as Lady Yeoju's sister instead?

703
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:24,949
That is too...

704
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:29,290
No. If my brother could not recognize me,

705
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:30,989
Mother might not either.

706
00:56:38,130 --> 00:56:40,130
I will get going.

707
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,969
She will not go there herself, will she?

708
00:57:06,619 --> 00:57:07,759
Please wait here.

709
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:11,230
My lady.

710
00:57:12,299 --> 00:57:14,528
She is here on Lady Yeoju's behalf, who has a cold.

711
00:57:14,529 --> 00:57:15,699
Should I let her in?

712
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:20,270
How can she send someone else when this is supposed to be secret?

713
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,819
Let her in.

714
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,219
Yes, my lady.

715
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:40,389
You want me to get the wedding date myself?

716
00:57:40,619 --> 00:57:42,488
You did not get to see their daughter's face...

717
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:44,259
at Sunhwa Temple, did you?

718
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:48,529
That is true, but how can I go there myself?

719
00:57:50,429 --> 00:57:53,138
Sometimes, noble ladies dress up as peddlers...

720
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:56,440
to have a look at their future daughter-in-law's face.

721
00:57:57,069 --> 00:57:58,610
I have heard of that.

722
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:01,850
But I would have to meet Lady Park there.

723
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,150
Will she not know?

724
00:58:04,049 --> 00:58:05,080
She will probably...

725
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,449
recognize you right away.

726
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:11,118
That is why you should go there...

727
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:14,119
to see if this marriage will be good for your family.

728
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,330
You have been uncertain, have you not?

729
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:25,699
Lady Yeoju sent her apologies for her absence.

730
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,310
And this...

731
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,940
is a present from the headmaster's wife.

732
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,330
There is one for you, Lady Ye Jin, and her aunt.

733
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:52,559
She prepared three pieces.

734
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,960
Even for Royal Noble Consort Suk?

735
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,900
She is such a thoughtful lady.

736
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:00,799
Mother.

737
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,150
Your future mother-in-law will be here tomorrow.

738
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:13,779
Make sure you look demure.

739
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:17,618
First impressions are the most important, after all.

740
00:59:17,619 --> 00:59:19,489
("The Young Master Next Door")

741
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:23,659
If you get in her bad books, your married life will be tough.

742
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,330
Must I go through such lengths?

743
00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:28,600
Tell me about it.

744
00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:31,440
Why were you absent during the pagoda circling?

745
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:37,670
This is my daughter.

746
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,809
I heard Lady Yeoju...

747
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,779
can tell one's love compatibility from their appearance.

748
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,179
I called her over in case you could do the same.

749
00:59:48,049 --> 00:59:49,618
Rumours in town say that...

750
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:53,190
the left state councillor’s daughter makes the best daughter-in-law.

751
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:57,189
How can I, a mere peddler, decide her worthiness?

752
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,059
I heard the headmaster's son...

753
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:01,869
is intelligent and dutiful.

754
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:06,899
Since young, their son has enjoyed studying.

755
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:08,169
As he is compassionate,

756
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:10,610
he has the potential to do great things for the country.

757
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,779
His parents' only concern is that he is too kind for his sake.

758
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,678
If that is so, please tell them that my bright daughter Ye Jin...

759
01:00:19,679 --> 01:00:21,319
and her father...

760
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,319
will help him out with that.

761
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,860
Yes, my lady.

762
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:39,199
May 25? Is that not too soon?

763
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,569
We are certain of him. There is no need for further delay.

764
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:47,779
I will ask Sam Wol's mother to make the detailed preparations.

765
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:50,650
You just need to take care of Ye Jin...

766
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:53,880
and make sure word does not get out until the wedding.

767
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:56,420
Yes, Mother.

768
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:01,830
By the way, Geun Seok's tutor will be here in a while.

769
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:05,698
When I call for you, come to the villa with Geun Seok.

770
01:01:05,699 --> 01:01:07,630
Geun Seok is only 12 years old.

771
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:11,170
Is it not too much for him to handle school and tutoring?

772
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,440
Twelve years old is no longer young.

773
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,610
Now, Geun Seok has to focus on his studies.

774
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:37,960
While I am grateful for the offer, I have never tutored anyone.

775
01:01:39,259 --> 01:01:40,699
I shall have to refuse...

776
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:42,869
tutoring your grandson.

777
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:50,408
Before the crown prince got his title,

778
01:01:50,409 --> 01:01:51,679
did you not...

779
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:54,750
tutor him for half a year?

780
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,149
Back then, I was just his simple companion.

781
01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:02,549
You can simply share ideas with my grandson too.

782
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:16,599
Grandmother, it is Geun Seok.

783
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:17,730
Come in.

784
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,610
(The Matchmakers)

785
01:03:15,230 --> 01:03:16,259
Calm down.

786
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,359
I just need to be careful not to get on his nerves.

787
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,059
You are here early.

788
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,130
He is the famous Man of Anger?

789
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:29,369
Just find out what Soon Duk had been up to.

790
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:32,979
We will be able to get rid of Lady Ha Na's rumour.

791
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,849
She must have feelings for the widower.

792
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:36,480
No. I do not.

793
01:03:37,049 --> 01:03:39,719
It happened in a flash, but I caught it.

794
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,489
His loving gaze.
