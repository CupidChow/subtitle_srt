(Jo Young Bae)

7
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:18,579
Are there still naive fools...

8
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,879
who think Joseon is ruled by a king?

9
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,249
(Left state councillor, henpecked husband)

10
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,319
Joseon is run by the nobility.

11
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:27,149
The reason...

12
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,720
is because a king becomes king by blood, not ability.

13
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,489
In times as complicated as this,

14
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,459
collective intelligence is the answer.

15
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:43,999
(Park So Hyun, Jo's wife, Honourable and Respectful Madame)

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,469
(Actual person in power)

17
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,669
Joseon is naturally...

18
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,910
a nation of women.

19
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,509
A great family...

20
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:54,520
is like a tree that lives for centuries.

21
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:57,649
In order for it to prosper, it must have healthy roots.

22
00:01:58,449 --> 00:02:00,720
I believe it is the women at home...

23
00:02:01,559 --> 00:02:03,619
who make up the roots you do not see.

24
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,360
That is why, however big a crisis you face,

25
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,030
as long as the women are strong and upright,

26
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:13,130
that family will never fall.

27
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:20,739
That is why I think Joseon is a country of women.

28
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:26,410
(Episode 3: I Think I Am an Agent of Love!)

29
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,319
Hwa Rok is the youngest of the old ladies?

30
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,160
- How interesting. - I gave Hwa Rok...

31
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:38,729
No,

32
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,359
I gave Lady Sam Soon my word, but...

33
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:47,739
I was so rude to that lord last time.

34
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,169
If even the chief royal secretary asked for your help,

35
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,609
they seem to need you more than you need them.

36
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,180
Right?

37
00:02:56,639 --> 00:02:58,949
I am not at a disadvantage, am I?

38
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,280
That is right.

39
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,489
Gosh, it's hot!

40
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,650
You could have told me.

41
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:09,919
He is rich...

42
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:11,389
Very well.

43
00:03:11,729 --> 00:03:13,229
Tell him to come for it himself.

44
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,728
You could pass it to me...

45
00:03:15,729 --> 00:03:17,970
No, I say this for your sake.

46
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:20,370
I will be fine, but if you were to get involved,

47
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:22,139
you could lose your head.

48
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,810
I doubt anything good will come from getting involved with him.

49
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:36,620
Lady Jung. Stay out of this match.

50
00:03:36,949 --> 00:03:38,989
That is even more reason for me to help.

51
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,318
That closed-minded weirdo of a nobleman...

52
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,589
will marry off the sisters to any bachelor...

53
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,389
stating the King's decree, as Lady Sam Soon said.

54
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:49,030
Now that I am aware,

55
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
I must do something about it.

56
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,239
"I will be the old ladies' matchmaker."

57
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,650
I will start by saying that.

58
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,609
I can do this.

59
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,279
However rude he may be,

60
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,819
I will think only of Lady Sam Soon.

61
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,660
Good. Let me...

62
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,029
Let me apologize first.

63
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,199
I am sorry for the last time.

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,700
I will be the old ladies' matchmaker.

65
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,479
- The condition... - I have a condition.

66
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,280
You two get on well, and that makes me nervous.

67
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,979
How about you sit down and then talk?

68
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,289
Since you agreed, I will state my condition.

69
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,359
The wedding must happen before June.

70
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,829
I have the King's decree,

71
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,899
I must have prior notification of the families we set up,

72
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,739
and I will participate in every step of the process.

73
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,400
And the husbands...

74
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,510
must be chosen from here.

75
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,510
From this outdated bachelor list?

76
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:18,220
Why does everyone say that as soon as they see the cover?

77
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:20,789
That ancient list of old bachelors...

78
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:22,520
are sons of great families?

79
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,358
The Capital District Office...

80
00:05:24,359 --> 00:05:26,789
stopped compiling that list in the Year of the Snake.

81
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,570
Which means this copy was made at least two years ago.

82
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:36,498
Right here. Look.

83
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:37,970
This man here.

84
00:05:38,369 --> 00:05:40,238
Hyeon Bin from Gwanwoon-dong married last year,

85
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,410
and his son celebrated his first birthday last month.

86
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:48,079
The scribe pretended to be so busy and did not update the list.

87
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,548
Once I take office,

88
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,689
I will rearrange all personnel of the Capital District Office.

89
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,418
The groom can be any bachelor...

90
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,820
even if he is not on that list?

91
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,228
If I summarize the conditions, we have two months,

92
00:05:58,229 --> 00:06:00,159
the groom can only be an old bachelor,

93
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,600
and everything will be done together with you, Lord Sim.

94
00:06:04,059 --> 00:06:05,970
- Is that all? - Yes.

95
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:09,169
Then I will state my condition.

96
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,269
I am the matchmaker.

97
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,640
So follow my practice, whatever it may be.

98
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,909
You mean I must follow your instructions?

99
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,379
Instead of putting it like that...

100
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:24,519
I am the expert, and I will take control.

101
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,049
It is the same thing.

102
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,890
Is it?

103
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:36,260
He has totally fallen for her.

104
00:06:37,299 --> 00:06:38,570
I am paid in advance.

105
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:41,129
The chief royal secretary said so.

106
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,668
One hundred nyang per match, a total of 300 nyang.

107
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:48,339
The down payment is 150 nyang.

108
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,510
You will get the remainder on the wedding day.

109
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,780
I meant 100 nyang for all 3.

110
00:06:53,249 --> 00:06:54,619
He will pay 100 per match?

111
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,080
What losers.

112
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,850
What is wrong?

113
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:00,789
How dare you?

114
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:02,960
Sign the contract first.

115
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,900
(If Lady Yeoju fails to perform any of the terms on the contract...)

116
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,499
If all three of them are not married within May,

117
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,439
you must return double the down payment.

118
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,239
Do you understand?

119
00:07:25,549 --> 00:07:27,950
I am Lady Yeoju, the master of matchmaking.

120
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,220
I never fail.

121
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,019
I will meet the ladies first,

122
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,119
and then start the process in earnest.

123
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,590
Three days from now,

124
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,590
we can meet at the inn and discuss plans and dates.

125
00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:44,770
Why three days from now and not tomorrow?

126
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:47,330
I have another match to finish up first.

127
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Goodbye.

128
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:03,450
Be sure not to lose the contract.

129
00:08:04,049 --> 00:08:05,090
Yes, my lord.

130
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,289
Will you come by tomorrow?

131
00:08:17,929 --> 00:08:19,129
I will not.

132
00:08:20,429 --> 00:08:22,270
You are being so strange.

133
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,808
You went to Lady Kim's for me.

134
00:08:24,809 --> 00:08:26,070
This is different.

135
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,309
I cannot go to Lord Jo's house.

136
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:33,479
Are you afraid of the place?

137
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:35,979
Is it because of...

138
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,089
the rumour that my mother-in-law...

139
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,148
killed her first son's wife,

140
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:41,320
and made it look like suicide to receive a Title of Womanly Honour?

141
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,330
Did you marry into that family knowing that rumour?

142
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:47,590
Are you crazy?

143
00:08:47,859 --> 00:08:49,659
That rumour is groundless.

144
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:51,430
Did you not hear the next rumour?

145
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,869
I did.

146
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,070
The horror story about the lady in the annex.

147
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,889
She got possessed by the spirit of the dead daughter-in-law,

148
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,258
and hit her forehead on a pillar all day long to escape,

149
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,369
and her forehead bled and her skull was visible.

150
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,239
Right.

151
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,340
It's just incredulous.

152
00:09:30,869 --> 00:09:33,170
My forehead is just fine.

153
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,540
They say 99 percent of rumours are lies.

154
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,179
I soon have to travel to do business with Hamgyeong Province merchants...

155
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,019
You leave next month.

156
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,590
Lady Yeoju.

157
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,519
Do you know how strange you are being?

158
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,320
I do not think this is just about the rumour.

159
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:55,359
What is it?

160
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,300
Are you crazy?

161
00:09:59,869 --> 00:10:01,769
How dare you think of going there?

162
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,399
Jo Young Bae...

163
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:04,768
No.

164
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:07,040
What if you were to meet Lord Jo?

165
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,409
He thinks I died eight years ago.

166
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,609
He will not recognize me.

167
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,149
If there is a fuss and his quick-witted wife...

168
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:19,389
were to deduct and realize who I am...

169
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,220
I fear that even more.

170
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:23,720
That is scary.

171
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,229
I do not want to think of it.

172
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:28,600
Still, be careful.

173
00:10:34,029 --> 00:10:35,070
Look.

174
00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:36,440
This right here...

175
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,070
is worth half a sack of rice.

176
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:40,710
What is that?

177
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,609
Do you know how much work I put into getting this powder?

178
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,549
They look real exquisite too.

179
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:49,579
No. Hands off.

180
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,549
You can look only. They are very rare.

181
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,489
- You are so mean. - Not at all.

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,290
What are you doing?

183
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,399
Did this person make this powder?

184
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,768
I got these from old potter Ko Ji Pyung.

185
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:10,100
I do not know who made them.

186
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,170
Where is that place?

187
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:29,590
You are here.

188
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:31,989
I was worried, thinking you would not come.

189
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:33,929
Come on in.

190
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,430
My mother-in-law is waiting.

191
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:53,080
Mother.

192
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,950
Lady Yeoju the peddler is here.

193
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,859
You can return to the annex.

194
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,599
I would like to stay...

195
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,899
If a widow is seen with a peddler,

196
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,800
bad rumours will sprout.

197
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,170
I understand.

198
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:26,509
Do as you practiced.

199
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,659
If you do business in Hanyang,

200
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,658
you should know...

201
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,200
our family does not hire matchmakers.

202
00:12:45,499 --> 00:12:47,170
But you insisted,

203
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,600
and I asked to see you to commend you on your courage.

204
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,609
Tell me...

205
00:12:53,369 --> 00:12:54,409
what family you have in mind.

206
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:04,180
My goodness.

207
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,618
I asked you to call off talks of marriage.

208
00:13:07,619 --> 00:13:09,820
How could you suggest another match?

209
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,488
Cancelling one match with another...

210
00:13:14,489 --> 00:13:15,859
is basic matchmaking practice.

211
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,028
You dislike the deputy minister's son,

212
00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:19,700
not the idea of marriage, correct?

213
00:13:21,369 --> 00:13:23,170
That is true, but...

214
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,009
But what?

215
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,210
Are you seeing someone?

216
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,680
No way.

217
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,180
I would not ruin my future by doing something like that.

218
00:13:38,619 --> 00:13:39,649
But then,

219
00:13:40,019 --> 00:13:42,459
you are at the age where one day you want to marry,

220
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,689
but the next, you want to enjoy the freedom...

221
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:45,960
of single life for longer.

222
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,358
But this young man is a catch.

223
00:13:48,359 --> 00:13:49,659
You will regret missing out on him.

224
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,129
You know I care about looks, right?

225
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,569
I know.

226
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:58,239
This young master did well in class, but he is also handsome.

227
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:00,309
What is more surprising is that he is sweet too.

228
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,139
Someone like him is almost impossible to find.

229
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,450
Sungkyunkwan's Headmaster Lee...

230
00:14:07,979 --> 00:14:09,749
wishes to become in-laws with you.

231
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,789
What matchmaker...

232
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,629
does not know our families are political opponents?

233
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:23,830
My mom will refuse that match.

234
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:29,070
I would say I know your mother better than you do.

235
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,939
I say she will accept the match.

236
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,040
Your mother sees the big picture.

237
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:34,769
Like me.

238
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:38,479
You must know our family and his are political opponents.

239
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,249
Are you sure...

240
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,450
the headmaster's wife suggested this match first?

241
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,350
This is the date and time...

242
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,359
of her son's birth.

243
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:55,659
I see why everyone calls you the master of matchmaking.

244
00:15:01,999 --> 00:15:03,899
This is the date and time of my daughter's birth.

245
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,440
Keep it a secret until the wedding.

246
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,579
I will give you a good date after Buddha's birthday celebration.

247
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,779
Come by again then.

248
00:15:21,149 --> 00:15:24,619
I come here sometimes for a nap.

249
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:28,700
Your father used to join me.

250
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:36,070
Your father was a tough subject to keep close,

251
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,170
but he was a good friend.

252
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,670
Just like you.

253
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,379
About the old ladies' marriages...

254
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:52,920
I hired a skilled matchmaker.

255
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,720
You need not worry anymore.

256
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:56,690
Me?

257
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:58,290
Why would I worry?

258
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,790
You should worry you might fail.

259
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,269
I am worried.

260
00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:08,700
Worries...

261
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,738
Ye Jin will marry...

262
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,639
Sungkyunkwan's headmaster's eldest son.

263
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,008
Is he not an ally...

264
00:16:18,009 --> 00:16:20,550
of the chief royal secretary and his Namjang Faction?

265
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:24,549
He is, but he is an upright man and very wise and learned,

266
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,550
so many of our young scholars respect him greatly.

267
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:30,420
If he were to become one of us,

268
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:34,729
that would be a great help to Prince Jinsung.

269
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,830
I am sure you know what you are doing.

270
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:45,909
Lord Gyeongunjae?

271
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,478
He must have decided...

272
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:52,409
written appeals alone cannot get him an annulment.

273
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,720
He has been seeing the King often.

274
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,050
He could be up to something else.

275
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:03,259
Why would that be a problem?

276
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,229
He is one of our people.

277
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,600
But if he turns his back on us,

278
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,770
he will become the most dangerous enemy.

279
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,409
Soon Duk.

280
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,678
Will you stop pacing?

281
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:29,719
I feel dizzy.

282
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:33,519
It is the wine, not my pacing.

283
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,590
You had enough tonight.

284
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:37,520
What is happening?

285
00:17:38,219 --> 00:17:41,060
It is two days away, so I must have heard by now.

286
00:17:42,699 --> 00:17:43,730
It will not...

287
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,830
be called off over a debt, right?

288
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:50,639
Which family are you working for that you are so anxious?

289
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:56,609
Try not to be too shocked.

290
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:00,449
I will work for the Maeng family from Mount Nam Valley.

291
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,820
The old ladies?

292
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,790
Which one?

293
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:07,689
The eldest...

294
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,060
that is haunted by a virgin ghost?

295
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,760
No, all of them.

296
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,060
No way.

297
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,398
Can you handle all three?

298
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:19,330
You bet I can. I am the master of matchmaking.

299
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,129
If I am to manage,

300
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:24,300
Mother must go to Sunhwa Temple tomorrow.

301
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:26,939
Why has she not said anything yet?

302
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:35,580
Geun Seok.

303
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,149
Geun Seok.

304
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,290
Goodness.

305
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:42,060
Why are you here so late?

306
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,859
Are you...

307
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:47,389
afraid of thunder when you are 12 years old?

308
00:18:47,959 --> 00:18:50,398
Did you come to protect your mom and aunt...

309
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,730
from the scary thunder and lightning?

310
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,030
Yes.

311
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:54,770
So why are you standing there?

312
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,800
Come and sit next to Mom.

313
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:04,579
You want to protect us...

314
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,049
when you are afraid yourself?

315
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,080
A noble scholar does not fear thunder.

316
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:13,619
It is okay.

317
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,889
Shall I tell you a story?

318
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:17,419
Yes, please.

319
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:20,330
Which one shall I tell you?

320
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,129
Right.

321
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:26,230
I will tell you the scary one about a woodcutter and a fairy.

322
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:29,740
How is that story scary?

323
00:19:30,469 --> 00:19:31,840
They part in the end.

324
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,109
Lady Jung.

325
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:38,540
Lady Park wishes to speak with you.

326
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,810
Yes!

327
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,919
She will leave as planned.

328
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:51,090
A long, long time ago, deep in a mountain...

329
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,159
lived a woodcutter.

330
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:57,699
One day, he saved a deer that was running from a hunter.

331
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,909
Mother, it is Soon Duk.

332
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,570
Come in.

333
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,459
I will stay at Sunhwa Temple...

334
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:29,030
until Buddha's birthday to pray and get a date for Ye Jin's wedding.

335
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:31,529
Yes, Mother.

336
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,230
Kim will come to Mapo on the second day of the month.

337
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:37,770
Give him seven bags of rice and one bag for himself.

338
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,209
That will be a total of eight bags of rice.

339
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,809
When buying seafood, buy some extra sea cucumbers,

340
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,809
dried abalone, mussels, cod roe,

341
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:47,209
and conches.

342
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,649
Order ten batches of dried yellow corvina.

343
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,619
Be sure they are fat with eggs.

344
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,589
We need yeast to make dohwa wine,

345
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:00,459
so be sure to order enough.

346
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:07,869
Run the house well while I am gone.

347
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,299
When you come on Buddha's birthday,

348
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,469
dress Ye Jin and Geun Seok in new clothes.

349
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:15,070
Yes, Mother.

350
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:16,909
And you too.

351
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:34,060
I have a lot of matchmaking to do starting tomorrow.

352
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,359
I must finish all the housework today.

353
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,100
- Come along. - Okay.

354
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:41,628
Do your job properly!

355
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:42,969
Goodness.

356
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,669
Is that the best you can do?

357
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,379
What is wrong with you?

358
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,719
The place should be nearby.

359
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,590
Oh, is that the place?

360
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:03,290
I have a bad feeling about it.

361
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,389
Come along.

362
00:22:05,889 --> 00:22:06,889
Go.

363
00:22:23,939 --> 00:22:26,750
A man Innkeeper Hong sent is here. What shall I do?

364
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:28,179
Let him in.

365
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,929
Do you know what poison golden silkworm is?

366
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,699
A poison that leaves no trace.

367
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,399
You do not look like a translator.

368
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,570
You speak Ming well.

369
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,109
You speak fluent Joseon. Have you traded for long?

370
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,480
What if I have?

371
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:03,350
Has anyone else asked for golden silkworm poison in the past?

372
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,689
You ask a merchant too many questions.

373
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,429
Will you buy or not?

374
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,240
You may be from Ming, but how would I know who you...

375
00:23:24,939 --> 00:23:25,939
We will buy.

376
00:23:29,439 --> 00:23:31,010
Do you want to die here?

377
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,409
Buy the thing and leave.

378
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,179
It is hard to come by.

379
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:39,090
You got lucky.

380
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,399
Why did you buy this?

381
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:56,939
Well,

382
00:23:57,199 --> 00:23:59,368
the symptoms of golden silkworm poison mentioned...

383
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:01,270
in a Ming book on medicine I read recently...

384
00:24:01,639 --> 00:24:03,638
were similar to the princess' symptoms...

385
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:05,209
from eight years ago.

386
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,979
Since I procured it, if you analyse the properties...

387
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:11,419
My lord. Please stop.

388
00:24:11,719 --> 00:24:13,888
The princess was not poisoned.

389
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:16,459
She died abruptly of an unknown cause.

390
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,369
There are much fewer, as I thought.

391
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,668
Are you not glad we did not cook too much?

392
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:31,740
Yes.

393
00:24:31,969 --> 00:24:34,270
How did you know we would have so few guests?

394
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,139
Mother went to the temple.

395
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:38,279
Half our guests...

396
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,178
stay the night to speak with her.

397
00:24:40,179 --> 00:24:41,649
There would be fewer of them.

398
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,418
I bet they all went to Sunhwa Temple.

399
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,020
To see who to side with.

400
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:50,419
The nobles' lives are just as pathetic.

401
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:53,059
When Mother is away, there is less work for us...

402
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,830
and less work for me.

403
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:58,429
If every day were like Buddha's birthday,

404
00:24:59,469 --> 00:25:00,899
I would not mind being a daughter-in-law.

405
00:25:04,399 --> 00:25:05,469
Oh, right.

406
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,939
The Minister of Defence is here.

407
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,580
What?

408
00:25:10,379 --> 00:25:12,139
Uncle is here when Mother is not?

409
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,118
I had not bought it in eight years,

410
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,820
and it cost a lot of money.

411
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,750
Do remember anyone other than myself could not have bought this.

412
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,730
I heard the queen prepares the food herself.

413
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,159
How will you give this to him?

414
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,398
How dare you hazard a guess...

415
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,340
when you know nothing?

416
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,669
I do know things.

417
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,270
It is for the crown prince...

418
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,899
I was waiting for your conversation to end.

419
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,270
I came to ask if you will stay for dinner.

420
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,638
Mother is not home, you see.

421
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,909
I will leave soon. Do not prepare my dinner.

422
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,409
Yes, my lord.

423
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,959
I think she overheard.

424
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,290
Will it be okay?

425
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,629
It does not matter.

426
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,699
She will not know what we were talking about.

427
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:40,869
Even so...

428
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:43,199
You are the one who should be more cautious.

429
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,760
No one had a reason to poison the princess.

430
00:27:41,959 --> 00:27:43,000
My lord.

431
00:27:46,969 --> 00:27:49,770
Why are you coming from that direction?

432
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,270
Does it matter where I come from?

433
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:02,010
Are you here with no servant?

434
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,080
You can serve me instead.

435
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,989
Why are you smiling?

436
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,000
I had only seen women or children ride a donkey.

437
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,369
I never saw a grown man ride one.

438
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,629
My older...

439
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:25,139
All the adult noblemen I know ride horses.

440
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:29,040
That is the fallacy of hasty generalization.

441
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,379
Pardon?

442
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,549
It happens when you apply...

443
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,850
your limited experience to the general population.

444
00:28:39,449 --> 00:28:40,520
Forget it.

445
00:28:40,889 --> 00:28:42,859
I did not expect you to understand.

446
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,319
Lead the way.

447
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Yes, sure.

448
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:48,060
"Yes, sure."

449
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,199
Goodness.

450
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,149
Darn you! Are you drunk?

451
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:10,050
They should watch where they go.

452
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:13,649
Gosh...

453
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,689
Get on your donkey.

454
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,230
Gosh...

455
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:45,319
It is a hot day.

456
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,350
You should have brought the donkey.

457
00:29:47,949 --> 00:29:51,060
I did not feel like riding. Do not mind me.

458
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,260
Sure, fine.

459
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,500
Back when I climbed Mount Mokmyeok with my brother,

460
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,398
there were nothing but fields.

461
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,600
Now there are houses here too.

462
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,100
This path used to be so pretty.

463
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,708
The incompetent chief magistrate...

464
00:30:07,709 --> 00:30:10,109
developed the area without a plan.

465
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,310
I see.

466
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,909
Is that why?

467
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,490
Shoo!

468
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,830
My gosh.

469
00:30:35,469 --> 00:30:37,699
Are you afraid of little dogs?

470
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,840
I am...

471
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,810
not afraid of them!

472
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,878
I stayed still because dogs...

473
00:30:42,879 --> 00:30:45,179
tend to react even more if you move!

474
00:30:45,609 --> 00:30:48,879
You do not know anything.

475
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:50,980
Goodness.

476
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,218
She does not even know why I acted that way.

477
00:30:53,219 --> 00:30:54,350
What?

478
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:01,129
He is such a scaredy-cat.

479
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,459
Will you slow down?

480
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,770
You are so energetic.

481
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,169
Do you have anything to drink?

482
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,040
- Are you all right? - I am not all right.

483
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,449
I think I broke my ankle.

484
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,320
- Take it off. - What?

485
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,889
Take what off?

486
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,619
Your beoseon. Let me see your ankle.

487
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,790
Forget it.

488
00:31:31,959 --> 00:31:34,259
I will see a physician later on...

489
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,590
What are you doing?

490
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,199
It is not broken.

491
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,600
I know that.

492
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:45,539
I just sprained my ankle.

493
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,869
I will take care of myself. Please move away from me, will you?

494
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:51,678
My brother told me what to do...

495
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,909
when one sprains an ankle.

496
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:00,820
Is that it?

497
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,859
Did it hurt that bad?

498
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,090
You will feel fine soon.

499
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:09,800
Did you think I did not know what to do?

500
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,398
I was not prepared for that.

501
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,168
You may be an ignorant peddler,

502
00:32:14,169 --> 00:32:15,669
but you should know your place.

503
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,240
Get away from me!

504
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:21,240
Why are you so angry?

505
00:32:22,169 --> 00:32:23,739
You yelled over nothing.

506
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:25,310
Like Man of Anger.

507
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,580
What did you just say?

508
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,379
Oh, dear.

509
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,020
Forgive me...

510
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:36,358
for likening you to a pathetic troublemaker...

511
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,589
like Lord Gyeongunjae.

512
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:38,919
A pathetic troublemaker?

513
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,129
You have never even met Lord Gyeongunjae.

514
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:45,500
He attended his wedding to the princess, and that is final.

515
00:32:45,859 --> 00:32:48,529
What pathetic fool would want an annulment?

516
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,070
That is a true troublemaker.

517
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,899
- Goodness. - Trouble...

518
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,109
That is a lot of trouble.

519
00:32:54,609 --> 00:32:56,010
Where are the honorifics?

520
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,638
What?

521
00:32:57,639 --> 00:32:59,809
You and I are from different social classes.

522
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:02,080
Keep a distance of at least three steps.

523
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,750
Okay, fine.

524
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,290
One answer will do. That gets on my nerves!

525
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:09,619
Fine.

526
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:11,320
Now hurry up.

527
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,468
Instead of shooting glances,

528
00:33:27,469 --> 00:33:29,879
speak up as it gets on my nerves.

529
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,618
Two months might be enough to arrange three matches,

530
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:45,219
but not have the weddings too.

531
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,428
Tradition dictates that nobles wait...

532
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:50,629
at least six months between their children's weddings.

533
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:53,899
Did you think I got into this not knowing that?

534
00:33:54,129 --> 00:33:58,240
I will have all three sisters marry at the exact same time.

535
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,139
A triple wedding?

536
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:03,579
That is a good idea.

537
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,339
How did you come up with it?

538
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,449
It is customary to marry children in order of age,

539
00:34:08,709 --> 00:34:10,780
but there is nothing against marrying at the same time.

540
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,989
It does not go against the nobleman's tradition.

541
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,818
And since the wedding takes place at the bride's home,

542
00:34:15,819 --> 00:34:19,119
it is appropriate that the sisters get married at the same time.

543
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,429
You do know well, as a royal inspector would.

544
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,900
I am smart, and there is nothing I do not know.

545
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:32,040
He can be cute, just like Geun Seok.

546
00:34:32,469 --> 00:34:36,439
Is the plan to put pressure on the unwed ladies...

547
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,610
going as scheduled?

548
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,250
The youngest sister will have left the inn by now.

549
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,719
Do not worry.

550
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,850
Goodness.

551
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,159
This is the original copy by Hwa Rok.

552
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:57,159
Thank you.

553
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,929
However,

554
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:02,869
you promised me that I would meet the author when Volume Two came out.

555
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,369
Why would you like to meet the author?

556
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,580
Many ladies bring gifts to meet Hwa Rok,

557
00:35:11,139 --> 00:35:12,739
but I have never had a scholar ask me this before.

558
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,580
In Hwa Rok's books,

559
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,520
impossible things happen and surprise you every single time,

560
00:35:18,219 --> 00:35:20,789
but the consistency of the stories make you believe them.

561
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,719
Reading Hwa Rok's books makes me forget all my worries,

562
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,420
so I wish to express my gratitude in person.

563
00:35:28,589 --> 00:35:29,799
How inspiring.

564
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,770
Meow.

565
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:36,540
I see.

566
00:35:40,009 --> 00:35:41,369
Speak of the devil!

567
00:35:52,779 --> 00:35:53,790
Where...

568
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:02,060
I heard you wanted to meet me.

569
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,330
Are you Hwa Rok?

570
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I wanted to meet you too.

571
00:36:11,799 --> 00:36:13,269
I hear...

572
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,909
you always pay a lot of money to buy my original books.

573
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:19,610
May I get your autograph?

574
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:21,650
Yes. Of course, you may.

575
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,819
What is your name?

576
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:29,520
I am Jung Soon Gu.

577
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,630
(For Jung Soon Gu)

578
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,230
(Always be happy, from Hwa Rok)

579
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,770
(Always be happy, from Hwa Rok)

580
00:36:50,139 --> 00:36:51,909
Your handwriting confirms that you are Hwa Rok.

581
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,479
You are under arrest for violating the laws.

582
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,179
What? My goodness.

583
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:00,889
Gosh.

584
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,730
My gosh!

585
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:49,739
Oh, no.

586
00:37:56,509 --> 00:37:57,509
You little...

587
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:03,279
- Oh, dear. - Goodness.

588
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:06,219
The house is way too small...

589
00:38:06,449 --> 00:38:08,020
for a triple wedding.

590
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,919
You said it was an important royal order,

591
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,589
but I suppose you have never once visited the house.

592
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:17,600
That makes you an armhole theorist.

593
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:18,799
Am I right?

594
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:22,600
No, not "armhole theorist."

595
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,469
It is "armchair theorist."

596
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:29,440
I see. It is "armchair theorist," not "armhole theorist."

597
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,409
Please refrain from using difficult words and phrases you do not know.

598
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,210
It makes you look awfully ignorant.

599
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:38,650
Once I learn that I am wrong, I never get it wrong again.

600
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,719
Also, do not smile like that.

601
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,190
It truly offends me.

602
00:38:44,889 --> 00:38:46,888
Why does my smile offend you?

603
00:38:46,889 --> 00:38:48,589
And do not mumble like that.

604
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:54,630
As I have made it clear to you, I do not wish to marry.

605
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,100
Why did you come all the way to my house?

606
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:00,270
She is very beautiful.

607
00:39:00,509 --> 00:39:02,469
She must be Lady Ha Na, the eldest daughter.

608
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:06,310
I wish to meet your mother and speak to her in person.

609
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,949
Would you please ask her?

610
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,850
I will ask her.

611
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,719
As I have heard, she is strongly against getting married.

612
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:20,429
There are three tell tale lies.

613
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,459
Old people saying they want to die soon.

614
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,059
Vendors saying they are losing profit on what they are selling.

615
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,529
And spinsters saying they do not wish to marry.

616
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,468
It is not true that she does not wish to marry.

617
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,039
She is still single because she was being too picky,

618
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,569
knowing she was pretty.

619
00:39:33,339 --> 00:39:34,939
You are the master of matchmaking.

620
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:37,110
How could you not even know such basics?

621
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,880
I would say that is the fallacy of hasty generalization.

622
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,650
What did you say?

623
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,389
I am a fast learner for I understand things quickly,

624
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,889
and I am good at applying my knowledge.

625
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:55,790
She said she would meet you.

626
00:39:56,529 --> 00:39:57,600
Please come in.

627
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:18,250
Mother, the inspector is here with a matchmaker.

628
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,819
I cannot see.

629
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:25,460
Inspector, I heard you wished to speak to me about something.

630
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,068
I am here...

631
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:37,440
to help your spinster daughters get married.

632
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,738
From finding suitable men to preparing wedding gifts,

633
00:40:38,739 --> 00:40:39,908
I will take care of it all,

634
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:41,369
so you need not worry.

635
00:40:42,469 --> 00:40:43,739
You are wasting your time.

636
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,310
My daughters do not wish to marry,

637
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:49,750
and I do not want to force them to get married.

638
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,988
Pardon me? That is absurd.

639
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,949
What is absurd about it?

640
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,520
If a woman stays single past the marriageable age,

641
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:01,029
a disaster is bound to befall her because of her resentment.

642
00:41:01,389 --> 00:41:03,259
- Like the drought, for example. - Two days ago,

643
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,029
it rained.

644
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,540
It was not enough at all to break the drought.

645
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,969
My daughters...

646
00:41:12,699 --> 00:41:14,269
chose not to get married of their own accord,

647
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,810
so they do not resent anyone.

648
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:19,110
Hence, they should not be held accountable for the drought.

649
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:21,150
My lady.

650
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:23,520
Women ought to get married,

651
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:25,649
serve their husbands, and produce sons...

652
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,988
to continue the family names.

653
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:30,460
May I ask you why you are neglecting your daughters?

654
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:31,989
I am neglecting them? No.

655
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:34,690
I am doing this for I respect their wishes.

656
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:38,759
And rather than having to serve their parents-in-law...

657
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:41,830
who are not related to them in any way,

658
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:44,868
I believe they should look after me, their blind mother.

659
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:46,839
It is only right.

660
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,479
Now, you know that my daughters do not need a matchmaker's help.

661
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,179
Please leave now.

662
00:41:53,409 --> 00:41:54,609
My lady, but...

663
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,179
Hurry up and escort them out.

664
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:58,380
- I am tired. - Yes, Mother.

665
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,589
Please get up.

666
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,139
- Wait, but... - Please leave.

667
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,638
- I will not see you out. - Gosh.

668
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:24,738
Your mother must be going senile...

669
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:27,109
Goodness! How could you say that in front of her daughter?

670
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,309
Gosh, seriously.

671
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:31,080
Did this lunatic just say my mother was going senile?

672
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,889
Everyone in the village knows that she has a foul mouth.

673
00:42:35,089 --> 00:42:36,989
The second daughter, Maeng Doo Ri.

674
00:42:37,259 --> 00:42:38,259
What? "Lunatic?"

675
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,389
Are you that old fossil in Bukchon?

676
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,659
What?

677
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,230
You were with that man.

678
00:42:56,739 --> 00:42:57,739
- Goodness. - My gosh.

679
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,710
Lady Sam Soon is here. Watch what you say.

680
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,960
(One day ago)

681
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,900
So, Hwa Rok is the youngest one...

682
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,440
of the three spinsters?

683
00:43:28,009 --> 00:43:30,739
Oh, dear. I am deeply worried about the future of this country.

684
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,548
It is absurd that an unmarried woman wrote the erotic romance novel.

685
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:36,549
On top of that, she is pretending to be a man?

686
00:43:37,279 --> 00:43:40,218
No one will pay a fair price for a book written by a woman,

687
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,048
so she had no choice.

688
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:45,389
It is wrong that a woman wrote a book in the first place.

689
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,230
Men and women have different roles,

690
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,928
and the line should never be crossed!

691
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:53,159
So? You cannot do it?

692
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,528
Then shall we report Lady Sam Soon to the Capital District Office...

693
00:43:55,529 --> 00:43:56,900
and give up on this altogether?

694
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,580
No.

695
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,178
Making sure she gets married...

696
00:44:10,179 --> 00:44:12,949
will be the fastest way to restore the Confucian order,

697
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,750
so explain the solution you mentioned earlier.

698
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,290
He is a nobleman, after all.

699
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,299
He quickly managed to find a justifiable ground.

700
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:34,210
Hwa Rok, what are you doing here?

701
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:38,040
What brings you to my house?

702
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,979
Pardon me? A widow and her daughters live here.

703
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,350
What do you mean this is your house?

704
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,819
(Doo Ri, Ha Na)

705
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:50,959
"Such insolence! How dare a woman disguise herself as a man..."

706
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:53,259
"and write a novel mocking the scholar-officials?"

707
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:55,960
"I will report you at once."

708
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:03,400
Inspector.

709
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:07,039
I believe she did it to earn money to look after her ill mother.

710
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:09,409
Could you let it go just this once?

711
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,179
"If it happened while trying to do her filial duty,"

712
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:15,008
"I shall give her a chance."

713
00:45:15,009 --> 00:45:17,048
A chance? Could you please elaborate?

714
00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:20,219
"If all three of them cooperate and get married,"

715
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:22,350
"I will not report her."

716
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,689
I will cooperate.

717
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:29,690
Me too.

718
00:45:30,259 --> 00:45:31,299
Me too.

719
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,529
Good job, everyone.

720
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:36,670
Shall we rehearse it once more? Be more natural this time.

721
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:39,199
Let us begin.

722
00:45:45,779 --> 00:45:47,580
Hwa Rok, what are you doing here?

723
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,549
What? This is different from what we rehearsed.

724
00:45:55,850 --> 00:45:56,889
I know.

725
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:05,029
Oh, no.

726
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,440
What brings you here?

727
00:46:14,369 --> 00:46:17,310
Did you not see a short scholar with fair skin coming in here just now?

728
00:46:19,179 --> 00:46:20,210
I did not see such a scholar.

729
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:23,380
You did not see him either, right? Oh, where did she go?

730
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,520
Where did she go?

731
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:35,630
What is my brother doing here?

732
00:46:36,029 --> 00:46:37,360
I must search the house.

733
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:40,730
What? Why would he search the house?

734
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:42,230
Who is there?

735
00:46:45,869 --> 00:46:46,899
My lady.

736
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,239
I am the matchmaker who came with the inspector.

737
00:46:49,409 --> 00:46:51,980
I got lost and came into the wrong room. I shall be going, then.

738
00:46:59,179 --> 00:47:00,290
I am doomed.

739
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:05,560
What is happening?

740
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:15,469
I am looking for a suspect who sneaked into your house.

741
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,039
I cannot see, but I know...

742
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,409
that there is no one else other than that woman in this room.

743
00:47:40,929 --> 00:47:44,429
Well, this is...

744
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:47,699
Please excuse me.

745
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,270
Did he...

746
00:47:56,909 --> 00:47:59,409
not recognize his own sister?

747
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,350
Wait, this is...

748
00:48:09,049 --> 00:48:11,420
Stop, will you?

749
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:13,319
Only women live in this house.

750
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,600
You suddenly blocking me like this makes it look more suspicious.

751
00:48:20,029 --> 00:48:21,069
What?

752
00:48:21,299 --> 00:48:24,000
That old fossil from Bukchon also said he never saw such a man.

753
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:31,210
I did not see him, so please leave.

754
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,679
Did something happen?

755
00:48:49,659 --> 00:48:50,659
Goodness.

756
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:57,299
Who are these people?

757
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:34,738
If you want to check,

758
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,469
search the house quickly and get lost!

759
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,360
I checked everything I needed to know.

760
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,790
I will be off, then. I apologize for the trouble.

761
00:50:04,139 --> 00:50:07,139
I thought he was different for he was after the real culprit.

762
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:10,040
But of course, he is another one...

763
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:13,080
of those thoughtless fools who never question the system.

764
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,678
Inspector, I suggest you stop being rude...

765
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:18,850
and leave too.

766
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,658
Now that all three of you are here,

767
00:50:26,659 --> 00:50:28,389
I have something to say.

768
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,658
My sisters all feel the same way as I do,

769
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:32,900
so do not waste your time.

770
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:37,298
Once you hear me out, you will change your mind.

771
00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:38,839
Do you not agree?

772
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,239
That officer from the Capital District Office...

773
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:43,739
is after you, Hwa Rok.

774
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,250
You little...

775
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,270
Let me sum it up for you again.

776
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:15,209
All three of you must cooperate to get married before the end of May.

777
00:51:15,210 --> 00:51:18,080
What did I say would happen if you were uncooperative?

778
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,339
Just say it once for we remember everything.

779
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,549
Do not ask us to repeat what you said.

780
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,250
But the thing is, Inspector...

781
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,190
What if things go south even if we did our best to cooperate?

782
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,359
Then it is not our fault, right?

783
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,659
"What if things go south?"

784
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,630
You are being uncooperative by using such vulgar expressions.

785
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,658
Try your best to watch what you say...

786
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:40,969
- Darn you! - Goodness.

787
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:43,199
This is just how I am! What do you want from me?

788
00:51:50,909 --> 00:51:51,909
What?

789
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:56,610
Where did everyone go?

790
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,750
This is just how I am! What do you want from me?

791
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:07,860
What is the matter?

792
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,758
Where have you been?

793
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:12,659
I was asking them to be cooperative.

794
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:15,799
You were asking us? As if. You are threatening us.

795
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:17,899
Agreed.

796
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,769
Even our mother does not want us to get married.

797
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:22,309
You call yourself a scholar, and yet you are using our weakness...

798
00:52:22,310 --> 00:52:24,009
to force us to be unfilial? How petty.

799
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:26,440
It makes me truly angry, and this is extremely unfair.

800
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,080
"Petty?"

801
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,709
I am forcing you to be unfilial?

802
00:52:29,710 --> 00:52:33,150
I now have your mother's permission to be your matchmaker.

803
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:42,960
Mother told you to go ahead and find our matches?

804
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:44,599
No way.

805
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:47,000
Ask her directly to find out whether or not it is true.

806
00:52:47,199 --> 00:52:48,600
Let me introduce myself first.

807
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,639
I am here to provide you with satisfactory matchmaking service.

808
00:52:51,799 --> 00:52:53,239
I am Lady Yeoju.

809
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,008
Oh, you are the famous master of matchmaking,

810
00:52:57,009 --> 00:52:58,239
Lady Yeoju.

811
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:01,750
My gosh. I look forward to working with you.

812
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:04,580
What are you saying?

813
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,549
Whose fault is it that we are in this mess now?

814
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:09,489
The eldest one, the middle one, and the youngest one.

815
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,360
I have now met all of them.

816
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,689
Who knew Lady Sam Soon would run in, being chased by the officer?

817
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:15,960
I was not expecting that at all.

818
00:53:16,290 --> 00:53:17,959
I did not expect that Lord Maeng's daughters...

819
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,799
would be so weird.

820
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,028
While I was gone, you followed my advice...

821
00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:24,698
and threatened Lady Sam Soon's sisters...

822
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:27,469
that you would report her. Well done.

823
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:31,039
You must know this by now, but I am good at everything.

824
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,940
Anyway, you are sure they can all get married, right?

825
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:35,850
Yes, of course.

826
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:38,679
You said you would report Lady Sam Soon,

827
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,520
so Lady Ha Na and Lady Doo Ri will certainly cooperate.

828
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,549
It is almost a done deal.

829
00:53:43,819 --> 00:53:45,589
Lady Sam Soon was being chased by my brother...

830
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:47,259
No. I mean...

831
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:50,460
That officer was really after her,

832
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:52,599
so everyone believed you when you said you would report her.

833
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:54,029
It all worked out.

834
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:58,299
It seems like you are so used to swindling others in this manner.

835
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,299
"Swindling?" No.

836
00:54:00,909 --> 00:54:02,610
It is one of my matchmaking skills.

837
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,610
Oh, right.

838
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,150
You said you were very smart.

839
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,089
That is correct. I am the smartest man in Joseon.

840
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:20,319
Then do you know what the Agent of Love is?

841
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,428
It is a mountain spirit with a knack for matching couples.

842
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,000
It appears in a Goryeo folktale.

843
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:29,199
You truly know everything.

844
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:32,569
If there is anything you do not know, feel free to ask me.

845
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:36,509
Then could you find out more about the Agent of Love?

846
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:39,339
Why?

847
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,610
Please excuse me.

848
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:47,279
Did he...

849
00:54:48,049 --> 00:54:50,489
not recognize his own sister?

850
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,469
My lady.

851
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:07,909
I am Lady Yeoju, a matchmaker from Hanyang.

852
00:55:10,339 --> 00:55:11,839
I do not mean to brag,

853
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:15,080
but I am known as the master of matchmaking among noblewomen.

854
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:16,979
The couples I have matched...

855
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,178
all truly love each other and conceive easily.

856
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:20,678
Especially families with daughters...

857
00:55:20,679 --> 00:55:24,219
Are you trying to tell me that you are the Agent of Love?

858
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:29,190
I do not know what that is,

859
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:31,999
but I am trying to tell you that I am confident...

860
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,529
I can find suitable husbands for your daughters.

861
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:35,730
Forget it.

862
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:37,770
If all my children get married,

863
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:39,839
who will look after this blind woman?

864
00:55:47,179 --> 00:55:48,250
Why are you...

865
00:55:49,409 --> 00:55:51,679
saying something you do not even mean?

866
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,850
What happened five years ago?

867
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:58,790
In the past,

868
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,290
you wanted your daughters to get married, just like other mothers.

869
00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:03,690
Do not run your mouth like that when you know nothing.

870
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:06,130
Over there.

871
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:09,630
The seal on the lovebird painting tells me...

872
00:56:10,069 --> 00:56:11,900
that it was painted in the Year of the Rabbit.

873
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,669
Did you not get it...

874
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:15,739
as a wedding gift for your eldest daughter?

875
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:17,709
Wishing her...

876
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:19,810
a happy marriage.

877
00:56:24,250 --> 00:56:25,650
The government...

878
00:56:25,819 --> 00:56:28,420
plans to wed all the spinsters,

879
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,349
so if you remain stubborn,

880
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,489
your daughters might have to marry men who are not suitable for them.

881
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,529
I want to prevent just that.

882
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:41,199
Were you the matchmaker behind the marriage...

883
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:45,139
between Lord Ha and Lord An's families?

884
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:47,338
Yes, that is correct.

885
00:56:47,339 --> 00:56:49,339
It is one of the marriages I take pride in.

886
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:51,678
The two families support different factions.

887
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:53,440
How did you think to match them up?

888
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:00,219
They looked so lovely together that I could not help myself.

889
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:02,650
You probably will not believe me now,

890
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,960
but I can see it,

891
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:08,989
whether or not they will be compatible.

892
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:12,400
Let me ask you one more question.

893
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:16,730
Why are you hiding your identity to act like a lowborn matchmaker?

894
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:26,839
You cannot answer.

895
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:29,350
That answers my question.

896
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,690
I want you...

897
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:39,790
to be my daughters' matchmaker.

898
00:57:43,889 --> 00:57:46,198
The Agent of Love appears in folktales...

899
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:48,069
and may not actually exist.

900
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,069
They could possibly exist, no?

901
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,699
I am asking because I think I am an Agent of Love.

902
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,709
This is really important to me, so please help me out.

903
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:56,838
Forget it.

904
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:58,379
I am busy enough with matchmaking.

905
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,080
I do not have the time to look into that.

906
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:03,908
All right, then.

907
00:58:03,909 --> 00:58:06,849
Once I finish this case, I will find out myself.

908
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,488
I shall take my leave. Please excuse me.

909
00:58:09,489 --> 00:58:10,619
Wait.

910
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:14,159
You have not said anything about your plans for the spinsters.

911
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,190
I will let you know the day after tomorrow.

912
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:20,900
Please come to the library at the inn at this time.

913
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:22,270
Goodbye.

914
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:25,040
Wait... My goodness.

915
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:30,270
For a merchant,

916
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,540
why is she so busy?

917
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,600
I see. Here it is.

918
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,130
On the Agents of Love.

919
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,639
Wait, I think I once saw it in a Goryeo book.

920
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:12,920
Here it is.

921
00:59:13,679 --> 00:59:15,290
My memory is impeccable.

922
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,960
It has been a while since I saw you here.

923
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,560
Oh, my.

924
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:26,130
Your Highness. What brings you here at this time?

925
00:59:26,759 --> 00:59:29,000
This is the library in my quarters.

926
00:59:29,270 --> 00:59:31,799
I should be the one asking. What brings you here?

927
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:35,339
I thought you have read all the books here.

928
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:40,739
I was looking for a book from Goryeo.

929
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,519
"Agents of Love?"

930
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,689
They are like deities who can identify...

931
00:59:50,690 --> 00:59:52,190
one's soulmate.

932
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:55,359
It is related to the task His Majesty gave me,

933
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,759
so I was looking into it.

934
00:59:57,330 --> 00:59:59,130
Those deities sound interesting.

935
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:02,298
If Agents of Love do exist,

936
01:00:02,299 --> 01:00:04,199
can they find my soulmate too?

937
01:00:08,009 --> 01:00:09,309
Your spouse will be chosen...

938
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,839
by the Queen's quarters through a selection process.

939
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:14,809
Agents of Love could just be a folklore...

940
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:16,409
made up by the uneducated commoners.

941
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:19,049
Do not say that.

942
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,790
What the people want shall become the deities' will.

943
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,690
Even if marriage is just for carrying on the family name,

944
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,519
wanting a good spouse...

945
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:29,060
is something the people and I would both desire, right?

946
01:00:35,529 --> 01:00:38,399
Most influential Agents of Love until the Goryeo era...

947
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:40,000
were women,

948
01:00:40,339 --> 01:00:42,338
and as Joseon was a nation built on Confucianism,

949
01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:44,009
they slowly disappeared.

950
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:46,709
One in 10,000 humans are born...

951
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,250
with the ability to identify one's soulmate,

952
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,979
and people with that special ability...

953
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,619
existed in every era.

954
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:57,619
Since the Silla times, they were called Agents of Love.

955
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,298
I think I know why...

956
01:01:09,299 --> 01:01:11,739
I keep going around to seek people's fates.

957
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,670
Ever since young, I have brought couples together.

958
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,779
I can totally see that happening.

959
01:01:20,110 --> 01:01:22,380
And now I do matchmaking services,

960
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:24,210
despite the risks.

961
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:26,179
I thought you were doing it for money.

962
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:28,319
That is not why.

963
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:31,159
I think...

964
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:34,290
I am an Agent of Love.

965
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,929
What is that?

966
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:41,529
Oh, I am planning to find out more.

967
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:44,969
But they are deities who can identify one's soulmate.

968
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,540
How incredible, right?

969
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,908
That must be why I am obsessed with matchmaking.

970
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,310
I was born for this.

971
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,548
To be honest, I wondered if I was abnormal...

972
01:01:57,549 --> 01:01:59,580
for wanting to meddle in love.

973
01:02:00,819 --> 01:02:02,690
But it was because I am an Agent of Love.

974
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:08,060
"Agent of Love."

975
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:11,199
Even the title sounds cool.

976
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:21,509
She drinks a lot these days.

977
01:02:22,509 --> 01:02:23,969
Is something bugging her?

978
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,819
Please look after Ye Jin until she gets married.

979
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:04,179
Look after her yourself, my dear.

980
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:08,150
Why are you asking me?

981
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:11,589
After all, Ye Jin likes you.

982
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:20,630
I...

983
01:03:22,699 --> 01:03:25,670
started liking Ye Jin because she likes you.

984
01:03:57,230 --> 01:03:59,339
Why did you have to leave so soon?

985
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:03,670
What was the hurry?

986
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,469
Come, this way.

987
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:46,150
What is this commotion?

988
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,589
Wait.

989
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:53,860
Why did you unload these at our place?

990
01:04:54,219 --> 01:04:56,960
We are acting on behalf of the matchmaker.

991
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,400
Lady Yeoju?

992
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:04,400
Sorry that I am not Lady Yeoju.

993
01:05:04,969 --> 01:05:07,839
The Minister of Defence said...

994
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,369
he would take your eldest daughter as his concubine.

995
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,509
Did you just say the Minister of Defence?

996
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:16,509
Yes. Although you will just be his concubine,

997
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,520
he got a matchmaker for the process.

998
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,520
Your marital home will be a new tile-roofed house in Pil-dong,

999
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:25,190
and he also sent you two servants.

1000
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:29,429
Such conditions would be appealing even for young, marriageable ladies.

1001
01:05:29,589 --> 01:05:32,860
Nonetheless, she is a noblewoman. Being a concubine is...

1002
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,028
You heard the rumours. She is lucky to even get this offer.

1003
01:05:36,029 --> 01:05:38,169
How can you get married without my permission?

1004
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,440
Oh, my.

1005
01:05:39,639 --> 01:05:41,739
I thought the discussions were settled.

1006
01:05:43,069 --> 01:05:44,540
I guess not.

1007
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,250
I will not approve of this wedding. All of you, leave.

1008
01:05:49,650 --> 01:05:51,150
Arrest the criminal!

1009
01:05:51,350 --> 01:05:52,380
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

1010
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:55,588
- What criminal? - Why is my mother a criminal?

1011
01:05:55,589 --> 01:05:57,149
- What are you doing? - Move aside!

1012
01:05:57,150 --> 01:05:58,488
- Mother. - Let go of me.

1013
01:05:58,489 --> 01:05:59,690
My mother is not a criminal.

1014
01:06:00,219 --> 01:06:02,060
Mother. Mother!

1015
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,000
My lord!

1016
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:09,699
Goodness. What is the fuss?

1017
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:14,369
The old ladies' mother was arrested by the Capital District Office.

1018
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,770
How unexpected. What was her crime?

1019
01:06:17,069 --> 01:06:19,838
It seems like she got into trouble for refusing...

1020
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,380
Minister Park's marriage offer.

1021
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,449
Her eldest daughter is 24 years old, right?

1022
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:29,088
Since she is a filial daughter,

1023
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:31,790
she will end up accepting the minister's offer.

1024
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:36,729
I have lived to see the day where the ignorant magistrate...

1025
01:06:36,730 --> 01:06:39,130
and the lewd minister are useful to me for once.

1026
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,770
Let us head to the inn.

1027
01:06:43,969 --> 01:06:44,969
But...

1028
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,619
My goodness.

1029
01:06:58,779 --> 01:07:00,380
Were you the one behind it?

1030
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:02,420
What are you talking about?

1031
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:04,488
If a woman cannot marry past the age of 24,

1032
01:07:04,489 --> 01:07:06,819
her parents can be punished by law.

1033
01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:10,859
I am asking if you made Lady Ha Na marry the Minister of Defence.

1034
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,999
Well, about that...

1035
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,900
Is it not a good thing that the eldest girl can finally marry?

1036
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:17,830
I had my doubts.

1037
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,239
So you were the one who came up with that idea.

1038
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,009
I am utterly disappointed in you.

1039
01:07:25,210 --> 01:07:27,210
You are disappointed in me?

1040
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,110
For what reason?

1041
01:07:32,580 --> 01:07:35,949
Since you broke your promise and went against my methods,

1042
01:07:36,219 --> 01:07:39,219
the contract between us is over as of now.

1043
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:42,860
From now on,

1044
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,960
I will do my best to make sure you can never carry out your orders.

1045

(The Matchmakers)

1046
01:08:33,079 --> 01:08:34,838
When a marriage prospect appears,

1047
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:37,208
it is a felony for the parents to reject him.

1048
01:08:37,209 --> 01:08:38,849
It will be worth a lot.

1049
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,319
I will finally have what I want thanks to Lord Gyeongunjae.

1050
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,218
You can come up with an excuse easily.

1051
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,218
Until when do I have to clean up after you?

1052
01:08:46,219 --> 01:08:48,928
Lady Ha Na and I will settle this by noon.

1053
01:08:48,929 --> 01:08:50,128
Please stall time for us.

1054
01:08:50,129 --> 01:08:53,159
No one will suspect you. Do not worry.

1055
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,199
Wait!

1056
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,729
How dare you? Please open up!

1057
01:08:56,730 --> 01:08:58,638
Do you know how long it takes...

1058
01:08:58,639 --> 01:09:00,638
for a man and woman to fall for each other?

1059
01:09:00,639 --> 01:09:04,169
I am not the kind of man who disappoints you.
