(The Matchmakers)

6
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,690
She may be a woman,

7
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:02,159
but I am sure she is a spouse I can admire.

8
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,200
(Yi Jae, 14 years old)

9
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:08,799
(Jung Soon Gu, 29 years old)

10
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,039
We will cherish each other...

11
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,270
and live a good life.

12
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:21,049
I believe I found a spouse who could help our family greatly.

13
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:22,080
(Han Jong Bok, 30 years old)

14
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:28,958

Right now?

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,999
(Jo Ye Jin, 17 years old)

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,039
It is a marriage of convenience. There is nothing to like or dislike.

21
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,079
The family of the minister of defence...

22
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,550
is a good match with my family.

23
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:57,318
I chose my spouse because he was...

24
00:01:57,319 --> 00:02:00,618
the most mature and respectable among the people I knew.

25
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:01,619
(Maeng Ha Na, 24 years old)

26
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,558
The one I am to marry is...

27
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,059
kind, brave, smart,

28
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,669
good-natured...

29
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:14,030
And above all, he is good-looking!

30
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:17,169
My eldest sister has met someone she wanted to,

31
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:19,269
and so did my younger sister.

32
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,469
I am fine.

33
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,479
(Maeng Doo Ri, 23 years old)

34
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,650
I have nothing more to say.

35
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,419
To be frank, marriage is a crazy thing.

36
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,289
(Four brides, confirmed!)

37
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,299
(Episode 14: The One Who Loves More Is the Winner)

38
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:49,299
I did not climb over the wall...

39
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,039
not because I wanted to see you.

40
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:59,280
I wanted to tell you to stop sending me letters.

41
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,448
Are you worried about me? I...

42
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:06,489
No.

43
00:03:08,859 --> 00:03:10,220
It was just as you said.

44
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:14,660
My feelings have died down.

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,269
Our feelings for each other...

46
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:21,440
are probably like a fleeting wind.

47
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:24,609
After some time,

48
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,109
these stormy feelings...

49
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,940
will die down too.

50
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:35,180
I do not have feelings for you anymore.

51
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:46,329
Right.

52
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:49,960
Why do you lie to me and say something you do not mean?

53
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:55,000
You said you did not like me,

54
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,210
yet you jumped over the wall in this annex where I was alone...

55
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,210
only to tell me not to send you letters anymore?

56
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,280
You said you did not like me,

57
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,479
but you kindly let me hold your arm to trust you and come down?

58
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,590
You said you did not like me, but why did your heart...

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,560
race so fast when you held me in your arms?

60
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,570
I must ask you not to see my daughter-in-law again.

61
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,239
If you keep seeing her,

62
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,570
I will have no choice...

63
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,840
but to do things my way for our family.

64
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,650
My heart raced...

65
00:04:46,049 --> 00:04:47,489
because I was afraid.

66
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:53,059
I was afraid you would prejudge my feelings...

67
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,499
and trouble me just as you did right now.

68
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,900
Heart is something...

69
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:05,510
that can race in fear...

70
00:05:06,369 --> 00:05:08,580
or even at the sound of a drum.

71
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,539
Hence,

72
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,879
please behave accordingly...

73
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,879
to prevent causing me any harm.

74
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,160
You have raised your daughter as a smart yet brave girl.

75
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,460
I have not raised her as such.

76
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:05,070
She was born that way.

77
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,900
That was why I had been quite worried.

78
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:14,609
A woman talented in both literary and martial arts...

79
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:18,679
in this land of Joseon usually was not received well.

80
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,520
However, those are qualities a woman needs...

81
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,419
to become the queen.

82
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,090
My daughter...

83
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,989
may not be a meek wife.

84
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,059
However, she is benevolent and down-to-earth.

85
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,900
I am sure she will be a faithful subject and spouse...

86
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,400
for the Crown Prince.

87
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,369
All he needs is a reliable spouse.

88
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,770
I know him very well.

89
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,950
He will be a sweet husband to you.

90
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:09,030
No way.

91
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,570
Ha Na is about to become the Crown Princess.

92
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,499
That little boy must have been the Crown Prince.

93
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:19,140
I see. That was why he had no sense of respect in his eyes.

94
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:22,879
Does this mean we will be the center of the Queen's relatives...

95
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,450
and save Ha Na from the veiled enmity in the palace?

96
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:29,080
What are you talking about?

97
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,020
Do you not know what Ha Na is like?

98
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,189
She is someone who does not need our help.

99
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:40,760
I have decided on the title of my next novel.

100
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,830
"Ladies of the Palace."

101
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:57,950
I do not have an appetite.

102
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,580
You will end up sick if you do not eat.

103
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,090
Have at least one bite.

104
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,869
My father passed away,

105
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:22,700
yet I must still get married?

106
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,340
I do not know what my mother is thinking.

107
00:08:27,869 --> 00:08:29,609
How will the people think of this?

108
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,049
Why do you care about what others think?

109
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:34,280
This is your marriage.

110
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,850
Your opinion is the most important,

111
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,149
so you do not have to marry if you do not wish to.

112
00:08:43,359 --> 00:08:44,619
How can I do that?

113
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,659
My mother is dead set on this.

114
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,259
I can always postpone the wedding...

115
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,800
or call it off without letting a word go out.

116
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:55,440
Just tell me.

117
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,609
Thank you for saying that.

118
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,210
Mother.

119
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:11,790
Goodness.

120
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:15,489
I already told you that Lady Jung would bring her food.

121
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,399
Did you bring this for your aunt?

122
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:23,629
Do not even get me started.

123
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,069
I was really shocked...

124
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:27,629
when he came into the kitchen.

125
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,869
What if Lady Park had seen him?

126
00:09:33,369 --> 00:09:34,840
I was only concerned about myself...

127
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:38,080
and even made a young boy like you worry.

128
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,710
I am sorry.

129
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,249
Do not say that.

130
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,119
You also looked after me all night when I was sick.

131
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,060
That was...

132
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:53,090
Yes, thank you...

133
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,759
for your consideration.

134
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:57,600
Please have some.

135
00:09:57,859 --> 00:10:00,300
I am going to stay until you finish everything.

136
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:04,940
In that case, I shall eat.

137
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,940
You should have a bite first.

138
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,979
Then Geun Seok and Ye Jin would have been forced...

139
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,350
into slavery for treason.

140
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:22,619
Was letting the family fall apart the right thing to do?

141
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,509
My lord. There is a letter for you.

142
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,080
Goodness!

143
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,580
I told you not to accept letters from the inn.

144
00:10:47,409 --> 00:10:50,580
This is from your brother in Wonju.

145
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,518
You must be waiting for a letter...

146
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:55,960
from Lady Jung in the left state councillor’s family.

147
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,460
No.

148
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:05,330
They say people visit the funeral of a minister's dog,

149
00:11:05,869 --> 00:11:08,670
but when the minister dies, no one will bother to come.

150
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,669
The members of Dongro Faction...

151
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,670
used to come by every single day, but none of them came.

152
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,638
It looks like his funeral is...

153
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:18,810
held very quietly.

154
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,820
I guess this is the end of the left state councillor’s power.

155
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,090
(Mourning)

156
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,269
I do not think we will have more visitors.

157
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:48,239
You may give out the food to our servants and tenant farmers.

158
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,440
Yes, Mother.

159
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:02,720
My lord.

160
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:45,499
Where do you wish to go?

161
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:49,830
(Mourning)

162
00:13:54,629 --> 00:13:55,769
It is I, Soon Duk.

163
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:58,070
Come in.

164
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,519
You should also get changed...

165
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,690
and focus on the wedding.

166
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:21,629
Yes.

167
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:25,129
Also, Ye Jin's wedding will be held...

168
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:28,970
along with Erudite Maeng's daughters at our place.

169
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:31,300
You shall also prepare for their wedding.

170
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:33,108
Pardon?

171
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:36,509
I mean, as my daughter-in-law, not as Lady Yeoju.

172
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:39,009
What do you mean?

173
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,080
Why should Ye Jin have her wedding with Erudite Maeng's daughters?

174
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:45,149
You will find out over time.

175
00:14:45,749 --> 00:14:47,819
Just do as I say at the moment.

176
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,989
But still, Ye Jin would not like it.

177
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:55,028
She is entering this marriage for her family.

178
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,960
There is nothing to like or dislike about this.

179
00:14:57,499 --> 00:14:59,768
I will inform Ye Jin myself.

180
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:01,330
You do not have to mind her.

181
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,710
The eldest daughter of Erudite Maeng was chosen as the Crown Princess,

182
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,580
so you could just focus on the other two.

183
00:15:14,909 --> 00:15:15,979
Yes, Mother.

184
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:21,249
You must have known the eldest of that family...

185
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:24,190
would become the Crown Princess.

186
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:30,129
I am not reprimanding you.

187
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:33,330
I am complimenting you for your ability...

188
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:35,670
to recognize a person's talent and use.

189
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,440
Why should I have my wedding with the old ladies?

190
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:46,779
You knew everything, so you should have stopped her.

191
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,479
How could I get married on the same day as Bu Kyum?

192
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,249
I will not do this.

193
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:54,950
No, I cannot.

194
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:59,159
Is the problem that you will have the wedding with him?

195
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,590
On the night...

196
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:04,529
of the May Festival, he refused to get married.

197
00:16:05,729 --> 00:16:07,899
That is why Lady Doo Ri is marrying someone else.

198
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:12,710
If you cannot get over him,

199
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,180
it is not too late to tell me.

200
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,050
It would have been all right before,

201
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:26,649
but if I married Bu Kyum now,

202
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,889
people would think it was because our family was in decline.

203
00:16:31,389 --> 00:16:32,629
I do not want that.

204
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,699
What is important is how you feel, not what others think.

205
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,899
It is important to me.

206
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,700
I will marry into the family of the minister of defence.

207
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,009
If that is what you want, you can do that.

208
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,609
However, one thing more important than your family...

209
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,310
is you.

210
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,969
You will stay here until the day of your wedding...

211
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:18,399
to learn and become familiar with customs of the palace.

212
00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:19,939
All right.

213
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,349
Congratulations on the selection of your eldest daughter...

214
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:00,550
as the Crown Princess.

215
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:07,689
Lord Gyeongunjae told us about the wedding venue.

216
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,189
Everything was decided by the higher-ups,

217
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,889
so we should abide by the decision.

218
00:18:12,129 --> 00:18:14,929
We will pay extra attention to cause no inconvenience,

219
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,830
so please do not worry.

220
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:18,730
I am not worried.

221
00:18:20,199 --> 00:18:22,699
I already know you will do a wonderful job.

222
00:18:25,639 --> 00:18:28,240
Why should we marry at her place?

223
00:18:28,639 --> 00:18:29,679
This is the worst.

224
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:31,879
- Goodness. - Stop it.

225
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,449
Please consider that not heard, Lady Jung.

226
00:18:38,149 --> 00:18:42,219
You are the younger sister of Lieutenant Jung, right?

227
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,159
You are such a beauty.

228
00:18:48,459 --> 00:18:49,530
Anyway,

229
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,399
have we met before?

230
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:54,669
You seem familiar.

231
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,040
Is it because you are such a beauty?

232
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:07,010
Why are you kissing up to her even before you are married?

233
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:12,619
We have...

234
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,149
met each other.

235
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:26,429
This is all thanks to you.

236
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,669
You and Lady Ha Na have met because you two were meant to be.

237
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,810
All I did was bring you the utensil after the meal was prepared.

238
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,809
Without the utensil, it would be difficult...

239
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,250
to eat the meal.

240
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,918
Right, about the Agent of Love who said Lady Ha Na...

241
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,350
and I were meant to be.

242
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:52,159
Is she a widower?

243
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,530
Something like that.

244
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,500
I knew it. The legend was right.

245
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,938
I was reading "Book of Folk Tales..."

246
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:06,609
and found a story on the sad fate of the Agent of Love,

247
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,240
so I wanted to let you know.

248
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,688
Back in Silla, the Agent of Love was not called that.

249
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,419
Rather, the Lonely Agent.

250
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:23,989
Because their spouse would die young...

251
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,790
when they married someone they were meant to be with.

252
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,320
These people could not be with someone they loved.

253
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:53,090
It is such a sad destiny.

254
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,069
It is as if you put on a disguise.

255
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,539
You look absolutely different without your makeup.

256
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,699
It is such a wonder.

257
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,709
I apologize for deceiving you.

258
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,310
Please be happy with my brother.

259
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:20,980
I also hope to get along with you,

260
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,350
my sister-in-law.

261
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,418
Enough is enough.

262
00:21:25,419 --> 00:21:28,520
You have not married him. She is not your sister-in-law yet.

263
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:35,259
Do you not think you should meet your groom before you marry him?

264
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,600
I am fine.

265
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,429
It is not like I could change my husband after I meet him.

266
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,330
Who knows?

267
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,409
I already know it is impossible.

268
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,340
By any chance, is there someone you fancy?

269
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:54,209
I just do not wish to get married.

270
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,619
May I ask why you do not wish...

271
00:21:59,889 --> 00:22:01,219
to be married?

272
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:21,510
My mother became blind because of me.

273
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,879
What do you mean?

274
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,350
My father only focused on his studies,

275
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:32,449
so he could not care less about how his family would eat.

276
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,219
My mother made a living for us by working as a matchmaker.

277
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:41,060
But my grandmother and father were ashamed of her,

278
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:44,159
saying she was in a vulgar trade.

279
00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:50,000
Once I grew old enough to make money with needlework,

280
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:53,070
my grandmother fed her poison and blinded her...

281
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,080
to make sure she could not go outside anymore.

282
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,250
My father knew about it, but he did not stop her.

283
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,090
How is this your fault?

284
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:08,790
The fault is on your grandmother and father.

285
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:13,790
I know that.

286
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:17,730
But whenever I see my mother,

287
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:21,169
it still feels like my fault.

288
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:26,740
Sam Soon was too young to know.

289
00:23:27,409 --> 00:23:29,240
But when Ha Na and I found out,

290
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,178
we signed a note swearing that the three sisters would...

291
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:34,810
live together for life without marrying.

292
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,820
I still have not changed my mind.

293
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:42,090
This is why...

294
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,090
I do not wish to marry.

295
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,300
My lord.

296
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,730
What brings you here?

297
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,138
The ladies of this family will marry at my house...

298
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:34,169
I know.

299
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,908
I did not come because of their wedding.

300
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,709
I came to ask a question to the wife of Erudite Maeng.

301
00:24:58,699 --> 00:25:01,730
When an Agent of Love marries the one for them,

302
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,869
their spouse dies young?

303
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,709
I have never heard that before.

304
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,939
Well, Erudite Maeng did not exactly pass away young.

305
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,209
Ha Na's father...

306
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,280
was not someone meant to be with me.

307
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:22,359
There was someone I was to marry before I married him.

308
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,260
He was the one.

309
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,830
A week before we married, there was an epidemic in my village.

310
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,260
He passed away before we could do anything.

311
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,499
I had already received the wedding letter from him,

312
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,070
so I was as good as married.

313
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,909
But both families agreed to treat it as if it never happened.

314
00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:43,080
Would this mean...

315
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,679
he passed away because I was an Agent of Love?

316
00:26:20,709 --> 00:26:22,179
This is inconvenient, so please leave first.

317
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,000
You can tell me.

318
00:26:40,969 --> 00:26:42,100
Tell you what?

319
00:26:42,699 --> 00:26:44,399
The things you wish to say.

320
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,040
You said you did not like me anymore.

321
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,739
However, I still have feelings for you,

322
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,379
so you can talk to me.

323
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,820
I do not have anything I want to say.

324
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:00,219
It is because you cannot see yourself right now.

325
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,189
You look as if you have so many things to say.

326
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,329
Even if I had something I wanted to say,

327
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,760
why should I talk to you?

328
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,899
If you came to visit Erudite Maeng's wife,

329
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,310
it must be about the ladies' wedding or the Agent of Love.

330
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:22,169
And I am the only one you can talk to about these matters.

331
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,750
So please, go ahead.

332
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,379
Do not be afraid.

333
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,689
You just smiled, so you have to tell me now.

334
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,859
I know a great place where we can chat.

335
00:27:57,939 --> 00:27:59,679
I tried so hard...

336
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,750
to find out why the Princess died.

337
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:06,490
You do not think...

338
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,159
the Princess passed away...

339
00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:11,419
because you are an Agent of Love, do you?

340
00:28:14,189 --> 00:28:16,000
Do you really believe that?

341
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,369
The years of human life is up to fade.

342
00:28:21,469 --> 00:28:23,840
Not fade, but fate.

343
00:28:24,139 --> 00:28:25,240
Precisely.

344
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,439
You are such a smart man. Why do you believe such an old tale?

345
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,340
Well, I mean,

346
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,750
it also happened to Lady Cho's old fiancé.

347
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,949
It is not like you have asked every single Agent of Love.

348
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,419
To me, it sounds like the fallacy of hasty generalization.

349
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,659
Lady Jung, why did you suddenly become so smart?

350
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,469
I learned it all from you.

351
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,699
Try to think more rationally.

352
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,938
How is it your fault...

353
00:28:58,939 --> 00:29:00,310
that the Princess passed away?

354
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:03,810
It is because of those who used poison for their treachery.

355
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,219
It still feels like my fault.

356
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:15,990
Only if she had not married an Agent of Love like me...

357
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,389
Please do not get such an idea.

358
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,230
It was not your fault.

359
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,099
I am not taking your side blindly...

360
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,869
because of my feelings for you.

361
00:29:31,139 --> 00:29:32,570
It is simply a fact.

362
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
So...

363
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,550
do not blame yourself.

364
00:29:50,659 --> 00:29:51,689
Thank you.

365
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,530
No, thank you.

366
00:29:57,699 --> 00:29:59,500
I seemed to have found...

367
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,040
the answer to my concern as I spoke with you.

368
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:07,669
I am...

369
00:30:09,209 --> 00:30:10,310
starting...

370
00:30:12,209 --> 00:30:14,709
to like you...

371
00:30:15,609 --> 00:30:16,780
more and more.

372
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,810
What did you and Lady Yeoju talk about?

373
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,709
Well, I asked her about my husband-to-be.

374
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:52,649
Are you starting to feel a little excited about your wedding?

375
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,260
Gosh, I am so relieved.

376
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,990
I was worried you were marrying against your will,

377
00:31:01,629 --> 00:31:04,629
even though you despised getting married.

378
00:31:05,859 --> 00:31:07,070
Do you think I am crazy?

379
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,969
Why would I marry against my will because of you?

380
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,270
Exactly.

381
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,208
Gosh, Doo Ri.

382
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,510
Let us continue to be good sisters even after we marry.

383
00:31:22,550 --> 00:31:23,619
Sure, I guess.

384
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,659
What do you wish to say to me?

385
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,369
I have given a thought about the question you asked me.

386
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:46,409
Good.

387
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:49,209
If you were in that situation,

388
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,609
how would you save your family? Have you found a way?

389
00:31:57,619 --> 00:31:58,649
No.

390
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:02,619
I realized it was meaningless to look for a way.

391
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,560
If it were me,

392
00:32:05,689 --> 00:32:07,158
I would not have made a foolish decision...

393
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:09,459
to take the Crown Prince's life.

394
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,629
"Foolish."

395
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,199
In that case,

396
00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:21,868
would you have sat around and let Prince Jinsung...

397
00:32:21,869 --> 00:32:23,580
lose his position as the Crown Prince?

398
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,840
If that was the course of nature, then yes, I would have followed.

399
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,378
It is not something we can change, is it?

400
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:32,649
The course of nature is created by those in power.

401
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,889
With power,

402
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:37,359
anyone else would have made the same decision I did.

403
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:43,060
Because of your decision,

404
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,230
Father died, and so did your brother.

405
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,840
Is this your definition of nature's course?

406
00:32:53,169 --> 00:32:55,770
Although I looked up to you and tried to take after you,

407
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:00,050
I have realized that I will never be the person you want me to be.

408
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,149
From now on,

409
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,990
I will find my own way.

410
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,530
All right.

411
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:16,800
Try and find your way.

412
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,969
You will be the head of this household, after all.

413
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,409
My sincere congratulations on the Crown Prince's wedding.

414
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:06,480
I never thought I would get to receive your blessings...

415
00:34:08,109 --> 00:34:09,250
for my son's wedding.

416
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:10,949
Please forget...

417
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,920
about my son's wrongdoing in the past.

418
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:18,389
From now on, I will serve you with utmost sincerity.

419
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,429
Very well.

420
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,500
May I recommend that you send Prince Jinsung...

421
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,629
to lead the envoy troop...

422
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,440
leaving in August?

423
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:33,369
With Prince Jinsung out of Joseon,

424
00:34:33,869 --> 00:34:36,110
your mind will be at ease.

425
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,839
Will Prince Jinsung agree to it?

426
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,809
Especially when the troop will be fetching...

427
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,380
the Crown Prince's investiture letter.

428
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,250
If that is your concern,

429
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:52,389
how about sending Lord Gyeongunjae with him?

430
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,130
Gyeongunjae?

431
00:34:55,131 --> 00:34:57,259
If he accompanies Prince Jinsung,

432
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,569
you will have your peace of mind.

433
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,339
As a member of the royal family,

434
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:06,569
Lord Gyeongunjae will also be glad to aid the Crown Prince.

435
00:35:09,339 --> 00:35:10,980
I shall think about it.

436
00:35:21,819 --> 00:35:23,420
Lady Park came to me.

437
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:25,920
She said that for the Crown Prince's sake,

438
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,290
we should send Lord Gyeongunjae with the envoys heading to Ming.

439
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,130
Is that so?

440
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,759
Upon hearing that,

441
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:39,610
I believe the Crown Prince needs Lord Gyeongunjae.

442
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,440
We should...

443
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,179
allow Lord Gyeongunjae to assist the Crown Prince.

444
00:35:45,509 --> 00:35:46,810
Please...

445
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:49,409
grant his marriage annulment appeal.

446
00:35:52,989 --> 00:35:54,819
If I grant his appeal,

447
00:35:55,589 --> 00:35:59,360
the Princess shall be a lonely soul who was unwed.

448
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:02,259
Will you be all right?

449
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,830
Lord Gyeongunjae wrote that appeal in the first place...

450
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:08,500
because of the Princess' last words, did he not?

451
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:11,969
You are right.

452
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,980
Lord Gyeongunjae always seemed pitiful.

453
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:19,850
I felt bad whenever I saw him.

454
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:24,420
Thank you for bringing it up first.

455
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,069
What brings you here?

456
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,540
Like a noble father-in-law,

457
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,909
I came to have a drink with my son-in-law.

458
00:37:03,589 --> 00:37:07,330
You must have spent a long and lonesome time in here.

459
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:09,159
I have been kept busy.

460
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,630
By writing all those annulment appeals?

461
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:16,170
They were not the only tasks I had.

462
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:20,440
Although you said there was no need,

463
00:37:21,409 --> 00:37:23,080
once this wedding wraps up,

464
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:27,650
I intend to grant your appeal to annul your marriage.

465
00:37:31,779 --> 00:37:32,779
Your Majesty.

466
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:34,949
I like my current arrangement.

467
00:37:39,759 --> 00:37:40,959
The Princess told you...

468
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,029
to work for the government and help me.

469
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,900
Will you ignore her last wishes?

470
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,940
While matchmaking under your orders,

471
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:52,940
I have realized a lot.

472
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,509
Love is everywhere and it is the start of everything.

473
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,948
We will expose the truth to everyone...

474
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,779
and turn rumours into praises.

475
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,920
We will also punish the merciless murderer.

476
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,119
If you are okay with it,

477
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:11,020
I would like to help you...

478
00:38:11,619 --> 00:38:13,659
find the murderer even if you cannot recall.

479
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,860
I learned that...

480
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,500
I do not need to take office to help the country.

481
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:22,699
Hence,

482
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:27,569
I will do my best to help you from my current position.

483
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,509
You have finally picked up the workings of the world.

484
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,049
If you take office,

485
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:39,989
you will be able to do far more things for me.

486
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,250
Therefore,

487
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,319
be prepared to work for the country and the people.

488
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,960
I am not saying this as your father-in-law.

489
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:49,330
This is my order as the king.

490
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:54,029
What?

491
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,469
You do not want an increased workload?

492
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,639
How long do you plan to laze in here?

493
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,239
Tell me!

494
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,350
I shall obey your order.

495
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:14,589
In that case,

496
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:18,960
you should wrap up the spinsters' weddings first.

497
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:22,759
The Crown Prince...

498
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,759
said he wanted to attend the wedding.

499
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,799
But that family is...

500
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
I know.

501
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:35,210
I myself do not approve of him being there.

502
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:37,440
But for nobles,

503
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,508
it would be the wedding of his future sisters-in-law.

504
00:39:39,509 --> 00:39:41,310
So he has every right to be there.

505
00:39:42,679 --> 00:39:46,549
It seems like a great decision for his first political move.

506
00:39:46,889 --> 00:39:48,089
So I agreed to it.

507
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:50,888
We need to show them that...

508
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,429
the Crown Prince no longer fears them.

509
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,330
So Jung Woo,

510
00:39:57,759 --> 00:40:00,869
do your best to help the Crown Prince by his side.

511
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,139
Yes, Your Majesty.

512
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,980
Pour me one.

513
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:12,839
Goodness.

514
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,199
Why did you not tell me?

515
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:37,869
Well, I...

516
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,139
You had plenty of chances to tell me.

517
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,778
Please do not worry.

518
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,110
My sister will...

519
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,080
Why should I be worried?

520
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:53,690
I am so happy.

521
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:56,219
If Lady Yeoju is my sister-in-law,

522
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,819
she will fully support me in writing my novels.

523
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,630
I see.

524
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:09,600
I will not stop you from writing.

525
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,969
But please make them less obscene.

526
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:16,509
Are you...

527
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,080
telling me not to write lewd scenes?

528
00:41:21,909 --> 00:41:23,980
- Yes. - That is out of the question.

529
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,290
Without those scenes, the ladies will drop the novels.

530
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:31,119
In that case, please make them more realistic.

531
00:41:31,819 --> 00:41:33,730
At the end of "The Lady's Private Life,"

532
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,089
her translucent clothes were...

533
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:37,759
How is that possible?

534
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,699
I see.

535
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:43,739
You mean the lady's combat outfit.

536
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,270
That dress...

537
00:41:47,009 --> 00:41:48,540
really exists.

538
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:50,610
Please do not make things up just because I do not know.

539
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:52,679
For someone who hates lewd things,

540
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:54,650
you sure have a good memory.

541
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:02,549
Are you having fun?

542
00:42:03,219 --> 00:42:04,219
Yes.

543
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:05,920
Do not tease me.

544
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:09,929
Are you allowed out of the house now?

545
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,158
Mother told me...

546
00:42:13,159 --> 00:42:15,000
to find a matchmaker for Ye Jin.

547
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,639
I thought the wedding was settled.

548
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,199
Why do you need a matchmaker?

549
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:21,009
Should I do it?

550
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,509
I found one already.

551
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,739
She is perfect for the job.

552
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,778
My goodness.

553
00:42:30,779 --> 00:42:34,819
These goods are great. Wonderful.

554
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,359
Are you Madam Lee?

555
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,830
Yes, that is me.

556
00:42:43,659 --> 00:42:44,699
Are you...

557
00:42:49,029 --> 00:42:51,299
We met at Sunhwa Temple on Buddha's birthday, right?

558
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,339
Which family is she from?

559
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:56,408
She is Lord Jo's daughter-in-law.

560
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,480
Watch your manners.

561
00:42:57,639 --> 00:42:59,210
My goodness, the insane one?

562
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,310
I mean...

563
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,920
What brings you here?

564
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:09,089
Sam Wol's mother should have informed me first.

565
00:43:09,889 --> 00:43:12,889
Lady Yeoju disappeared when she was in charge of Ye Jin's wedding.

566
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,088
I want you to take over since I heard...

567
00:43:15,089 --> 00:43:16,560
you were the most experienced.

568
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,900
Being your family's matchmaker...

569
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,000
would be an honour.

570
00:43:21,429 --> 00:43:23,939
You just need to receive the silks and dowry...

571
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:26,199
from the groom's family, who is the Minister of Defence.

572
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:29,869
Make sure to keep it a secret.

573
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,779
Of course.

574
00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:36,009
I am extremely tight-lipped, you know.

575
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,159
Well then, I am counting on you.

576
00:43:47,929 --> 00:43:50,400
The left state councillor and the Minister of Defence?

577
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,630
It is a secret. Do not tell anyone.

578
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Do not worry.

579
00:43:56,369 --> 00:43:58,170
You know what is juicier?

580
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,739
Lady Yeoju fled in the middle of the night.

581
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,540
- Why? - What do you think?

582
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:06,638
Seeing how a slave hunter was after her,

583
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:07,980
she must have been a runaway slave.

584
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,049
She fled since her identity would be exposed.

585
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:11,979
She did not seem like one.

586
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,049
Why, she looked exactly like one to me.

587
00:44:15,089 --> 00:44:19,119
I should be off to the Minister of Defence's.

588
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,759
They always ask me for important tasks.

589
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:26,929
Goodness.

590
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,699
Lord Jo's daughter will marry the Minister of Defence's son?

591
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,900
The Jo family still has prestige.

592
00:44:32,139 --> 00:44:33,139
Right?

593
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:34,409
Madam!

594
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,179
Big news.

595
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:39,909
Lord Jo's daughter...

596
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:42,650
Is marrying the Minister of Defence's son?

597
00:44:43,449 --> 00:44:44,449
What?

598
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:46,179
How did you know?

599
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,388
Anyway, the bigger news is...

600
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,759
Lady Yeoju fled in the middle of the night?

601
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,060
What?

602
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,389
She said it was a secret.

603
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:59,028
How can she go around spreading it herself? Goodness.

604
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,830
By tomorrow, the rumours will be all over the city.

605
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:07,170
So that is why you chose Madam Lee the gossip.

606
00:45:10,139 --> 00:45:11,939
I guess Mother wants people to know...

607
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,779
that our family is still strong.

608
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,549
As you said,

609
00:45:16,409 --> 00:45:19,520
I think Lady Park is an incredible person.

610
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,789
I plan to pack up...

611
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:32,029
and move to Ming to start my powder business.

612
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,429
With the officer?

613
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,500
There is nothing between...

614
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,440
the officer and I.

615
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:44,509
As if. I can totally see something.

616
00:45:45,279 --> 00:45:47,750
That officer likes you.

617
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,949
You know I am as intuitive as a shaman, right?

618
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:54,619
Of course.

619
00:45:58,719 --> 00:45:59,889
I took advantage...

620
00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:03,290
of the officer's feelings for me to stay alive.

621
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,330
I knew that he liked me.

622
00:46:12,739 --> 00:46:13,770
So...

623
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,670
I asked him to let me go eight years ago.

624
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,580
I knew that he could not refuse.

625
00:46:23,279 --> 00:46:24,980
Because of that, he lost his title,

626
00:46:26,049 --> 00:46:28,719
and his entire life was ruined.

627
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:34,360
But you like him too.

628
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,869
It would be shameless of me to like him.

629
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:43,400
How frustrating.

630
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,799
Please help them, Lady Jung.

631
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:51,080
The officer is leaving today.

632
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,480
What?

633
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:55,810
And why are you here?

634
00:46:58,920 --> 00:46:59,920
Go and get him.

635
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:02,119
There is no shame in love.

636
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,769
I told you to stop sending me letters.

637
00:47:13,770 --> 00:47:15,130
Why do you not listen?

638
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,069
You are quite early despite being angry.

639
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:21,639
I called for you as this is a matter only you can solve.

640
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,709
I cannot do it.

641
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:27,908
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

642
00:47:27,909 --> 00:47:28,909
Why not?

643
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,150
"You are made for each other."

644
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,080
That is all you need to say.

645
00:47:35,219 --> 00:47:38,290
My heart did not race when I saw them.

646
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,759
They are not fated to be.

647
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,529
You can lie to them.

648
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:47,429
They know you are an Agent of Love.

649
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:49,069
Why should I lie?

650
00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:51,400
They are not meant to be...

651
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,040
so they can forget each other.

652
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,739
You can like someone you are not meant for.

653
00:47:57,279 --> 00:48:00,310
Look at us. Did we like each other because we were fated to be?

654
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:09,350
Mister!

655
00:48:14,989 --> 00:48:17,960
Mister, please do not go. Come and live with us.

656
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,739
I have to go.

657
00:48:40,489 --> 00:48:41,489
Please...

658
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,350
do not go.

659
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,770
It was not your fault,

660
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:02,270
but because I liked you,

661
00:49:03,569 --> 00:49:06,339
my wife suffered a hard time and died.

662
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,049
So how can I...

663
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,420
live with you now?

664
00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:18,190
I would be too sorry for my late wife.

665
00:49:25,699 --> 00:49:26,929
If you live in suffering,

666
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,969
will your guilt disappear?

667
00:49:34,339 --> 00:49:36,610
As someone who can tell the fates of others,

668
00:49:36,969 --> 00:49:38,380
you are made for each other.

669
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:41,080
That is why you met again after so long.

670
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:44,250
So forget the past...

671
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,380
and live together.

672
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:51,690
Even if you go now,

673
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:53,860
you will meet again.

674
00:49:55,429 --> 00:49:56,460
That is...

675
00:49:57,659 --> 00:49:58,860
the fate you two have.

676
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:33,159
I am sure...

677
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,730
they will have a good life together.

678
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,839
Even if they were not made for each other,

679
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,409
I can see that they truly love each other.

680
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,009
If they loved each other so much,

681
00:50:46,179 --> 00:50:48,278
they should have stayed together...

682
00:50:48,279 --> 00:50:50,049
even if they were not told their fates.

683
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,020
They had too much burden in their hearts.

684
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:58,920
To lift that burden,

685
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,960
fate is the best excuse.

686
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,699
Since I am done here,

687
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:08,830
I shall get going.

688
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,600
My lord.

689
00:51:15,009 --> 00:51:16,739
Can you stop that now?

690
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,650
Stop pretending you do not like me.

691
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:27,489
I am having a hard time as it is.

692
00:51:30,489 --> 00:51:31,860
You are having a hard time?

693
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:34,389
What is bothering you?

694
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,600
Please tell me.

695
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,569
See? You are so worried about me.

696
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,569
Yet, you pretend not to like me.

697
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:52,710
What am I to do then?

698
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,650
I had no other options,

699
00:51:54,980 --> 00:51:56,350
but I was worried about you.

700
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,819
And I missed you to death.

701
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:00,350
So I...

702
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:03,250
You think I wanted to ignore my feelings?

703
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,790
I feel much better now that you are being honest.

704
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:12,360
Do you know...

705
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,670
what is the line I hate the most in novels?

706
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,199
"I am leaving because I love you."

707
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:23,869
I made up my mind when you climbed the wall.

708
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,639
To be with you.

709
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:31,580
How will you do that?

710
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,489
I have not figured out how.

711
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,389
But do not worry.

712
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:42,129
I am the best...

713
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,889
at bringing people together in Joseon.

714
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,600
Lady Park...

715
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,469
is more fearsome than you...

716
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:55,810
I am...

717
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,440
more courageous than you think.

718
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:04,949
So have faith and wait for me.

719
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:18,528
Have you heard?

720
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:21,169
- Yes, I heard. - What do we do?

721
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:22,928
Someone has to take responsibility.

722
00:53:22,929 --> 00:53:25,369
My apologies for being late.

723
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,670
It is always busy at the Capital District Office.

724
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,540
All right.

725
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,650
I am thinking of a meeting for the Dongro Faction at my house.

726
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,549
When are you free?

727
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:44,790
You must not have heard the news.

728
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,729
What news?

729
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,989
With the successful weddings of the spinsters,

730
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:52,659
His Majesty plans to accept the appeal...

731
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:55,029
to annul Lord Gyeongunjae's marriage.

732
00:53:55,869 --> 00:53:57,638
Then, Lord Gyeongunjae should be...

733
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:00,099
the new leader of Dongro Faction, do you agree?

734
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:01,540
That is true.

735
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,069
I see.

736
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:09,080
Even so, that man is too young.

737
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:11,679
Besides, he has no political experience.

738
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,218
How can we trust and make him the leader?

739
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:16,150
He is smart, is he not?

740
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,290
Joseon's youngest to pass the state examination first place.

741
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:22,730
Right. Back then,

742
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,900
did you not rank third?

743
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,698
If the letter of appeal gets accepted,

744
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:31,000
he might become the Capital District Office's Chief Magistrate.

745
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:34,569
Well, the Capital District Office did not settle anything...

746
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,170
from the spinster to the house price problems.

747
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,350
Good grief.

748
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:50,350
This is my last wedding gift to you.

749
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,259
Is this not the book of military tactics?

750
00:54:56,659 --> 00:54:59,560
War is not the only place this book is needed.

751
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,330
Tactics are necessary to lead a household.

752
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,839
It will come in handy if you read it.

753
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,610
Yes, Mother.

754
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:13,179
Once you get married, you must respect and serve your husband.

755
00:55:14,110 --> 00:55:17,449
However, that does not mean you must obey him at all costs.

756
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,948
Only when you suggest the right path...

757
00:55:20,949 --> 00:55:22,589
to your husband...

758
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:24,619
will you gain your husband's trust...

759
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,060
and be on equal footing with him.

760
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,779
I am not sure if I can accept it.

761
00:55:46,210 --> 00:55:49,779
I have always wanted to give you a wedding gift.

762
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,679
Please do accept it.

763
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:55,350
Thank you.

764
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,489
Actually, I have prepared a wedding gift for the young master.

765
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,929
But you must have been busy with your wedding preparations.

766
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,900
Thank you.

767
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,199
Gosh.

768
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,500
How beautiful.

769
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:15,770
It is very nice.

770
00:56:16,469 --> 00:56:18,209
Hoping your son will begin his official career...

771
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,909
and get promoted to a high position,

772
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,449
I embroidered a butterfly on it.

773
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,610
Goodness.

774
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,569
Are you visiting our house?

775
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,239
I was actually leaving.

776
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,560
Oh, gosh.

777
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:14,630
What is it? Why are you following me?

778
00:57:15,069 --> 00:57:16,699
I am not following you.

779
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,569
We are only heading in the same direction.

780
00:57:21,839 --> 00:57:22,869
Where are you going?

781
00:57:24,239 --> 00:57:25,310
Well...

782
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:28,150
I am on my way to meet my friend.

783
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:30,049
You know, right?

784
00:57:30,279 --> 00:57:32,549
That I have a shaman friend at Mount Nam Valley.

785
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,069
Is your wedding preparation going well?

786
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:53,600
The country should prepare for it.

787
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:55,869
After all, a precious spinster is getting married.

788
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,440
Gosh, that is sick.

789
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,049
So you have mastered it.

790
00:58:05,549 --> 00:58:08,589
The Crown Prince is coming to the wedding?

791
00:58:09,389 --> 00:58:12,819
Thanks to you, the government officials will attend the wedding.

792
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:16,928
People who did not come to the funeral...

793
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:18,600
will show up no matter what.

794
00:58:21,369 --> 00:58:24,440
This is the very reason I am holding Ye Jin's wedding...

795
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,839
along with that of Erudite Maeng's daughters.

796
00:58:29,509 --> 00:58:30,639
Ye Jin...

797
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,980
marrying the son of the Minister of Defence...

798
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:37,250
and Erudite Maeng's eldest daughter becoming the Crown Princess...

799
00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:40,350
are all thanks to you.

800
00:58:42,350 --> 00:58:45,790
Along with it, your brother is now in-laws with the Crown Prince.

801
00:58:48,690 --> 00:58:49,730
Mother.

802
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,960
I did not do it for the family.

803
00:58:53,159 --> 00:58:55,869
I simply connected two people who were in love with each other.

804
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,199
And so? Did that make any difference?

805
00:59:01,210 --> 00:59:03,170
The man Ye Jin wanted to marry.

806
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:04,609
The family I wanted.

807
00:59:04,610 --> 00:59:07,239
The marriages you successfully arranged are all the same, no?

808
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,218
- However... - I will not stop you...

809
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:13,179
from finding your own method.

810
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:17,719
In the end, we are all on the same side.

811
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,909
(The day of the wedding)

812
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,899
Here is the groom.

813
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:39,469
Well, hello there.

814
01:00:45,339 --> 01:00:46,339
Let us go.

815
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:15,409
Here they come.

816
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,179
They are coming.

817
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,969
The brides are coming.

818
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:00,710
Why are you standing over there, my lady?

819
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,409
What about you, my lord?

820
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:46,290
(The Matchmakers)

821
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:00,739
(Listen to "Love Signal" by UM TAEMIN on all music platforms.)

822
01:04:01,369 --> 01:04:02,810
Where did Ye Jin go?

823
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,209
Do you think I set this up...

824
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,679
to make those spinsters get married?

825
01:04:06,909 --> 01:04:09,049
Let us think of a plan to make all three pairs get married.

826
01:04:09,409 --> 01:04:11,080
From bowing to the bridal room,

827
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,920
carry out everything as I tell you.

828
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:16,420
You must never reveal your face.

829
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:19,420
Swap it with this and serve it as a snack.

830
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:21,690
Will it really be all right?

831
01:04:22,889 --> 01:04:24,259
Once this wedding is over,

832
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,400
let us run far away.

833
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,779
(The Matchmakers)
