(Sim Jung Woo, 25 years old)

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,560
(Widowed son-in-law of the king and an inspector)

8
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:03,629
The reason why I wrote an appeal to marry a princess...

9
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,670
is because me not being in government...

10
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,770
would be a waste of resources for Joseon.

11
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:11,839
As stated in the appeal, my lifestyle...

12
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,280
is exactly that of a scholar's.

13
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,780
(Jangakwon)

14
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:38,270
Besides my studies, I am also...

15
00:01:38,899 --> 00:01:40,699
diligent in mastering the arts.

16
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,338
How incredible.

17
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:47,739
Just after six months,

18
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,008
you have caught up with my skills.

19
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:52,209
We are not exactly equals, though.

20
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,749
You said that the basics of daegeum...

21
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,948
are to play it on beat and control your breathing.

22
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:59,318
The cherry on top...

23
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,819
would be to play it with your own colour, right?

24
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,020
That is right.

25
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:06,959
However, your performance lacks personal colour.

26
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,970
How can you compare yourself to a perfect player like me?

27
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:14,470
It seems like I have nothing left to learn here.

28
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,910
I will not return again.

29
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:23,680
(Dohwaseo)

30
00:02:32,989 --> 00:02:35,689
It is as if sunlight is peeking through the paper.

31
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,519
Your painting is lively.

32
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:40,459
You should not sit indoors...

33
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,728
and only draw from your imagination.

34
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,870
Try to come outside and portray the light and sights of Joseon.

35
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,410
It will be hard to follow this new paradigm, though.

36
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,910
All the best.

37
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,720
I think it should be lower. Should I give it a go?

38
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:31,150
He is saved.

39
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,780
Is it not hot?

40
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:34,249
I am all right.

41
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,849
- Let me cool you down. - Goodness, I am fine.

42
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,919
Hey!

43
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,989
Gosh, this is giving me stress.

44
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,418
I taught you for so many years,

45
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:43,758
and you cannot insert a needle.

46
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,930
How is it that you are so good at dating without being taught?

47
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:48,430
It cannot be helped.

48
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,298
Dating is for the lowly and foolish...

49
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:54,669
who cannot control their feelings.

50
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,509
Why do you try to learn medicine when it is so lowly?

51
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:07,719
Could you be trying to find the cause of what happened...

52
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,180
eight years ago?

53
00:04:09,819 --> 00:04:10,850
I am not.

54
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,089
There is no physician in Joseon...

55
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,960
who can treat my chronic chest pains.

56
00:04:15,259 --> 00:04:17,590
So I am trying to find the cure myself.

57
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:27,700
(Episode 2: A Bad Feeling Never Turns Out to be Wrong)

58
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,070
Serve this traitor the poison at once!

59
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,510
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,048
Your Majesty, this is an unfair punishment.

61
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:41,280
It is unfair.

62
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,390
If you find it so unfair, should I give you another chance?

63
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,309
Getting the crown prince to wed is easy.

64
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,548
The crown prince's marriage...

65
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,349
was stopped because of the spinsters and bachelors.

66
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:23,189
If we get rid of those spinsters, everything will be settled.

67
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,129
I see.

68
00:05:26,359 --> 00:05:29,998
Even the previous king, and the one before him,

69
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:34,498
as well as the ones way before him could not solve...

70
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,168
the spinster-bachelor issue.

71
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,470
I just have to solve it in two months, right?

72
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:40,539
Why, you...

73
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:45,949
Everyone in Joseon knows...

74
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,779
that we cannot solve it right away.

75
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,478
Make an example of model spinsters...

76
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,418
by marrying them off to old bachelors.

77
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,618
Through this,

78
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,418
announce the court's interest in the spinster-bachelor issue.

79
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,559
And when you carry out the crown prince's wedding,

80
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,059
no one will be able to stop it.

81
00:06:04,429 --> 00:06:06,599
He is just suggesting window dressing.

82
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,070
Why are you nodding away?

83
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,998
If you show continued care for the matter,

84
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,770
it will not be window dressing.

85
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,879
You will not let the issue go on, will you?

86
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,950
What?

87
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,210
Yes?

88
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,820
Of course not.

89
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,118
However, the idea of model spinsters...

90
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,989
is too abstract, is it not?

91
00:06:29,059 --> 00:06:30,160
Your Majesty!

92
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:34,390
There are spinsters that come to my mind.

93
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,559
- You do? - Yes, Your Majesty.

94
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:39,829
Maeng Sang Chun's three daughters in Mount Nam Valley...

95
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,569
are all spinsters.

96
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,599
- All three of Maeng Sang Chun's? - Yes.

97
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,808
He is... The name sounds familiar.

98
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:49,038
Yes, he was your playmate when you were the crown prince.

99
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,080
I know him.

100
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:55,548
That is right. He enjoyed studying.

101
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:59,049
Was it five years ago? I heard he had passed.

102
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,259
How are his three daughters still unwed?

103
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,259
I do not know the details.

104
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,228
But it was unusual for all three sisters to be unwed.

105
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:08,628
So people called them...

106
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,470
the Old Ladies of Mount Nam Valley.

107
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:14,069
Seeing how the rumour has reached even me,

108
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,069
I think they make the perfect model spinsters...

109
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,669
that Lord Gyeongunjae mentioned.

110
00:07:21,239 --> 00:07:23,308
But I am the king of the nation.

111
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,378
If I go out of my way to help those sisters only,

112
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:28,519
people might criticize my fairness.

113
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,619
Well, that is...

114
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,419
- I see. - You see?

115
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,150
All right.

116
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,460
- Well... - Faith between friends!

117
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:41,059
This is not just 1, but all 3 of your friend's daughters.

118
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,558
If you let them remain spinsters,

119
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,369
you are going against your morals.

120
00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:48,699
Your Majesty has more than enough reason...

121
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,039
to go out of your way to help those ladies.

122
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,710
- He is a smart one. - Yes.

123
00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:01,719
Then, Jung Woo. You shall marry off all three...

124
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,080
of Erudite Maeng's daughters within two months.

125
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:08,119
Pardon me? How can I marry them off?

126
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,918
I have read all your appeals.

127
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,858
It sounds like in Joseon,

128
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:16,700
you seem to know best about the meaning and process of marriage.

129
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,229
If you succeed,

130
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:23,840
I will review this appeal with an open mind.

131
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:26,840
But if you fail,

132
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,580
I will charge you for contempt against the throne.

133
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,950
You will have to drink this poison.

134
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,850
Keep this poison safe.

135
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,340
(Sim Jung Woo)

136
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:05,949
(Gwanghwamun)

137
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,979
My lord!

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,949
They named you a traitor?

139
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,720
How can this be?

140
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,489
O Bong.

141
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,790
I finally see the road to getting into government.

142
00:09:17,859 --> 00:09:19,789
Did His Majesty accept your appeal?

143
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,159
Not yet.

144
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,430
But the deal is in the bag.

145
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,940
I am the most outstanding talent in Joseon.

146
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,409
Matchmaking would be a piece of cake.

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,809
If he pulls it off,

148
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:41,680
will you annul Lord Gyeongunjae's marriage?

149
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,519
That is ridiculous.

150
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:49,320
My daughter is pitiful enough for dying at such a young age.

151
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,960
I cannot leave her as an unmarried ghost.

152
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,319
Knowing that I will not see you after you marry...

153
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,960
makes my heart heavy.

154
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,529
My lady.

155
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,200
We can be together forever.

156
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,070
If we drink this,

157
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,710
we will fall into eternal sleep without pain.

158
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,739
All right, young master.

159
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:44,909
Have you both lost it?

160
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,249
What?

161
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,960
What would have happened if I was not here?

162
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:01,060
Lady Yeoju?

163
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,700
Please keep it secret from my mother.

164
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,600
For someone who planned to die,

165
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,869
you are afraid of your mother?

166
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:17,179
I had hoped that your lover...

167
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:18,509
would be a noble.

168
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,379
But he is way too noble.

169
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,519
My lady, who is this?

170
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,889
Young Master Kim Ho, second son of the chief royal secretary.

171
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:34,859
That is you, correct?

172
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:38,800
My lady, when you said you could infer someone's significant other,

173
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,799
did you mean you could figure out...

174
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,670
the person's family and even their name by their looks?

175
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:46,210
Of course,

176
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,239
I cannot figure out the person's name.

177
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,049
But he was dressed like a son of a high-ranking official.

178
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:55,049
Just as I figured he was rich because he casually frequented...

179
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:57,550
the biggest mill in the city,

180
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,320
I caught the identification tag dropped on the floor.

181
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,290
If he is the son of the chief royal secretary,

182
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,290
is he not way beyond that young lady's league?

183
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,600
That is the problem.

184
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:12,829
No matter how well-off Official Hong's family is,

185
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,339
the chief royal secretary would deem them a classless upstart.

186
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,670
He would not let them marry.

187
00:12:18,609 --> 00:12:21,238
However, I am not the one to give up on marrying...

188
00:12:21,239 --> 00:12:23,340
such a handsome couple.

189
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,249
Why do you try so hard?

190
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,720
What?

191
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:34,349
It is not like you will make more money...

192
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,989
by marrying couples that are good for each other.

193
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,960
But you always go at it a little too hard.

194
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,759
Because this is a once-in-a-lifetime event.

195
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,739
A woman from a noble family only gets to marry once.

196
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,498
That is why she needs to marry...

197
00:12:51,499 --> 00:12:53,409
someone she is meant to be with.

198
00:12:54,369 --> 00:12:57,138
Marriage is the act of combining strengths of two families...

199
00:12:57,139 --> 00:12:58,549
to serve their ancestors...

200
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:00,310
and carry on their family lineage.

201
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,478
Even so, should you not meet the ladies you are to marry?

202
00:13:04,479 --> 00:13:08,019
Dear me! I have written appeals regarding marriage for eight years.

203
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,159
I know everything there is to know about marriage customs.

204
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:14,389
According to the customs, the marriage process begins...

205
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,658
when two families gather with the matchmaker...

206
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,229
to see how marriageable the families are.

207
00:13:17,729 --> 00:13:20,700
I can let the matchmakers meet the women.

208
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:22,300
Hence,

209
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:24,069
I will not have to meet...

210
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,768
the ladies of Mount Nam Valley...

211
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:28,070
until this wedding happens.

212
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,050
Eyes, nose, and mouth. They are all placed perfectly.

213
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,748
I have never seen such a good-looking man in my life.

214
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:39,220
Goodness, look at how smooth his skin is.

215
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:41,350
Did you come to buy makeup for your wife?

216
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,330
Goodness.

217
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,658
You have such beautiful hands for a man.

218
00:13:47,659 --> 00:13:49,430
Goodness gracious!

219
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,440
Enough is enough! Sit back!

220
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,439
He is not someone you can easily taunt!

221
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,809
We are all busy women. Yet, you gathered us here...

222
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,940
and have not said a word.

223
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:06,909
Should I tell them?

224
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,350
No, this is my business.

225
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:21,700
I need to marry three daughters...

226
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,099
of my teacher before May is over.

227
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,399
That was why I asked you to gather.

228
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,600
All three?

229
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,369
Within May? That is quite soon.

230
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:33,268
It is practically impossible.

231
00:14:33,269 --> 00:14:34,470
You will get paid...

232
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,580
twice as much.

233
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,479
- Are you the one who is paying? - It only seems fair.

234
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,949
If experts like us divide this up and arrange the marriages,

235
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,420
- two months are more than enough. - You are right.

236
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,690
It is rather a long time.

237
00:14:53,389 --> 00:14:55,800
So? Who are these ladies?

238
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,070
The daughters of Erudite Maeng in Mount Nam Valley.

239
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:12,878
My lord.

240
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:15,320
We do not arrange marriages for old ladies.

241
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:18,118
We wasted our time for nothing.

242
00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:19,190
Good grief!

243
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,519
How can matchmakers refuse to make matches?

244
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,429
It is not that we refuse. We simply cannot, my lord.

245
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,659
Why is that the case?

246
00:15:27,629 --> 00:15:30,600
I do not know where to begin.

247
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:34,429
When I first took up this job, I did not know any better...

248
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,100
and tried to arrange a marriage for his second daughter.

249
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,309
Do not even get me started.

250
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,069
She was the most foul-mouthed person.

251
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,580
It is just my luck to run into a scoundrel like you.

252
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:45,109
Goodness.

253
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,180
What kind of an idiot would steal just one shoe?

254
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,149
This would all be over as soon as you show me that basket.

255
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:53,550
Why should I do that?

256
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,060
- Oh, my! - Goodness!

257
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:14,940
You are a thief!

258
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,580
Otherwise, why would you hide it so desperately?

259
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,749
Why is there such a big fuss?

260
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:38,629
Darn it.

261
00:16:43,239 --> 00:16:45,469
The problem with her is not just the foul mouth.

262
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,669
She is also violent with her actions.

263
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,940
Such an aggressive woman.

264
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,879
But the first daughter is a beauty. Why has she not married?

265
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,749
She thought she could afford to be picky, then lost her chance.

266
00:16:56,249 --> 00:16:58,849
Who cares if she is beautiful? She has a thick head.

267
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,690
You can tell how slow she is just by her looks.

268
00:17:01,859 --> 00:17:04,960
Was she slow to get married because she was so slow?

269
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:09,800
That is an age-old truth.

270
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,699
I heard this rumour recently.

271
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,799
She is possessed by Lady Cho Ok's ghost.

272
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,600
- Really? - Is that true?

273
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:20,070
The woman of that rumour...

274
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,939
must have been his first daughter.

275
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,368
What was that? You scared me!

276
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:46,500
Come on!

277
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,399
What are you doing here?

278
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,340
That is so cold!

279
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:55,939
- Stop it! - Cut it out!

280
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,730
What? Where is she?

281
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,069
Every night, she sits in the stream...

282
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,878
and jumps on any man she can find.

283
00:18:30,879 --> 00:18:33,309
Right, birds of a feather flock together.

284
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,419
Lady Cho Ok used to befriend those old ladies.

285
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:38,989
The eldest daughter of that family...

286
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,250
will never get married with such an indecent rumour.

287
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,289
Tell me about it.

288
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,759
She should have accepted the offer last year...

289
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,188
to become the concubine for the minister of defence.

290
00:18:46,189 --> 00:18:48,560
Come on, that does not sound fair.

291
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:50,958
What about their third daughter?

292
00:18:50,959 --> 00:18:53,070
She is as odd as her sisters.

293
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,899
She was once seen leaving home dressed like a man.

294
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,409
Was she the famous man-woman?

295
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,810
The man-woman!

296
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,309
Goodness, you must be confused, my lord.

297
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:09,679
Let me summarize this for you.

298
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,249
The first daughter is a beauty, but she is picky,

299
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,250
and she is promiscuous because of a ghost possession.

300
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,789
The second daughter is good at needlework,

301
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,719
but she is aggressive and foul-mouthed.

302
00:19:17,959 --> 00:19:20,830
The third daughter seems to have a different sexual orientation.

303
00:19:23,959 --> 00:19:25,770
You truly are different as a nobleman.

304
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,699
You figured it out at once.

305
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,840
So?

306
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,010
Not one of you wish to take part...

307
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:35,040
in this matchmaking?

308
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:40,010
My lord.

309
00:19:41,109 --> 00:19:42,949
Lady Yeoju...

310
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,850
may be able to find their matches.

311
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,618
Lady Yeoju?

312
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:49,789
She is a woman who does whatever she can...

313
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,989
by all ways and means...

314
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,060
for the matchmaking request she has taken up.

315
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:55,659
Did you say I must shave my head?

316
00:19:55,899 --> 00:19:57,730
I was taught not to cut off anything I was born with.

317
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,570
I cannot do that.

318
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,468
You seem to know cherishing your body is...

319
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:05,969
the first way of showing respect for your parents.

320
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,510
Why do you not realize...

321
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,179
it is the worst disgrace to pass away before your parents?

322
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:17,419
You know your customs well, although you are just a merchant.

323
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,089
You just have to get married...

324
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,789
and have children to show your parents.

325
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:25,218
That will be a true way of fulfilling your filial duty,

326
00:20:25,219 --> 00:20:27,060
and they will forget the small disgrace of your shaved head.

327
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:41,639
You cannot stop me. I will leave and take this path.

328
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,349
No. You cannot go!

329
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,878
Do not stop him.

330
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,948
How dare you lay a hand on your hair?

331
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,079
You!

332
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,389
You have done well. You can just trust me now.

333
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:57,219
No, you cannot go!

334
00:21:06,929 --> 00:21:08,628
I know this great lady your son can marry...

335
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:10,300
to forget his religious fervour.

336
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,270
Would you like me to make this match?

337
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,449
By any chance, does this matchmaker, Lady Yeoju...

338
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,148
Is she the woman with a mole under her eye?

339
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,250
Yes.

340
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,718
She is not so good-looking with that mole,

341
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:30,520
so she could not join our group.

342
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:31,918
We may not look much,

343
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,560
but we must be above average in many ways to take up this job.

344
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:39,369
That man over there asked for golden silkworm poison?

345
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,730
Who is he?

346
00:21:41,629 --> 00:21:43,169
I am not so sure.

347
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,139
A bum?

348
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,639
But a rich one.

349
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,609
A rich one?

350
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,639
Are you leaving?

351
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,050
To the men's room.

352
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,480
Lady Yeoju does not come to the inn every single day.

353
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,378
If you are in a hurry, you can visit her at home in Namchon.

354
00:21:57,379 --> 00:21:58,379
My lord!

355
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,689
My lord, take the donkey...

356
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,990
Goodness.

357
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,658
They accepted Lady Yeon Hee right away...

358
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,429
as soon as he shaved his head and threatened to leave.

359
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,428
They would have accepted any woman of ordinary birth.

360
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,070
(People of ordinary birth did not usually marry up.)

361
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,039
It feels wonderful to think how happy they will be...

362
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,500
as a married couple.

363
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:19,909
This is why I cannot stop making matches.

364
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,138
What about that mama's boy...

365
00:22:23,139 --> 00:22:25,279
who was supposed to marry that lady?

366
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,309
(Mama's boy: A son who has not become independent of his mother)

367
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,609
That handsome man?

368
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:32,350
I called him a mama's boy to break off that marriage.

369
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:35,590
I would not call him that. He is more like an exemplary man.

370
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:39,989
Thankfully, I know a lady who can be a good match for him.

371
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,560
Who is that lady?

372
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,159
Well...

373
00:22:47,129 --> 00:22:49,100
("The Lady's Private Life")

374
00:22:52,369 --> 00:22:54,908
- This is crazy. - How evil!

375
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:57,810
- This is the end? - It ended here?

376
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:00,179
("The Lady's Private Life")

377
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:03,149
She would hit it off very well with her mother-in-law...

378
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,919
and even better with that man.

379
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:08,448
My lady, how could you be so sure that two people...

380
00:23:08,449 --> 00:23:09,790
would make such a great match?

381
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,560
Do you want to know my secret of noticing a great match?

382
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:14,929
Yes.

383
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:20,730
I do not share this with everyone, so listen carefully.

384
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,638
Make sure you watch...

385
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:26,070
the single woman and man with warm interest.

386
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,009
That is it?

387
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:30,839
You can only make a guess...

388
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,250
after you watch them with warm interest.

389
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:37,648
For example, that exemplary man was in his scholar's outfit at home...

390
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:40,419
because his mother loved seeing her son in that outfit.

391
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,789
If he is that thoughtful,

392
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:46,290
it means he grew up with a father who was affectionate to his mother.

393
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:49,358
A considerate man like him tends to become a devoted husband...

394
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,859
for an independent and strong woman.

395
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,240
Do you still have something to say to me?

396
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,209
I called a litter here.

397
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:07,810
Please wait and take that home.

398
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:09,719
What are you saying?

399
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:14,590
Anybody would have been suspicious of you in that situation.

400
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:18,789
However, I was rash in my behaviour, although there was no evidence...

401
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,129
you were the thief,

402
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,698
and you ended up hurting your ankle.

403
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,329
So please take the litter, my lady.

404
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,830
"My lady," my foot.

405
00:24:26,129 --> 00:24:28,030
Do you not remember how you treated me like a thief?

406
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:31,240
Also, you continue to insist you did not do anything wrong.

407
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,240
"Anybody would have been suspicious?"

408
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:37,609
The more I think about it, the angrier I get.

409
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,750
My lady, how can I apologize if you leave like this?

410
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,479
How dare you grab me?

411
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,049
No, it is not that.

412
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,719
How dare you touch each other in the middle of the day?

413
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,859
Men and women are to remain separated!

414
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,800
This behaviour is simply deplorable.

415
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:57,260
Which family are you from?

416
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,570
Well...

417
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,629
What is wrong with that old fossil?

418
00:25:03,139 --> 00:25:04,169
"Old fossil?"

419
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,639
This is exactly why I hate coming to Bukchon.

420
00:25:12,109 --> 00:25:14,909
Please take the litter and get away from that old fossil first.

421
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,649
Follow me.

422
00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:20,850
Goodness, my lord.

423
00:25:25,189 --> 00:25:26,659
I apologize for my suspicion.

424
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,709
Are you in pain again?

425
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,149
Goodness.

426
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,418
Please escort her home.

427
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,490
Yes, young master.

428
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:00,628
I apologize for making this scene.

429
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:03,060
Your mistake is not my business.

430
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:04,530
The problem is...

431
00:26:08,469 --> 00:26:10,639
You are not in good health now.

432
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:13,638
Do you know how scary young people are these days?

433
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:15,779
Why did you meddle with them?

434
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,609
"Why did you meddle with them?"

435
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,679
Is that your idea of speaking to me with respect?

436
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:25,079
Goodness, what will happen to this kingdom of Joseon?

437
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,649
Even children of noblemen are in such shallow relationships.

438
00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:29,790
Goodness.

439
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,090
My goodness.

440
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,300
My lady, in the future, will you find my match too?

441
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,658
Of course.

442
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,668
And I will not charge you, Bok Hee.

443
00:26:40,669 --> 00:26:42,770
Please write down what you said on paper...

444
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,540
and sign it too.

445
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,169
You raised such a clever daughter.

446
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:49,980
She will become a wealthy merchant.

447
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,139
That would be wonderful.

448
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:54,909
I am on my way to the inn to drop something off. Come with me.

449
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:58,280
What? Well...

450
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,919
I will leave a little later.

451
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,790
The weather is too nice for me to go home this early.

452
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,859
All right. Let us go, Bok Hee.

453
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,840
It is such a warm day.

454
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,658
It has been 20 years.

455
00:27:38,659 --> 00:27:40,689
How could she have sat there just as she looked then?

456
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:44,429
Wait just a little longer.

457
00:27:44,699 --> 00:27:47,270
You will find out the reason once I read you the ending.

458
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:51,070
I am sorry. I became too curious.

459
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:54,639
Let me continue reading.

460
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,649
"He saw his bride..."

461
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:02,649
"sitting there just as she had on their consummation 20 years ago."

462
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:05,619
"He did not feel scared but sorry."

463
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,719
"He began to caress her shoulder."

464
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,858
"At that moment, the bride turned into ashes..."

465
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:14,359
"and crumbled down to pieces."

466
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,659
"The ashes turned into white butterflies..."

467
00:28:18,199 --> 00:28:21,469
"and flew around the scholar, then flew away."

468
00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:29,638
The ending of this story is always sad yet beautiful,

469
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,540
no matter how often I read it.

470
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:20,689
Over there. That must be her house.

471
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,290
I see.

472
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,260
Go bring my donkey.

473
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:26,699
All of a sudden?

474
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,529
But Lady Yeoju's place is right there.

475
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,540
Hey!

476
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,899
I cannot walk all the way back.

477
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,108
This was why I asked you to wait a moment.

478
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:38,840
Also, I can meet Lady Yeoju by myself.

479
00:29:39,449 --> 00:29:40,550
All right.

480
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,549
Why does it feel like...

481
00:29:46,550 --> 00:29:48,719
this is not my first time getting abandoned by him?

482
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,590
Lord Sim seems rather excited.

483
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,590
It must be just me, right?

484
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,969
Is anybody home?

485
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:49,850
Did I wake you?

486
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:01,959
What is going on?

487
00:31:03,959 --> 00:31:05,030
Is this a dream?

488
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,609
If this is a dream, I want to go back to sleep.

489
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,179
I miss you, my husband.

490
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,939
This feels...

491
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,939
too realistic.

492
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,119
What?

493
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,590
What?

494
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,520
What was that?

495
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:04,859
Oh, my. Goodness.

496
00:32:06,189 --> 00:32:07,530
Are you that lord from the inn?

497
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:09,830
What are you doing right now?

498
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:11,958
I did not do anything.

499
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:13,769
I just caught your bag...

500
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,000
because it was falling off.

501
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,469
Goodness.

502
00:32:17,939 --> 00:32:19,968
Why? For what reason?

503
00:32:19,969 --> 00:32:21,509
What did you do while I was dozing off?

504
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,539
You did something to me, not I!

505
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,908
I know you did not learn any better as a merchant,

506
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,448
but the moral principle requires men and women to remain separated.

507
00:32:28,449 --> 00:32:30,219
How can you massage the neck of a strange man?

508
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,820
Then why did you...

509
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,519
sneak into this house...

510
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,519
where a widow lives alone as if you were a stray cat?

511
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,889
I am not a stray cat, but...

512
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:44,260
Well, I am here...

513
00:32:46,469 --> 00:32:50,600
Well... Yes. I came to ask you to arrange marriages.

514
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:52,869
Arrange marriages?

515
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,740
You do not look that old.

516
00:32:55,939 --> 00:32:57,539
Do you have a child who is old enough to marry?

517
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,810
I do not have children!

518
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:00,708
Then is this for yourself?

519
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,379
I am already married.

520
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,949
Then who is this for?

521
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:09,090
My goodness, how long was I asleep for?

522
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:13,229
I wish to marry the three daughters of Erudite Maeng...

523
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,959
in Mount Nam Valley within two months.

524
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,468
Did you just say you wish to marry all three daughters, not just one,

525
00:33:19,469 --> 00:33:22,469
the pregnable three ladies of Erudite Maeng?

526
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:23,770
And in two months?

527
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,469
It's not pregnable,

528
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:29,139
but impregnable. Unable to penetrate.

529
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:33,179
I really want to have a go at the daughters of Erudite Maeng.

530
00:33:34,109 --> 00:33:35,109
What should I do?

531
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,879
No.

532
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,350
No, it is too dangerous to get involved with this official.

533
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:43,290
What is more dangerous is that the sun is setting now.

534
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:46,489
I am sorry, but I am already working for another family,

535
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,359
so I cannot take another request.

536
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:51,830
Also, I must be on my way.

537
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:57,169
The merchants at the inn said you would be able to do this.

538
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:08,379
Why do you wish to marry the daughters of Erudite Maeng?

539
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,649
I am an inspector,

540
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,159
and mopping up these old maids is a royal command.

541
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,959
What did you just say?

542
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,959
It may be a royal command, but do not feel overwhelmed.

543
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,900
You can do your job as you always have.

544
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:30,500
No, before that. "Mopping up old maids?"

545
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:33,569
These ladies are not bandits! Why would you mop them up?

546
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,709
What?

547
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,508
I do not accept a matchmaking request from a man...

548
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,409
with such an idea.

549
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,650
I am busy, so please excuse me.

550
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,080
Goodness. Gosh.

551
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:44,880
Hey.

552
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,290
This is not my idea. This was a royal command!

553
00:34:49,089 --> 00:34:51,419
My, my. How rude.

554
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,290
How can you take off after you are done talking?

555
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,600
Stop.

556
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,069
Stop right there.

557
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,440
I am not done talking.

558
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,679
I kept thinking and concluded that you needed to hear this.

559
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:14,579
Spinsters are still women,

560
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,149
and marriage is also important to them,

561
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,650
just as it is for any other woman.

562
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,988
So do not approach this,

563
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:24,489
saying you are here to mop them up even if they are spinsters!

564
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,330
Marriage is...

565
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:31,199
a mayor life event!

566
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,900
No, not mayor. Major.

567
00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:38,368
What?

568
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,210
You do not even know the difference between mayor and major.

569
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:44,080
Who do you think you are to try to teach me?

570
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:46,409
I do not care who you are. If you are ignorant, learn.

571
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:49,779
You are the one who is ignorant...

572
00:35:50,619 --> 00:35:51,649
Stop right there!

573
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,989
Where are you going? I am not done talking to you!

574
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,818
Move aside, will you?

575
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:57,790
Watch where you are going.

576
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,630
What? Where did she go?

577
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,860
Where are you?

578
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,659
Am I the only one who cannot see you?

579
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,529
Show up!

580
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,170
Where are you?

581
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,540
You cannot run like that and catch me.

582
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
My lord!

583
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:30,859
Did you have a good talk with that merchant?

584
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,619
Why does everyone do this to me?

585
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,230
Pardon?

586
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,229
I received the royal command and am doing my best...

587
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:39,830
to get rid of spinsters, the deep-rooted evil of our kingdom.

588
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,139
No one up above or down below is living up to their expectations.

589
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,809
There is no use if I am the only one...

590
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:48,509
who lives according to customs and principles!

591
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:54,279
- What a nice day. - It is very nice.

592
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,449
It is dangerous. Please take another way.

593
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,818
He is Lord Gyeongunjae!

594
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,949
Do not get caught up in his fury, and please run away!

595
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:06,060
- It is Man of Anger. - It is Man of Anger.

596
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,468
I believe I just saw scholars roaming about,

597
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,239
neglecting their duty to study.

598
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,739
No, I did not see anyone.

599
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:21,739
You did not see them, O Bong?

600
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:24,380
Please get on the donkey. I will bring it here.

601
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
All right.

602
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,080
I can see everything, O Bong.

603
00:37:31,219 --> 00:37:34,619
O Bong, take your time and follow me.

604
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,060
(Bukchon)

605
00:38:24,639 --> 00:38:25,670
Is it ready?

606
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:34,980
Not bad.

607
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,400
Geun Seok.

608
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:26,600
Mommy will come in.

609
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:45,219
Mother, I will go to school now.

610
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,619
Do not study too hard. You may not grow taller.

611
00:39:57,759 --> 00:39:59,799
What great weather for matchmaking.

612
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,739
Why are you suddenly visiting the Capital District Office?

613
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:06,439
I did not think this through.

614
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,439
This is not an ordinary marriage arrangement.

615
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,509
I am on an official duty.

616
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,449
Hence, I need to take a proper procedure to carry this out.

617
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,719
Go slowly.

618
00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:25,960
I am walking slowly.

619
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:30,330
Are you out of your mind?

620
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,229
The only daughter of the left state councillor...

621
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:34,368
not only has as much wealth as you demanded,

622
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:36,400
but everything else on top of that.

623
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,539
What is the problem?

624
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,738
Are you truly unaware that the left state councillor’s family...

625
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:42,440
and our family are political opponents?

626
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,638
Three years ago, I have made a match...

627
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:47,710
between the worst political enemies, Lord Ha and Lord An's family.

628
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,879
You must remember that those were the only two families...

629
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,350
who survived the political feud...

630
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,889
of the Year of the Horse.

631
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,860
The left state councillor’s daughter is wise and tough,

632
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,289
so she will put wings on your soft-hearted son,

633
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,960
who took after his father.

634
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,299
What is more important is this.

635
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:09,199
The left state councillor’s family wanted this marriage first.

636
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,299
Is that true?

637
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,810
Would I dare to lie to you?

638
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:26,080
They even sent the hour and date of her birth to check compatibility.

639
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:29,190
Did you already get consent from the bride's family?

640
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,989
Hardly. I have not even talked to them.

641
00:41:33,219 --> 00:41:36,230
Then how did you obtain her birth hour and date?

642
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:38,559
The lady in question is my sister-in-law,

643
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,000
so I paid someone to put it together.

644
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,369
I see.

645
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:46,339
You are arranging your sister-in-law's marriage?

646
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:51,239
That is why I want to ask you...

647
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,310
to pretend like you are Lady Yeoju this once.

648
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:55,679
What?

649
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,420
Actually, you are Lady Yeoju, so you are not even pretending.

650
00:41:58,779 --> 00:42:01,190
People do not recognize me when I put on makeup,

651
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,719
but I cannot act like a matchmaker in front of my mother-in-law.

652
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:06,360
Please?

653
00:42:10,529 --> 00:42:11,730
I cannot do it either.

654
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,969
Please do not say no.

655
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,968
It will not be hard.

656
00:42:15,969 --> 00:42:17,270
What if we get caught?

657
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:19,170
Will it be okay with you?

658
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,210
We will not get caught.

659
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,678
The lady of the headmaster thinks I am Lady Yeoju,

660
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:27,210
and my mother thinks you are Lady Yeoju.

661
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,379
In-laws may seem very close,

662
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,448
but it is a rather distant and difficult relationship.

663
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,588
I doubt future in-laws would get together...

664
00:42:33,589 --> 00:42:35,190
and compare the looks of the matchmaker.

665
00:42:38,819 --> 00:42:41,960
Whatever it is, I cannot go to your place.

666
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,500
That is final.

667
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:46,060
Please, Lady Yeoju.

668
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:48,969
Please?

669
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,139
Please? Lady Yeoju.

670
00:42:57,739 --> 00:43:02,350
(Capital District Office)

671
00:43:08,290 --> 00:43:09,650
- Wait here. - Yes, my lord.

672
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,929
The children of the noble birth are the problem.

673
00:43:14,830 --> 00:43:16,360
They will not listen.

674
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:20,929
They believe they became the smartest generation...

675
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:23,028
who were only born...

676
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:25,299
in the wrong time period.

677
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:27,670
Just answer my question.

678
00:43:28,069 --> 00:43:30,008
The problem with spinsters and old bachelors is...

679
00:43:30,009 --> 00:43:31,480
under the responsibility of the Capital District Office, right?

680
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,080
That is true.

681
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:40,650
The daughters of Erudite Maeng, my teacher from Sungkyunkwan,

682
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,589
are getting old as spinsters, not just one, but all three.

683
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,560
How are these women supposed to survive...

684
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:49,290
this harsh world all alone if you neglect them like this?

685
00:43:51,429 --> 00:43:52,960
You really have no idea, do you?

686
00:43:54,069 --> 00:43:57,239
Hanyang is the city of administration and consumption.

687
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,939
If women have a specialized talent...

688
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,069
in needlework or cooking,

689
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,539
they will not have a problem...

690
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,940
making a living even if they do not marry.

691
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,049
You never rose to power, so you do not know how the world works.

692
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,949
What did you just say?

693
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,589
If you are worried about the livelihood of the old ladies,

694
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,759
you should first look into how they are doing.

695
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:21,559
Their sick mother...

696
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,830
receives treatment every single day in that expensive medicine room.

697
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,469
This means those three ladies are unable to marry...

698
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:31,639
because of their reputation, not their situation.

699
00:44:35,469 --> 00:44:38,940
Chief Magistrate Kim, an official from Haemi wishes to see you.

700
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,080
All right.

701
00:44:42,009 --> 00:44:45,580
I do not know why you are suddenly worried about his daughters,

702
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:50,460
but feel free to look for someone in this list of old bachelors.

703
00:44:50,889 --> 00:44:54,190
As you can see, I am too busy working for our kingdom.

704
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,460
Excuse me.

705
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:08,940
"Too busy working for our kingdom, excuse me?"

706
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,479
He holds a lower rank,

707
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,509
yet he continues to speak disrespectfully against me.

708
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:16,079
And he did much worse than me in the state exam.

709
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,520
How condescending.

710
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,060
("The Lady's Private Life")

711
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:54,089
("The Lady's Private Life")

712
00:45:57,619 --> 00:46:00,730
"The lady peeked through the openings of her hood."

713
00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:03,129
"She sat mysteriously under the sunlight,"

714
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,730
"shining through a tiny window."

715
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,400
"The lady..."

716
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,239
"kept her eyes on the investigator..."

717
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:13,199
"as she took her hood off."

718
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:18,738
"The fabric was sheer, exposing her skin."

719
00:46:18,739 --> 00:46:20,749
"The lady's long hood dropped from her shoulders..."

720
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,649
"to her chest and waist. She, then, crossed her legs."

721
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,279
"And with that, her body line was fully visible."

722
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:44,770
You will not be able to escape easily today.

723
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:48,770
I must see your face. Now, take off that long hood.

724
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,310
You will regret it.

725
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:54,269
(The story will continue in Volume 2.)

726
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:57,879
(The story will continue in Volume 2.)

727
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,409
How can you end it here?

728
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:02,380
Is this not too nasty?

729
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,270
What are you sneaking a look at?

730
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:37,150
Your clothes tell me you are the Capital District Office's officer.

731
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,218
If you do not explain why this promiscuous book...

732
00:48:39,219 --> 00:48:40,718
is here in detail,

733
00:48:40,719 --> 00:48:42,618
you will not have that job for long.

734
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:44,618
Telling me who you are should be first.

735
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:47,489
I am Sim Jung Woo, living in Gyeongunjae, Bukchon.

736
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,259
Lord Gyeongunjae.

737
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,299
These books are evidence.

738
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,940
What a lame excuse.

739
00:49:00,770 --> 00:49:03,539
Only women read such an erotic romance novel.

740
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,080
So, which case could this be evidence for?

741
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:09,408
It is evidence to catch the culprit who made Lee Cho Ok...

742
00:49:09,409 --> 00:49:11,619
drown to death six months ago.

743
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,919
Did he get this job through connections?

744
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,159
(Hiring sons of meritorious families without exams)

745
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:18,790
Which family are you from?

746
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:24,460
I am the eldest son of the ninth-class officer Jung Yeon Mu,

747
00:49:25,299 --> 00:49:26,299
Jung Soon Gu.

748
00:49:27,369 --> 00:49:30,068
Oh, you are the rumoured brother-in-law...

749
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:31,239
of the left state councillor.

750
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:34,568
If you received your government post after selling your sister off,

751
00:49:34,569 --> 00:49:36,409
should you not study as you work?

752
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:38,778
The lady threw herself into the water.

753
00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:40,178
So what is this about a culprit?

754
00:49:40,179 --> 00:49:42,079
And for the evidence to be a novel book.

755
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:44,548
Nothing makes sense. Am I not right?

756
00:49:44,549 --> 00:49:45,979
Nobody in this world...

757
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,190
drowns themselves to death for no reason.

758
00:49:50,619 --> 00:49:53,489
A handful of Hwa Rok's novels were found in the dead Cho Ok's room.

759
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:56,928
It is not strange for women...

760
00:49:56,929 --> 00:49:58,699
to read novel books.

761
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:00,729
Hwa Rok's novels...

762
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:02,769
are mostly nonsensical romances about falling in love...

763
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,669
with a nobleman's son disguised as a farmhand...

764
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,298
or with the crown prince travelling incognito.

765
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:08,508
Fascinated by those books, Cho Ok's standard of men...

766
00:50:08,509 --> 00:50:10,239
became higher and avoided getting married.

767
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,439
In the end, she became depressed over her status as a spinster...

768
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,209
and committed suicide.

769
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,610
Hence, the author Hwa Rok is under investigation...

770
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,750
for breaking the law, which led to someone's death.

771
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:20,278
Do you truly think Lee Cho Ok...

772
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:22,819
took her life because of the novel books?

773
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,330
I am simply following my orders.

774
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:31,330
I cannot believe you work without giving any thought.

775
00:50:32,630 --> 00:50:34,869
Give me the investigation records of Lee Cho Ok.

776
00:51:13,869 --> 00:51:16,839
This is the investigation records of Lee Cho Ok.

777
00:51:28,350 --> 00:51:30,249
If she had thrown herself into the water,

778
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:32,159
how come she had this many wounds?

779
00:51:34,029 --> 00:51:35,060
The autopsy report...

780
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,428
stated it was due to being swept by the water.

781
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:39,730
From what I see, these are clearly stab wounds.

782
00:51:40,259 --> 00:51:43,029
The wound is 1.8 pun deep.

783
00:51:43,299 --> 00:51:45,638
It is deep enough to kill someone in an instant.

784
00:51:45,639 --> 00:51:48,440
Do you know how to examine a corpse?

785
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:52,508
I wrote the footnotes reinforcing...

786
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,810
the information in the book of forensic medicine...

787
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,080
you are treasuring.

788
00:51:57,750 --> 00:52:00,048
Contrary to the autopsy report,

789
00:52:00,049 --> 00:52:02,888
you wrote that Lee Cho Ok did not take her life by drowning...

790
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:06,619
but was stabbed to death and then thrown into the river...

791
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,529
in that paper.

792
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,798
Since you are investigating privately,

793
00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:12,900
you are not as incompetent,

794
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,799
which is a relief.

795
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:40,488
I heard Erudite Maeng's Lady Cho of Mount Nam Valley was admitted here.

796
00:52:40,489 --> 00:52:42,790
I wish to meet her. Inform her.

797
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:44,429
Please wait a moment.

798
00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:48,269
When did you find that out?

799
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:50,739
I just did with my intelligence.

800
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,209
Parents are the most responsible in their children's marriage.

801
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,309
If I inform the spinsters' mother that...

802
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:58,778
I will have them marry suitable old bachelors,

803
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:00,310
this matter will be settled.

804
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,699
Are you Erudite Maeng's Lady Cho of Mount Nam Valley?

805
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,469
Good grief.

806
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:28,369
Do I look in any way married to you?

807
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:33,139
Well, I requested to meet Lady Cho.

808
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,679
I see.

809
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:44,460
I am Maeng Ha Na, her eldest daughter.

810
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:47,659
My mother is getting acupuncture in the room.

811
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,099
She is weak, so meeting a guest is not possible.

812
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:53,229
She told me to listen to what you had to say.

813
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,928
I am a royal secret inspector...

814
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:57,329
with the order from the king to make you ladies get married.

815
00:53:57,330 --> 00:54:01,069
Thus, I came to tell your mother to have her children...

816
00:54:01,509 --> 00:54:03,339
get married to sons of great families.

817
00:54:08,210 --> 00:54:10,980
She was touched to get married by the king's order.

818
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:13,250
She must have wanted to marry really badly.

819
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,190
That ancient list of old bachelors...

820
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:18,159
are sons of great families?

821
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,888
You are quite knowledgeable in Chinese characters...

822
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:25,259
despite being a woman.

823
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:27,568
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

824
00:54:27,569 --> 00:54:29,599
It is not that we could not get married.

825
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,100
We decided not to get married.

826
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:33,198
So we do not need unnecessary help.

827
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:34,309
How could you?

828
00:54:34,310 --> 00:54:37,068
You, a noble's daughter, are being undutiful to your parents.

829
00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:38,338
How appalling.

830
00:54:38,339 --> 00:54:39,738
What do you mean by that?

831
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:42,749
You are way past the age and yet refusing to get married.

832
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,520
That is being undutiful, no?

833
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:47,020
I can feel your mother's worries all the way here.

834
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:52,619
My mother does not wish us to marry, either.

835
00:54:52,819 --> 00:54:54,830
That is plain nonsense.

836
00:54:55,489 --> 00:54:57,129
Every parent in Joseon...

837
00:54:57,130 --> 00:54:58,900
wants their child to get married.

838
00:55:02,469 --> 00:55:03,529
Ha Na.

839
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,269
Mother keeps asking for you.

840
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,368
All right. Let us go.

841
00:55:08,369 --> 00:55:10,068
I am still talking to you.

842
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:11,139
Stop right there!

843
00:55:18,219 --> 00:55:20,849
My lord. Being dutiful...

844
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:23,850
is the only ideology that comes before loyalty in Confucianism.

845
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:28,230
Rather than going to my mother at once, should I be listening...

846
00:55:28,389 --> 00:55:31,199
to a man who does not believe my words?

847
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,060
That is undutiful.

848
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:36,130
Do you realize you are committing high treason?

849
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,699
According to the law,

850
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,940
if a woman does not wed over the age of 24,

851
00:55:42,069 --> 00:55:43,838
the parents are to get punished...

852
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,480
unless the family is in difficulty.

853
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:47,339
Hence,

854
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:49,849
if you want to be dutiful to your parents,

855
00:55:49,850 --> 00:55:51,219
which you think so highly of,

856
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:55,219
you should marry the man I decide on.

857
00:55:58,489 --> 00:56:00,060
Go ahead and try that.

858
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:04,360
Let us go.

859
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:19,138
That foolish woman put her pride before her...

860
00:56:19,139 --> 00:56:20,440
and lied.

861
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:24,349
The chief magistrate in charge of the spinster matter...

862
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:27,020
uses social structural problems to sit by and do nothing.

863
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:30,790
The current state of Joseon is truly pathetic.

864
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,359
What are we to do now?

865
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,460
Is it not obvious?

866
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,369
I will show them how strict the law is.

867
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:56,279
- Oh, goodness. - My lord.

868
00:56:57,049 --> 00:56:58,719
What brings you here?

869
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:00,679
I need you to come with me.

870
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,089
I see.

871
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,219
What is this?

872
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:08,960
Is it edible?

873
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:14,798
Come in quietly. Come on.

874
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:19,000
- Your Majesty... - Good grief. Really.

875
00:57:20,369 --> 00:57:22,309
I am travelling in disguise.

876
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:24,509
Come and sit down without a word, all right?

877
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,610
My dear.

878
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:32,880
Goodness.

879
00:57:44,429 --> 00:57:45,429
Pour me a glass.

880
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:48,969
Right.

881
00:57:50,569 --> 00:57:51,670
Unbelievable.

882
00:57:52,839 --> 00:57:54,569
I do not like him at all.

883
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,118
Did I not tell you to take care of it quietly?

884
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,149
But you just had to tell it to the chief magistrate.

885
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,758
I simply followed the flow of the job.

886
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:14,190
How dare you talk back to me?

887
00:58:16,089 --> 00:58:18,658
Why would I have asked you if the chief magistrate...

888
00:58:18,659 --> 00:58:20,000
could do it?

889
00:58:22,330 --> 00:58:24,069
I am the king, you hear me?

890
00:58:33,139 --> 00:58:34,310
Just kidding.

891
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:39,919
The chief magistrate is...

892
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:41,749
like at the left state councillor’s beck and call.

893
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:44,589
But you showed our hands to the opponent. So what now?

894
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,889
You do not have to worry about him.

895
00:58:48,330 --> 00:58:49,528
They would not imagine...

896
00:58:49,529 --> 00:58:52,158
I would move for the crown prince's royal wedding...

897
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:53,799
by defaming them.

898
00:58:54,469 --> 00:58:55,469
Oh, right.

899
00:58:55,470 --> 00:58:58,169
The king's son-in-law of Gyeongunjae came out of the blue...

900
00:58:58,170 --> 00:59:01,469
and demanded the old ladies to be wedded off.

901
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,838
I panicked.

902
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:04,309
(Left State Councillor Jo Young Bae)

903
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,380
Why is he concerned about the old ladies' marriage?

904
00:59:07,509 --> 00:59:09,150
Who are these old ladies?

905
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,649
It is what people call the daughters of Sungkyunkwan's erudite...

906
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:15,089
Maeng Sang Chun, who passed away in the Year of the Rabbit.

907
00:59:15,549 --> 00:59:17,690
All three daughters are spinsters.

908
00:59:18,190 --> 00:59:19,190
So tell me.

909
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:22,159
Why is he suddenly acting like Maeng Ha Na's matchmaker?

910
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:26,400
Is there any reason for whatever he does?

911
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:30,069
He has so much time but so little to do.

912
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:33,199
Going around government offices and making appeals...

913
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,839
is his hobby, no?

914
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:36,670
So my question is,

915
00:59:36,909 --> 00:59:39,440
why is his target Maeng Ha Na?

916
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:47,850
I am just simply curious.

917
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,059
If you show off you are an inspector and threaten them with the law,

918
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,129
then yes,

919
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,360
the Maeng family's first daughter could be married off.

920
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,029
What about the other two?

921
01:00:01,770 --> 01:00:04,100
Are you going to wait until they turn 24?

922
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:07,810
I gave you two months.

923
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:13,210
From what I heard, a proficient matchmaker...

924
01:00:14,409 --> 01:00:17,850
could even make a widow of nobility marry a bachelor.

925
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,689
A wife of a noble family must serve but a single husband.

926
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:24,588
So how can she get married again?

927
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:26,389
And what is more, with a bachelor.

928
01:00:27,659 --> 01:00:30,059
It is simply an example, is it not?

929
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,060
But you!

930
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:34,630
Whose eyes do you think you are looking straight into?

931
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:36,270
Goodness.

932
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,468
Anyway, he sure is straight-laced.

933
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:43,468
Nor does he know the ways of the world.

934
01:00:43,469 --> 01:00:44,710
Is he in any way useful?

935
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:48,149
You... Let us say that your appeal gets accepted,

936
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:49,549
and you become a government official.

937
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:53,580
Will you be able to survive in this rough political world?

938
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:55,119
Good grief.

939
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:01,020
Listen.

940
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:02,829
If I ordered you...

941
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:05,099
to drink the deadly poison that night,

942
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,759
brought charges to the left state councillor, and exiled him,

943
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:10,500
the crown prince could have gotten married.

944
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:12,900
But had that happened,

945
01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:15,770
I would have lost much more than I gained.

946
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:18,210
Jung Woo.

947
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:21,480
You see, politics...

948
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:26,080
is losing the least and gaining what you want.

949
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,150
Bear that in mind.

950
01:01:35,989 --> 01:01:37,130
Gosh.

951
01:01:38,259 --> 01:01:41,060
What weak fire. We need new charcoals.

952
01:01:44,369 --> 01:01:46,068
There is a peddler selling women's items...

953
01:01:46,069 --> 01:01:47,939
in Hongwol Inn who is a great matchmaker.

954
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:49,869
Do not tell me... Again?

955
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:51,509
She is called Lady Yeoju.

956
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,079
She is a professional who helped...

957
01:01:54,080 --> 01:01:55,909
my second son, the troublemaker, get married.

958
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,679
A bad feeling never turns out to be wrong.

959
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:01,989
I have already spoken to her.

960
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:04,420
Meet her at the inn tomorrow.

961
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:07,259
- I will take care of it. - How?

962
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,389
Do as I say this time.

963
01:02:10,659 --> 01:02:14,258
I made a special request even though she was too busy for it.

964
01:02:14,259 --> 01:02:16,630
Pay her extra if you must and hire her.

965
01:02:22,009 --> 01:02:24,270
Come and grill the meat, will you?

966
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,150
Ask for some new charcoals.

967
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:36,389
Hwa Rok.

968
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:40,290
I have plans. Tell me quickly.

969
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:42,489
Or shall I listen to it next time?

970
01:02:56,469 --> 01:02:57,810
Be a matchmaker.

971
01:02:58,739 --> 01:03:00,040
For who?

972
01:03:04,049 --> 01:03:08,020
Have you heard of Mount Nam Valley's old ladies?

973
01:03:10,219 --> 01:03:11,259
I have.

974
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,489
Among them,

975
01:03:14,219 --> 01:03:17,360
help the 1st and 2nd ladies get married.

976
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,299
I wonder what this is.

977
01:03:21,569 --> 01:03:23,999
I got asked several times to act as the old ladies' matchmaker...

978
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,339
in the past two days.

979
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,440
You are the third person.

980
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,170
Who else was there?

981
01:03:30,610 --> 01:03:32,639
I need you to help an inspector.

982
01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:37,549
Can a matchmaker like me be of any help to an inspector?

983
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:40,420
It is to make the Mount Nam Valley's old ladies get married.

984
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:42,449
You will be of great help.

985
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:46,960
A bad feeling never turns out to be wrong.

986
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,960
Can you tell me why you are asking me to find them a husband?

987
01:03:54,259 --> 01:03:58,600
Well, I am quite acquainted with Lady Maeng Ha Na.

988
01:03:59,569 --> 01:04:01,838
The man, who was not charmed by you, came,

989
01:04:01,839 --> 01:04:03,738
identified himself as an inspector with the king's order,

990
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:06,239
and told her to marry whichever old bachelor he chose.

991
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:11,849
Lady Ha Na said not to worry as no man would marry her.

992
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:14,150
But my older sister is too oblivious about the world.

993
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,489
"My older sister?"

994
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:20,219
Hwa Rok.

995
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,029
Are you one of the old ladies?

996
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,000
I knew you were a woman from the beginning.

997
01:04:28,469 --> 01:04:30,500
So you were one of them.

998
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:32,670
Then...

999
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:36,239
Hwa Rok.

1000
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:38,638
Why are you crying?

1001
01:04:38,639 --> 01:04:39,710
You...

1002
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:42,250
guessed it right immediately.

1003
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:46,179
It shocked me. And now, I am worried.

1004
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:51,488
I will not tell anyone that you are Hwa Rok.

1005
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:52,889
Do not worry.

1006
01:04:54,089 --> 01:04:55,730
So, to sum it up,

1007
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:58,130
the man who did not fall for me...

1008
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:01,060
was to make your sister get married to anyone.

1009
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:02,468
Worried about her,

1010
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:04,839
you are asking me to be her matchmaker, yes?

1011
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:10,770
My lady?

1012
01:05:13,239 --> 01:05:14,279
Actually,

1013
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:16,009
that is not it.

1014
01:05:19,819 --> 01:05:22,289
I want to get married, all right?

1015
01:05:22,290 --> 01:05:23,888
But my older sisters must get married first for me,

1016
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:25,619
the youngest, to get married.

1017
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:28,759
Despite the inspector's threat, my sisters are not budging.

1018
01:05:29,089 --> 01:05:31,259
I am just so frustrated that I have come to see you.

1019
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:35,029
Please help my sisters get married.

1020
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:39,639
And do not tell my family I asked you...

1021
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,569
to be their matchmaker.

1022
01:05:43,469 --> 01:05:44,509
How come?

1023
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:48,649
When I was 16, I wrote a contract stating I would never get married...

1024
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:50,650
and live with my sisters forever.

1025
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:52,949
Any young girl would have done that, no?

1026
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:55,690
But...

1027
01:05:56,049 --> 01:05:57,520
I do not want to grow old...

1028
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:00,889
and die as an old maiden.

1029
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:06,330
Yes. You should get married.

1030
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,500
So you are going to be my sisters' matchmaker, right?

1031
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:14,670
I will find a good man for all three of you.

1032
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:16,310
Thank you.

1033
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,639
Leave it to me.

1034
01:06:25,949 --> 01:06:27,049
Good grief.

1035
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:32,719
She will refuse to do it when she sees me.

1036
01:06:33,989 --> 01:06:35,830
You must have been really rude to her.

1037
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,500
I should have gone with you that day.

1038
01:06:42,670 --> 01:06:45,770
When the matchmaker comes, apologize to her first.

1039
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:47,100
Why should I?

1040
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:48,969
I did nothing wrong!

1041
01:06:50,009 --> 01:06:51,779
For once, just do as I say.

1042
01:06:52,210 --> 01:06:54,309
You are not aware of things,

1043
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,908
but women forgive you if you apologize to them.

1044
01:06:56,909 --> 01:06:58,009
So...

1045
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,750
Even you to say that I am not aware of things.

1046
01:07:02,489 --> 01:07:06,360
Who is the actual one who does not know the principles and limits?

1047
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:25,480
Good. Let me...

1048
01:07:36,819 --> 01:07:39,158
Let me apologize first. I am sorry for the last time.

1049
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:40,589
I will be the old ladies' matchmaker.

1050

(The Matchmakers)

1051
01:08:33,610 --> 01:08:34,638
We have two months.

1052
01:08:34,639 --> 01:08:36,878
Everything will be done together with Lord Sim.

1053
01:08:36,879 --> 01:08:38,879
Please move away from me, will you?

1054
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:42,288
I came to help your daughters get married.

1055
01:08:42,289 --> 01:08:43,319
Your trip has been wasted.

1056
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,088
Do you know what an agent of love is?

1057
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:46,289
"Agent of love?"

1058
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:48,928
I must be an agent of love.

1059
01:08:48,929 --> 01:08:52,029
Has anyone else asked for golden silkworm poison in the past?

1060
01:08:52,030 --> 01:08:54,229
She is one of our people.

1061
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,798
But if she turns her back on us,

1062
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:57,928
she will become the most dangerous enemy.

1063
01:08:57,929 --> 01:08:59,270
I must search your house.

1064
