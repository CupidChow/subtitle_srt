(The Matchmakers)

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:58,660
I see. So you are asking...

7
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,659
why I took in Sim Jung Woo...

8
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,398
when he is from the Dongro Faction?

9
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:06,630
(The King, Father of Many Daughters)

10
00:01:12,309 --> 00:01:16,780
Well, I have never disliked the Dongro Faction.

11
00:01:17,039 --> 00:01:19,580
It is the left state councillor and his bunch that I hate.

12
00:01:20,309 --> 00:01:23,850
Jung Woo's father, the founder of Dongro Faction,

13
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:26,249
also used to write in appeals...

14
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,019
about everything I did.

15
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,520
That is right. Just like Jung Woo.

16
00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:32,889
Although I was irritated,

17
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,499
I have never disliked him.

18
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,669
However, the current left state councillor...

19
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:42,799
The left state councillor pretended to be loyal to the faction...

20
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,609
and came up with an excuse...

21
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,269
to grow his power. That stuck out to me,

22
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,640
so how can I not dislike him?

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,648
Goodness. I cannot believe...

24
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,949
how I have to be wary of my subjects even in my introduction.

25
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,549
Being a king is nothing much.

26
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,419
Do you agree? Goodness.

27
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,619
I should not have been one.

28
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,699
(Episode 6: Everyone Has a Secret)

29
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,339
While I was at Sunhwa Temple,

30
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,840
I heard you dispelled my brother's rumours.

31
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:23,738
As a token of appreciation, I wanted to offer you a position.

32
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,150
Hence, I called for you.

33
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:26,650
A position?

34
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:30,650
Please be my grandson's tutor.

35
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:34,120
I heard your family does not allow you to adopt.

36
00:02:34,359 --> 00:02:36,620
You may be fine now as you are young.

37
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,590
But when you grow old, you will be lonely.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,798
If you get a disciple,

39
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,469
you may be less lonely when you grow old.

40
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,799
No one takes care of their tutors these days.

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,039
Why not?

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,638
You yourself...

43
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,638
were taught by Erudite Maeng for less than a month.

44
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,478
Yet, you are helping to match his daughters...

45
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,579
lest they remain as spinsters.

46
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:04,079
I must say, Lady Park. You know everything.

47
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,518
Most of the things I do are to while away time.

48
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,359
There is no other reason for it.

49
00:03:11,229 --> 00:03:15,059
Besides, while I am grateful that you care for my old age,

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,400
I have never tutored anyone.

51
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:21,569
I shall have to refuse tutoring your grandson.

52
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,068
This child has to be raised upright...

53
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,840
in order to lead your father's faction, you know.

54
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:32,180
If you decide to join hands with me,

55
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,879
I hope we can drink tea like so...

56
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,419
and talk about worldly affairs.

57
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:46,288
When I get a tutor,

58
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:48,859
will I have to study until late at night again?

59
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,768
Tell me about it.

60
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:55,169
You are already in school. Why do you need tutoring?

61
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,909
Nevertheless, you know Grandmother is doing this for you, right?

62
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,680
Yes. Good medicine always tastes bitter.

63
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,079
Let us go in.

64
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,289
Forget it.

65
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,858
I will see a physician later on...

66
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,129
What are you doing?

67
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,229
There is no way.

68
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,209
Grandmother, it is Geun Seok.

69
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,340
Come in.

70
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,260
I have a nosebleed.

71
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,029
Do not worry. I think I spent too much time on needlework.

72
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,429
Hurry to Grandmother.

73
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:01,739
Yes, Mother.

74
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,760
Why did your mother not come in with you?

75
00:05:30,129 --> 00:05:33,200
She went back to the annex as she got a nosebleed.

76
00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:34,429
A nosebleed?

77
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,669
Just like how I got one for studying too hard,

78
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,839
Mother also got a nosebleed from too much needlework.

79
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,379
She told you not to worry.

80
00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:45,249
- You had a nosebleed before? - Yes.

81
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,279
However, Mother told me not to study...

82
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,549
after dinner time so it stopped.

83
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:53,689
What is the matter?

84
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:57,119
It seems like not studying after dinner time...

85
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:59,189
was a secret between him and his mother.

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,669
Lady Jung.

87
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:10,439
What is wrong?

88
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,140
Why are you leaving?

89
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,308
Who is the person who will tutor Geun Seok?

90
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:20,879
It is Lord Gyeongunjae.

91
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,780
What?

92
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,789
The inspector turned out to be the famous Man of Anger?

93
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,858
You yelled over nothing. Like Man of Anger.

94
00:06:29,859 --> 00:06:32,030
What did you just say?

95
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,489
Forgive me...

96
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,329
for likening you to a pathetic troublemaker...

97
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,100
like Lord Gyeongunjae.

98
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,830
You have never even met Lord Gyeongunjae.

99
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,369
This is driving me crazy.

100
00:06:45,869 --> 00:06:49,379
Did I badmouth Man of Anger in his face?

101
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,710
Lady Jung. Lady Jung?

102
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,280
Lady Jung!

103
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:57,219
What? Oh...

104
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,788
Have you gone deaf?

105
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:01,150
Why did you not go in with Young Master Geun Seok?

106
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:03,160
Well, I...

107
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,329
I had a nosebleed.

108
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,390
Pardon? A nosebleed?

109
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,969
I thought it was a nosebleed, but it was just snot.

110
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,428
Either way,

111
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:16,600
I cannot let our precious guest see that.

112
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,769
Let me know when he leaves.

113
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,038
I will tell Mother about it.

114
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:23,039
Yes, my lady.

115
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:30,549
The inspector was Man of Anger.

116
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,419
And he will be Geun Seok's tutor?

117
00:07:35,189 --> 00:07:36,220
What do I do?

118
00:07:37,619 --> 00:07:39,558
It was not a good thing...

119
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:41,460
for people to recognize me without makeup.

120
00:07:44,299 --> 00:07:47,270
Lady Jung? Lady Park is here.

121
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,640
Mother, why did you come here? I could have gone over.

122
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,189
Did you ask Geun Seok to stop studying past dinner time?

123
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:17,159
Well, Geun Seok had a nosebleed one time, so...

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,200
Good call.

125
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,200
- Sorry? - Studying is important,

126
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,640
but it will be for nothing if he is not healthy.

127
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,910
However, if such a thing happened,

128
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,850
you should have informed me.

129
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,349
When outsiders hear of this,

130
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,388
they will say you neglected Geun Seok's studies...

131
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:41,989
because he is not your biological son.

132
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,290
I failed to look at the big picture.

133
00:08:49,359 --> 00:08:51,569
Go to the physician's tomorrow...

134
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,529
and get tonics for Geun Seok.

135
00:08:53,769 --> 00:08:56,399
Yes, Mother. I shall do so.

136
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,439
Also, Lord Gyeongunjae...

137
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,979
will come over to tutor Geun Seok.

138
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,579
Make sure you are prepared.

139
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
No!

140
00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:09,850
I mean,

141
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:14,350
you said that Geun Seok's health is a priority.

142
00:09:14,619 --> 00:09:16,919
If you let him have lessons on top of school,

143
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,229
you are contradicting yourself.

144
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,830
It is only once every five days.

145
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,498
Let him try it out. If he finds it too much,

146
00:09:24,499 --> 00:09:26,070
we shall reconsider.

147
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,710
How did your matter go?

148
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,508
I am going to go to Lady Park's every five days...

149
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,378
to tutor her grandson.

150
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,450
What?

151
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,649
I thought you hated the left state councillor. So why...

152
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,018
This child has to be raised upright...

153
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:47,889
in order to lead your father's faction, you know.

154
00:09:49,119 --> 00:09:51,090
I wanted to outright refuse her.

155
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:53,930
But I could not bear to let it be.

156
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:55,960
Let what be?

157
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:59,070
- You may leave. - All right. Please rest.

158
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:36,700
Why have you not wrapped up the case of Lee Cho Ok?

159
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,008
It has been months since then.

160
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:40,608
When will you let it go?

161
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:43,139
The main suspect goes by the pseudonym "Hwa Rok."

162
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:45,450
It is not easy to arrest that person.

163
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,909
I hear...

164
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,080
half of the women in the city read Hwa Rok's novel.

165
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:53,590
How can you not catch him even if he uses a pseudonym?

166
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,118
Chief Magistrate.

167
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:58,258
During my investigation, I found traces of murder, not suicide...

168
00:10:58,259 --> 00:10:59,330
You!

169
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:02,229
That case ended as a suicide caused by personal depression.

170
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:04,060
Why did you continue investigating without approval?

171
00:11:04,999 --> 00:11:08,369
Arrest Hwa Rok faster if you have time to do that.

172
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,550
Everyone is already asking when the third volume...

173
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,019
of "The Lady's Private Life" will be ready.

174
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,849
It will take a while for me to write the third volume...

175
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,359
due to personal reasons.

176
00:11:29,619 --> 00:11:30,859
Has Lady Yeoju...

177
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,930
already found your spouse-to-be?

178
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,869
About 80 percent of my writings come from my mood.

179
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,069
If she found my future spouse,

180
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,769
I would have finished volume three by now.

181
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:48,379
She was unable to find one for me. Just me!

182
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,509
Unable to find one? Find what?

183
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,249
Goodness, do not cry.

184
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,550
There, there.

185
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:03,590
Why are you so sad?

186
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,190
Why am I the only one without someone to marry?

187
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,009
What do you want now?

188
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,249
I need to speak with you for a moment.

189
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,609
Go ahead.

190
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,489
I cannot speak to you in this illegal state.

191
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:32,050
I am now in a legal state, so please speak.

192
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:34,079
You promised not to write novels...

193
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,450
dressed up as a man.

194
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,180
I went there...

195
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,519
to receive the outstanding balance for what I had already written.

196
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,420
I put a lot of work into it,

197
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:45,628
so I had to get the rest of the money.

198
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:48,430
Are you saying money is more important than your life?

199
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,029
Yes.

200
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,570
It is that important right now.

201
00:13:54,369 --> 00:13:56,170
The wall finally collapsed,

202
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,769
so my home is completely exposed.

203
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,550
All right.

204
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,479
Goodness. My gosh.

205
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,920
Put one up over there.

206
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:14,350
- This one? - No, that one.

207
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,988
One, two, three.

208
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:18,389
Mother, why did you come out?

209
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,199
I hear the lieutenant of the Capital District Office...

210
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,659
is fixing our wall.

211
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,869
Well, there is a long story.

212
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:28,899
You do not have to mind him, Mother.

213
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:31,869
I have something to say to him.

214
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:33,409
All right.

215
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,180
You really do not have to mind him.

216
00:14:40,909 --> 00:14:42,179
You are here, my lady.

217
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,680
Not only do we need help with the wall,

218
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,050
we need new roof tiles too.

219
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:49,659
The water leaks in the annex when it rains.

220
00:14:54,389 --> 00:14:58,060
Mother, why are you sharing that with him?

221
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,069
Yes, my lady.

222
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:04,239
I will fix the roof in a few days after the wall is finished.

223
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,310
Good.

224
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:26,889
Do you think that lieutenant...

225
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,930
is married?

226
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:32,670
I am sure he is. He is a lieutenant, after all.

227
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,269
A woman who has such a dependable man as a husband...

228
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,999
must be very happy.

229
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:42,210
Why would you want a husband...

230
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,680
who fixes the wall of another woman's house?

231
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,920
Our father never forgot the birthday of his mentor's wife,

232
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,259
but he never celebrated Mother's birthday.

233
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:59,489
A man like him is the worst as a husband.

234
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:15,540
You tell me.

235
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,509
So Hyun, it seems like the head shaman is wrong.

236
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:23,479
I could not find a trace of the Crown Prince...

237
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:26,320
in the princess's home or the King's nanny's home.

238
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,859
So, I discreetly requested help to Royal Noble Consort Suk.

239
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:33,259
She said it seemed like he was in Dongungjeon.

240
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,600
What you did was utterly unnecessary.

241
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,649
Do not be so harsh...

242
00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:57,080
on Bok Ki, I mean, on the minister of defence.

243
00:16:57,979 --> 00:17:00,749
I also think something went wrong.

244
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,859
The Queen continuously makes the Crown Prince's meals,

245
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,329
and the Crown Prince has not skipped a day...

246
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,300
of his studies at Sigangwon.

247
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,399
I think we are making a fruitless effort...

248
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,899
looking for him outside the palace.

249
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,240
Did you hear the Crown Prince reading his book out loud?

250
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:22,409
I did not hear him read.

251
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,510
The Queen must have left...

252
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:28,480
a young eunuch to sit there in his place.

253
00:17:34,149 --> 00:17:35,820
I have already found the home...

254
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,790
where the Crown Prince is.

255
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,699
Where is it?

256
00:17:45,199 --> 00:17:47,698
By any chance, did anybody in the city...

257
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:49,770
come by to get some milk?

258
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:53,139
Yes, there was someone.

259
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:56,080
Where does that person live?

260
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,479
Your milk porridge is...

261
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,280
much better than what I had in the palace.

262
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,519
I found out through a peddler...

263
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,888
that Seo became a commoner from her servanthood...

264
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:11,359
by the order of the Queen soon after her installation.

265
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:17,199
There were two other men seen in her house,

266
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:18,730
the ones who had never been there.

267
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,240
You must pretend not to know about this.

268
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,169
Hence, it is unnecessary...

269
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:31,139
do not send a court lady to spy on Dongungjeon.

270
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:34,149
I understand.

271
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,780
(Book Rental Shop)

272
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:49,530
Stay calm.

273
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,168
It does not matter even if he is the Man of Anger.

274
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:53,369
Nothing at all.

275
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:56,240
I just have to be careful not to cross him.

276
00:19:07,179 --> 00:19:09,250
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

277
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:12,820
My goodness.

278
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,820
Did I dare to come late?

279
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,060
What? No.

280
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,989
I got here a little early.

281
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,060
I see. You personally came out very early.

282
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,230
Why are you suddenly doing this?

283
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:31,168
I had been quite rude to you because I did not know...

284
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:33,969
you were Lord Gyeongunjae, one of the royal family.

285
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,240
How did you know I was Lord Gyeongunjae?

286
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,609
Well...

287
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,649
Your butler told me.

288
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,449
O Bong did not need to do that.

289
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,320
Just do as you always have.

290
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:51,290
I got used to your rudeness, so I feel even more uncomfortable.

291
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,859
In that case, I will abide by your order.

292
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,399
Do as you like.

293
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,800
Gosh, nice portraits.

294
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:04,040
I mean, they are wonderful.

295
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,969
Did you draw these yourself?

296
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,539
You said you would reflect on the first eye contact...

297
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,840
from Sunhwa Temple to find their husbands-to-be,

298
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,850
so I drew them to increase the efficiency of the process.

299
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,750
You are a good artist too.

300
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,919
There is nothing you cannot do, my lord.

301
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:24,659
Now, let us begin.

302
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,399
You could remember every single old bachelor...

303
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:39,009
you only saw from a distance?

304
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,969
I never forget anybody once I have seen them.

305
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:46,149
"An agent of love..."

306
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:49,879
"does not forget anybody's face for the rest of their life."

307
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:54,918
Let us begin with Lady Ha Na, who received the attention...

308
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,020
of every single old bachelor.

309
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:58,188
(Bachelor 1, 2, 4, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 23, 24, 20, 22, 8, 7)

310
00:20:58,189 --> 00:21:00,290
(First Eye Contact: Success)

311
00:21:08,399 --> 00:21:11,540
It seems too good a game to give up.

312
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:12,809
(Bachelor 15: Jang Chun Bae, Bachelor 12: Kim Jib)

313
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,009
The eldest daughter wanted someone from a good family...

314
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,209
who has a good fortune and is respectable.

315
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,579
That means Bachelor 15, Jang Chun Bae,

316
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,709
is the most suitable as a man who owns a big bookstore.

317
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,719
On the surface, Bachelor 15 seems like an appropriate spouse.

318
00:21:26,219 --> 00:21:29,290
But my 6th sense tells me Bachelor 12 is the right one.

319
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:32,830
I will put up both men as candidates for Lady Ha Na.

320
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:34,290
Bachelor 12?

321
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:37,259
Bachelor 12 was good at playing the game of go,

322
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,270
so he must be rather educated too.

323
00:21:39,969 --> 00:21:41,668
Education is one thing.

324
00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:44,139
But did you not see his worn-out clothes?

325
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:47,509
The eldest would not accept, as she wanted someone with fortune.

326
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,609
You cannot jump to a conclusion just by his worn-out clothes.

327
00:21:49,939 --> 00:21:52,550
Did you not catch his beautiful hand under the sleeve?

328
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,850
Also, when his eyes first met with Lady Ha Na's,

329
00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:58,649
I saw an amber headband button next to his hat.

330
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,619
Did you fail to catch that?

331
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,730
I do not know why Bachelor 12 is hiding his wealth,

332
00:22:06,189 --> 00:22:09,299
but I know he is a son of an affluent family.

333
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,599
I also believe Lady Ha Na must have known instinctively...

334
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,300
and played a move for his side.

335
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,070
It is quite scary to imagine...

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,469
the kind of details women can catch.

337
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,850
Also, Bachelor 12 is not from Hanyang,

338
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:28,209
so he is unaware of Lady Ha Na's rumour.

339
00:22:29,719 --> 00:22:31,080
It may be even better.

340
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:35,250
All right. In that case,

341
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:38,889
what about the second daughter, who had the toughest term?

342
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,230
What I look for in a husband is very simple.

343
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,899
It is someone who uses his hands...

344
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,100
to earn enough money to buy the food he eats.

345
00:22:52,139 --> 00:22:55,369
Lady Doo Ri's term was rather tough, unlike I expected.

346
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,678
Among the old bachelors who showed interest in her,

347
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,949
Bachelor 16 was the most ordinary.

348
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:05,218
He also passed the state exam,

349
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:06,889
so he was the most likely to become a success.

350
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,520
(Bachelor 24)

351
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,358
I will go with Bachelor 24.

352
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,060
Bachelor 24 was a man who had an inferiority complex.

353
00:23:17,699 --> 00:23:20,368
And he is a farmer who is not interested in succeeding.

354
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:22,500
Do you not think that makes him more perfect?

355
00:23:22,699 --> 00:23:23,839
He farms,

356
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,070
so he is a man who uses his hands to make a living for himself.

357
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:30,080
Lady Doo Ri will not be able to protest.

358
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,009
You boasted saying you could tell...

359
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,010
when people were meant to be as an agent of love,

360
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:37,949
but you focused more on their terms than I did.

361
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,419
If you consider the future of the three daughters,

362
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,760
Bachelor 16 is a better choice, as he is likely to succeed.

363
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,260
The real reason why I chose him was...

364
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:49,800
because of the way he looked at her and his assertiveness.

365
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,500
It happened briefly, but I clearly saw it in his eyes.

366
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,939
Bachelor 24's eyes gleamed with love for Lady Doo Ri.

367
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:00,168
Also, unlike other old bachelors,

368
00:24:00,169 --> 00:24:02,780
he was assertive enough to run after her.

369
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,309
If only you have the final say, why are we having this meeting?

370
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,349
Because I must go through the entire process with you.

371
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,179
That was the term of our contract.

372
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,520
It is not too late to trust me and leave it to...

373
00:24:15,219 --> 00:24:16,290
Forget it.

374
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,740
Are you revisited with heart acceleration?

375
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:34,269
No.

376
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:37,079
Also, heart acceleration is not human.

377
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,310
Why would it visit me?

378
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:41,250
You never use the right words.

379
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,219
(Bachelor 24)

380
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:53,929
My goodness.

381
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:56,530
We meet again right here.

382
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:58,629
What are the chances?

383
00:24:59,169 --> 00:25:01,830
I did not come by to see you.

384
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:06,070
I stopped by a friend's house and was on my way home.

385
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:10,139
Are you the shaman's friend?

386
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,040
Pardon?

387
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,629
Lastly,

388
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,040
a diamond in the rough, Lady Sam Soon. Shall we?

389
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:40,010
I have a grasp on your way of matching.

390
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,169
The art of matchmaking...

391
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,810
cannot be learned by studying.

392
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,579
Which bachelor did you choose?

393
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,948
Tell me which one you have on your mind.

394
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,020
No.

395
00:25:51,619 --> 00:25:53,989
What if you get jealous of my excellent ability to learn...

396
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:56,889
and deny it even if I choose the right one?

397
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,929
- Why would I do that? - I also have no idea...

398
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:03,899
why people do that.

399
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,169
That was why you became the Man of Anger.

400
00:26:13,139 --> 00:26:14,169
What?

401
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,739
Ever since I found out you were Lord Gyeongunjae,

402
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,010
I began to wonder...

403
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,049
why such a smart and honest man like you...

404
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,609
became the Man of Anger.

405
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,719
But I just figured out why.

406
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,918
You only had lousy people in your life,

407
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:29,119
those who pushed you down just to elevate themselves.

408
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:39,330
In that case, let us pick one on the count of three.

409
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:40,899
No misunderstandings.

410
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:42,469
Sounds good.

411
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:46,570
One, two, three.

412
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,510
See?

413
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,909
I told you that I learned everything quickly.

414
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,080
Why did you choose him?

415
00:27:31,719 --> 00:27:34,418
Just like the third daughter who dresses up as a man and writes,

416
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,719
Bachelor 23...

417
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,759
also loves to cook as women usually do.

418
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,590
They both pursue something against the world,

419
00:27:41,889 --> 00:27:43,699
so they will make a good match.

420
00:27:45,429 --> 00:27:47,770
Your reason is incorrect.

421
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:51,398
Lady Sam Soon is honest to her emotions...

422
00:27:51,399 --> 00:27:53,810
and steps up bravely in this process of marriage.

423
00:27:55,109 --> 00:27:58,179
That is why she is a good match for Bachelor 23,

424
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:01,649
who will do as the woman says if it is not about cooking.

425
00:28:06,449 --> 00:28:11,060
I see. In that case,

426
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,060
what kind of a woman should I be with?

427
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:31,740
You...

428
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,649
Well...

429
00:28:36,879 --> 00:28:38,020
My lord.

430
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,800
All right.

431
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:53,169
I prepared some snacks.

432
00:28:57,969 --> 00:29:01,070
Then, the candidate for Lady Sam Soon...

433
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:03,708
will be Bachelor 23.

434
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:07,080
Also, please contact the selected bachelors...

435
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,949
and contact me, just as I asked.

436
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:13,719
Our job is finished today. Please excuse me.

437
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,149
Sure.

438
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,189
Wait. I brought some snacks. Stay and have some.

439
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,659
Thank you.

440
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,560
But I have to be somewhere urgently.

441
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:27,929
Goodness.

442
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:36,080
What? Why?

443
00:29:36,439 --> 00:29:38,309
Why did you come in now?

444
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,479
What? You told me to come by...

445
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,148
with some snacks in an adequate hour.

446
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:46,050
I woke up early in the morning and paid someone to make this!

447
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,750
What does she mean to you anyway?

448
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,020
You cannot glare at me like that.

449
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,290
I am quite disappointed.

450
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:00,230
Goodness.

451
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:11,540
We will use these as our tableware tonight.

452
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:14,709
I do not see Lady Jung on a day like this one.

453
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:20,489
Our food is made with devotion, so her subordinates...

454
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:23,260
will not work properly if she is not here to watch over them.

455
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,158
She is also a servant. Why does she talk as if she is the lady?

456
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,030
Should I visit the annex?

457
00:30:35,169 --> 00:30:36,500
Why are you out here?

458
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,040
Goodness.

459
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,270
All right.

460
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,550
Prince Jinsung loves ginger liquor, right?

461
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,678
It was stuck at the bottom of the storage,

462
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,090
so it was tough to pull out.

463
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,260
Oh, right.

464
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:59,060
Prince Jinsung said he could not have alcohol...

465
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:00,990
because he is currently taking tonics.

466
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:02,958
I completely forgot.

467
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,859
I will return the liquor.

468
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,199
Tell one of the servants to return it later.

469
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,770
You can finish cooking the meal.

470
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:15,939
Yes, Mother.

471
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,718
Goodness, Lady Jung.

472
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,060
She just got here, right?

473
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,789
You do not have to do this each time.

474
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,429
We had a lot to do today.

475
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,830
Let us hurry.

476
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:41,199
All right. Let me taste the soup.

477
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,708
Prince Jinsung is here.

478
00:31:46,709 --> 00:31:48,909
Why are you here instead of the reception room?

479
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,689
I was right!

480
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:06,759
Lady Jung had been going outside in secret.

481
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,489
("The Lady's Private Life")

482
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:10,260
What in the world is she doing out there?

483
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,060
Look at these vulgar clothes.

484
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,500
- What are we going to do? - You.

485
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,570
Keep your mouth shut.

486
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,369
Do not share what you just saw with anybody else.

487
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,938
If I hear someone say my daughter-in-law...

488
00:32:24,939 --> 00:32:27,449
had been wandering outside without my permission,

489
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:29,418
I will think of you as the source,

490
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:31,419
no matter what the true source is,

491
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:34,619
and I will sell Sam Wol to a dangerous place. Remember that.

492
00:32:36,389 --> 00:32:39,119
Yes, my lady.

493
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,100
Just find out...

494
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:47,629
what Soon Duk had been up to.

495
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,570
Yes.

496
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:02,820
Was there...

497
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,280
a need to have Prince Jinsung here?

498
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,520
We are doing all the work anyway.

499
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:12,719
Prince Jinsung should know what we had to do...

500
00:33:13,629 --> 00:33:16,159
to make him a king better than anybody else.

501
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,999
That is how we will stop him from acting independently...

502
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,429
even after his enthronement...

503
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,530
to make sure Dongro Faction continues to stay in power.

504
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,239
We can never catch up to the wisdom...

505
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,040
of the left state councillor.

506
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,709
Prince Jinsung is here.

507
00:33:47,629 --> 00:33:49,290
In that case,

508
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,300
what kind of a woman should I be with?

509
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:02,169
She already knows I am unable to remarry.

510
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,540
She must have thought I was utterly immoral.

511
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:15,049
I must be crazy.

512
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,319
I should have pulled my hand out when his hand touched mine.

513
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,960
What if he thinks I am that easy?

514
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,330
Lady Jung!

515
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:29,869
What are you doing right now?

516
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:31,339
What?

517
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:37,079
Oh, my. What am I going to do?

518
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,110
What am I going to do?

519
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,250
I better do this alone.

520
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:44,719
You can get some rest over there.

521
00:35:04,699 --> 00:35:07,109
I will only see her again after many days,

522
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,440
and she will misunderstand me until that day.

523
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,880
Is my stress acting up again?

524
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,150
I cannot let this go on.

525
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,690
I shall talk to the groom candidates as soon as possible...

526
00:35:22,549 --> 00:35:25,619
to meet Lady Yeoju and lift this misunderstanding.

527
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,369
Soon Duk, open the door.

528
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:37,639
What?

529
00:35:38,299 --> 00:35:41,009
Am I not allowed a moment to reflect on myself?

530
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,009
Hurry up, Soon Duk.

531
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:50,619
Yes, coming.

532
00:35:52,219 --> 00:35:53,250
Goodness.

533
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,699
Goodness, why did you bring this heavy jar here?

534
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
My life would end as soon as I get married,

535
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:13,040
so before then, I wanted to drink lots of my favourite ginger liquor.

536
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:16,579
Why do you think your life will end after marriage?

537
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,980
That is when your life begins.

538
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:22,980
It does not sound too convincing coming from you.

539
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,619
Give me a moment. I will bring some chasers.

540
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,330
You did not have to take things this far.

541
00:36:41,929 --> 00:36:44,040
You said you would finish this jar of liquor.

542
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:46,739
And I want a drink today too.

543
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,380
Is something going on?

544
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,779
Take your time.

545
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,619
Well...

546
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,520
Something is bothering me,

547
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:06,889
so can you tell me your thoughts?

548
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,929
Fire away. Is this about you?

549
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,130
No.

550
00:37:14,029 --> 00:37:15,429
This is not about me.

551
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:18,940
This is about a woman I know very well.

552
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:24,480
She was picking out something at the marketplace,

553
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,549
and her hand overlapped with the man next door.

554
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,548
Was that man married?

555
00:37:29,549 --> 00:37:30,679
No, he is a widower.

556
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,119
Or so I heard.

557
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,759
A widower and a married woman?

558
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:43,429
- And? - Anyway, the important part was...

559
00:37:44,299 --> 00:37:46,869
that the woman was so flustered, so she did not pull her hand out.

560
00:37:47,469 --> 00:37:49,130
She began to worry...

561
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:52,639
if the man next door would think she was an easy woman.

562
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,509
Because that lady is...

563
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:57,310
only in love with her husband.

564
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,580
That is a lie.

565
00:38:02,009 --> 00:38:05,319
She lied when she said she only loved her husband.

566
00:38:05,949 --> 00:38:07,289
It is not a lie.

567
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,219
I am sure she has feelings for that widower.

568
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:12,790
No, she does not.

569
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,759
I know her very well.

570
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,130
She does not have feelings for him.

571
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,600
You knew I was married three times, right?

572
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,199
I do.

573
00:38:26,199 --> 00:38:27,209
Listen up.

574
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,169
If something like that happened,

575
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,738
she should be concerned about everyone else thinking she was easy.

576
00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:35,678
Why would she only worry...

577
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,150
if only that man might think...

578
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:39,619
she was an easy woman?

579
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:41,089
Which means...

580
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,758
that lady wishes...

581
00:38:43,759 --> 00:38:47,560
to remain in that man's favour.

582
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:51,000
- That is nonsense. - Right.

583
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,369
Now that you say that, you are right.

584
00:38:53,699 --> 00:38:54,699
She is not right.

585
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,940
Lady Jung, you may be the best matchmaker,

586
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:00,638
but you only match those who are young and single.

587
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,469
You would not know anything about how adults love.

588
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:05,980
By any chance,

589
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,980
do you have another story of how adults love?

590
00:39:10,279 --> 00:39:11,319
Do you want me to tell you?

591
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:14,719
Well, I got a story of my second husband...

592
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:17,219
who eloped with the lady after they hit it off.

593
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,119
Yes, tell me.

594
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:21,790
- When was this again? - Good grief.

595
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,829
Do not pretend like you know everything about love...

596
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,600
just because you were married three times.

597
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:28,369
I said no, which means no.

598
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,239
You do not even know her. That is not love.

599
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,569
This happened way back when...

600
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,889
His Majesty is feeling under the weather.

601
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:55,429
He is still in bed.

602
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,860
Is he in bad condition?

603
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,770
I believe it to be a common cold.

604
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:04,639
I understand. Please tell him I was here.

605
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,529
She has passed life-threatening danger.

606
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,299
I am glad.

607
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,199
I must ask something to this court lady.

608
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:39,000
Do whatever it takes to make her conscious again.

609
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40,839
I will do my best.

610
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,880
And be especially cautious so nobody finds out...

611
00:40:44,279 --> 00:40:45,679
she is still alive.

612
00:40:46,279 --> 00:40:47,480
Yes, Your Majesty.

613
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,960
There is a purpose behind every study.

614
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,429
What is your dream?

615
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,960
I wish to become the premier.

616
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,630
Why do you wish to become the premier?

617
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,670
I wish to make my grandparents happy.

618
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,339
You become an official...

619
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:16,439
to assist the King and work for the people,

620
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,980
not to make your grandparents happy.

621
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:21,449
By any chance, are you acquainted with my mother?

622
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,979
Why do you suddenly ask?

623
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,089
I have never met anybody who says that other than my mother.

624
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,460
She also said I could study hard if I wanted to.

625
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:32,588
But if I did it only for my grandparents,

626
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:34,889
she said there was no need to study too hard.

627
00:41:36,799 --> 00:41:38,360
You have a great mother.

628
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,730
That is why I am worried.

629
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,440
She does not seem to know this world too well.

630
00:41:56,779 --> 00:41:59,049
How was your first class with him?

631
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:03,860
I would have regretted it if I turned down this lesson.

632
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,229
You have such an extraordinary grandson,

633
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:09,529
so I may end up learning from him.

634
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:14,369
I am happy to hear that he earned your favour.

635
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:18,400
So, how is the matchmaking going?

636
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:22,310
Please let me know if you face any difficulties.

637
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:24,009
I will help you.

638
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,580
Marriages are usually up to the women in a household.

639
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,920
I am working with a famous matchmaker, so it is all right.

640
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,489
But if I do face any difficulties, I shall seek your help.

641
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,589
How was your private lesson?

642
00:42:43,759 --> 00:42:46,629
If it is too tough, please do tell me.

643
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,069
It was fun.

644
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,639
I especially liked the teacher.

645
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:53,409
Is that so? How come?

646
00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:55,710
Because he likes you, Mother.

647
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,009
What?

648
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,739
It is our little something.

649
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,880
What did you study today?

650
00:43:06,449 --> 00:43:08,020
I learned the Analects of Confucius.

651
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:09,989
"The Analects of Confucius?"

652
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,689
To even learn the Analects of Confucius.

653
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,259
You are all grown up now.

654
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,170
How is it?

655
00:43:20,299 --> 00:43:22,029
Do you attend a school or something?

656
00:43:24,369 --> 00:43:26,770
- Good grief. - All right.

657
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:30,480
Gosh. My apologies for being late.

658
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:32,738
I have many students to take care of...

659
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:35,980
with the initial state exam just around the corner.

660
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:38,678
- I see. - As the weather was fine today,

661
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:41,048
I invited some other scholars as well.

662
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,889
The more people, the merrier.

663
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,259
I just realized we were all standing near the wall at Sunhwa Temple.

664
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,059
You came late. Drink three cups.

665
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:55,000
(One who comes late must drink three cups to join.)

666
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,940
Here. Drink.

667
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,279
Goodness.

668
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,779
What have you done to this sotak?

669
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:18,659
I have never had such delicious sotak before.

670
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:24,798
If it is this good, I could even drink ten cups.

671
00:44:24,799 --> 00:44:27,198
Right. Go ahead.

672
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:30,238
Today's drinks are on me, so let us enjoy it...

673
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:32,139
to our heart's content.

674
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:36,069
- Here. - Come now.

675
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,839
Here, another cup for you.

676
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:41,779
Here.

677
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,119
Where is the Jeon?

678
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:47,449
And the meat Jeon?

679
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:50,488
- Cut more grass over there. - Understood.

680
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:51,960
Place the fish here.

681
00:44:57,860 --> 00:44:59,029
Where is your mother?

682
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,920
- Mother. - Stay seated.

683
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:27,889
There is still some time left.

684
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:32,929
But the ground is dirty.

685
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,310
It is not easy, is it?

686
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,350
Living without a husband.

687
00:45:51,779 --> 00:45:54,850
Born weak, my second son had a rough time.

688
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:57,159
But he laughed a lot after meeting you.

689
00:46:04,259 --> 00:46:07,170
I am sure I laughed a lot more than him.

690
00:46:10,069 --> 00:46:11,540
It was too short, was it not?

691
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:22,009
Longer years do not mean greater love.

692
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,889
Though it was short, I received ample love from my husband.

693
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,020
He gave me enough energy to live happily for the rest of my life.

694
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,460
Thank you.

695
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
For loving In Guk...

696
00:46:41,029 --> 00:46:42,900
and raising Geun Seok well.

697
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,210
Staying at home might be stifling right now.

698
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:50,310
But once Geun Seok grows up and gets married,

699
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,610
you will be the lady of our household.

700
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:14,069
Oh, right. Do you remember the lady who gave you some advice?

701
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:15,900
Of course, I do.

702
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,469
I cannot seem to forget her.

703
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:22,369
Do you know which family she is from?

704
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:25,879
Before their feelings deepen,

705
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,210
do not tell the old bachelors that they are the old ladies.

706
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:30,919
The false rumours will give them a preconception.

707
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,849
Were you not looking for a woman...

708
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:35,988
who will love you regardless of your wealth and family?

709
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,819
So why ask which family she is from?

710
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:45,659
I assure you that I am not picky about the lady's family.

711
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,630
Why? Because I am wealthy.

712
00:47:51,639 --> 00:47:53,939
Buying affection with love...

713
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,939
is very unromantic.

714
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,138
Now, now.

715
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:59,580
Are you still going on about being romantic?

716
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:02,679
How about thinking of it this way?

717
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:06,618
The most romantic thing you can gain with money...

718
00:48:06,619 --> 00:48:09,150
is the lady's heart.

719
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:18,258
Right. You two should continue with your conversation.

720
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:20,969
Thank you very much for your wise words.

721
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:34,749
On that day, I thought you would not come...

722
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,350
to this old-bachelor-no-more drinking party.

723
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:43,150
What do you think about her?

724
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:47,389
I am happy with whoever accepts my circumstances.

725
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,429
You must not take back your word that...

726
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,429
you will be happy with anyone. It is a promise.

727
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,679
What are you doing here?

728
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,449
I was looking for you high and low.

729
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:12,580
Oh, I see.

730
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,649
Grilled ricefish is a delicacy. I wanted to serve it to everyone.

731
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:18,388
Forget about the grilled ricefish.

732
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:19,488
Take a look at this.

733
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:21,560
I have found a suitable lady for you.

734
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,799
You really found one?

735
00:49:28,929 --> 00:49:31,739
My goodness. Would such a beautiful lady...

736
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,009
like me?

737
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:38,509
Did I give you the first daughter?

738
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:42,850
No, it is the third daughter.

739
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:48,650
I guess Lady Yeoju is a real Agent of Love.

740
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:58,630
I am sure she has feelings for that widower.

741
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,770
She knew nothing yet spouted such nonsense. And now, it bugs me.

742
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:08,639
Forget it. I know my own feelings the best.

743
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:10,540
How would Gae Dong know?

744
00:50:11,009 --> 00:50:12,179
Lady Jung!

745
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,149
Talk of one, and they sure will appear.

746
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,549
Lady Jung. Here.

747
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,020
I was told it was urgent.

748
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,330
What is going on?

749
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:33,099
I have to go out right now.

750
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,130
"Right now?"

751
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,239
If anyone asks, tell them I have gone to buy something.

752
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,739
What? Lady Jung!

753
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,670
Good grief.

754
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,739
You are busted.

755
00:50:50,049 --> 00:50:51,279
She walks so fast.

756
00:50:57,259 --> 00:50:58,619
Gosh, get out of my way!

757
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:00,830
What?

758
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:04,000
Where did she go?

759
00:51:13,739 --> 00:51:15,069
Where did she go?

760
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:23,750
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

761
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,690
Wait. Why are you not waiting outside?

762
00:51:30,219 --> 00:51:31,889
I told him to join us.

763
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,359
It seems like he is handling the work.

764
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,630
He should be here so there are no misunderstandings.

765
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:40,830
I think it is best that we three have the meeting together.

766
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:44,400
But still...

767
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:50,469
The contract stated you were to follow my matchmaking plan.

768
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:51,739
You do remember, yes?

769
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,679
I will be dead silent over at that corner.

770
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:00,690
What is the serious structural problem you wrote in the letter?

771
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:05,319
You see...

772
00:52:14,299 --> 00:52:15,330
Hold on.

773
00:52:16,069 --> 00:52:18,699
This will not do. I am getting stressed out.

774
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:22,440
Let us clear up the misunderstanding before we talk about work.

775
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:30,650
I asked what kind of lady would be a good fit for me that day...

776
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,049
because of some complex situation.

777
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:37,089
I will explain everything later on.

778
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:39,689
So, do not think I am a weird person.

779
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:41,529
I did not get any wrong ideas.

780
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,830
Stop lying.

781
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:46,758
If you did not, why are you keeping your distance?

782
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:49,999
Back at Mount Mokmyeok, you told me to stay three steps away from you.

783
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,100
Did you forget?

784
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:54,269
You and I are from different social classes.

785
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,509
Keep a distance of at least three steps.

786
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:02,679
Since when did you start doing as I asked?

787
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:05,619
Goodness, you are being plain obvious.

788
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,889
How embarrassing. Will you be able to face Lady Yeoju now?

789
00:53:09,049 --> 00:53:10,889
Go ahead and tell me the problem.

790
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:12,319
I am quite busy.

791
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,560
I was just about to tell you, all right?

792
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:17,428
Like your plan, I gathered the bachelor candidates...

793
00:53:17,429 --> 00:53:19,500
for drinks that were on me and gave them a big push.

794
00:53:21,929 --> 00:53:24,199
Everything was going well in the beginning.

795
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,400
- Gosh. - Here.

796
00:53:27,299 --> 00:53:28,809
Just a bit more.

797
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:30,270
Great. Thank you.

798
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:31,940
Lord Inspector.

799
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:34,580
I am very grateful.

800
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:36,610
In my situation,

801
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:39,219
anyone but the old ladies will be more than...

802
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,889
who I deserve.

803
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:44,489
Good grief, who would want to get married to the old ladies?

804
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,818
I heard you came from the countryside...

805
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:48,528
far from here, Scholar Kim.

806
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:49,860
Do you still know of the old ladies?

807
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,860
Rumours are very important.

808
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:54,529
In particular, the first daughter,

809
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:56,199
possessed by an unmarried ghost,

810
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,900
lures men into her house every night, no?

811
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,508
Rumour has it that even the Minister of Defence became a victim.

812
00:54:03,509 --> 00:54:04,638
It is true.

813
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:06,439
What are you saying is true?

814
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,379
The whole nation knows...

815
00:54:08,380 --> 00:54:10,719
the Minister of Defence is a womaniser.

816
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,049
You see...

817
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,088
As the teacher of the Minister of Defence's son,

818
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:17,319
here is what I heard.

819
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:20,289
The first daughter of the old ladies...

820
00:54:20,290 --> 00:54:22,230
came on to the Minister of Defence first.

821
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,029
But when he did not give her enough money,

822
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:27,000
she filed a petitioner's drum as revenge.

823
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,199
With how the first daughter is,

824
00:54:29,799 --> 00:54:32,468
anyone can guess how the younger two are.

825
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,839
Did you witness it yourself?

826
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:36,869
When she hit on the Minister of Defence first.

827
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,480
What...

828
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,580
One does not have to see it to know.

829
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:46,318
Because rumour spread that the dead Lee Cho Ok,

830
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,289
the first daughter's friend, was promiscuous and lustful,

831
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:51,359
she did not get any matches despite her old age.

832
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,859
Too embarrassed,

833
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:55,060
she threw herself into the water.

834
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,460
Like attracts like.

835
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,130
Birds of a feather flock together.

836
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,529
They say rumours travel fast.

837
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:05,770
Be careful of what you say about uncertain things.

838
00:55:12,139 --> 00:55:13,379
Even in my point of view,

839
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:16,610
that seems like a false rumour.

840
00:55:17,449 --> 00:55:19,549
It could be a false rumour.

841
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,419
But parents do not care if the rumour is true or false.

842
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:26,920
Even if my parents gave up on me,

843
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:29,830
they would disown me if I declared to marry...

844
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,630
one of the old ladies.

845
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,210
You should have seen the old bachelors' determined faces.

846
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,039
We cannot feign ignorance...

847
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,279
and introduce them to the three daughters.

848
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,008
Especially...

849
00:55:47,009 --> 00:55:49,279
Yes, this man.

850
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:52,350
Bachelor 15.

851
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,219
Despite running a village school, he spreads false rumours.

852
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:58,759
Even if the first daughter likes him,

853
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,589
I will oppose him.

854
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:04,730
The indecent rumour must have been a bigger obstacle than expected.

855
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:05,960
What was that?

856
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:07,869
"Must have been a bigger obstacle?"

857
00:56:08,529 --> 00:56:10,600
That was an irresponsible remark.

858
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,899
You talked like the first eye contact...

859
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,399
would solve things smoothly.

860
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,670
There are exceptions in everything in this world.

861
00:56:16,509 --> 00:56:18,238
- Good grief. - With what has happened,

862
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:20,810
we should prove Lady Ha Na's rumour wrong.

863
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:22,650
And how will we do it?

864
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,749
I have an excellent plan.

865
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,949
You need to find the murderer who killed Lady Cho Ok.

866
00:56:29,049 --> 00:56:30,889
Why bring her death up all of a sudden?

867
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,859
Lady Ha Na's indecent rumour started...

868
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,529
with being possessed by Lady Cho Ok's ghost.

869
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,290
Excuse me?

870
00:56:38,029 --> 00:56:40,360
Lady Cho Ok took her own life.

871
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,869
So what murderer?

872
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,500
That is what the foolish government officials say.

873
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,469
Find out the truth behind Lady Cho Ok's death,

874
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,408
and we will be able to get rid of...

875
00:56:50,409 --> 00:56:52,179
Lady Ha Na's indecent rumour for good.

876
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:59,750
The Agent of Love's excellent plan never goes wrong.

877
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,440
You want me to tell you the murderer?

878
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:21,869
Were you not privately investing in Lee Cho Ok's case?

879
00:57:30,549 --> 00:57:32,618
You know who the murderer is,

880
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:33,980
and yet, you are covering it up.

881
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,519
I am sure you know...

882
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,889
what a severe crime protecting a murderer is.

883
00:57:38,119 --> 00:57:40,119
If I inform you who the murderer is,

884
00:57:41,589 --> 00:57:43,389
are you confident you can punish them?

885
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,730
Why should I do that?

886
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:48,730
You should return.

887
00:57:49,699 --> 00:57:52,699
It is not something I can personally tell you to satisfy your curiosity.

888
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,339
It is not me,

889
00:57:55,839 --> 00:57:58,838
but there is someone who can punish the murderer alone...

890
00:57:58,839 --> 00:58:01,549
and cause no harm to anyone else once they know the truth.

891
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:06,980
Who is that?

892
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,889
Come along with me, and you will know.

893
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:15,960
(Success)

894
00:58:17,659 --> 00:58:18,730
Good grief.

895
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,170
Keep walking forth.

896
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,730
Mind your head.

897
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:24,130
Goodness.

898
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:35,880
Why are you here?

899
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,580
I am a matchmaker.

900
00:58:49,489 --> 00:58:52,900
I am here for my and my sisters' marriage.

901
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,298
Do not misunderstand.

902
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:56,170
For marriage?

903
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,009
I am glad he did not recognize me.

904
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,210
But it is starting to make me unhappy.

905
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,080
Why did you bring the third here?

906
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:16,420
I must ask you why you brought the lieutenant here.

907
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:19,659
He knows the full story and the murderer of Lee Cho Ok's case.

908
00:59:20,119 --> 00:59:21,159
My brother...

909
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,230
No. The lieutenant does?

910
00:59:29,230 --> 00:59:31,239
Gosh, I feel better now.

911
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:37,940
Did you tell Lord Gyeongunjae...

912
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:40,739
that you could punish Lee Cho Ok's murderer?

913
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,150
Yes, it was me.

914
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:48,250
I have a question.

915
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,690
Are you Lord Gyeongunjae?

916
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:52,690
Does that mean...

917
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,960
you are the famous Man of Anger?

918
00:59:58,699 --> 00:59:59,699
Well...

919
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,170
Yes, I do reside in Gyeongunjae.

920
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:06,000
I was dying to meet you, but to think we were this close.

921
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,369
You are not as good-looking as the rumours,

922
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,509
but you are a lot more sane than I imagined.

923
01:00:17,449 --> 01:00:19,619
Because of this sporadic chest pain,

924
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,520
I cannot even get angry.

925
01:00:23,750 --> 01:00:24,859
Are you all right?

926
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:25,960
Three steps.

927
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:27,690
Get away from me.

928
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,560
Do not let it bother you.

929
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,860
Now that everyone has introduced themselves,

930
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:33,900
tell us the plan.

931
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,170
Look at him bearing a grudge.

932
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,409
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

933
01:00:47,850 --> 01:00:50,079
Thank you for participating in the matchmaking operation...

934
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,619
for Erudite Maeng's daughters.

935
01:00:52,520 --> 01:00:54,020
Our job this time...

936
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:57,089
is to get rid of Lady Ha Na's false rumour.

937
01:00:57,889 --> 01:00:58,989
I have a question.

938
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:03,630
Is Bachelor 23 next to my portrait...

939
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,360
my marriage partner?

940
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,469
That is correct. You will meet him at the May Festival.

941
01:01:08,830 --> 01:01:11,500
He is a gentle Hanyang scholar. You will like him.

942
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,540
Stop going off-topic.

943
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:17,069
Tell us what we must do at once.

944
01:01:18,710 --> 01:01:22,110
They say rumours stop rumours.

945
01:01:22,750 --> 01:01:24,919
Starting now, we will inform many of the truth,

946
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,819
change the false rumour into a moving story,

947
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,690
and punish the atrocious murderer.

948
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,819
Who would believe the words of a peddler?

949
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,129
The murderer has great power.

950
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:37,329
You will be sentenced to death for false accusation.

951
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:38,830
(The accuser gets punished for defamation.)

952
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:42,029
Lady Yeoju, going that far is a bit...

953
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:43,629
I will not do it.

954
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:45,900
The one who will spread the truth is this person.

955
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:50,739
Me?

956
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,639
Go and inform the government office?

957
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,080
This is different from what I have heard.

958
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:01,388
You said only the murderer will get punished.

959
01:02:01,389 --> 01:02:04,218
How could you have Lady Sam Soon do such a dangerous job?

960
01:02:04,219 --> 01:02:05,920
You see...

961
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,690
Do...

962
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:09,830
Do not yell.

963
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,960
If you do...

964
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:16,369
my...

965
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:19,139
my chest...

966
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,009
My lord!

967
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,049
Pull yourself together!

968
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,569
(The Matchmakers)

969
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,218
You must go to the Royal Court today.

970
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:15,359
I am always open when it comes to that.

971
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:16,389
Right, you are.

972
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,500
He's so engrossed in this woman.

973
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,230
By the way...

974
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:23,170
The left state councillor has no idea.

975
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:24,500
They ran away!

976
01:03:24,770 --> 01:03:27,199
The crown prince was kidnapped from the private house?

977
01:03:27,639 --> 01:03:30,239
I will turn Lady Ha Na's false rumour into a moving story.

978
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:31,508
How?

979
01:03:31,509 --> 01:03:33,179
The murderer in this novel...

980
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:34,678
Who?

981
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,210
Do you even know what you are saying?

982
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:38,679
I know how to punish the Minister of Defence.

983
01:03:38,819 --> 01:03:41,718
Will it not be dangerous for Lady Yeoju as well?

984
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:44,049
I will kill you for sure this time.

985
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,969
