1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:12,530

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,360

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,360

4
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:45,900

5
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,790

Making a living for myself is so convenient.

6
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,570

Why would I get married to serve and feed a husband, too?

7
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,010
Men are all about the same. What is the use of an ideal type?

8
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:16,510
Oh, right!

9
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:22,530
Since I was told I do not have to marry someone I do not want...

10
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,200
My ideal type is...

11
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,770
someone who can earn a living for himself with his own hands.

12
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,350

Mencius once said

13
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,640

farming is the great basis of life for humanity.

14
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,860
It is not a shame for a noble to farm.

15
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,240
My ideal type?

16
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,400
Even if I tell you,

17
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,670
what would be the use of my feelings?

18
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,370

19
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,380
Don't get nervous.

20
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,140
My brother cannot even recognize me before and after makeup.

21
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,030
Yes...

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,010
What do I do?

23
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,540
You!

24
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,770
What is this outfit?

25
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,810
Do you... recognize me?

26
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,890
How could I not?

27
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,460
I asked why you are dressed like this.

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,900
I disguised myself as a Bukchon daughter-in-law to make my job easier.

29
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:34,350
Even so, how can a merchant pretend to be a noble madam? I will—

30
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,190
Are you going to report me?

31
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,040
Seriously.

32
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,760
It is quite miserable because this job is far too different from my conviction.

33
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,900
Miserable is a bit too much.

34
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,590
Now that I look at you, you took the thick makeup off your face...

35
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,950
Gosh! Do not say anything.

36
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,990
I know very well my face without makeup and a beauty mark is bland.

37
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,310
I am glad you know,

38
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,960
but it is not too bad to look at.

39
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,860
I prefer the way you look now.

40
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,780
Sorry?

41
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,450
Forget it. Hurry up and explain now.

42
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,840
Why is Temple Seonhwa a special place?

43
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,260
Where are the brand new old bachelors you mentioned?

44
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,930
Since you are here, I will tell you everything, starting with Temple Seonhwa's tower circling of love.

45
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,800
Whoa, t-this is...

46
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,890
The inner circle is made up of madams and their children, who have clear goals.

47
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:27,150
It is the final procedure of checking if the brides and grooms are healthy.

48
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,680
The one next to the madam with a peony skirt is Young Master Seok Ho.

49
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,870
 Some enthusiastic madams will check the brides or grooms by disguising themselves as peddlers.

50
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,350
 But it is cumbersome, so they prefer Temple Seonhwa's tower circling.

51
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:51,090
It is surprising that there is such an unspoken rule to tower circling.

52
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:54,480
It is more surprising that someone from Hanyang does not know about it.

53
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,130
My family went to Temple Yongmun.

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,510
How unfortunate.

55
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,890
Now, we will move to my favorite heart-fluttering section.

56
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,430
H-Heart-fluttering section?

57
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,650
W-Wait for—

58
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,720
It is where young people who are not yet engaged gather.

59
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:28,180
This is also the section where most first-sights happen.

60
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,020
Whoa.

61
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,550
 Are you feeling ill?

62
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,460
I sometimes get unprovoked palpitations when I am in a crowd.

63
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,970
Sorry?

64
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,220
That was surely the language of Joseon, but why can't I understand what you said?

65
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:56,020
It means my heart sometimes races when there are many people, causing chest pain.

66
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,490
It calms down if I look away from people,

67
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,020
so just stand there covered for a moment.

68
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,700
It is not some kind of a life-threatening disease. Right?

69
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:11,350
Modern-day medicine does not know the cause, but it is not life-threatening.

70
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,220
Gosh, it is getting a bit better now.

71
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,790
One moment, please.

72
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,020
I will make way, so just follow me closely from behind, looking at only me.

73
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,200
Simply said, make me your shield and don't look at other people.

74
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
Your chest should not hurt anymore, then. Right?

75
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,140
Sure.

76
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,850
All right.

77
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,150
This way.

78
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:05,990
Aren't we getting away from the old bachelors if we go this way?

79
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:08,180
There aren't any old bachelors here.

80
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:11,280
Old bachelors gather somewhere else.

81
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:24,830
This is it. The place where old bachelors gather.

82
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:29,670
Among matchmakers, it is called the Fence of Darkness.

83
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,130
What do you mean there are people there?

84
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:34,870
Wait! Will you be okay?

85
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,950
A lot of old bachelors will be there as well.

86
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,960
I cannot be any better, perhaps because I cannot see them.

87
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,640
In that case, take a few more steps and inspect.

88
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:08,530
W-Whoa, is your chest in pain again?

89
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:10,830
Do not make a scene unnecessarily!

90
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,840
Being around people does not mean I will be in pain, so do not treat me like a patient.

91
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,210
Yes, but tell me if it hurts again.

92
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,200
I will become your shield.

93
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,840
Okay, sure.

94
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,010
B-By the way, what are those things in the darkness?

95
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:34,250
They are empty souls who cannot even join the tower circling.

96
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,260
They are old bachelors who came to Temple Seonhwa with vague hope.

97
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:00,060
Once you go inside, you can see for sure.

98
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,380
Hurry up now.

99
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:17,410
- My goodness. 
 - You are way too slow.

100
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,120
Why do you play janggi like this? 
  (Korean chess)

101
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,500
Hear me out. Isn't the one in the jade skirt over there quite pretty?

102
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,970
She's too tall for my liking.

103
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:27,780
I mean, it's not like I was head over heels for her.

104
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,600
Hear this out. If Left State Minister's only daughter and Great Merchant...

105
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,300
- Scholar Song. 
 - Yes, Scholar Song's oldest daughter.

106
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:38,980
If both of them proposed to you at the same time, who would you choose?

107
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,910
W-Wait, give me some time.

108
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,550
It is not easy.

109
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,300
Why are you conflicted about such things?

110
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:53,240
They still have not stabilized Bukchon's home prices? How frustrating.

111
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,200
I do not think there is anyone who can stabilize Bukchon's home prices.

112
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,420
Please take back just one move.

113
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,010
I missed it because I was too busy talking.

114
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,140
They say what is done is done.

115
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,520
This lamp is what you need. Right?

116
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,190
Well...

117
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,440
Yes, I do need it.

118
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:52,630
I would like you to interview and record all the scholars by the fence.

119
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:56,970
I will make it so the ladies will come here after one hour as we planned.

120
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,020
Sure, I got it.

121
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,410
Is it because it's Buddha's Birthday?

122
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,120
My makeup is looking better.

123
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,000
 But it is not too bad to look at.

124
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,120
 I prefer the way you look now.

125
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:46,930
He was the first one to recognize me without my makeup.

126
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:15,090
Sir, please sit here.

127
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,470

I believe Joseon today has lost its fairness.

128
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,170
If you are not the child of a high-ranking official,

129
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:31,360
you have no chance at success or marriage.

130
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,610

131
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,390
My ideal type of a woman is someone who is pretty and young.

132
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:50,090

Houses in Hanseong have become too expensive, all the way to Mt. Mokmyeok.

133
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,980
So I could not get married.

134
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,540

My ideal type of woman is

135
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,190
someone who is pretty and young.

136
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,900

Everyone gets a house at least within the capital when getting married

137
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,090
and travel to the eight provinces once a year to refresh one's energy. Right?

138
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:12,610
My marriage was delayed looking for a woman who would agree to those terms.

139
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,260
My ideal type of woman is...

140
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,840
- someone who is young— 
 - Someone who is young and pretty. Right?

141
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:22,170
Whoa, how did you know?

142
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,600
I am not fazed by such words anymore.

143
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,420
Oh Bong!

144
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:31,020
Captain Jeong Soon Goo of Hanseongbu is the one who opened the door to Sinmungo.

145
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,530
- Are you sure? 
 - Yes.

146
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,390
Go now.

147
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:44,110
My goodness. Sister, you need to manage your in-laws.

148
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:50,130
I found out the one who opened the door to Sinmungo is a son of your in-laws.

149
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,540
Why would he do that?

150
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,670
That is my question.

151
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,440
He does not even know who made it possible for him to become a captain.

152
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,880
I will talk some sense into—

153
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,090
I will look into it so you can sit still.

154
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,710
Yes.

155
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:10,720
Oh, that's right. I saw Prince Gyeongwoonjae on the way here.

156
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,060
Prince Gyeongwoonjae came here?

157
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,150
Yes.

158
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,550
I heard he is setting up Maeng Ha Na. That must be why he is here.

159
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,830
Temple Seonhwa on Buddha's Birthday is the matchmakers' favorite place.

160
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,450
What do you mean Prince Gyeongwoonjae is setting people up?

161
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:35,640

I heard Temple Seonhwa is the most beautiful in the nation, so I came from far away.

162
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:43,060
If I am looking for a lady who will accept me for who I am instead of my family or wealth,

163
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,430
am I being too idealistic?

164
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:50,550
I would have said you were too farfetched moments ago.

165
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,940
But you sound the most normal, actually.

166
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:57,170

Everyone comes here for the same reason. Why should I be embarrassed?

167
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,360
I am actually a returnee. 
  (Slang for divorcé)

168
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:03,600
Do you not know what a returnee is?

169
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,130
Someone who married for a brief moment and came back single. A returnee.

170
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,020
However, I do not have children, so I am more or less a first-timer.

171
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,790
Do you understand?

172
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,210
I ran a big school in Myeongrun-dong for a long time,

173
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,980
so I have some farmland outside the capital.

174
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,440
I would like a young bride who is healthy, pretty,

175
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,350
and well-behaved. Do you understand?

176
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,970

Youth and beauty are fleeting.

177
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,600
It's not like men don't age.

178
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,940
You live well when you meet someone of your age.

179
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,780

180
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,330
Oh, yes.

181
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:15,530

Would there be a woman who would like a man like me?

182
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,050
There just might be one, so tell me your ideal type.

183
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,050
I just want...

184
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:29,090
a woman who can understand me, and that's all.

185
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,010
Why would I need to get interviewed?

186
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,980
All the scholars here need to be interviewed.

187
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:51,610
Are you the last one, Number 24, Scholar Yoon Boo Gyeom, who lives in Shinchon?

188
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:54,140

- That is correct. 
 - You passed...

189
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,840
the lesser exam with top scores.

190
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,930
But why are you farming instead of continuing to study for the state exam?

191
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,020
Could I be appointed even if I passed the state exam when I do not belong to neither

192
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:08,480
the Dongno Party nor the Namjang Party? Never mind.

193
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,800
Would I even be able to pass the state exam?

194
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:15,170
You only need skills to pass the state exam. Right?

195
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:19,950
Since you say such a thing, you must belong to the Dongno Party.

196
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,380

Since he is twisted by having a distorted inferiority complex,

197
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,710
no wonder he became an old bachelor!

198
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:46,860

199
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,630
Put down your lotus lamps and come closer for a second.

200
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:10,250
Pass the first gate, cover your faces with your head coverings so your faces do not show

201
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,880
and go all the way up to the Mahavira Hall.

202
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,800
 Do tower circling at the twin towers.

203
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,850
You like him, right?

204
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:26,070
He is over there.

205
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,370
The more you look, the more charming she is.

206
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,600
 Walk exactly two rounds and,

207
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,290
starting with Lady Ha Na, take 50 steps to the left,

208
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:40,340
until you are under the tree with the fish lamp.

209
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,270
From there, you will see the Darkness Horizon I told you about.

210
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,190

Starting with Lady Ha Na, start walking past the Darkness Horizon and

211
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,970
perform the first-sight technique in the middle.

212
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,390
I will be going first, then.

213
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,650
You just need to do as we practiced.

214
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:22,830
Shall we do a cheer and start?

215
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,100
Gosh, what is the use?

216
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:27,010
It is childish.

217
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,000
I love the cheer.

218
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,260
Let us find a good fate and live happily.

219
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,910
- Hurray! 
 - Hurray! 
  (Sounds like abbreviation of "Let Us Find Good Fate and Live Happily")

220
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:46,430
Hurray!

221
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,160
Let us go.

222
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,930
Are you making it obvious you belong to the Namjang Party?

223
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:07,050
What are you saying after ruining a perfectly fine game?

224
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,950
 You clearly know I belong to the Dongno Party.

225
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:14,070
 But you ticked me off, saying Dongno Party is to blame for the inflation in Hanyang!

226
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,840
 Stop making excuses.

227
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,790
 - You knew you would lose, so you...  
 - What's the vibe over there?

228
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:20,270
 You should know to be ashamed!

229
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:22,120
Don't even get me started.

230
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,540
They broke into a fight while playing Go.

231
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,890
 You should know to be ashamed!

232
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:28,160
 - And you call yourself— 
 - Let's settle this with a fight!

233
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,140
 A fight? You think I would be scared? Come here.

234
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,230
 - Bring it on. 
 - Come on!

235
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,590
I really dislike old bachelors.

236
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,310
 - Go ahead, take a shot! 
 - You go ahead!

237
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,340
The ladies will be passing by soon.

238
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,290
 - Hey! 
 - Who do you think you are?

239
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,030
 I will let you swing first!

240
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,850
Huh?

241
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:47,340
Gosh, it's all over!

242
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,390
It is the song of love with a daegeum! 
  (Korean large bamboo flute)

243
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:39,640
Daegeum song?

244
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,960
What an annoying daegeum sound.

245
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,470
Do you dislike this sound of daegeum, Aunt?

246
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:53,960
I love it so much.

247
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,350
It is because it is too sweet to my ears.

248
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,360
You are annoyed when it is sweet to your ears?

249
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:04,190
It would have been great if he came with me today.

250
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:09,430
I will be in the kitchen, so please look after Geun Seok.

251
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,940
Yes.

252
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,640
Goodness.

253
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,560
She has her reasons.

254
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,560
 I cannot be too conspicuous because this marriage is to be done in secret.

255
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:39,610
 But the Left State Minister's daughter will be circling the towers with her 12-year-old nephew.

256
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,720
 So, you should be able to recognize her right away.

257
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,750
How odd.

258
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,740
Why is she not there?

259
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,850
Mother, who are you looking for?

260
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:59,020
I am happy I got to circle the towers with you.

261
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,960
Yes, I am happy as well.

262
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,230
My Lady.

263
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:04,450
W-What did you do just now?

264
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:08,110
Lady Ha Na's looks are enough to make all the old bachelors move.

265
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:12,160
So, letting her make the choice makes it easier to create a relationship at times like this.

266
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:17,690
 Even among Ssangyeonsulsa, those born more powerful than others

267
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,890
 would end up matching people without even realizing it.

268
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:09,460
It seemed too early to throw the stone in this game.

269
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,280
A heavenly maiden...

270
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,040
H-Hey—

271
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,070
Why are you playing the drum?

272
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,880
Your heart races when you see someone you like.

273
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,840
It also races when you hear drumbeats.

274
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,420
It is to confuse old bachelors into thinking their hearts are racing from seeing Lady Du Ri.

275
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,880
Wait! That would be fraud.

276
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,980
Rather than fraud, please call it my technique of amplifying the heart flutter.

277
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:19,640
We need an old bachelor who will take the reigns for Lady Du Ri, who is not cooperative with marriage.

278
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,270
This is a resin extracted from spring flowers.

279
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:44,180
Apply it on your wrist, neck, and skirt hem before walking.

280
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,130
From flowers?

281
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,270
Hurray!

282
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,730
W-Wait! Why is that lamp placed there?

283
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:13,000
Unfortunately, most old bachelors only focus on looks.

284
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,010
So, the flower scent will move old bachelors just like attracting bees.

285
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:19,780
And Lady Sam Soon's looks will be enhanced with the lights from the fish lamp.

286
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:24,350
Wait! That is also fraud based on optical illusion.

287
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:28,090
I think it is a matchmaking technique.

288
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,850
As I expected, you are flexible.

289
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,440
To be calling fraud a technique...

290
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,750
The future of Joseon is gravely dark.

291
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:59,880
Whoa! Lady Sam Soon is the type to sneeze from flower pollens!

292
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Gosh, this is nuts.

293
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,570
She should have told me sooner.

294
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:18,950
The youngest did not get to lock her eyes with anyone. What do we do?

295
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:22,840
I will ensure the marriage happens without a hitch, so do not worry.

296
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,000
If failing the first-sights does not affect their marriages,

297
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,400
why on Earth did we go through all this ruckus?

298
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:35,100
It is to find old bachelors whom the ladies would like.

299
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,800
Oh, no, Lady Sam Soon.

300
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:00,280
You will blow out the ground with your sighs.

301
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,130
What's this? You said you were not coming.

302
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:11,760
I was passing by and decided to stop by.

303
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,210
Liar. How can you be just passing by Temple Seonhwa?

304
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,590
You came to see me.

305
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:25,170
It's a trotting horse lamp this year instead of the turtle lamp, huh?

306
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,270
It is pretty.

307
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,180
Oh, you should take a shot, too, Orabeoni.

308
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,260
This liquor is a delicious one.

309
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,610
Who would ever take a virgin who loves alcohol this much?

310
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:44,250
Do not worry.

311
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:49,040
I got a marriage offer from a handsome young master who goes to Sunkyungkwan.

312
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,640
How great.

313
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,160
Our little girl is getting married, so I should share a toast with you.

314
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,920
O-Oh, yes.

315
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,870
Gosh!

316
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:26,430
Stop looking back. Your neck is about to get twisted.

317
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:31,910
I am sure you have no regrets since many scholars stood up.

318
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:36,370
Youngest, go ask Yeojudaek whether it is okay or not if you are that worried.

319
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,460
Can I really do that?

320
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,900
Du Ri, go with her.

321
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,500
- I need to give Mother her medicine. 
 - Gosh, it's such a hassle.

322
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,700
Let's go, please, Sister!

323
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:54,060
So, was there a man you found appealing?

324
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,520
I was so busy sneezing that I did not get to see anyone.

325
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,500
I am fine with any scholar who says he likes me.

326
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,450
Any? Do you like men that much?

327
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,540
I know...

328
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,810
Why can I not be honorable like the other unnis when it comes to men,

329
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,880
and lewdly like men for no reason?

330
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,990
Hey, why are you running away?

331
00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:33,800
Gosh, that idiot.

332
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,200
Whoa!

333
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,800
Whoa?

334
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:01,540
You scared me.

335
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:02,650
Where did you come from?

336
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:05,480
Oh, I was also taken aback.

337
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,510
To think I would meet you again at a place like this.

338
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,600
It is nice.

339
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,470
Mind your own business and go your own way.

340
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,990
I think you have twisted your ankle again, so I cannot just pass by.

341
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,620
Please excuse me...

342
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,690
for a moment.

343
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:32,180
Hey! Let me down!

344
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,250
Can't believe he's chasing me even on Buddha's Birthday...

345
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,630
That officer is too diligent!

346
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,960
Wait...

347
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:53,680
Is he chasing me so hard because it is me?

348
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:36,610
 I will spare your life if you give me the signed letter you have.

349
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,380
 You were a woman, as I thought.

350
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,530
 The soldier who took the signed letter from her arms,

351
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:42,680
 and the assassin who got the signed letter taken from her,

352
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:46,330
 stood watching each other as if time stopped.

353
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:50,500
 They did not know then that was

354
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,090
 the start of their long and difficult romance.

355
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:57,730
It is such a good start.

356
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,640
So you were Hwa Rok, after all, Maiden.

357
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,200
I will not arrest you,

358
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,690
so do not worry.

359
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,480
Tell me what you want to say if you are not arresting me.

360
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,070
Stop writing erotica novels immediately.

361
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:03,830
The reason Hanseongbu is chasing Hwa Rok is not merely for disturbing society.

362
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:06,710
It is for causing the deceased Lee Cho Ok's death by violating the law.

363
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,810
Causing her death by violating the law?

364
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:11,590
If you get caught, you could be executed.

365
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,410
So, if you do not want to die an unfair death—

366
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:17,810
I understand.

367
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,210
You have to be careful because an injured ankle can easily get twisted again.

368
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:43,540
It will get better with some time, so please rest up here before you go.

369
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,840
I should have gone with Sam Soon...

370
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,670
Pardon? I did not hear what you said.

371
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:57,180
I was not speaking to you.

372
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,850
Also, do you think I would be grateful to you if you did this?

373
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:07,670
My father said I should express my apology, gratitude, and love

374
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:10,760
if I want to live without regrets.

375
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:18,350
You have a good father.

376
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,520
You do that.

377
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,520
There is something I have been curious about.

378
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,150
How old are you that you constantly speak down to me?

379
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,350
Twenty-three. What about you?

380
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,760
I am somewhat similar in age.

381
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,500
Similar, my foot.

382
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,670
You look younger than my youngest sister.

383
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:12,270
Do you want to circle the tower with me if you have not done so?

384
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:17,660
I already did.

385
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,930
You already did, I see...

386
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:38,950
Wow, I did not know there was such a good place like this in Temple Seonhwa.

387
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,360
What a beautiful view.

388
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,510
I did not get to tell you this yet.

389
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:48,460
I really enjoyed your daegeum performance.

390
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,980
I tend to get really good at something if I start it.

391
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:56,870
But are things going well with the third daughter?

392
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:03,390
There is a rice cake merchant I know on the market street.

393
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:08,340
He makes injeolmi (rice cake varieties), steamed rice cake, and mugwort pounded rice cake.

394
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:12,050
But one day, he said steamed rice cakes were not selling as much.

395
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,660
It is not like the steamed rice cakes are not tasty.

396
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:22,320
But I think it is not the steamed rice cakes' fault.

397
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,090
You are saying the situation earlier was not ideal for the third daughter to find a partner.

398
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:31,810
As expected, your ability to understand is top-notch as well.

399
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:35,950
I mean, stop talking about things that all of Joseon knows.

400
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:38,070
Just take this.

401
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:43,460
This is the latest item from the Ming Dynasty. Do you know what it is?

402
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,460
- It is— 
 - Is it not a sky lantern?

403
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:49,100
- It is. 
 - I launched one with my orabeoni once in Pyeongyang.

404
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,890
You keep talking about your orabeoni.

405
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:54,210
What does your orabeoni do for a living anyway?

406
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,390
While we are on the topic,

407
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,390
how old are you?

408
00:42:59,390 --> 00:43:04,020
You look much younger than me, and yet you speak brashly to me.

409
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,860
All right.

410
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,280
Gosh! I should have made a wish!

411
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,110
You are not a child. Why make a wish?

412
00:43:14,110 --> 00:43:17,800
Here. You can have this one.

413
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,070
Is that really okay?

414
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:48,720
Oh, right.

415
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:56,610
Making a wish, goodness.

416
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,320
Let me ask you.

417
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,830
What wish did you make?

418
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:10,120
My orabeoni said your wish will not come true if you tell someone.

419
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:13,480
Again, again, with your orabeoni talk.

420
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,620
 Is this...

421
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,530
 Is this not the premonitory behavior before a kiss that I read in the erotica novels?

422
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:22,180
Why already...

423
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:28,590
Sir, I will see you at the merchants' inn in three days.

424
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,800
Goodbye.

425
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:41,670
She cannot just leave...

426
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:45,180
after making a situation like this!

427
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,770
I...

428
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:19,330
No... No.

429
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,610
Gosh, what do I do!

430
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,760

431
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:36,590
Why is my granddaughter-in-law not here?

432
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,210
It appears she is outside with Geun Seok.

433
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,640
I saw on the way that Geun Seok was with a servant.

434
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,880
Hyungnim, you need to watch your widowed daughter-in-law.

435
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,580
Shall I go outside and look for her?

436
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:10,190
Gosh, you scared me!

437
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:12,910
Aunt, quietly!

438
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:18,430
Why were you bowing in the back?

439
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,030
Because you were not here, Mother...

440
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:27,200
Do not forget that you are now a part of the Jo family.

441
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,200
Yes, Mother.

442
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,230
Where did you come from?

443
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,410
You were definitely not here before.

444
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,500
You did not even look carefully, Aunt.

445
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,630
Where did you pop up from, Ye Jin?

446
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:42,730
Sister-in-law insisted on doing a thousand bows,

447
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:46,860
so I was bowing here all day and missed out on the lantern festival.

448
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,310
Oh! It is Uncle!

449
00:48:15,110 --> 00:48:17,070
Orabeoni!

450
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,040
Have you been well?

451
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,360
Thanks to you, we are doing well.

452
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:34,070
Your father is doing well. Right?

453
00:48:34,070 --> 00:48:37,410
Thanks to you, he is well.

454
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:41,870
Oh, when there was the issue with Sinmungo,

455
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:45,900
I heard you were the one who opened the door to Sinmungo.

456
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:48,000
Is that true?

457
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:52,510
 Why are you here at this hour?

458
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:55,290
 There is a lady who has been treated unjustly.

459
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,150
 Could you open the door to Sinmungo?

460
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:01,590
Oh, Mother, that was—

461
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,870
I did so because of His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

462
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,270
Prince Gyeongwoonjae?

463
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:12,350
If that was discourteous of me, I apologize.

464
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:16,160
What do you mean, discourteous? Not at all.

465
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:20,630
Thanks to you, the Defense Minister's unfair scandal disappeared.

466
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:24,540
Did you come to see Geun Seok's mother?

467
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,350
Geun Seok.

468
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:30,020
Geun Seok's mother, leave Geun Seok with me,

469
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,950
and catch up with your orabeoni before you come home.

470
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:35,580
- You do not need to— 
 - Thank you...

471
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:38,560
Mother.

472
00:49:55,510 --> 00:49:59,010
What is Prince Gyeongwoonjae up to?

473
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,950
I would handle it myself. Why did you tell a lie that would be found out quickly!

474
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:09,810
My mother can ask Resentful Man—

475
00:50:09,810 --> 00:50:13,680
I mean, she can ask His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae directly.

476
00:50:14,450 --> 00:50:16,700
- It is not a lie. 
 - What do you mean, it is not a lie?

477
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,780
I asked you to open Sinmungo.

478
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:22,150
When things were nearly wrapped up, His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae came to me.

479
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,090
He said if anyone asks who opened Sinmungo, say that it was him.

480
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:28,990
Why would the Resentful Man do that?

481
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,900
 Why would you ask me to say yes to something you did not?

482
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:34,950
 I do not want innocent people to suffer

483
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,600
 when the Defense Minister is the despicable one.

484
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,030
 I can avoid punishment because I am a member of the royal family.

485
00:50:42,030 --> 00:50:45,520
 This is how much I care about the subordinates.

486
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:48,430
 But... um...

487
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:52,480
 how do you know Yeojudaek?

488
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:54,930
 Who is Yeojudaek?

489
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,580
 Forget it if you do not know her.

490
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,340
Though His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae is eccentric

491
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:06,930
and quite resentful, but he does not seem like a bad person.

492
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:12,090
Do the Inspector and His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae know each other?

493
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,020
That was why he did not like it when I criticized Resentful Man.

494
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:20,550
What?

495
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,980
It is nothing.

496
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,470
In any case, that is a relief.

497
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:35,910
Could you please just stay out of trouble for once?

498
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:38,560
Geez, you are taking credit for helping me out once!

499
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:41,540
I will take care of myself, so mind your own business.

500
00:51:41,540 --> 00:51:43,520
You should go home now.

501
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:45,920
Already? I do not want to!

502
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,300
You think I have many opportunities to be allowed to play like this?

503
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,570
I will play a bit more before I go home.

504
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:54,800
Are you at the age to play?

505
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,810
Hurry up and come.

506
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,840
There are two in the sky...

507
00:52:08,210 --> 00:52:11,070
Is there another person who launched sky lanterns?

508
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:13,480

509
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:15,770
Gosh, do not come here and wait where you are.

510
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:17,210
You will get your clothes dirty.

511
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:19,790
Hey, just go on ahead.

512
00:52:19,790 --> 00:52:23,720
Yeah, over there, over there. It is right in front over there.

513
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,780
Oh my goodness.

514
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:41,800
What wish did you make?

515
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:46,400
A wish will not come true if you tell someone.

516
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,230
Who said that?

517
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:51,400
Her orabeoni— gosh, hey!

518
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,720
What is the matter?

519
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:22,650
I came to talk to you because I am worried about Prince Gyeongwoonjae's actions.

520
00:53:22,650 --> 00:53:26,000
If it is about Sinmungo, I will handle it.

521
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,700
More than that,

522
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,700
I am more concerned about how he is matchmaking for Master Maeng's daughters.

523
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,250
So you heard that he is matchmaking for them.

524
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:40,900
This is not the first time that Prince Gyeongwoonjae did something weird.

525
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:46,070
Old maidens were used as an excuse to push back the Crown Prince's marriage.

526
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:50,440
Seeing how he is matchmaking for Master Maeng's daughters, who represent old maids,

527
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:56,420
I worry that he may be helping the king.

528
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:59,440
Once this insurrection is over,

529
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:04,730
the plan was to send him into exile, linking him to his brother and charging him with accepting bribes.

530
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,040
I will move up the timing.

531
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,260
How about making him...

532
00:54:11,350 --> 00:54:15,030
Geun Seok's tutor instead of sending him to exile.

533
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:20,540
Prince Gyeongwoonjae would not easily go into exile just because we charged him with a crime.

534
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,190
And he would not be able to give up on the Dongno Party.

535
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:28,410
So, I must keep him close and find out what he thinks.

536
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:31,760
That way, we will be able to decide

537
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,130
whether he will come with us,

538
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:39,750
or eliminate him rather than exile him.

539
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:01,310
 Your Excellency, it is me, Oh Bong.

540
00:55:01,310 --> 00:55:02,550

541
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:05,860
This is the list of tenant farmers based on the farmland,

542
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,640
and the letter was sent by the Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong of the Left State Minister.

543
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:14,490
The Minister's wife?

544
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:25,710
Why is she ordering me to come and go?

545
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,170
What do I do?

546
00:55:29,170 --> 00:55:31,730
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

547
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,890
You told Yeojudaek you will handle everything.

548
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,930
Why are you doing this here? It is so distracting!

549
00:55:36,930 --> 00:55:40,330
I had time, then. So, I thought I would come up with something when it happens.

550
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:43,140
What do I do? I need to pick up the wedding date letter tomorrow.

551
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,910
How about you ask that person Lee?

552
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,630
That person Lee?

553
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:55,400
The Left State Minister's daughter and the Chancellor's eldest son are getting married?

554
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,300
Of course, I will keep it a secret until their wedding!

555
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,650
I am good at keeping secrets.

556
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:09,940
No. The moment it enters that person Lee's ears, the whole city will find out.

557
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,000
That is true.

558
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,500
It would surely lead to a broken-up wedding.

559
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:15,450
Damn it...

560
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,600
How about I just put on stronger makeup

561
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,920
and say Yeojudaek's younger sister came in her place?

562
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:28,010
That is a bit...

563
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:31,370
No, even my brother cannot recognize me,

564
00:56:31,370 --> 00:56:34,030
so maybe Mother will not, either.

565
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,150
I will be going, then.

566
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,900
She is not thinking of actually going there. Right?

567
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:10,660
Wait here for a moment.

568
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,200
Madam!

569
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:18,460
Someone came in Yeojudaek's place because she got a cold. Shall I have her come in?

570
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,100
I told her to conduct it secretly, yet she sent someone else?

571
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,090
Have her come in.

572
00:57:38,090 --> 00:57:39,660
Yes, Madam.

573
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:42,590
You want me to go personally to pick up the wedding date letter?

574
00:57:42,590 --> 00:57:47,120
You did not get to check out the Left State Minister's daughter at the Temple Seonhwa.

575
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:51,370
That is true, but how could I personally go there?

576
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,020
The wives of officials sometimes disguise themselves

577
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,930
as merchants to check out their future daughter-in-law in advance.

578
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:00,950
I have heard those stories, too.

579
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:04,050
But if I go to that house, I will have to meet the Minister's wife.

580
00:58:04,050 --> 00:58:05,950
Will she not recognize me?

581
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:10,760
She probably will know right away.

582
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,110
That is why you should personally go and

583
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:16,910
check if this marriage will truly be beneficial to your family.

584
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:20,200
You kept having doubts about it, did you not?

585
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:28,570
Yeojudaek said to let you know she is sorry for not being able to come.

586
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:35,830
And the Chancellor's wife told me to give you this.

587
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:52,330
Each for you, the aunt-to-be, and Lady Ye Jin, Madam.

588
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:54,380
She said she was sending three.

589
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,800
Even for Royal Consort Sookbin?

590
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,580
She must be a very detailed person.

591
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:03,440
Mother.

592
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,980
 Your mother-in-law-to-be will be coming tomorrow.

593
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,660
You should dress as modestly as possible.

594
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:20,610
The first impression is always important.

595
00:59:20,610 --> 00:59:22,130

596
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:26,520
If you give a bad impression, your first years of marriage will be difficult.

597
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,310
Must I really do that?

598
00:59:29,310 --> 00:59:34,210
I know. Why were you not at the tower circling for Buddha's birthday?

599
00:59:38,260 --> 00:59:39,660
She is my daughter.

600
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:45,900
I heard Yeojudaek sets up people by using a man and woman's appearance.

601
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:49,200
I called you because I wondered if you do the same.

602
00:59:49,930 --> 00:59:55,280
It is well known that the Left State Minister's daughter is the top bride candidate in Hanyang.

603
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:59,090
How could a mere merchant judge her and say she is good or bad?

604
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:04,710
I heard the Chancellor's son is also very intelligent and dutiful.

605
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:08,780
The young master of that family loved to study from a young age,

606
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:13,000
and is compassionate, so he has the capacity to do great things for the nation,

607
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:17,990
but they are worried about how he is just too nice.

608
01:00:17,990 --> 01:00:23,870
If that is the case, please tell them that my bright daughter Ye Jin and his father-in-law,

609
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,750
the Left State Minister will provide great support to him.

610
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,470
Yes.

611
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,240
If it is May 25th, is that not too soon?

612
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:45,460
The marriage partner is set. There is no need to delay it.

613
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:50,810
I will ask Sam Wol's mother to take care of the little details,

614
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:52,740
so you should take care of Ye Jin,

615
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,200
and take care not to let word get out until the wedding day.

616
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,110
Yes.

617
01:00:59,110 --> 01:01:03,970
Oh, and Geun Seok's tutor is to come soon,

618
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:07,620
so come to the annex with Geun Seok when I tell you.

619
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:09,800
Geun Seok just turned 12.

620
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:13,330
Would it not be too hard on him to have tutoring in addition to going to school?

621
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:15,910
Being 12 is not a young age.

622
01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:20,580
Geun Seok should focus on his studies now.

623
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,530
I am grateful.

624
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:41,060
But I have no experience in teaching anyone.

625
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:45,760
I will refuse the position of tutoring your grandson.

626
01:01:48,550 --> 01:01:55,020
Were you not Grand Prince Woon Hae's teacher for about half a year

627
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:56,740
before he became the Crown Prince?

628
01:01:56,740 --> 01:02:00,130
I was merely someone he could talk to back then.

629
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:05,510
All you have to do is to just tell my grandson some good things as well.

630
01:02:16,050 --> 01:02:18,600
Grandmother, it is me, Geun Seok!

631
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,730
Come on in.

632
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:42,530

633
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:57,470

634
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:05,570

635
01:03:06,360 --> 01:03:09,230
♫  Love is falling again, love is coming to me again  ♫

636
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:12,560
♫  Strange emotions fill me and confuse me  ♫

637
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,820
♫  Because of you, because of you, I've got a lot on my mind  ♫

638
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,430
  Calm down.

639
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,330
  I just need to make sure not to get on his nerves.

640
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,130
  You have arrived early, Sir.

641
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:24,980
  That infamous Resentful Man?

642
01:03:27,610 --> 01:03:31,620
  As for you, in secrecy, find out what Geun Seok's mother is doing.

643
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:34,990
  Lady Ha Na's scandal can be eliminated.

644
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:36,710
  I am sure that the wife has feelings for the widower.

645
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:38,890
  No! That is not true!

646
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,190
  It was just for a moment, but I definitely saw it.

647
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:43,690
  The gaze of love.

648
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:50,350
♫  The smile on your lips, the awkward tone, different from your usual  ♫

649
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:02,620
