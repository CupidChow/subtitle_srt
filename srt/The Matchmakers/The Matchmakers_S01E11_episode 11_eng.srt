1
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,490

2
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:24,640

3
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:47,020

4
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:00,380

5
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,560
Please be careful during the long journey.

6
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:06,720

7
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,370

8
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,110
I told Madam I heard it from a book distributor.

9
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,770
But I have known Monk So Cheon from Pyeongyang.

10
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,430
I also look after Yeojudaek and Bok Hee

11
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,530
because of Monk So Cheon's request.

12
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,450
I dared...

13
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:31,250
to have feelings for him by myself.

14
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,540
The monk does not know.

15
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,840
Did you get it?

16
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:50,510

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,440
No one until her grandfather held a high public office.

18
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Could you still call her a noble?

19
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,210
Nobility is taken away if no one takes high public office for four generations.

20
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,360
This family's youngest daughter is the third generation, so she is noble.

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,510
If you don't want it, forget it.

22
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:11,330
I have plenty of other customers.

23
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:13,750
Gosh, you are so impatient.

24
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,980
I did not say I will not buy it! It is just a bit lacking.

25
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,790
Refunds and exchanges due to a simple change of mind are not accepted.

26
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,320
By the way, who are you going to make into a noblewoman?

27
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,460
That would be...

28
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,800
a secret.

29
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,930

30
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,180
There she comes.

31
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,460
Why did she stop?

32
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,060
The scholar will take the remaining four steps.

33
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,550
Let's not be so senseless in staying here.

34
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:57,280
Let's go back and watch them from there.

35
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,430
I did not know you enjoyed riding swings.

36
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,180
Do you...

37
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,610
remember me?

38
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,530
Of course, I remember you.

39
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,620
I saved you during that game of baduk, did I not?

40
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,780
O-Oh, yes, you did.

41
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,060
Next person, get on the swing!

42
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,310
It is our turn. Let us go.

43
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,770
Yes, let us go.

44
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,730
Hurrah!

45
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:16,500
Let's go!

46
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,400
Whoa!  This is awesomely amazing!

47
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:22,100
It is "awesomely amazing"?

48
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,950
This is a phrase you use when your heart is shriveled like a salt-pickled cucumber...

49
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,370
"It's so awesome."  "It's so amazing."

50
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,230
But if it you say it like that, it doesn't sound as good.

51
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,270
It's "so awesome" coming from the mouth of a virtuous girl, I wonder who will take you as a bride?

52
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,820
You little brat, you are testing my nerve!

53
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,930
I cannot tell who the little one is.

54
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,880
Gosh, I-I was not talking about our heights.

55
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,350
Oh, I will be married at the end of this month.

56
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,040
So I think I am your senior, anyway we look at it.

57
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,200
I am also marrying, all right?

58
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,040
Wait, really?

59
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,250
What is with that face?

60
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,910
Why? Did you think I would not be able to marry?

61
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,530
You know I am making all of your wedding-favor futons. Right?

62
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:55,190
I will sew a needle into your futons if you keep getting on my bad side.

63
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,870
They say the good comes with the bad.

64
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,470
I must have failed those countless crushes

65
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,470
because I was fated to meet you, Officer.

66
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,530
I see.

67
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,370
What number...

68
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,210
does that make me?

69
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,280
Well...

70
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,980
you are the fifth.

71
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,790
I see.

72
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:52,370
N-No, I liked all of them by myself.

73
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,150
I never even got to exchange words.

74
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:59,440
But you had proposed to me.

75
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,320
O-Oh, that is...

76
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,130
You are the first one I confessed to.

77
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,130
I swear it is true!

78
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:14,580
You are my first for everything.

79
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,980
Your novel was the first one to relieve my worries in real life.

80
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,150
You are also the first one I kissed.

81
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,280
And you are the first one who proposed to me.

82
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,810
It is also my first time...

83
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,000
liking someone enough...

84
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,320
that my heart was in pain.

85
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,370
Officer, you are the greatest man I know,

86
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:57,230
including the men in the novels as well.

87
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:07,580
This is the first time I have watched the festivities of Dano like this.

88
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,130
It is not as bad as I thought.

89
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,450
Your first time?

90
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,680
What did you do on Dano in the past?

91
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,240
I read books alone at home because I did not like the hectic environment.

92
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,770
That is also not as bad as you think.

93
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:32,810
Since you got to see it this year, do not just stay home starting next year.

94
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,290
Starting next year, I plan to watch the Dano festivities with you.

95
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,970
If all three daughters of Dr. Maeng get married, I get to be released from the Royal Family.

96
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,330
This means I can take public office and get married freely, too.

97
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:02,710
Take it.

98
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,100
What is this?

99
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,260
It is your noble lineage.

100
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,090
Sorry?

101
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,550
You are not Yeojudaek the peddler

102
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:17,200
or Tae Ran, who is being chased by a bounty hunter anymore.

103
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,690
You are Heo Soon Deok, the third daughter of the 12th generation Heo of Inyang, Heo Myeong Gon.

104
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,530
Why did you do this for me?

105
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,590
I told you I would take care of my lovesickness on my own at Temple Seonhwa, did I not?

106
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,840
You meant...

107
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,950
you will forget about me, did you not?

108
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:43,250
Maybe if you did not have feelings for me.

109
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:48,270
I already found out you like me as well, so how can I forget you?

110
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,730
Is that possible for you?

111
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,570
- However— 
 - You do not need to forget your dead husband.

112
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,310
I also have not forgotten the princess.

113
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,530
Like you,

114
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:07,980
I probably will never be able to forget her.

115
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,490
However,

116
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,170
it is certain that I like you.

117
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,130
Is that not also...

118
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:20,110
true of you, too?

119
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:30,000
Your Excellency,

120
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,420
I am...

121
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,510
Are you all right?

122
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,850
Did you...

123
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:30,940
just save my life?

124
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,830
Number 12, do not ever let go of this maiden!

125
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:45,170
Sorry?

126
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,100
Yes!

127
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,010
 Why did I tell him that?

128
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,010
What's wrong?

129
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,610
What is it?

130
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,440
Damn it!

131
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,240
Where did she go?

132
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,200
I think I saw her running this way.

133
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,460
Gosh, I know right now is not the time,

134
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,170
but you should give me your answer to my proposal earlier...

135
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,070
Stay still for just a moment.

136
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,250
The bounty hunter is coming our way.

137
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,600
Your Excellency, I am okay—

138
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,540
Do not worry.

139
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,050
I will protect you without fail.

140
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,450
Look, there! Do not come any closer.

141
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:41,180
This woman is my wife—

142
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,840
How can you...

143
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,390
How can you be still looking at me...

144
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
with those eyes?

145
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,580
Yeojudaek?

146
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,800
Why did she come already?

147
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,370
Gosh.

148
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,830
Hurry up and run away.

149
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:54,380
He is the bounty hunter who came to get you.

150
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,260
It is okay, Madam.

151
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:00,880
I...

152
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,810
came back to Hanyang...

153
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:06,260
to meet this man.

154
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:10,020
What do you mean?

155
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,700
My Lord...

156
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,600
I am sorry.

157
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,500
- Because of me... 
 - I am fine...

158
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,660
as long as you are alive, Tae Ran.

159
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,620
If this woman is Tae Ran, the Yeojudaek, the bounty hunter is after,

160
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,350
what does that make you?

161
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,710
The thing is...

162
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,440
- Gosh! 
 - Lady Ha Na?

163
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,460
Crown Prince?

164
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,890
Get rid of both of them without fail.

165
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,530
Everyone freeze!

166
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:51,390
Just look the other way and keep going. You will get hurt.

167
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:55,830
Alas! Do you even know who that young master is to be this thoughtless?

168
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,940
Withdraw right this moment.

169
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,620
I was going to let you go if you did not know.

170
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,650
But you are out of luck.

171
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,170
No!

172
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:20,200
Are you okay?

173
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:24,700
Y-Yes, I think I am okay. Are you okay?

174
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,790
I am okay.

175
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,310
Shoo, shoo!

176
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:04,820
You punk!

177
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,730
Go away now!

178
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,560
What are you doing, you idiot?

179
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,070
Run away!

180
00:20:24,070 --> 00:20:25,810
Hurry up and go, you punk!

181
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:27,670
How dare you!

182
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,270
Are you all right?

183
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:51,390
I did not know you could wield a sword.

184
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,250
I learned it from the books every now and then to protect you.

185
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,750
But today was my first time with an actual sword.

186
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,640
You learned swordsmanship from the books for me?

187
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,850
Are you not hurt anywhere?

188
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,780
I am okay.

189
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,040
Are you okay, Lady?

190
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,970
Why on Earth did you come here?

191
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:24,730
Did you not send me a letter inviting me to come?

192
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:29,840
I have never sent such a letter.

193
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,870
C-Crown—

194
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:36,440
Oh, are you okay?

195
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,930
Yes.

196
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,270
I will escort Young Master and come right back, so wait for me at the inn.

197
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,590
We are not done talking, so do not run away saying you are busy.

198
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,840
This humble one told him he could not, but...

199
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,870
he said he would come back in two hours.

200
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,350
Send the Royal Guards right now to look for

201
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,410
- Crown Prince— 
  - Your Majesty!

202
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,440
Chief Royal Guard is here.

203
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:52,220
His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae entered the palace with Crown Prince and is on his way.

204
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,820
With Prince Gyeongwoonjae?

205
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,010
As expected, you are really...

206
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,230
His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae entered the palace with Crown Prince!

207
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,310
But Prince Gyeongwoonjae is one of our people.

208
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,230
Could it be he switched sides and joined Crown Prince?

209
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,110
Sister, we would not be getting blamed, would we?

210
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:18,440
Please do not worry.

211
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,980
It is getting late. I will take my leave.

212
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,530
You can lower your hands.

213
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:40,630
You experienced that big trauma recently at the private residence.

214
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:43,110
Yet, you secretly snuck out of the palace.

215
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:49,480
What are you thinking, Crown Prince?

216
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,650
I will never do it again next time.

217
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:58,800
Have you been exchanging letters with Maeng Ha Na of Namsan Village since then?

218
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:05,840
I asked her to tell me what was going on within the capital.

219
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,700
Even if you did,

220
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:11,390
I had told her you were in a dangerous situation before!

221
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:14,120
How can a woman shamelessly

222
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,890
send a letter asking you to come see her?

223
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:21,830
- Right this moment— 
 - Mother!

224
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:25,620
Maiden Ha Na did nothing wrong.

225
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,790
She also said this letter was not from her.

226
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,480
So, please punish me if you must punish anyone.

227
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,160
I cannot lose my only friend.

228
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,780
Your friend?

229
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,160
Lady does not even know I am the crown prince.

230
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,940
It looked like Lady Ha Na knew about the crown prince's true identity.

231
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,370
Are you saying she intentionally invited him outside, knowing he was the crown prince?

232
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,150
I do not think so.

233
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:02,080
If that were so, she would not have risked her life to protect the crown prince.

234
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:06,720
It looks like someone who knows they exchange letters

235
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,550
sent a false letter to lure the crown prince out of the palace,

236
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:13,400
pretending to be Lady Ha Na.

237
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,720
Do you have someone who comes to mind?

238
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:26,570
The ruffians were sent outside the capital so there will not be any problems.

239
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:32,500
Having failed is the problem itself!

240
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,380
How can you fail every time—

241
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,740
That is my question!

242
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,560
Even if His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae intervened,

243
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,500
failing because they could not deal with that weak nerd—

244
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,980
Gyeongwoonjae was not the only one there!

245
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:50,880
He said they had a private soldier who was good at martial arts!

246
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,010
It could not be that the prince knew in advance and prepared. Right?

247
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,660
If so, the Royal Guards would have been deployed.

248
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:02,440
They would not have let the crown prince escape the palace so easily.

249
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:07,040
What is important is, since the prince clearly became the king's ally,

250
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,430
we can no longer just sit still and watch!

251
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,650
They must be the same people who poisoned

252
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:23,530
Eastern Palace's court maid and abducted the crown prince after making him come out of the palace.

253
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,960
Is there still no progress on Eastern Palace's court maid?

254
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,090
My apologies. She has not regained consciousness.

255
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,540
However, I think I found a trace

256
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,600
of the one who brought the geumjam poison to Joseon while investigating another matter.

257
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,660
Who is the one?

258
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,950
I will report to you within a few days once I am certain.

259
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:03,360
I am sorry I could not tell you all this time.

260
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,600
After coming to Hanyang with the innkeeper,

261
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,660
you had become the Left State Minister's daughter-in-law.

262
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,340
So, I could not bring myself to tell you.

263
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,360
It is fine. I would not have been able to say it, either.

264
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,070
Let's go outside and play jachigi. 
  (A traditional Korean game played with sticks)

265
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:35,370
What is going on here?

266
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:41,780
So, that captain had let you go eight years ago, not that he lost you, huh?

267
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,980
I did not even know this and told you to run away in a letter.

268
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,670
He should have told me instead of carrying this around and confusing me!

269
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:56,830
Do you really not know why he carried it?

270
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:00,510
You still have no idea even after seeing the scroll?

271
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:04,400
He was trying to preserve the painting of Yeojudaek's face.

272
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,950
He has a deathly face, but he is a great lover.

273
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:02,220
 When I first started matchmaking,

274
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:05,710
 I did not know I would end up writing a marriage proposal to you.

275
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,250
 Especially because...

276
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:12,240
 you are just a widowed merchant,

277
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,960
 who speaks thoughtlessly to me,

278
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,350
 tries to lecture me,

279
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:20,980
 and walks imprudently quickly.

280
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:26,460
 However, now that I think about it,

281
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,860
 we were fated to end up like this.

282
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,280
 Because my dark world started to brighten

283
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:37,980
 the moment I first saw you at the bookstore.

284
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:46,090
 As you said, you came into my heart in that short moment.

285
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:51,180
 At first, I was going to reject you because you were too strange to me.

286
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,060
 But I realized it was impossible to do it of my own accord.

287
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,990
 Therefore...

288
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,920
 I want to spend the rest of my days with you.

289
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:07,760
 So, I hope you will look at me favorably and accept me as your spouse.

290
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,610
Is Yeojudaek inside?

291
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,460
Why does he ask when he will not even wait for an answer?

292
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,160
Are you Yeojudaek?

293
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,870
Did you escort Young Master to safety?

294
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,080
I also...

295
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,460
want to spend the rest of my days with you.

296
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:06,670
Just like how you never thought you would end up proposing to me,

297
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,560
I also never thought...

298
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:14,900
I would grow feelings of love for someone again.

299
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:19,370
Because my first love was so big,

300
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,300
I was so confident that...

301
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,910
I could live the rest of my life with that love alone.

302
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,810
However, without me knowing,

303
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:41,070
I was embracing you in my heart.

304
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:51,090
I was thankful because you told me...

305
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,730
I was not betraying my late husband by having such feelings.

306
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,940
W-Wait.

307
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,330
However,

308
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,510
I cannot accept your proposal, Your Excellency.

309
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:18,060
Wait, how come?

310
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,110
I am not...

311
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:28,290
Yeojudaek, the peddler, you know.

312
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,700
My name is...

313
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,830
Soon Deok of the Jeong family and...

314
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,940
I am a noblewoman who has a son.

315
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:50,810
At first, a widowed matchmaker.

316
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,320
After that,

317
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:58,460
an accused murderer with memory loss.

318
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,510
And now you say...

319
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:05,280
you are a noble?

320
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:10,780
I could not do matchmaking as a noble.

321
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,740
So I had to borrow Yeojudaek's name, which is the cause of all this.

322
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,610
Since we realized each other's situation and feelings,

323
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,910
I think...

324
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,950
we should never meet again.

325
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,470
Good job.

326
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:11,640
You cannot forget him if you keep seeing him.

327
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,140
Mother!

328
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:18,630
Hello.

329
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,500
Did you have fun with Aunt?

330
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,600
Yes, I had so much fun.

331
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,390
Really?

332
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,700
How was your uncle-to-be?

333
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,330
The thing is...

334
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:34,310
Gosh, why ask such a thing to a kid?

335
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:36,820
I met him and...

336
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,630
I even got a gift.

337
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:42,020
How do you feel about him after meeting him?

338
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:49,040
He is polite, looks noble,

339
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,560
and he was better than I thought.

340
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:54,600
I knew he would be the type you like.

341
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,900
- It was good to meet him before the wedding. Right? 
 - Yes.

342
00:35:58,430 --> 00:36:03,230
I would have regretted it for the rest of my life had I not met him today.

343
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,690
Tell me the details after we go home.

344
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,340
Let's go now.

345
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,900
Your Excellency!

346
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,740
Where in the world were you?

347
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,140
I could not find Scholar Number 23 in the end...

348
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,340

349
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,310
Gosh, we get to meet him now.

350
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,440
Do you know how long I have been looking for you?

351
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,740
But who is this lady next to you?

352
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,610
Your Excellency,

353
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,880
I met a woman who is so clumsy and poor.

354
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,520
I think I will have to stay by her side...

355
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,540
and take care of her.

356
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,690
Hence, I cannot marry Master Maeng's...

357
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:30,680
youngest daughter. I am sorry.

358
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,690
I understand.

359
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,760
She looks great with you, Scholar Number 23.

360
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,960
Now, then.

361
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,600
Your Excellency, can you just let him go?

362
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,490
Huh?

363
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:06,150
Wait! Is he not Scholar Number 12, the oldest maiden's partner?

364
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:13,380
I finally met the woman of my destiny, whom I had been looking for, around the eight provinces.

365
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,730
As you said, I will not let go of this woman.

366
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,180
You made the right decision.

367
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,070
This way.

368
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:36,120
Wait! He made the right decision?

369
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,490
What about the oldest maiden?

370
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:41,100
The eldest has her own fated one.

371
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,980
And who would that be?

372
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:48,020
- What do you mean? 
 - Lady Ha Na's fated one!

373
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,440
Gosh, seriously.

374
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,580
W-Wait—

375
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,020
No way. Not another one. Right? I am sure he is not.

376
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,050
He does not even have a woman next to him, so...

377
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,660
I was on my way to Gyeongwoonjae to tell you something

378
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,560
and I run into you here.

379
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,040
I have...

380
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,510
another woman I have feelings for.

381
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,250
Whoa, everyone found the love of their lives!

382
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,860
Is this Dano, where love blooms or something?

383
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:28,330
I do not think I can marry Master Maeng's second daughter.

384
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:30,050
I am sorry.

385
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:33,870
Well, it cannot be helped.

386
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:45,680
What do you mean it cannot be helped? Are you not going to marry the old maidens?

387
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,060
It is all meaningless.

388
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:49,300
Your Excellency!

389
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:54,630
Looks like the old maidens' marriages all went wrong just now. Right?

390
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,820
You think so. Right?

391
00:39:55,820 --> 00:40:00,000
They all went wrong, for sure. Not that they look like it.

392
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,370
I am suddenly in such a great mood!

393
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:04,080
We need to go tell people right this moment!

394
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:05,770
Wait for me!

395
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:29,890
If you fail to match those marriages, your public office and marriage are all going down the drain.

396
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:32,800
But why did you do that? Can you say something—

397
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,340
Yeojudaek is a noblewoman.

398
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:39,190
So what use is it if I get released from the Royal Family?

399
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:40,500
What?

400
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,400
Yeojudaek is what?

401
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,560
I want to be alone,

402
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,680
so take your leave now!

403
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:32,070
 Number 12, do not ever let go of this maiden!

404
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:33,440
 Sorry?

405
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,020
 Yes!

406
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:55,410
 Since we realized each other's situation and feelings,

407
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:58,350
 I think... we should never meet again.

408
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,150
The entire capital knows about all of our marriages going wrong.

409
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,220
What on Earth did you do to break off the marriages?

410
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,120
I did as I was told,

411
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,190
but Old Bachelor Number 24 did not come to the wrestling competition.

412
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:20,430
So it is not my fault my marriage was broken off.

413
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,890
What about you, Sister?

414
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,510
Well, I left my position for a moment to do great work for the country.

415
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:35,440
And that scholar got himself another woman.

416
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,600
They said men's hearts are like the reeds.

417
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,340
In fact, it is not like I was head over heels for him.

418
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:43,670
So do not worry about me.

419
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:47,820
Sisters, do you really not care about your youngest sister?

420
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:51,390
Sam Soon, we are not to blame for the marriages breaking off.

421
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:53,690
So, you will not be taken to the government office.

422
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:55,470
You are right.

423
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:57,120
Do not worry.

424
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,210
Is getting arrested the problem right now?

425
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:08,120
If you two do not get married, how am I going to get married?

426
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,250
It is all back to square one.

427
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:15,120
The good comes with the bad, my foot.

428
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,260
My life is just full of the bad and the worse!

429
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:21,270
H-Hey, youngest...

430
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,060
do not cry.

431
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,280
Why are you crying over something like marriage?

432
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,840
Hey, Maeng Sam Soon,

433
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:32,660
do you not remember how we wrote the pledge not to marry and live with our mother for life?

434
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,340
I do not!

435
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:37,110
Do you two even know what love is?

436
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:58,510
 The Dano Operation you guaranteed would work soiled completely, so what will you do now?

437
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:02,000
 Please do not worry.

438
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,430
 I am Yeojudaek, the goddess of matchmaking.

439
00:45:12,390 --> 00:45:15,390
 Since we realized each other's situation and feelings,

440
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,790
 I think...

441
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:22,210
 we should never meet again.

442
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,340
 I will finish the matchmaking by myself and...

443
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,930
 I will let you know in a letter.

444
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,480
I am the one who said we should not meet.

445
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:51,090
But why did I wait?

446
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:05,720
Even if he went on a retreat, you fail at finding a mere undertaker monk?

447
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,040
I apologize. We are still looking around.

448
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,620
No one does a single thing right.

449
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,370
He disappeared after meeting Prince Gyeongwoonjae?

450
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,750
I do not deem it a coincidence.

451
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,050
I found out who the undertaker monk was.

452
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:24,100
Why bother finding out who the monk is?

453
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,500
- Just go and find him. 
 - Now, now!

454
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:32,570
Who is the undertaker monk? Go ahead.

455
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,850
The son of His Excellency Min Seung Gwan of Namjang Party, who died seven years ago.

456
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:38,560
W-What—

457
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,520
Why are you telling us that now?

458
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:44,930
This means Gyeongwoonjae met Min Seo Joon.

459
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:51,030
Does that mean he knows everything you did to Nephew and his wife eight years ago?

460
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,910
Why do you always run your mouth without thinking?

461
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,720
I mean, it is because I was just worried.

462
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:14,160

463
00:47:29,230 --> 00:47:31,670
My In Hyeon died?

464
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:33,910
What do you mean by that?

465
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:39,180
His Excellency Min sent someone to take back the letter he exchanged with the interpreter.

466
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:43,490
It looks like In Hyeon was killed while trying to keep the letters.

467
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,800
Gosh. Sister...

468
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:57,960
In Hyeon!

469
00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,140
 Does that mean he knows everything you did to Nephew and his wife eight years ago?

470
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,580
The young master from Dano...

471
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:40,300
I do not know which family he is from, either.

472
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:46,280
Are you saying you saved a young master you do not know?

473
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:05,990
It looks like she knows who he is but will not tell me.

474
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,570
Should I ask His Excellency?

475
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:11,400
No.

476
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,570
I can do it alone.

477
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:23,140
Gosh, my goodness.

478
00:49:24,110 --> 00:49:26,600
What is wrong with His Excellency?

479
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,010
He was completely fine until the evening on Dano.

480
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,380
Lovesickness rapidly worsens when you think there is no hope,

481
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,280
making you let go of yourself like this.

482
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,790
Letting go of yourself? What does that mean?

483
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:48,740
What could it mean? It means he might not make it and die if his spirit is too weak.

484
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:50,670
H-He will pass away?

485
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:56,030
In your eyes, does he look like he will pass away with his temper, huh?

486
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:59,430
I will go back and send you gagamjinsindan. 
  (Herbal medicine for replenishing one's body and spirit)

487
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:03,840
So help him take it with warm alcohol.

488
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,690
 Butler, sir, there is a letter from the inn!

489
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,300
You can leave it on the table.

490
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,860
Yes.

491
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,320
My gosh.

492
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:25,290
Your Excellency, are you feeling better now?

493
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:28,220
You were bedridden for three entire days!

494
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,200
He is alive.

495
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:47,810
He said a letter came from the inn. Bring it.

496
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,240
S-Sorry?

497
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:51,550
Oh, okay.

498
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:55,990

499
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:01,730
The letter from the inn must be the cure.

500
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:31,360
You only had to tell me which family he was from in a letter.

501
00:51:31,360 --> 00:51:32,950
So why...

502
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:36,030
That young master will not do.

503
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,630
What do you mean, "He will not do"?

504
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:44,280
Are you not trying to match the young master we met on Dano and Lady Ha Na?

505
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:47,980
Let us look for someone else.

506
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,500
We agreed...

507
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,840
I will do matchmaking on my own from now on.

508
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:54,370
I never agreed to it.

509
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:59,100
I find it uncomfortable to be with Your Excellency.

510
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,610
Endure it even if it is uncomfortable.

511
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:06,990
Because you are the one who deceived me in the first place.

512
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:12,250
I will not ask to meet you anymore once the match is complete.

513
00:52:12,250 --> 00:52:16,630
So, let us work together until the match is over, as per our contract.

514
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:25,620
In that case,

515
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:29,390
let's say what happened...

516
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,080
on Dano never happened.

517
00:52:36,780 --> 00:52:40,800
If that is more comfortable for you, I will do so.

518
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,200
Also, treat me like a merchant like you did before.

519
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:50,420
It is uncomfortable when you use honorifics to me.

520
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:53,900
How can I skip the honorifics when I know you are a noblewoman?

521
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,590
You must also endure that, even if it makes you uncomfortable.

522
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,590
Among the scholars who showed interest in Lady Ha Na...

523
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:08,810
Why are you saying that young master will not do?

524
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:13,790
They do have an age gap, but they look good together.

525
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,770
Is your chest in pain again?

526
00:53:34,770 --> 00:53:36,910
It is okay.

527
00:53:36,910 --> 00:53:40,240
It is not because they do not look good together.

528
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,610
I am sure that young master is Lady Ha Na's fated one.

529
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:49,440
However, his family is not one we can match for.

530
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,880
- Therefore— 
 - Hold on.

531
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,860
You just said they are fated to be together.

532
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:58,140
What is the reason you said that?

533
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,790
Well, obviously...

534
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,110
because when I just look at them...

535
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,730
I can feel it.

536
00:54:11,390 --> 00:54:17,570
  Other matchmakers hear sounds or recognize fate with energies from their bodies.

537
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:20,510
  I was wondering how you recognize them.

538
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:26,850
By chance,

539
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:30,910
does your chest hurt when Lady Ha Na and the young master are together?

540
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:34,610
Just like when Lady Sam Soon and Officer are together.

541
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,120
Hearing the symptoms,

542
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,240
it sounds like Your Excellency is the Ssangyeonsulsa.

543
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,680
That makes no sense—

544
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,640
Ssangyeonsulsa are mostly women, are they not?

545
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:55,530
I heard a few of them are men.

546
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:01,370
I read that Ssangyeonsulsas naturally match people with their fated ones.

547
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:04,370
But I have never done such a thing in my life!

548
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:08,410
I guess you studied a lot about Ssangyeonsulsa.

549
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:13,010
That is also what most Ssangyeonsulsa do

550
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:16,790
to find out why they are acting in such a way.

551
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:23,760
If that were true, I should be Ssangyeonsulsa.

552
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,420
After being sick immensely, the fates you recognize become more clear.

553
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:32,010
So you cannot help but match them.

554
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,620
Did that ever happen to you?

555
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:41,430
If I am indeed Ssangyeonsulsa,

556
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:44,630
I need a strategy to match the fated ones.

557
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:48,700
But a way to match your eldest daughter with the young master—

558
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:52,900
  It is rather simple to wed His Highness the Crown Prince.

559
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:54,450
 Really?

560
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:58,110
  Since the old maidens in the city were the excuse to hinder His Highness to wed,

561
00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:02,150
  I believe the problem will be resolved by getting rid of the old maidens.

562
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:08,290
 The purpose of this match was to wed the crown prince in the first place.

563
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,120
I think I can come up with a justification to connect their fates.

564
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,420
I am regretful that the business on Dano failed because

565
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,930
His Excellency Park did not do his job right.

566
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:30,270
Why is that my fault?

567
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:35,200
It is Gyeongwoonjae's fault for interrupting, determined to foil the operations.

568
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:38,590
Therefore,

569
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,150
before Prince Gyeongwoonjae creates a justification to

570
00:56:41,150 --> 00:56:43,780
wed the crown prince by matching the old maidens,

571
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:46,870
I am thinking about getting rid of the root of the problem.

572
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:51,240
By g-getting rid of the root,

573
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,070
do you mean you will get rid of him?

574
00:56:55,070 --> 00:56:58,410
It must be done if necessary.

575
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,680
I am against this idea.

576
00:57:08,910 --> 00:57:12,580
The king is sensitive because of the incident with the crown prince.

577
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:15,750
Is there a need to attract his attention?

578
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:19,850
Additionally, since Master Maeng's daughters' marriages were broken off,

579
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:22,460
I think finding out what Gyeongwoonjae schemed

580
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,840
with the king takes priority over what he plans to do from now on.

581
00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:29,550
What do you mean he is scheming?

582
00:57:29,550 --> 00:57:33,510
On Dano, although it was the crown prince's independent action,

583
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:38,710
do you not find it odd how there is no action when the ruffians almost took the crown prince's life?

584
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:40,450
True...

585
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,620
If you speak against my opinion so blatantly in front of everyone,

586
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:55,650
would people not think our household lacks order and discipline?

587
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:04,650
Finding out what the king is planning is important,

588
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:09,730
I think it is right to get rid of Prince Gyeongwoonjae now

589
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,460
as a warning and to boost the morale of the Dongno Party.

590
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:18,240
This discussion was over earlier, was it not?

591
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,220
By chance...

592
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:31,450
is there another reason we have to get rid of Prince Gyeongwoonjae...

593
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:36,370
besides the ones I already know?

594
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:41,120
You know such a thing does not exist.

595
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:48,510
If you are not hiding anything from me,

596
00:58:48,510 --> 00:58:51,840
please do not speak of this issue anymore.

597
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,790
Because I will not change my mind.

598
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:14,020
Now that I think about it, I think the Dano Operation failed because of you.

599
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,930
You wanted them to meet their real fated ones

600
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,910
because you are the Ssangyeonsulsa, not me.

601
00:59:23,240 --> 00:59:26,390
Madam, I am not a Ssangyeonsulsa.

602
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:28,460
I also do not want to admit it,

603
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:33,710
but you are definitely a Ssangyeonsulsa based on everything that has happened.

604
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:36,670
I also researched a lot about Ssangyeonsulsa, so I know it well.

605
00:59:36,670 --> 00:59:42,820
Master Maeng's wife said that is also a trait of Ssangyeolsulsa, did she not?

606
00:59:53,770 --> 00:59:56,340
It is slippery here.

607
01:00:21,290 --> 01:00:25,670
I researched them because you said you wanted to know.

608
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,350
Show it to me...

609
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,870
if you researched them for me.

610
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:54,090
These are all my stories except seeing the red string and their hearts racing.

611
01:00:54,090 --> 01:01:00,250
Especially, "Ssangyeonsulsa have their own skills for matching fated ones."

612
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:05,110
The moment I see a man and a woman who are a match, I think of a way to connect them.

613
01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:10,730
Are you very upset because you are not a Ssangyeonsulsa?

614
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,610
Yes.

615
01:01:15,610 --> 01:01:19,360
Why did you hope you were a Ssangyeonsulsa?

616
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:24,330
Even though I am doing this because I enjoy it,

617
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:29,600
I needed a reason to obsess over matchmaking while fooling the elders of my household.

618
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:33,320
But that would be resolved if I were a Ssangyeonsulsa.

619
01:01:34,110 --> 01:01:39,540
There is no reason to hesitate since matchmaking would be my innate fate.

620
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,450
Do you think fate exists?

621
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:53,670
Yes.

622
01:01:53,670 --> 01:01:58,960
Because the relationship between a man and a woman is like fate in the end.

623
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:03,800
If...

624
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,650
I am a Ssangyeonsulsa,

625
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:13,270
the fact my heart races this much whenever I see you...

626
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,890
would mean you are my fate, would it not?

627
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,000
It would not.

628
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,230
Master Maeng's wife said she saw my husband was my fated one.

629
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:36,120
Which means...

630
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,230
your feelings and mine are...

631
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:46,610
probably just passing winds.

632
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,880
After some time passes,

633
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:54,590
these tempest-like hearts will also...

634
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,450
quiet down.

635
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,630
Are you certain?

636
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,470
Probably so.

637
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,430

638
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,860
  Which family are you from, Madam?

639
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:03,310
  Find the matchmaker who accompanies Prince Gyeongwoonjae

640
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:05,510
  and bring her to me right away!

641
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:07,460
  I am sorry.

642
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,350
  What you said was right, Your Excellency.

643
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:11,480
  The merchant who sold the geumjam poison back then...

644
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:16,230
  That case is the beginning of the current case of Crown Prince's abduction.

645
01:04:16,230 --> 01:04:19,690
  Since things came down to this, let us get rid of Gyeongwoonjae together.

646
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:23,390
  I knew it the moment I first saw you...

647
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:25,960
  that you were someone I could never forget.

648
01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:41,270

649
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,360
