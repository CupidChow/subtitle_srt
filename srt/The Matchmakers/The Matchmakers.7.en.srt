(The Matchmakers)

6
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,219
Because of my unique family ties,

7
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,789
I think it will be harder for me to marry.

8
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,529
Is it because of my half-brother Prince Jinsung?

9
00:01:03,959 --> 00:01:04,969
No.

10
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,329
The reason it is hard for me to marry is...

11
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,970
because I have four older sisters.

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,140
Who would want four sisters-in-law?

13
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:31,489
What I want from a spouse is simple.

14
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:32,659
(Maeng Ha Na, smarter than she is pretty)

15
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,459
His father must be fifth class or above.

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,300
He cannot be below that.

17
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,030
He must be between 5.5 and 6 feet tall.

18
00:01:39,899 --> 00:01:42,339
A tall man is never worth the extra height.

19
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,169
He just has to look manly enough.

20
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,679
No.

21
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:52,179
I waited this long already.

22
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,250
I will not marry if he does not fit even one condition.

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,119
Now for the most important one.

24
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:03,660
He must be worthy of my respect.

25
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:09,300
(Episode 7: An Eye for an Eye, a Rumour for a Rumour)

26
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,000
This is different from what I have heard.

27
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:15,699
You said only the murderer will get punished.

28
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:18,508
How could you have Lady Sam Soon do such a dangerous job?

29
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:19,509
Do...

30
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,579
Do not yell.

31
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,710
If you do...

32
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,880
my... my chest...

33
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,350
My lord!

34
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,060
Pull yourself together!

35
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:40,729
My lord. Wake up.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,169
Look only at me.

37
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,780
My lord.

38
00:03:02,079 --> 00:03:03,119
Get on my back.

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,619
I will take you home.

40
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,289
My horse is outside. I will be outside the inn.

41
00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:07,519
Leave it.

42
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,460
I am fine now.

43
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,429
You are not fine. You passed out.

44
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,930
You must see Physician Yu...

45
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:14,259
Get off me.

46
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,269
Do not cause a fuss.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,940
I know my condition well.

48
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:24,940
Explain the next step.

49
00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:26,970
This is a pressing matter.

50
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,810
My goodness.

51
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,500
This feel.

52
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,569
It is not the first time.

53
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,970
Lady Sam Soon.

54
00:04:01,979 --> 00:04:03,810
Stand by that wall.

55
00:04:05,449 --> 00:04:06,479
What?

56
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,079
Go do it now.

57
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,419
Go.

58
00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:20,729
Okay.

59
00:04:20,989 --> 00:04:24,869
Now Lieutenant, go and stand by Lady Sam Soon.

60
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:28,299
Go on.

61
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:31,140
Help me out here.

62
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,489
This was the cause of my chest pain?

63
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:46,989
Lieutenant.

64
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,359
Stay at least two steps apart from Lady Sam Soon.

65
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,830
Go, now.

66
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,660
Now.

67
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:57,799
What the...

68
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:03,600
You are in pain again?

69
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:12,510
As of this moment,

70
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,280
Lady Sam Soon and the lieutenant...

71
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,749
are to stay at least two steps apart.

72
00:05:20,249 --> 00:05:21,260
Why?

73
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,959
When a single man and woman are unacceptably close,

74
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,129
my chest seizes up in pain.

75
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,339
The Classic of Rites says...

76
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,840
men and women must be apart since the age of seven.

77
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,979
Let us say you are honouring our morals.

78
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:51,788
Why are you laughing?

79
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,390
I do not think it has anything to do with morals or rites.

80
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,559
You have no experience with a woman,

81
00:05:57,619 --> 00:05:59,789
and you will likely never have any,

82
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:02,798
so seeing other couples makes you angry and jealous.

83
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:04,400
I think that is why your heart races.

84
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,669
My lord, you are a Confucian scholar to the core.

85
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:16,280
A true example of an upright man.

86
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,020
What is it now?

87
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:25,619
Lieutenant.

88
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,460
Are you still single?

89
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,488
Stand well apart!

90
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,330
- Stand apart. - Stand...

91
00:06:34,489 --> 00:06:35,799
Stand apart...

92
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,799
Are you unwed?

93
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:45,739
I am.

94
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:49,609
Yes!

95
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,989
I always lose her in this area.

96
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,510
The conclusion is,

97
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:29,549
Lee Cho Ok's murderer...

98
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,689
seems to be the Minister of Defence.

99
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:38,859
The day Lee Cho Ok vanished,

100
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,929
the minister's birthday party was held.

101
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,359
(6 months ago, Minister of Defence's residence)

102
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:50,299
Lee Cho Ok went to help with the arrangements.

103
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:52,869
She did not return home.

104
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,678
The investigation report...

105
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:58,510
did not mention Lee went to the minister's residence.

106
00:08:00,309 --> 00:08:01,519
Early on,

107
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,580
we had witnesses who said they saw Lee at the party,

108
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,488
and that the minister...

109
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:06,889
dragged her into a room.

110
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,188
The very next day, they all said they never saw her.

111
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,059
He bought their silence.

112
00:08:12,989 --> 00:08:15,128
Everyone knew the Minister of Defence...

113
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,530
had a thing for Cho Ok when she was alive.

114
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,269
If that were how things were,

115
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:23,669
Lee should have had no reason to work at the minister's party.

116
00:08:24,299 --> 00:08:26,939
She must have borrowed from him during the famine.

117
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,808
He would have offered...

118
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,379
to write off the interest if she worked for him that day.

119
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,450
As a peddler, you know how things work.

120
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,889
Thank you.

121
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,859
I am smart and quick-witted.

122
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,619
Unlike someone else.

123
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,290
Cut out the chatter and...

124
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:48,499
keep explaining.

125
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,259
My point exactly.

126
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,869
Lee's body was found by the river.

127
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:02,138
The Minister of Defence's butler claimed he saw Lee...

128
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:03,909
walk into the river the night before.

129
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,810
It was concluded a suicide.

130
00:09:06,009 --> 00:09:08,719
The witness works for the minister,

131
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,180
and that proves he is guilty.

132
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,619
I have a question.

133
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,560
How did I end up being named as Cho Ok's killer?

134
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,228
Officials found...

135
00:09:20,229 --> 00:09:22,659
many of Hwa Rok's erotic romance novels in Lee's room.

136
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,629
Lee became engrossed in the novels,

137
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:28,969
failed to distinguish imagination and reality,

138
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:30,999
and became depressed and took her own life.

139
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,710
That was the conclusion.

140
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,680
The Capital District Office wants to close the case...

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,450
by punishing Hwa Rok for writing psychoactive novels...

142
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:40,609
that have negative effects on women and children.

143
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,549
The stuffy officials...

144
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:45,519
sometimes get too pointlessly creative.

145
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,159
Everyone but you, Lieutenant.

146
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,009
They sell new books here?

147
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,279
This book.

148
00:10:17,879 --> 00:10:19,489
It looks familiar.

149
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,290
Two nyang for three days.

150
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,820
What?

151
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,590
It is expensive because it is most popular.

152
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,840
I was just looking around.

153
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:40,540
Stop a rumour with a rumour.

154
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:43,279
I will explain Operation Rumour Block.

155
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,908
We will punish the Minister of Defence...

156
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,608
with public sentiment...

157
00:10:47,609 --> 00:10:50,180
and turn Lady Ha Na's false rumour into a moving story.

158
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,889
How?

159
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,220
With an incredibly gripping story.

160
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:55,989
Who?

161
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:59,029
Hwa Rok, the most popular writer of the day.

162
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,960
I understand the mission completely.

163
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:05,070
Move the public...

164
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,998
It is not the greatest of tactics,

165
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,869
but it should counter Lady Ha Na's rumour.

166
00:11:12,909 --> 00:11:14,569
To wish us success,

167
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,440
we should chant the operation name.

168
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,278
The deal was that...

169
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,119
I follow Lady Yeoju's practices.

170
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:37,700
Lieutenant, your hand too.

171
00:11:40,229 --> 00:11:41,540
Okay, then.

172
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,469
The lieutenant must keep his distance from Lady Sam Soon.

173
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,170
You do not have to participate.

174
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,649
- Your hand too. - Oh, okay.

175
00:11:53,409 --> 00:11:54,449
Okay, then.

176
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,450
Block a rumour with a rumour!

177
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
- Rumour Block! - Rumour Block!

178
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,460
Let us go, then.

179
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,989
What a great start.

180
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,039
You must go to the Royal Court today.

181
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,170
- You must hurry. - Oh, yes.

182
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,769
It is because I am the princess' husband.

183
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,839
What is?

184
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,509
The reason Lady Yeoju is distancing herself from me.

185
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:29,319
For a peddler...

186
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,019
to work with a royal must be so uncomfortable.

187
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,889
Do you really believe that is it?

188
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,859
How do I explain I am open when it comes to that matter?

189
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:43,129
You are, are you? I had no idea.

190
00:12:43,659 --> 00:12:45,799
Can we get going now?

191
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,628
You know better than anyone.

192
00:12:47,629 --> 00:12:49,699
I am always open when it comes to that.

193
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,799
Right, you are.

194
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,769
I have no prejudice about social class.

195
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,540
You wanted to talk in private?

196
00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:01,080
My spouse. Instead of Bachelor 23,

197
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,820
can it be the lieutenant?

198
00:13:06,249 --> 00:13:07,988
Do not make a decision now.

199
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:09,759
Let us think about it over time.

200
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:11,859
Why?

201
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,460
Am I not good enough a match for the lieutenant?

202
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,060
It is not that.

203
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:20,128
From what I know,

204
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:22,200
the lieutenant decided never to marry.

205
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,769
I do not want you to get hurt.

206
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,570
I was against marriage myself too.

207
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,940
But we always change our minds.

208
00:13:31,979 --> 00:13:34,609
I have a feeling that the lieutenant...

209
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,850
likes me too.

210
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:43,320
You said I could marry the man I want.

211
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,759
Help me out.

212
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:48,960
Lady Sam Soon is brave and true to her feelings.

213
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,899
She could be the person to reach out...

214
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,769
to my stubborn brother.

215
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:02,639
Very well, then.

216
00:14:02,979 --> 00:14:06,210
Let us work on matching you with the lieutenant.

217
00:14:09,249 --> 00:14:10,420
Thank you.

218
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,690
The death of Lee Cho Ok from six months ago.

219
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:20,029
Do you remember the case?

220
00:14:20,629 --> 00:14:21,899
Of course I do.

221
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,728
She was a depressed spinster...

222
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,430
who took her life.

223
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,169
There was a spooky story about her spirit...

224
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,340
haunting other women of marriageable age.

225
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,840
That story...

226
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:36,080
was one of the reasons the crown prince could not marry.

227
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:38,180
How could I forget?

228
00:14:38,409 --> 00:14:41,409
That story is hampering the marriage of Erudite Maeng's three daughters.

229
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:44,050
The matchmaker and I are working on it.

230
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,590
Okay. Good luck.

231
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:52,560
By the way,

232
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:58,129
are you sure the left state councillor has no idea?

233
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,629
Yes.

234
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Actually,

235
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,109
his wife seems to suspect something,

236
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,409
so to appease her,

237
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,710
I agreed to tutor their grandson.

238
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:17,350
Very well.

239
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,139
Lady Sam Soon.

240
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:41,779
You stayed up all night?

241
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,609
Let us go to the inn.

242
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,979
What? Wait.

243
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,249
Looking like that?

244
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,889
I need not dress like a man.

245
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,059
It is the lieutenant's day off,

246
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,930
and he will come to help copy your story.

247
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,190
What?

248
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,600
Why are you telling me that now?

249
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,269
That is why I am here.

250
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,399
Go and get changed.

251
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,499
Let us...

252
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,440
become prettier.

253
00:16:33,489 --> 00:16:34,560
Lieutenant.

254
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,759
Have you forgotten?

255
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,368
No excessive show of affection.

256
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:42,440
I only stood up. I cannot do that either?

257
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,040
He is the type who steps away whenever a woman approaches.

258
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:49,609
To succeed, you must make him come to you.

259
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,050
I understand.

260
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,720
Lieutenant.

261
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,489
You can sit over there and copy the pages.

262
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,129
Oh, my gosh.

263
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,629
I know we cannot hire professionals for security reasons,

264
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:48,800
but why must I wear something like this?

265
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,139
To get people to think Hwa Rok is a young man in green.

266
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:55,408
When you leave, your butler can wear the robe...

267
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:57,080
and head to the water mill.

268
00:17:58,439 --> 00:17:59,550
Okay.

269
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,279
Then witnesses will focus on the green robe...

270
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,719
and not Hwa Rok's build or figure.

271
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,089
It will be easier to evade the guards.

272
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,590
Your mind works wonderfully, Lieutenant.

273
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:13,290
I could tell that much myself.

274
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,310
Lady Yeoju.

275
00:18:32,709 --> 00:18:35,280
Thank you for working hard on this case.

276
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:37,519
I will lift the command...

277
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,820
that you must keep a three-step distance from me.

278
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:41,688
And to make things move smoothly,

279
00:18:41,689 --> 00:18:43,859
you need not feel too uncomfortable around me.

280
00:19:11,719 --> 00:19:14,020
"The Story of Lady Cho Hee."

281
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:21,129
I do not understand the story.

282
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,070
Ask me about it, then.

283
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,270
Right.

284
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,868
If Cho Ok's ghost felt wronged,

285
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,468
she should appear to the magistrate to plead her case.

286
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:35,510
Why would she appear to unwed women?

287
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:37,439
It lacks a sense of realism.

288
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,449
I do not know what "a sense of realism" is,

289
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,519
but from Cho Ok's ghost's perspective,

290
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,490
she was killed by the Minister of Defence,

291
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:48,350
and the governors and magistrates are his lackeys.

292
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,359
Unless she were stupid, she would not visit a magistrate.

293
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,428
She haunted women because she believed...

294
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:56,060
a woman would understand and help.

295
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,070
Lady Sam Soon is right.

296
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,169
I think this story has a great sense of realism.

297
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:10,040
I think that unlike other officials,

298
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,879
you have a sense of justice.

299
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,689
I suddenly feel so hot. Is it just me?

300
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,389
I do not find the story strange.

301
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,290
If you all think so, then...

302
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,208
My heart accelerates...

303
00:20:44,209 --> 00:20:46,310
even when I am frustrated,

304
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,550
so I would like an answer to my letter.

305
00:21:11,439 --> 00:21:12,439
My lady.

306
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,009
Go back inside,

307
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,938
walk around the bookstore five times, then come outside.

308
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:17,939
Then...

309
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:20,750
I cannot walk with the lieutenant.

310
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:23,780
That is the point.

311
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,149
What...

312
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,340
I will leave, then.

313
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:44,570
Well...

314
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,510
If you keep asking because you do not know how I feel,

315
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,550
that would be so upsetting.

316
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,709
She need not be upset.

317
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,879
When you read this,

318
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,090
tell how you feel, whether it be to a tree or the sky.

319
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:38,619
I would like to hear it through the wind.

320
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:42,759
Cho Hee poured out her heart for her beloved...

321
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,299
into the letter.

322
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,300
"Cho Hee?"

323
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,570
Who is Cho...

324
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,510
I will manage.

325
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,070
Lady Yeoju.

326
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,840
She wrote just one line...

327
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,750
on the back of scrap paper?

328
00:23:02,719 --> 00:23:04,750
She could have talked to me instead.

329
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,159
She got my hopes up by giving this to me.

330
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:19,729
The paper smells fragrant, even.

331
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,830
(You need not feel too uncomfortable around me.)

332
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,168
My heart accelerates...

333
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:29,179
even when I am frustrated,

334
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,480
so I would like an answer to my letter.

335
00:23:53,869 --> 00:23:56,469
(I will manage. Lady Yeoju.)

336
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:25,560
"Confucius said,"

337
00:24:26,199 --> 00:24:28,300
"'If you study and sometimes learn,'"

338
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,139
"'would that not be a pleasure?'"

339
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:33,639
"'Even if no one notices, you need not be upset.'"

340
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,709
"'That is a true scholar.'"

341
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:37,239
Your Highness.

342
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,949
The Queen urgently needs you at the palace.

343
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,649
Right now?

344
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,820
"He considered it beautiful,"

345
00:24:47,949 --> 00:24:51,020
"and followed harmony with all things big and small,"

346
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,129
"but still, sometimes, things did not go as he wished."

347
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:03,340
There is no mountain path on the way to the palace.

348
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:09,040
Stop the palanquin.

349
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,250
What is the matter?

350
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,379
I need to relieve myself,

351
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,250
and there is no chamber pot.

352
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,329
I would feel embarrassed.

353
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:30,859
Stay three steps away and turn your back to me.

354
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,129
Yes, Your Highness.

355
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,280
Ha Na!

356
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,949
Beat it and get the dirt out!

357
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:55,090
I get eczema from just washing my hands.

358
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:57,820
- Will you let me off? - I cannot.

359
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,829
You need to practice because I cannot wash your clothes...

360
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,290
when you marry.

361
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,399
Fine.

362
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,529
You must do this forever once you marry.

363
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,730
Why practice already?

364
00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:11,669
Do your thing and catch a pheasant.

365
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,209
Watching you is infuriating.

366
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,340
Shall I?

367
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:17,179
We should each do what we do best.

368
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:20,379
See you later.

369
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:24,879
Be careful!

370
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,030
He ran away!

371
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,669
Over there!

372
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:14,869
Stop!

373
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:03,919
That way.

374
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,889
Are you all right?

375
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,219
I will be if you move.

376
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,300
You helped me with your slingshot.

377
00:29:07,709 --> 00:29:08,709
Ha Na.

378
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,449
Who is he?

379
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:17,590
He looks lost.

380
00:29:18,959 --> 00:29:19,990
I see.

381
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,959
Kid. Where do you live?

382
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,530
I cannot tell you.

383
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,639
I do not wish to know.

384
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,740
- Let us go home. - Okay.

385
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,840
Wait.

386
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,409
You saved me, so I am your responsibility now.

387
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,020
I must be responsible?

388
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,178
O Bong, sit up straight and write.

389
00:30:17,179 --> 00:30:19,019
Look at your terrible writing.

390
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,919
- Oh, thank you. - How terrible.

391
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:23,490
My lord.

392
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,419
There is no time to rest.

393
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,560
I am coming.

394
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,030
They say you can tell when a person is missing.

395
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,000
One less lieutenant is slowing us down a great deal.

396
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,500
I also do not feel like working without him around.

397
00:30:40,409 --> 00:30:41,840
Write with your hands, not your mouths.

398
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,339
The story comes out tomorrow.

399
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,179
Speed up, everyone.

400
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,850
Halt.

401
00:30:49,619 --> 00:30:51,079
We release the story tomorrow,

402
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:53,349
and we must all spend the night here, you said.

403
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:54,889
Where are you going?

404
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:57,189
Well...

405
00:30:57,790 --> 00:31:01,128
I will visit the Virtuous Lady where we will release the story.

406
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:03,459
I will see you all later.

407
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:05,129
Wait, but I...

408
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,770
The crown...

409
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,009
The young master disappeared? How?

410
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,080
He caught on and got away.

411
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,909
He must be within the capital.

412
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,520
How many capital district officers can we gather?

413
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,289
It is late, but we can muster about 30 men.

414
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,649
I will call on them now.

415
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,260
You cannot do that.

416
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,619
If you summon official guards,

417
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:36,329
people will notice, and it could work against us later on.

418
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,000
Are you saying we should sit and wait?

419
00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:42,399
I talked to a merchant I know...

420
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,139
and had him look for the young master in secret.

421
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:48,109
The most urgent matter now...

422
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:51,639
is to silence the bodyguard we hired.

423
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:53,909
I will take care of that.

424
00:32:01,189 --> 00:32:02,519
I suggest...

425
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,919
you return to the Capital District Office at once.

426
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,628
If the Crown Prince is in the village,

427
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:08,790
people may take him to the government office.

428
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,330
Yes, I will be leaving then.

429
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:20,240
Then I shall go and check on Sam Wol's mother.

430
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:22,439
Sure.

431
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,419
I told them to go and find him.

432
00:32:41,429 --> 00:32:43,300
Mother, I heard you asked for me.

433
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,500
I am quite tired today.

434
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,570
You need not come to my chambers to wish me a good night.

435
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:50,199
Make sure Geun Seok goes to bed early too.

436
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,909
I hope you are not feeling sick.

437
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:58,040
I am just a little tired. Do not worry.

438
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,689
Hey, kiddo. Is it not this house either?

439
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,959
My name is not "kiddo."

440
00:33:17,929 --> 00:33:19,060
I am Yi Jae.

441
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:22,300
You can state your name so clearly.

442
00:33:22,969 --> 00:33:24,398
How come you do not know where your home is?

443
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,469
Because it is my first time...

444
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:28,209
visiting my maternal grandfather.

445
00:33:28,669 --> 00:33:30,980
Also, the streets look different as night has befallen.

446
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:33,878
The curfew hours will begin soon.

447
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,310
I will take you to the Capital District Office.

448
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,580
Come along.

449
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,810
I cannot believe you brought that kid to our house!

450
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,418
If that stupid boy does not know where his home is,

451
00:34:10,419 --> 00:34:12,079
you should just take him to the Capital District Office!

452
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,920
How dare you call me stupid?

453
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:16,920
We did go to the Capital District Office.

454
00:34:18,259 --> 00:34:20,190
The Minister of Defence was there.

455
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,860
He does not like me because I beat the petitioner's drum.

456
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:24,859
If I show up with a boy he does not recognize...

457
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,729
He will spread rumours that this boy is your secret child.

458
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,330
How dare you spew such nonsense?

459
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,940
Do you know who my parents are?

460
00:34:31,799 --> 00:34:33,069
Who are your parents?

461
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:36,068
Yes, you are old enough. How could you not know where your home is?

462
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:38,178
Did you raise your voice at me just now?

463
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,908
You raised your voice first!

464
00:34:39,909 --> 00:34:41,080
That is enough, both of you.

465
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,679
The curfew bell has rung, so we have no choice.

466
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,250
He will sleep here tonight.

467
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,130
I am done.

468
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,040
Well done, my lady.

469
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:09,710
Gosh.

470
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,420
Come out for a moment.

471
00:35:18,779 --> 00:35:20,819
We are almost done here. I cannot step out now.

472
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:56,150
Lady Sam Soon truly is a natural-born storyteller.

473
00:36:06,529 --> 00:36:07,929
What is your name?

474
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:15,270
Do you not wish to tell me?

475
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,310
Or do you not have a name?

476
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:25,048
No one else has ever asked me my name...

477
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:27,489
since I began working as a peddler.

478
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,659
Then you should be honoured.

479
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:36,060
Let me ask you again. What is your name?

480
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,199
My name is...

481
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,810
Soon Duk.

482
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:49,909
Soon Duk.

483
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,639
That is a pretty name.

484
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,750
How old are you?

485
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,980
I am two years older than you.

486
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:00,389
So, you are 27.

487
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,460
How do you know my age?

488
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,290
You were born in the Year of the Monkey, were you not?

489
00:37:07,529 --> 00:37:09,929
You are famous in Hanyang.

490
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,659
Goodness.

491
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,900
As the Man of Anger?

492
00:37:15,069 --> 00:37:16,440
This is not fair.

493
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,440
I wish to know more about you too.

494
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,040
What do you want to know?

495
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,040
Everything about you.

496
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:48,670
What for?

497
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,040
Once this matchmaking project is completed,

498
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,210
we will never see each other again.

499
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,210
I am going out for a walk. Would you like to join me?

500
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,339
(Restricted Area, Trespassers Will Be Executed)

501
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:36,818
(Trespassers who enter the restricted area shall be executed.)

502
00:38:36,819 --> 00:38:38,880
This is a restricted area.

503
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,719
No one is allowed to enter this area. Am I wrong?

504
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,759
But no one else is around, so it is perfect for a night stroll.

505
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,339
I wonder...

506
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,610
if the King knows about this restricted area here.

507
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,980
What do you mean?

508
00:39:07,279 --> 00:39:10,179
Because this area is blocked, people have to make a detour.

509
00:39:10,819 --> 00:39:12,618
If the King blocked it off knowing that,

510
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,389
it means he failed to understand his people's needs.

511
00:39:15,449 --> 00:39:18,360
If he does not know about it at all, it means he is an incompetent king.

512
00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:29,529
I enjoy admiring the view from here at this time of night.

513
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:35,969
The palace looks very peaceful from here.

514
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Yes, how did it go?

515
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,960
They sent a messenger.

516
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,429
They have not found the Crown Prince yet.

517
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:02,830
This is not good.

518
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,799
I must let His Majesty know.

519
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:10,009
The Crown Prince was kidnapped from the private house?

520
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,380
It is all my fault.

521
00:40:12,179 --> 00:40:13,980
What if something bad happens to the Crown Prince?

522
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:18,380
Summon the investigator at the Department of Justice now.

523
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:19,779
Yes, Your Majesty.

524
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,500
(Ogyeongsamjeom: The night time curfew ends at 4am.)

525
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:52,920
It is time to mobilize your private army.

526
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,649
Now? Knowing that the soldiers...

527
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:57,360
from the Department of Justice are combing every street?

528
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,758
It was the Queen...

529
00:40:58,759 --> 00:41:01,988
who sent the Crown Prince to the private residence in secret.

530
00:41:01,989 --> 00:41:04,759
So if something bad happens to him, it is all on her.

531
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,210
That house at the end of the street is where you live?

532
00:41:54,549 --> 00:41:55,850
It is that way. Get him!

533
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,250
Stop right there!

534
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,060
If something bad happens to the Crown Prince...

535
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,969
Two ladies are here to see you.

536
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,170
Mother!

537
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:27,178
My goodness. You are... Gosh.

538
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:30,449
My dear, what happened? Are you all right?

539
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,629
The curfew hours had begun, so I let him sleep at my house.

540
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,269
But everything was different including the bedding,

541
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:51,170
so he barely slept. He must be exhausted.

542
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:53,139
Thank you for saving my child.

543
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,239
Could you kindly identify yourself?

544
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,380
I am Maeng Ha Na from the Mount Nam Valley.

545
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:02,150
Are you the eldest one of the three spinster sisters?

546
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:03,979
You are the brave lady...

547
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,080
who beat the petitioner's drum to report the Minister of Defence.

548
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,650
I wanted to meet you.

549
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,850
By the way,

550
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:13,119
how did you come up with the idea of putting a skirt on my son?

551
00:43:14,529 --> 00:43:15,759
Before I answer that,

552
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,199
I wish to ask you a question first.

553
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,630
It seems like he is from a prestigious family.

554
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,069
Why is it that he has these men after him?

555
00:43:27,509 --> 00:43:30,679
Am I helping a traitor, by any chance?

556
00:43:31,210 --> 00:43:32,339
I am concerned.

557
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,980
You need not be concerned.

558
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,219
He is the eldest son of the family, but I had him at an old age.

559
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,189
But my husband's concubine and her adult son...

560
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:42,049
who are after the family's money schemed together...

561
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:46,389
and tried to hurt him. That is all.

562
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,329
I was afraid the assassin who was after your son yesterday...

563
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:56,069
might still be around, so I disguised him as a girl.

564
00:43:57,699 --> 00:43:59,638
Thankfully, the Crown Prince returned to the palace safely,

565
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:00,908
but someone tried to kidnap him.

566
00:44:00,909 --> 00:44:02,440
Yet, you say we should not launch an investigation?

567
00:44:03,739 --> 00:44:06,980
Chief Royal Secretary, are you in your right mind now?

568
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:10,880
If the King goes public with how the Crown Prince was nearly kidnapped,

569
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,420
it will present us with an opportunity.

570
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:17,119
We can use that to depose the Queen.

571
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,060
If you go public with it, the left state councillor...

572
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:22,658
will hold Her Highness the Queen accountable for sending...

573
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:25,299
the Crown Prince to the private residence without permission...

574
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,569
and insist that Her Highness be deposed.

575
00:44:29,429 --> 00:44:30,770
Once the Queen is deposed,

576
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,999
there will be no one left in the palace...

577
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,339
to protect the young Crown Prince,

578
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:37,409
so the situation is certainly in our favour.

579
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:40,310
I am the King of this country,

580
00:44:40,650 --> 00:44:43,210
and yet I cannot even track down the one who tried to kidnap my son?

581
00:44:45,279 --> 00:44:47,020
What about the missing Crown Prince Protection Officer?

582
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,218
We are doing our best to track him down at the moment.

583
00:44:50,219 --> 00:44:53,219
We must find people who can provide us with evidence.

584
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,060
I hear the court maid at Dongungjeon...

585
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:58,830
is becoming more ill, just like the late princess.

586
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:03,369
I believe she holds the first key to solving this case.

587
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,670
I will look for a way to get her treated.

588
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:13,040
You are here.

589
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:15,650
- Hello. - Hello. Please go inside.

590
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:19,750
- Yes. - You must be so excited.

591
00:45:20,989 --> 00:45:22,619
- Hello. - You are here.

592
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,060
Let us go inside.

593
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,619
Oh, you are here.

594
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:28,259
Yes, go on in.

595
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:34,969
My lord.

596
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:37,439
I will let down the blinds,

597
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:39,440
but you might get nervous in front of all the ladies.

598
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,139
Do not look up. Keep your eyes on the book and just read aloud.

599
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,639
You seem more nervous than I am.

600
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,409
I am ready. We may begin.

601
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,880
Okay.

602
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,860
One moment.

603
00:46:07,869 --> 00:46:09,429
It was lopsided.

604
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:16,409
I fixed it.

605
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:37,629
Thank you all for joining us...

606
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:41,069
as we reveal Volume 3 of "The Lady's Private Life" for the 1st time.

607
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,699
I would also like to thank the Virtuous Lady for organizing this.

608
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,540
- Thank you. - Thank you.

609
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:51,278
Hwa Rok who has never revealed himself before...

610
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:53,779
is here to recite Volume Three for all of you.

611
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:56,948
- Oh, my. - Hwa Rok is truly here?

612
00:46:56,949 --> 00:47:00,290
We will keep the veil down to protect his identity.

613
00:47:00,549 --> 00:47:04,289
Please stay seated, and do not leave your seats.

614
00:47:04,290 --> 00:47:06,319
- Of course. - Sure thing.

615
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:08,690
All right, then. We will get started now.

616
00:47:21,569 --> 00:47:23,679
- It is him. - Oh, my.

617
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,919
Volume Three of "The Lady's Private Life,"

618
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,080
titles as "The Story of Lady Cho Hee,"

619
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:36,290
is based on true events.

620
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,589
He looks just like the image of Hwa Rok I had imagined.

621
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,830
"That night, the sky was pitch-black without the moon in sight."

622
00:48:10,619 --> 00:48:13,419
"When more than five young ladies fell ill for an unknown reason..."

623
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,589
"right before their weddings,"

624
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:18,199
"the villagers hired a shaman to conduct a ritual and prayed."

625
00:48:18,529 --> 00:48:21,170
"However, the misfortunes did not stop."

626
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:24,540
"Consequently, more and more families..."

627
00:48:24,799 --> 00:48:26,270
"had to postpone..."

628
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:28,569
"their daughters' weddings."

629
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,739
How pretty.

630
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:36,049
You have to visit us often even after you get married.

631
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:37,580
Of course.

632
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:40,749
When did you prepare all this, Dool Soon?

633
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,920
She is getting married?

634
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,759
I suppose she is not afraid of the virgin ghost.

635
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:48,259
"But Ho Na in the Mount Nam Valley did not postpone her wedding,"

636
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,159
"and a malicious rumour..."

637
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,360
"that she could not postpone it because she was pregnant..."

638
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,469
"was spreading among the villagers."

639
00:49:23,799 --> 00:49:25,059
"Ho Na instinctively knew..."

640
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:27,630
"that the virgin ghost was Cho Hee, her deceased friend."

641
00:49:28,069 --> 00:49:29,429
"So instead of postponing her wedding,"

642
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:31,540
"she reached out to the Lady for help..."

643
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,270
"and was waiting for the ghost with her."

644
00:49:37,069 --> 00:49:39,440
("The Lady's Private Life," Volume Three)

645
00:49:57,929 --> 00:49:59,029
("The Lady's Private Life")

646
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:03,369
People say my brother is the murderer in this novel?

647
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,269
In the novel, the politician's sister is portrayed...

648
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:06,468
as Royal Noble Consort Suk.

649
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:08,270
I believe that is what caused the rumour.

650
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:11,739
I cannot believe such a false rumour is spreading at this unsettled time.

651
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,380
I heard it with my own ears.

652
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,278
The Minister of Defence wanted Maeng Ha Na to be his concubine,

653
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:17,749
so he spread the rumour that she was jumping men...

654
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:19,779
because she was possessed by a virgin ghost.

655
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:20,888
That is insane.

656
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:22,888
- My gosh. - I heard Hwa Rok...

657
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,659
wore a green robe to commemorate Cho Ok.

658
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:29,290
By the way, is it true that Hwa Rok is retiring as an author?

659
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,928
I hear his father is a powerful nobleman.

660
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:32,460
He cannot write anymore, for he now has a government title.

661
00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:36,298
All right. You are number 28,

662
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:38,068
which means you will have to wait for about eight days.

663
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,739
("The Lady's Private Life," Volume Three)

664
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:42,639
Re-read the first two volumes, and you can enjoy it even more.

665
00:50:42,739 --> 00:50:44,338
So to sum it up,

666
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:45,879
while Lady Cho Ok was waiting...

667
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:49,679
for her fiancé to wrap up his father's three-year funeral,

668
00:50:49,750 --> 00:50:52,179
the Defence Minister tried to take advantage of her and killed her?

669
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,048
Do you remember the stories in Volume 1 and 2?

670
00:50:57,049 --> 00:50:58,089
(The Defence Minister's wife)

671
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:00,089
Even so, I suggest you read them again.

672
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,190
Get out.

673
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:14,839
I would like to read Volume Three of "The Lady's Private Life."

674
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,739
There are many people waiting for it, so you will have to wait.

675
00:51:21,449 --> 00:51:22,580
How much would be enough?

676
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:25,779
I wish to buy every single copy of the book.

677
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,290
The bad rumours about Ha Na have died down.

678
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,659
Everyone is busy criticizing the Defence Minister.

679
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:34,360
Lady Yeoju, thank you.

680
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,330
Thank you all for your help.

681
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,569
We managed to bury the rumours with another rumour,

682
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:46,000
but I think it will be hard to punish the Minister of Defence.

683
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,170
That is okay.

684
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,540
Everyone knows anyway.

685
00:51:50,739 --> 00:51:52,139
That he is a murderer.

686
00:51:52,779 --> 00:51:54,980
All sinners must be punished.

687
00:51:55,350 --> 00:51:57,778
We should file a petition with what Lieutenant Jung has found out...

688
00:51:57,779 --> 00:51:59,219
No, we cannot do that.

689
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:01,790
If we do that,

690
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:04,560
Lieutenant Jung...

691
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,429
could get in trouble.

692
00:52:13,259 --> 00:52:15,929
Everyone, do not worry.

693
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:19,239
I know how we can punish the Minister of Defence.

694
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,420
("The Lady's Private Life")

695
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,020
I thought you should know...

696
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:38,920
what everyone had been talking about, Mother.

697
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:42,659
Most rumours are false.

698
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,960
You need not believe every rumour.

699
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,130
I know that,

700
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,500
but I saw it.

701
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:52,040
On Uncle Bok Ki's birthday, I saw him...

702
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:54,839
dragging Lady Cho Ok to his room.

703
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,138
Ignoring a rumour...

704
00:53:00,139 --> 00:53:02,409
and feigning ignorance are two very different things, Mother.

705
00:53:15,259 --> 00:53:17,960
My lady, the Minister of Defence is here.

706
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:28,439
If it is up to the wise Mother,

707
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,880
she will be able to punish Uncle.

708
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:39,080
Sister. Why did you call for me tonight?

709
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:42,150
("The Lady's Private Life")

710
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:45,790
What were you doing that you let such rumours spread?

711
00:53:46,819 --> 00:53:49,388
I told you to watch yourself after the drum scandal.

712
00:53:49,389 --> 00:53:50,829
This is such a crucial time.

713
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:53,299
What is this? Why did it make you mad?

714
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:54,869
("The Lady's Private Life")

715
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:56,130
What the...

716
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:06,940
What should I do?

717
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:14,619
Step down from your position right away.

718
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:16,449
Sister. That is ridiculous.

719
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:20,459
I will take care of this matter myself.

720
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,659
Sister, please!

721
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,738
Writing an erotic novel...

722
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,940
is a shameful thing that scholars want to hide.

723
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,979
He did not use his real name, and I did not question him.

724
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:42,710
I really do not know who Hwa Rok is.

725
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,449
Do you think you are without guilt even if you do not know?

726
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,619
What guilt? This is unfair.

727
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:53,658
Because the lieutenant at the Capital District Office...

728
00:54:53,659 --> 00:54:56,159
said he must catch Hwa Rok,

729
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,529
we only loaned out the novels at his request.

730
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,829
A lieutenant from the Capital District Office?

731
00:55:00,830 --> 00:55:01,869
Yes!

732
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:05,540
It will put Lieutenant Jung in danger, no?

733
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,569
That shall not be the case.

734
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:11,839
Since our follow-up plan will be perfect.

735
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:14,879
Before the Minister of Defence looks for you,

736
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,250
go and make the report first.

737
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,759
(Capital District Office)

738
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:29,489
Oh, my.

739
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,630
Minister Park, what brings you here at this hour?

740
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,900
Are you the lieutenant who is meeting Hwa Rok in secret?

741
00:55:40,069 --> 00:55:42,639
Tomorrow, at the shed near the misty cliff,

742
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:44,940
I plan to meet Hwa Rok to arrest him.

743
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:47,310
Why tomorrow, and not today?

744
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,009
Hwa Rok is an extremely cautious person.

745
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:52,349
If I change the date, he will be suspicious.

746
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:54,589
That may cause him to not turn up at all.

747
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,218
Even His Majesty told us to catch him at all costs.

748
00:56:00,219 --> 00:56:02,729
The Capital District Office is paying special attention.

749
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:03,989
Please do not worry.

750
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,759
Even His Majesty knows about it?

751
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:10,270
Darn it.

752
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:26,549
Are you Hwa Rok?

753
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:32,790
Yes. I am Hwa Rok.

754
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,159
You are suspected of murdering Lee Cho Ok.

755
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,000
Darn it!

756
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,299
Wait, stop there!

757
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:50,509
It is too dangerous for Lady Sam Soon.

758
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,040
Well...

759
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,779
If I am with Lieutenant Jung,

760
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:57,619
I will be able to do anything.

761
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:02,690
My, I cannot be here. My face is burning up.

762
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,920
She is so direct.

763
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:08,359
She will be in danger as the court is invested in this case,

764
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:09,889
so I will not be acting alone.

765
00:57:13,699 --> 00:57:14,699
Mr. Hwa Rok?

766
00:57:16,969 --> 00:57:18,369
Do not worry.

767
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:20,369
The one acting as Hwa Rok...

768
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:22,969
shall be me.

769
00:57:25,739 --> 00:57:27,880
(The Shed)

770
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,020
Mr. Hwa Rok?

771
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:42,758
Since I am a speedy runner, I will run out by the back door...

772
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,659
and flee to the misty cliff.

773
00:58:18,259 --> 00:58:20,329
When I arrive at the misty cliff,

774
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:23,068
Lieutenant Jung will shout, "You cannot escape any further."

775
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:25,199
"Surrender."

776
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:27,868
That will be my signal to jump into the river.

777
00:58:27,869 --> 00:58:29,270
(The Misty Cliff)

778
00:58:32,839 --> 00:58:34,279
You cannot escape any further.

779
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,080
Surrender.

780
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:43,449
Wait! That cannot happen!

781
00:58:45,819 --> 00:58:47,020
(The Misty Cliff)

782
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,799
What is the matter now?

783
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:58,839
I mean, is it not too dangerous for Lady Yeoju as well?

784
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:03,310
Gosh, everyone except me is looking out for their love.

785
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:04,710
Lieutenant Jung, you...

786
00:59:05,540 --> 00:59:07,080
Do not worry.

787
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,710
Just like my running, I am exceptional at swimming.

788
00:59:10,310 --> 00:59:12,419
Is there anyone here other than Lieutenant Jung...

789
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,750
who can swim as well? Tell me.

790
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:17,149
How did you know I can swim?

791
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,219
Because you...

792
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:25,428
Since I have keen eyes,

793
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:27,429
I could tell from your straight shoulders.

794
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:32,069
Well, we are pretty... dissimilar.

795
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:36,138
Since Lieutenant Jung has to chase Hwa Rok,

796
00:59:36,139 --> 00:59:37,810
I should be the one to jump.

797
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,238
Mr. O Bong, you will then throw the body...

798
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:42,110
you prepared into the river.

799
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:44,420
End of operation.

800
00:59:44,850 --> 00:59:45,879
(The Misty Cliff)

801
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:47,949
Is the body ready?

802
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:51,118
Yes. The burial monk that Lady Yeoju mentioned...

803
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:53,290
has given me the body of a dead beggar.

804
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,329
He has been robed in green...

805
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:57,159
and will be brought to the river tomorrow.

806
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,730
Everyone, stay calm.

807
00:59:59,799 --> 01:00:02,630
Let us do our best in our own roles.

808
01:00:41,869 --> 01:00:43,270
You cannot escape any further.

809
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:44,980
Surrender.

810
01:01:14,739 --> 01:01:16,440
I shall teach you a lesson.

811
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,110
Looking back,

812
01:02:26,940 --> 01:02:29,310
I had already made up my mind then.

813
01:02:31,619 --> 01:02:32,750
To marry...

814
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:35,719
Lady Yeoju.

815
01:02:44,759 --> 01:02:47,759
(The Matchmakers)

816
01:03:07,319 --> 01:03:10,118
Lord Gyeongunjae, do you like Lady Yeoju?

817
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,360
- No! - Have you lost it?

818
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:16,130
I am glad that I was the injured one, and not you.

819
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,659
- Is your arm all right? - It is nothing at all.

820
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:24,269
Eight years ago, the princess was also...

821
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:28,170
Rather than a hypothesis, I need concrete proof.

822
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,169
Mother knew?

823
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:32,239
I thought you were a master at love.

824
01:03:32,739 --> 01:03:34,678
Why are you a widow?

825
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,448
There was a wanted poster.

826
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:38,520
It said that Lady Yeoju was a murderer.

827
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,170
(The Matchmakers)
