(Lee Si Yeol)

7
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,629
Marriage is a matter between two families,

8
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,770
so I will marry a woman whom my parents decide on.

9
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:10,640
- I will take this. - Sure.

10
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,979
My ideal type is the woman my mother decides on.

11
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,809
I will take one more of the same design.

(Jo Ye Jin, 17 years old Note: A lonely wine lover)

13
00:01:29,059 --> 00:01:31,890
My husband had been decided since before I was born.

14
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,500
He must be the son of the top one percent of the nobility.

15
00:01:35,699 --> 00:01:37,769
If his family was not as prominent,

16
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,399
it would be all right if he came in first in the state exam.

17
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:45,169
My ideal type?

18
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,780
The smartest man among the ones who meet the prior qualifications.

19
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:53,050
And, of course, he must be as well-conducted as I am.

("The Restless Lady," "The Lady's Affection")

21
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,830
There is something my mother always says.

22
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,329
"One's family is the only thing that can protect a woman,"

23
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,840
"and a woman is the one who protects the family."

24
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,699
Pardon?

25
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:20,569
Marrying for love is insanity.

(Episode 8: Life Is Unpredictable, Therefore, Life Is Meaningful)

27
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,120
Thank you for your trouble.

28
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:33,649
You will no longer be harassed by the Minister of Defence...

29
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,918
after today.

30
00:02:34,919 --> 00:02:36,060
It was not much trouble.

31
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,590
The minister's wife bought up the books,

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,630
so it was a profitable business.

33
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,069
What about you, Lady Jung? He is an elder of your family.

34
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,529
Are you sure you are okay?

35
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,068
Nobody will find out about me.

36
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,699
There is nothing to worry about.

37
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,738
Also, the motto of my life was...

38
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,738
that someone who did wrong must be punished.

39
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:59,549
You have the same motto as the lady of "The Lady's Private Life."

40
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,548
But I am a bit nervous as this is the D-day.

41
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:06,918
Nobody came by, right?

42
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,160
They had all stopped by already.

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,160
What?

44
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:12,160
I heard the plan was pulled up by two hours.

45
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,530
- Have you not heard? - What?

46
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,630
I do not know anything about it. What was pulled up?

47
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:34,280
I shall teach you a lesson.

48
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,879
Goodness, my lord.

49
00:04:37,379 --> 00:04:39,280
My lord.

50
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:41,950
Wake up, my lord!

51
00:04:50,619 --> 00:04:51,629
What?

52
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,460
I am fine.

53
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:59,629
Goodness. Oh, no.

54
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,109
My goodness.

55
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,580
Why are you crying?

56
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,650
Are you hurt?

57
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,249
Have you lost your mind?

58
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:23,559
Why did you jump in? You cannot even swim!

59
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
Well...

60
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:31,700
I learned to swim last night.

61
00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:35,169
What?

62
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:54,520
Wait, so you are saying...

63
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,789
you learned how to swim from books?

64
00:05:59,989 --> 00:06:01,760
I would have done a perfect job...

65
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:04,530
if only I hadn't been shot with an arrow.

66
00:06:18,049 --> 00:06:21,010
- I heard I had to stop the blood... - Did your brother say that?

67
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,890
Yes.

68
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,419
You are right.

69
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:35,859
I am relieved I was hurt...

70
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,129
instead of you.

71
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:50,780
My lord!

72
00:06:55,549 --> 00:06:56,819
Goodness, my lord!

73
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,418
I heard you were shot with an arrow.

74
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,719
Good grief, will you stay still? That hurts.

75
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,988
So why did you insist on jumping in instead of Lady Yeoju...

76
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:07,358
and ended up suffering like this?

77
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,728
Goodness.

78
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,160
I am glad everyone is fine.

79
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
Hey.

80
00:07:17,369 --> 00:07:18,410
What?

81
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:21,510
Wait, who are you?

82
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:24,850
Who do you think? She is Lady Yeoju.

83
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,710
What?

84
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,119
Wait, where is she going?

85
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:36,889
- Goodness, my lord. - That hurts!

86
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:39,590
- You were shot here? - Do not touch me!

87
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,659
It is the left side, you punk.

88
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,358
- Goodness. - Gosh, my lord.

89
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:45,429
I am done for.

90
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,929
You are Soon Duk, right?

91
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,368
I will explain everything later,

92
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,669
so please do not say anything now.

93
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,839
If Lord Gyeongunjae finds out...

94
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,439
I am the daughter-in-law of the Left State Councillor,

95
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:57,950
I will get arrested.

96
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,749
Have you been playing Lady Yeoju all along?

97
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,849
Exactly.

98
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:07,249
You never noticed me, your only sister.

99
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,918
What is this?

100
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,260
What are Lieutenant Jung and Lady Yeoju discussing for so long?

101
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:17,799
- I am... - You are sorry, right?

102
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:19,498
Then please help me this once...

103
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,700
and patch up this matter with Lord Gyeongunjae.

104
00:08:22,539 --> 00:08:24,970
- Goodbye. - Wait, Soon Duk.

105
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,479
Good grief.

106
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:36,850
Lord Gyeongunjae, you must leave this place now.

107
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,519
The officers who are after Hwa Rok will arrive here soon.

108
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,090
Okay.

109
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:47,489
Wait, where is Lady Yeoju going?

110
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,629
Something urgent came up, so she left first.

111
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,799
Please stay inside and do not get together...

112
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,600
until this incident is resolved.

113
00:08:58,369 --> 00:08:59,369
Okay.

114
00:09:01,409 --> 00:09:04,179
What have you been up to lately...

115
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,080
that you were hit with an arrow?

116
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,779
He has gone head over heels for a woman.

117
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,219
I could not share any details,

118
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,820
- but it was not a bad thing... - Goodness.

119
00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:19,559
You should be relieved for whoever that did this.

120
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,628
You received great first aid,

121
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:25,399
so you would get well soon if you took your medicine.

122
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,930
Good grief.

123
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,899
I am relieved I was hurt...

124
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,200
instead of you.

125
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,009
Are you in your room, Soon Duk?

126
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,999
I stopped by to discuss something about Ye Jin.

127
00:10:33,229 --> 00:10:34,570
What about her?

128
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,739
She became quite sensitive lately, so I was worried.

129
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:42,139
Women become very emotional right before their marriage.

130
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,450
If that was the case, everything would be fine,

131
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,609
but it felt like something else.

132
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,389
Can you summon her and ask what is on her mind?

133
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,889
She shares her heart with you.

134
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:58,590
Yes, I understand, Mother.

135
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,829
The writer of that novel, Hwa Rok,

136
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,330
died during the arrest?

137
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,070
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,569
I told you time and time again to capture him alive,

139
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,339
for I needed to find out if the rumours were true.

140
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:11,809
Lieutenant Jung of the Capital held an undercover operation...

141
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,440
to arrest Hwa Rok,

142
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:16,439
but the Minister of Defence showed up with armed officers...

143
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,878
and suddenly shot an arrow.

144
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,518
Hwa Rok's body fell under a cliff,

145
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,549
then it was found in the Hour of Chicken.

146
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,749
(Hour of Chicken: Between 5pm to 7pm)

147
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,060
This is Hwa Rok.

148
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,269
Wait.

149
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:42,440
Lieutenant Jung of the Capital is Minister of Defence's in-law.

150
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,268
Yes, he is.

151
00:11:44,269 --> 00:11:47,908
And Minister of Defence killed the one who exposed his murder...

152
00:11:47,909 --> 00:11:50,179
by shooting an arrow during the arrest.

153
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,649
It means he confirmed this awful rumour was true.

154
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,450
That seems like the case,

155
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,549
but it is not easy to prove the authenticity of the matter...

156
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,489
as Hwa Rok, the writer of the novel, has passed away.

157
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:04,388
A rumour this severe can be considered as my people's sentiment.

158
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,290
I may be able to dismiss him over this hearsay.

159
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,459
- Is that not the case? - However,

160
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,169
if the minister was dismissed by using the novel as the reason,

161
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,799
this could become a precedent.

162
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,169
In the future, there will come many...

163
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,939
who forge provocative stories...

164
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,810
for their own benefit.

165
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:23,009
- Right. - Yes.

166
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,080
Why do you always stop me from doing things?

167
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,180
I am done.

168
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,158
The novelist is now dead.

169
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,859
There will not be a problem anymore.

170
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,830
I still believe you must step down from your office.

171
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,629
My sister, everyone...

172
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,799
will forget about that petty novel over time.

173
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,269
After this incident,

174
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,200
the King began to look upon us with suspicion.

175
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:54,439
You should step down from your office...

176
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,379
and show remorse...

177
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:00,079
to recover the reputation of Royal Noble Consort Suk...

178
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,249
and Prince Jinsung, which you tarnished.

179
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:08,290
My dear, I have a different idea.

180
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,029
You are not well-versed in politics, so you would not know.

181
00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:16,129
But in politics, power is more important than reputation.

182
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:18,199
If the Minister of Defence stepped down now,

183
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,930
it would mean he admitted to his crimes.

184
00:13:20,029 --> 00:13:22,970
Then, his office will be filled with someone from Namjang Faction.

185
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,810
After that, I will lose my place in the royal court.

186
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,570
I will not have enough power...

187
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:31,080
to help enthrone Prince Jinsung.

188
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,149
You are more than right.

189
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:46,930
You need to stop working as a matchmaker.

190
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:54,729
Did you bring me...

191
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:57,600
a basket full of unripe plums to tell me that?

192
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,239
This was not the first time I went around making matches.

193
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,008
Do not worry.

194
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,779
Matchmaking is not the problem.

195
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,619
If the Minister of Defence's family finds out about what you did,

196
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,090
getting kicked out of this house would not be the end of it.

197
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,759
How would they find out?

198
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,429
You did not know I was Lady Yeoju...

199
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,528
until I fell in the water.

200
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,999
But I know now. You need to stop.

201
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,769
It is too dangerous.

202
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:32,070
I will stop after this one.

203
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:38,080
This matchmaking project is very important for Lord Gyeongunjae.

204
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:40,409
It was the King's order.

205
00:14:41,409 --> 00:14:44,420
Wait, do you have feelings for him?

206
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:47,950
What? Have you lost your mind?

207
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,959
I may go around looking like this,

208
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,889
but I am still a noblewoman who keeps only one husband.

209
00:14:52,729 --> 00:14:53,859
My husband is...

210
00:14:55,859 --> 00:14:57,100
the only one for me.

211
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,869
Soon Duk.

212
00:15:08,009 --> 00:15:09,079
Well...

213
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:12,009
My brother came by to give me plums. He is leaving now.

214
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,310
Hello.

215
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:15,680
Have you been well?

216
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,690
Are you on your way back to the main quarter?

217
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,159
Yes, to bid Mother a good night.

218
00:15:23,359 --> 00:15:24,389
You should just leave.

219
00:15:24,989 --> 00:15:27,090
Things there seem very cold right now.

220
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:31,060
My uncle on Mother's side is here because of recent rumours.

221
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,700
You should just go back today.

222
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,340
Thank you for letting me know.

223
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:40,739
You should go home today.

224
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:44,009
I will find the right moment to let Mother know you were here.

225
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,580
All right.

226
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,649
Do not forget my words.

227
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,379
Goodness. When did you bring this here?

228
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:24,850
What is the problem, Ye Jin?

229
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,430
I do not think I wish to get married.

230
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:36,499
Why not? I am sure you have a reason.

231
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,629
Well...

232
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:43,898
It is embarrassing to marry while my uncle is...

233
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:46,009
caught up in this rumour.

234
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,579
Anyway, I feel frustrated...

235
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,909
whenever I think of marrying.

236
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:54,680
All I want to do is drink.

237
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
But you always want to drink.

238
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:03,560
Give me just a few days. I will take care of this.

239
00:17:06,930 --> 00:17:10,500
How will you take care of the matter of my heart?

240
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:12,868
I cannot let a bride...

241
00:17:12,869 --> 00:17:15,540
remain this gloomy after I make a match.

242
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:19,208
I will make a chance for you to meet your fiancé during the May Festival.

243
00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:20,209
Forget it.

244
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,979
This is a marriage of convenience anyway.

245
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,739
Even if I do not like him,

246
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,809
it is not like I can get a new groom.

247
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,080
Why should I meet him in advance?

248
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,919
You have no idea, do you?

249
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,688
Meeting him before marriage feels completely different...

250
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:36,189
from meeting him on the day of your wedding.

251
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,990
Wait until the May Festival.

252
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,138
Our next agenda is...

253
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:52,739
a request made to expel Park Bok Ki,

254
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,810
the Minister of Defence, over the recent scandalous rumour.

255
00:17:58,379 --> 00:17:59,409
Your Majesty.

256
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,418
I beg your pardon,

257
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:05,350
but we should not deem a fictional story for women...

258
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,889
as the people's sentiment.

259
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,520
Left State Councillor.

260
00:18:12,189 --> 00:18:14,729
How are you so sure that...

261
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,060
I am holding him responsible just because of that novel?

262
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,199
My goodness.

263
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,569
Since last year, we have received...

264
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:26,408
Letters of Appeals from the people of Mount Nam Valley...

265
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:28,309
over the no-passing zone in Mount Mokmyeok,

266
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,779
because they now have to take...

267
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,250
the long way round.

268
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,719
What brings you here this late?

269
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:45,658
While I was outside the palace,

270
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:48,230
I saw a prohibition sign in the middle of Mount Mokmyeok.

271
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,760
Is that so?

272
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,199
I saw that sign around here.

273
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,208
But there were no areas in Mount Mokmyeok...

274
00:19:00,209 --> 00:19:01,669
prohibited from entering by the state.

275
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:05,080
It seems like someone has put up that sign...

276
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,409
to cut down pine trees in the area to take profit.

277
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:13,689
Here.

278
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,559
It must have been tough to pull yourself together...

279
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,899
after the harsh incident you suddenly had to go through.

280
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:26,230
How did you come up with the idea to look for something like this?

281
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,069
Because this area is blocked, people have to make a detour.

282
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,938
If the King blocked it off knowing that,

283
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,809
it means he failed to understand his people's needs.

284
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,639
If he does not know about it at all, it means he is an incompetent king.

285
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:42,750
I will look into this matter as soon as the day breaks.

286
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,550
You should return and get some rest.

287
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,290
Yes, Your Majesty.

288
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,760
An investigation was conducted to confirm this matter,

289
00:19:50,959 --> 00:19:53,560
and the area was not prohibited by the state.

290
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,060
It was blocked off...

291
00:19:56,129 --> 00:19:59,600
for the minister's personal gain.

292
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:05,439
Your Majesty, I do not know what is going on.

293
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:07,740
It looks like my subordinates did not do something properly.

294
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,438
I shall look into this.

295
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:11,339
The Department of Justice already confirmed...

296
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,908
a pine tree in your garden was...

297
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:15,619
originally from the area.

298
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,718
If you did not know that, your incompetence is...

299
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,790
another good enough reason to dismiss you.

300
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:24,790
Do you not agree, Left State Councillor?

301
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,570
I was not the only one who cut down pine trees from there!

302
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,379
This is just my luck.

303
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,340
Goodness, I should have listened to my sister.

304
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,080
If I had stepped down, it would have been easier to return.

305
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,280
But I was dismissed.

306
00:20:54,719 --> 00:20:58,060
Let us begin our discussion by deciding who we should have...

307
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,590
as his replacement.

308
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:05,030
We should probably ask for Madame Park's idea.

309
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,600
What do you think?

310
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,149
Hello. You are here.

311
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:23,719
Well...

312
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,790
How is your injured arm?

313
00:21:28,419 --> 00:21:32,020
I am a man. This was not a big...

314
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
This was not a big deal.

315
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:39,229
I understand. You can stop now.

316
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:41,129
I can almost feel the pain in my arm.

317
00:22:09,199 --> 00:22:10,199
What?

318
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,929
Have you met with the groom candidates?

319
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,899
- Well... - Yes.

320
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:19,310
We have.

321
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,878
Thanks to the influence of the novel,

322
00:22:22,879 --> 00:22:25,708
they said they would prefer to be with old maids.

323
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:26,709
Now,

324
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,819
there will not be a big problem...

325
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,280
as soon as the ladies make up their minds.

326
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:32,418
I have a plan...

327
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,850
to help them make up their minds at the May Festival,

328
00:22:33,949 --> 00:22:36,560
but we need to replace one of the groom candidates.

329
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,359
Who are you going to replace without talking to me first?

330
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,060
For Lady Sam Soon, I thought...

331
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,179
Lieutenant Jung.

332
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,149
What brings you here?

333
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:06,619
I believe Operation Rumour Block has already ended.

334
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,830
It seemed like you were doing good work, Lord Gyeongunjae.

335
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,990
I would like to help out until this matchmaking is over.

336
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,770
Lady Sam Soon, what brings you here?

337
00:23:26,669 --> 00:23:28,510
I told her to remain home for a while.

338
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:34,480
You were here too, Lieutenant Jung.

339
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,419
- They... - Goodness.

340
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,990
Please stand further apart as you chat.

341
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,399
This match must turn out to be great if things are already going haywire.

342
00:24:12,389 --> 00:24:13,590
This must be the right house.

343
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:22,060
I prepared this to thank your hard work.

344
00:24:23,459 --> 00:24:25,259
You can thank us...

345
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,000
by letting your sisters marry instead of making this for us.

346
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:32,138
Of course, us sisters will also thank you...

347
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:33,510
by marrying someone.

348
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:36,239
This may be a sweet rice beverage,

349
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,179
but it is still a drink. Shall we make a toast?

350
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,349
For successful marriages!

351
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:43,179
- For marriages! - For marriages!

352
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,399
He is even more romantic...

353
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,369
than the characters in novels.

354
00:25:03,939 --> 00:25:05,000
What am I going to do?

355
00:25:05,439 --> 00:25:07,270
I like him so much.

356
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:14,409
She is smiling at just about anyone.

357
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,649
I smell danger.

358
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:23,219
Something will explode very soon.

359
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:26,059
One, two, three.

360
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,159
Lieutenant Jung, keep your distance from Lady Yeoju!

361
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:33,600
Goodness, do you feel pain in your chest again?

362
00:25:33,929 --> 00:25:36,040
Yes, I am in pain.

363
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:37,840
It seems like...

364
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:39,969
you two are in an inappropriate relationship.

365
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,108
Let us just keep it safe by switching your seat with O Bong.

366
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:48,149
That seems much better.

367
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,949
You are so obvious with your intentions.

368
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,760
- Over here. - Right.

369
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,560
Yes, this is much better.

370
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,600
Lord Gyeongunjae.

371
00:26:09,469 --> 00:26:11,040
Do you like Lady Yeoju?

372
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:12,369
What?

373
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,540
Lady Sam Soon, what kind of nonsense is this?

374
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,280
Lieutenant Jung, do you also like Lady Yeoju?

375
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,119
- No! - Are you crazy?

376
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,118
I understand it is not the case for you two.

377
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:31,689
Please calm down.

378
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,790
Lieutenant Jung.

379
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,959
What do you think about me?

380
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,830
What?

381
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:40,530
What do you mean?

382
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,668
Wait, will she share her feelings?

383
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,570
Do not tell him how you feel.

384
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,340
- Do not do it. - What...

385
00:26:49,379 --> 00:26:51,780
do you think about having me as your bride?

386
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,020
She did it.

387
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:02,990
Lieutenant Jung.

388
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,459
Please give me your answer.

389
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,500
Will you...

390
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:14,570
accept my proposal?

391
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,419
No.

392
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,520
I do not wish to marry you.

393
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,129
All right.

394
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:43,899
I remembered...

395
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,129
something urgent I had to do at home.

396
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,800
Please excuse me.

397
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:00,879
(Matchmaking Operation for Erudite Maeng's Three Daughters)

398
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,290
I said I would let you meet him at the May Festival.

399
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:13,530
Why did you suddenly propose to him?

400
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:17,060
I could not contain my feelings because I liked him so much.

401
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:19,369
Also,

402
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,539
I was sure he was into me too.

403
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,869
I ended up blurting it out.

404
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,439
How did you become so sure?

405
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:29,840
You have no idea,

406
00:28:30,139 --> 00:28:31,979
but he fixed the wall and the roof tiles...

407
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,179
of our house.

408
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:36,419
You also saw how much he was worried...

409
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,179
when I almost fell off the cliff.

410
00:28:38,949 --> 00:28:40,750
If those are not signs of affection,

411
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,689
what else can they be?

412
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,429
I mean,

413
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:50,429
is it not too dangerous for Lady Yeoju as well?

414
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:53,169
I am relieved I was hurt...

415
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,730
instead of you.

416
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,070
I am sorry.

417
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,409
I did not stick to your plan.

418
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,310
However,

419
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,510
it is too hard for me...

420
00:29:07,609 --> 00:29:09,320
to hide my feelings.

421
00:29:16,859 --> 00:29:19,659
It is so hard for a woman to say something like that.

422
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:22,459
How can you turn her down so coldly?

423
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,429
I also thought you were too harsh, Lieutenant Jung.

424
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,969
Please be quiet. I cannot hear them.

425
00:29:31,199 --> 00:29:33,139
It is nothing to apologize for.

426
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,379
However, Lieutenant Jung has been stubborn since when he was a kid.

427
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,009
Even if what he says is wrong,

428
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:41,649
he never changes his mind once he says something.

429
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,290
I need to think about what I can do from now on.

430
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,320
You do not have to try anymore.

431
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,388
I will marry Bachelor 23 as planned,

432
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:54,189
the man who is good at cooking.

433
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,230
Sorry?

434
00:29:56,231 --> 00:29:58,600
Lieutenant Jung does not wish to marry me.

435
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:00,399
But...

436
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:03,000
Are you sure, Lady Sam Soon?

437
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,638
You said you liked him so much.

438
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:06,709
Do not worry.

439
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,810
I may fall in love easily, but I also tend to forget easily.

440
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,510
I will be over him in a few days.

441
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,379
My goodness.

442
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,149
How is love that easy for her?

443
00:30:34,169 --> 00:30:37,570
Once he gets married, his wife will make his clothes.

444
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:43,080
These are probably the last time I make clothes for my son.

445
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:47,449
It is not like you made it yourself until this day.

446
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,080
What?

447
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,550
Even if your daughter-in-law makes his clothes,

448
00:30:53,889 --> 00:30:56,688
what does not change is the fact that he is your son.

449
00:30:56,689 --> 00:30:58,760
I mean that you do not have to lose heart.

450
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,060
Yes, you are right.

451
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,560
Please excuse me.

452
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:15,510
She is so shrewd.

453
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,780
If she came from a better family,

454
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,409
she would have been perfect as Si Yeol's wife.

455
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,060
It has been a while.

456
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,699
Do you have plans for the May Festival?

457
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:43,039
What if I do not have plans?

458
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,070
If you do not,

459
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,270
let us watch ssireum together.

460
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,839
You will not compete as a ssireum wrestler,

461
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,679
but you want to watch with me like a girl?

462
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,919
Of course, I will compete.

463
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,550
What I meant was...

464
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:01,090
that you could come and watch me play.

465
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,619
You do not have to lose your temper.

466
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,030
It does not seem like you have ever played.

467
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:10,500
No, I am good at ssireum.

468
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:12,869
My lady!

469
00:32:15,129 --> 00:32:16,469
Please come on out.

470
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,740
What is with the fuss?

471
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,810
This is from my lady.

472
00:32:44,899 --> 00:32:47,800
I think your husband shall need this very soon.

473
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,570
I have ordered a set for him.

474
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,980
Has Father been promoted to the Minister of Defence?

475
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,379
I was not informed of that.

476
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,090
Postscript.

477
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,790
The edict shall be announced three days later.

478
00:33:13,189 --> 00:33:14,358
As my congratulations,

479
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,929
I have also sent you the ginger wine we made.

480
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:20,330
You are a filial son.

481
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,639
Your in-laws are already helping us before your wedding.

482
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,708
I think Lady Park sent your father a set of uniform...

483
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,138
knowing that he would be appointed as Minister of Defence.

484
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:31,209
It must mean...

485
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,780
your in-laws pulled the strings for it, right?

486
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,250
I see.

487
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,250
Right.

488
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:53,869
He is nuts.

489
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:55,698
Why did a husband-to-be...

490
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:57,340
invite me to a ssireum match?

491
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:03,040
And why did I entertain him with a smile on my face?

492
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,109
How annoying!

493
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,290
If a man's clothes make up to three-tenths of his appearance,

494
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,060
the rest is up to his hair.

495
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,629
Now, we shall cut the hair under the topknot...

496
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,060
to make the most upright topknot.

497
00:34:26,569 --> 00:34:28,330
Are you suggesting to shave our hair?

498
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:31,600
One must treasure everything their parents gave them.

499
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,009
Scholar Kim.

500
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,638
Is it not more undutiful for you to stay unwed?

501
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,040
And what do you mean "shave?"

502
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:40,810
We are merely thinning your hair for a beautiful topknot.

503
00:34:41,049 --> 00:34:43,119
Do you not want to please the ladies?

504
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,290
Leave the other parts of my hair untouched.

505
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:51,819
I do not need to cut under my topknot.

506
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,290
Goodness.

507
00:34:59,529 --> 00:35:00,670
Scholars.

508
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:03,600
Cutting under your topknot is not a choice. It is a must.

509
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,670
Let us begin.

510
00:35:18,179 --> 00:35:19,750
Show me the five-colour threads.

511
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,750
It is for a protection bracelet, right?

512
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,319
Please hold on.

513
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:36,900
Here you go.

514
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:39,339
Thank you.

515
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,009
Why did you dress shabbily...

516
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,080
when you had such a nice outfit?

517
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,980
I wanted to meet...

518
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:52,319
a lady who would accept me regardless of my background.

519
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:55,719
Your background is a part of your identity.

520
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,369
Bachelor 24 looks too plain, does he not?

521
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,110
It is fraud to dress beyond your status.

522
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:16,939
Beside, he is all right as he has good looks...

523
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,509
and well-fitting clothes.

524
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:20,949
Do you like faces like his?

525
00:36:22,449 --> 00:36:25,219
Please come to the May Festival looking exactly like this.

526
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,420
All right.

527
00:36:29,989 --> 00:36:30,989
You are dismissed.

528
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:35,388
If we successfully get married to the old maids,

529
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:36,758
we will be brothers-in-law.

530
00:36:36,759 --> 00:36:38,029
Let us get along well.

531
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:39,830
Yes, my brother.

532
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:44,670
And you. If you face any troubles, please let me know.

533
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,239
Once we wed, I will be your big brother-in-law.

534
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:49,170
Sure.

535
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:01,819
Bu Kyum.

536
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,790
Are you marrying one of the old maids?

537
00:37:07,389 --> 00:37:08,429
Yes.

538
00:37:08,529 --> 00:37:09,860
It is time I got married.

539
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:12,299
I see.

540
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:14,770
That is great news.

541
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:18,399
I was worried that you would die...

542
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,670
as an old bachelor.

543
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,710
Which family is the bride from?

544
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:25,409
Oh, wait.

545
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,580
You said it was the old maids.

546
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:30,980
I am really glad for you.

547
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,920
Do they know each other?

548
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,400
Ye Jin.

549
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,239
Soon Duk?

550
00:37:56,009 --> 00:37:59,380
Do you know that mole under your eye is really hideous?

551
00:38:00,279 --> 00:38:02,110
Everyone said it looked fine.

552
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,549
By the way, do you know the scholar you were talking to?

553
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:08,619
Who?

554
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:12,659
Oh, right.

555
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:16,830
You mean the scholar who asked me where I bought this thread?

556
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,500
Which scholar?

557
00:38:22,429 --> 00:38:23,469
I see.

558
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:26,199
You went to buy thread to make a protection bracelet.

559
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,639
Who is it for?

560
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,210
You said I would see my husband-to-be at the May Festival.

561
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:34,880
I will give it to him then.

562
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,089
I thought you did not want to see him.

563
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,520
You were actually excited, right?

564
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,629
Is the matchmaking for the old maids going well?

565
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:50,500
Of course. I am the matchmaker, after all.

566
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,230
Who will be their husbands?

567
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:54,730
Will you know even if I tell you their names?

568
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:05,679
Find out who the old maids are getting wed to?

569
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Yes.

570
00:39:06,881 --> 00:39:09,008
Go and find out who Soon Duk chose...

571
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:11,019
as the spouses for all three ladies.

572
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,049
Goodness.

573
00:39:12,179 --> 00:39:13,919
Do you think I am an investigator?

574
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,449
Why would I snoop on people's affairs?

575
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,560
Seems like it is urgent.

576
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,130
When do you need it by?

577
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:25,799
I shall head out now.

578
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:40,779
Dear Lady Ha Na,

579
00:39:41,409 --> 00:39:44,580
thanks to you, I have arrived home safely.

580
00:39:45,279 --> 00:39:49,619
This roll of silk is a token of gratitude from my mother.

581
00:39:50,089 --> 00:39:51,989
Please accept it.

582
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:59,060
Thank you for letting me know that the barricade...

583
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,270
to Mount Mokmyeok was removed.

584
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,399
We do not need to go the long route anymore.

585
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,968
Oh, my. I feel so relieved.

586
00:40:05,969 --> 00:40:07,368
That is right.

587
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:08,940
I live in the remote countryside.

588
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,579
If you write to me about Hanyang and yourself...

589
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,880
just like so,

590
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,049
it will be a great help to me as I intend to take office.

591
00:40:17,779 --> 00:40:19,949
With that, I await your reply.

592
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,529
When we meet again,

593
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:31,759
I can no longer call him "kiddo."

594
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:46,909
Chief Royal Secretary.

595
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,979
I would have gone over if you called.

596
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,048
Why did you come here?

597
00:40:50,049 --> 00:40:51,819
Move the sickly patient first.

598
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:53,850
Let us talk inside.

599
00:40:55,089 --> 00:40:56,089
Yes, my lord.

600
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:00,889
This way.

601
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:12,170
She has the same symptoms as the princess?

602
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:13,509
Give me the details.

603
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:15,610
Please come this way.

604
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,559
Eight years ago,

605
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,429
Her Highness also had the same spot under her collarbone.

606
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:40,029
Back then, I thought it was just an unrelated skin condition.

607
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,230
So I overlooked it.

608
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,969
That was also...

609
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:46,969
a symptom of golden silkworm poison as stated in the book.

610
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:49,670
That is right.

611
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,838
As she is a palace maid who fell ill...

612
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,610
after eating the crown prince's leftovers,

613
00:41:55,009 --> 00:41:56,879
they have proclaimed her as dead...

614
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,380
while treating her in secret at the palace.

615
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:03,960
If she improves after I treat her as this book says,

616
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,119
both this maid...

617
00:42:07,029 --> 00:42:08,690
and the princess...

618
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,159
have most likely contracted golden silkworm poisoning.

619
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,739
You speak fluent Joseon. Have you traded for long?

620
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,210
What if I have?

621
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,639
Has anyone else asked for golden silkworm poison in the past?

622
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,480
I think I know who bought the poison.

623
00:42:36,589 --> 00:42:37,759
Golden silkworm poison?

624
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:41,060
I remember the person...

625
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:44,199
who bought the poison from the Ming merchant.

626
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:45,899
If we investigate him,

627
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,770
we will find out who is behind it.

628
00:42:50,139 --> 00:42:52,299
Call for the investigator right now.

629
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:54,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

630
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,849
Why did you bring me here...

631
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,949
instead of searching for the suspect?

632
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,690
The Ming merchant you mentioned has covered his tracks.

633
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:13,089
Please check...

634
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,460
if that is the man who bought the poison.

635
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,948
Yesterday morning, a herb gatherer found the body.

636
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,250
He is the man.

637
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,750
Who killed him?

638
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,960
Probably the ones who plotted the crown prince's kidnapping.

639
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,830
They wanted to silence him.

640
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,540
And?

641
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,839
The body ended up at the Department of Justice?

642
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,278
I think it was because...

643
00:44:05,279 --> 00:44:07,480
he was dressed as a bodyguard and had a name tag.

644
00:44:10,049 --> 00:44:12,319
Why are you so bad at cleaning things up?

645
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,020
You should have removed his clothes and name tag!

646
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,619
You people only know how to talk and not act.

647
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,489
- What did you say? - He is already dead!

648
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,000
What is the problem? He cannot speak!

649
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:30,270
We will never be caught.

650
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:31,869
Please relax.

651
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,170
Seeing how the crown prince has no symptoms,

652
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,939
the court maid...

653
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,949
did not fall ill after eating the crown prince's leftovers.

654
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:44,580
She must have taken the poison herself.

655
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,889
It was a plot to send His Highness to the private house.

656
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:51,219
We are on the same page.

657
00:44:51,589 --> 00:44:54,230
If something happened to the crown prince,

658
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,129
the blame would be...

659
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:58,560
on the Queen for sending him to the private house.

660
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:02,369
For someone to craft such a grand plan, could it be...

661
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,969
Rather than a hypothesis,

662
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,040
I need concrete proof.

663
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:14,080
Only the court maid has the remaining clues.

664
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:16,080
I will make sure to heal her...

665
00:45:16,179 --> 00:45:19,380
and find out who gave her the poison.

666
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,659
Do you trust Lord Gyeongunjae?

667
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,069
He had been investigating the princess' death for eight years.

668
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:43,210
Even I had forgotten about it as her father.

669
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,279
Mother.

670
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:55,150
When I get married, I want to bring more bowls with me.

671
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:58,419
Before you have your first child, you will stay here.

672
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,589
Let us make the ones you like.

673
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:09,600
Mother, should I put this aside too?

674
00:46:09,799 --> 00:46:11,639
Save the ones for the tenant farmers.

675
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:12,799
Yes, Mother.

676
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:22,810
She moved so fast that I could not tell where she put it.

677
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:32,960
What?

678
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:42,429
It was here.

679
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,008
("The Lady's Private Life")

680
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,040
My goodness.

681
00:46:58,049 --> 00:46:59,119
Dear me.

682
00:47:00,489 --> 00:47:01,489
My poor legs.

683
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:05,920
Oh, gosh. I was seated for too long.

684
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,389
I am exhausted.

685
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:21,369
What? Did I leave the window open?

686
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,150
Oh, well. Whatever.

687
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:34,290
("The Lady's Private Life")

688
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:37,519
She rents out novels?

689
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,719
Yes, my lady.

690
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:42,329
The Minister of Defence had suffered a lot...

691
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:44,299
because of those novels.

692
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:46,060
My goodness.

693
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,369
Even after Lady Jung married into the household,

694
00:47:49,569 --> 00:47:52,369
did she not read novels to Young Master?

695
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:55,669
(Five years ago)

696
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:59,110
Why was she still sitting there even after 20 years?

697
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,210
Please be patient.

698
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:04,580
You will find out when I read the ending.

699
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,449
I am sorry. I was too curious.

700
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:10,219
Let me continue.

701
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,259
"In that moment,"

702
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,428
"the bride turned into ashes and scattered away..."

703
00:48:16,429 --> 00:48:19,699
Do not look into Soon Duk's affairs anymore.

704
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:22,829
No. If I have a little more time,

705
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:24,540
I will be able to catch her red-handed.

706
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,040
Do not make me repeat myself.

707
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:30,069
Yes, my lady.

708
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,319
- You may leave. - Okay.

709
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,920
Mother found out?

710
00:48:43,350 --> 00:48:46,690
Yes. Sam Wol's mother told her everything.

711
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:02,310
No wonder things felt off.

712
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:03,839
Goodness.

713
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:04,940
Lady Jung.

714
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,480
Lady Park wants you to come over.

715
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:31,400
Mother, you called for me?

716
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,630
(List of Tenant Farmers)

717
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:58,600
This is the key to the shed and the list of tenant farmers.

718
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,929
From now on, you will be in charge...

719
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:05,469
of the tenant farmers and our grain reserves.

720
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:07,339
Me?

721
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,540
I am sure you are bored from doing needlework at home.

722
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,540
I have already informed Kim.

723
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,049
Now, you should look after the house...

724
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:18,949
and familiarize yourself with the tenant farmers.

725
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,419
If the owner does not take charge and leaves it to an outsider,

726
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:24,219
the system will fail.

727
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,758
I think it is too early for me to take charge.

728
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,230
I have been in charge since I married over.

729
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,029
You are more than capable.

730
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:36,429
Now, you should...

731
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:39,239
get ready to be the head lady of the Jo family.

(List of Tenant Farmers)

733
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:48,150
I understand.

734
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:50,980
Mother.

("The Lady's Private Life")

736
00:50:59,989 --> 00:51:01,189
Sam Wol's mother...

737
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,230
found this in the backyard of the annex.

738
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:11,639
From now on,

739
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:14,610
you need to work hard to win people to your side.

740
00:51:17,279 --> 00:51:20,610
People can lack gratitude and are fickle-minded.

741
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:22,549
They want to avoid danger,

742
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:25,150
yet do not want to let go of their gains.

743
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,419
So if you are someone people fear...

744
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:30,420
and seem to have what others want,

745
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,060
everyone will always be on your side.

746
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,060
Keep that in mind.

("The Lady's Private Life")

748
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:50,509
I feel more uneasy that she did not scold me.

749
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,580
Mother was giving you time.

750
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:05,658
You know that Mother liked you for being wise and sensible...

751
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:07,259
from the start, right?

752
00:52:10,429 --> 00:52:11,500
Of course.

753
00:52:12,259 --> 00:52:14,330
I like Mother too.

754
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,569
I feel at ease because you are by her side.

755
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:24,980
I guess...

756
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:28,509
you also do not like that I play matchmaker.

757
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,989
Seems like you are always late.

758
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:16,529
We have a lot to cover today. Let us get moving.

759
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:18,759
Wait...

760
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,830
She makes it sound as if I was late.

761
00:53:29,009 --> 00:53:31,480
Since Lady Ha Na likes riding the swing,

762
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,338
please tell Bachelor 12...

763
00:53:33,339 --> 00:53:35,048
to ride the swing at the May Festival.

764
00:53:35,049 --> 00:53:36,079
I got it.

765
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,219
Just a typical ride is not enough.

766
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,218
He must not lose to Lady Ha Na...

767
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:42,089
who won the swinging contest for three years.

768
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:44,089
Tell him to practice with all his might.

769
00:53:48,489 --> 00:53:50,259
Oh, my.

770
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:16,920
The coincidental first eye contact at Sunhwa Temple...

771
00:54:17,219 --> 00:54:19,659
will connect the two right here.

772
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,769
Lady Doo Ri will watch the ssireum match.

773
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:34,238
Tell Bachelor 24 to participate in a match,

774
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,909
rank in the top three, and win a prize.

775
00:54:37,139 --> 00:54:40,779
I didn't know that the second liked men good at ssireum.

776
00:54:40,949 --> 00:54:43,679
Do any women hate men who are good at it?

777
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,589
Do you also like men who are good at ssireum?

778
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:53,989
What I like does not matter.

779
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,809
After failing to make the first eye contact at Sunhwa Temple,

780
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,310
Lady Sam Soon chose to wash her hair.

781
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:27,889
This is a sweet spot almost everyone knows.

782
00:55:28,029 --> 00:55:30,028
Save a seat early morning...

783
00:55:30,029 --> 00:55:31,860
and have Bachelor 23 sit there.

784
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:33,658
All right.

785
00:55:33,659 --> 00:55:35,568
I got it. Let's take a short break here...

786
00:55:35,569 --> 00:55:36,928
We will head to... the Office of Tributes and Food now.

787
00:55:36,929 --> 00:55:38,739
I guess not. Fine.

788
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:47,779
- It is so small. - That is right.

789
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:54,289
Is Lady Yeoju selling dohwa powder here?

790
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:55,420
"Lady Yeoju?"

791
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,179
Do you know her?

792
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,819
I have never seen her before.

793
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,619
Me too. This is my first time here.

794
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:28,449
Ask the chief inside.

795
00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:30,089
Over there.

796
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,039
She does look like Lady Yeoju...

797
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,509
who sells dohwa powder in our inn.

798
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:55,750
But I do not know when she will come as she visits without a schedule.

799
00:56:56,210 --> 00:56:57,619
That does mean she comes here.

800
00:57:02,850 --> 00:57:04,860
Why did you lie when he was looking for Mother?

801
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:06,520
She went to Hamgyeong Province, no?

802
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:09,929
He is obviously a bad person, so I should keep it from him.

803
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:13,759
He may look scary, but he is not a bad person.

804
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,670
How do you know that?

805
00:57:15,929 --> 00:57:18,100
You can tell by looking at people's eyes.

806
00:57:18,569 --> 00:57:20,139
His eyes looked frightened.

807
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:33,149
After Lady Sam Soon finishes washing her hair,

808
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:36,219
have Bachelor 23 bring her here and dye her nails with balsam.

809
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:39,360
Lady Sam Soon dreams of romantic situations.

810
00:57:39,719 --> 00:57:41,589
The balsam will help them get closer...

811
00:57:41,929 --> 00:57:44,529
and gain a memorable moment before their marriage.

812
00:57:47,159 --> 00:57:48,330
Demonstrate it for me.

813
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,130
Excuse me?

814
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:52,039
I must know how to do it...

815
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:54,409
to teach the groom candidate, right?

816
00:58:10,089 --> 00:58:11,920
Give me one of your fingers.

817
00:58:14,219 --> 00:58:15,230
You mean mine?

818
00:58:16,489 --> 00:58:18,929
It is women who dye their nails with balsam, no?

819
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:22,569
I cannot dye my own finger when I am walking you through it.

820
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:24,569
Hurry. We do not have much time.

821
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,540
Here.

822
00:58:40,989 --> 00:58:42,989
- The thread, please. - Right.

823
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,669
Legend says if your nail is still dyed when the first snow falls,

824
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,969
your love will come true.

825
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,778
Inform the groom candidate...

826
00:59:05,779 --> 00:59:07,509
to tell Lady Sam Soon that.

827
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:10,210
I will.

828
00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:17,520
You are a master at love.

829
00:59:17,989 --> 00:59:19,719
So why are you a widow?

830
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:25,299
Is it something like you cannot scratch your own back?

831
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:38,279
My late husband and I were married for less than half a year.

832
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:40,739
And yet, I received great love.

833
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:46,350
Hence, there is no space in my heart for another man.

834
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,029
Thinking back, I must have known...

835
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:59,630
I was already in love with Lord Gyeongunjae the moment...

836
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:01,770
I said those to him.

837
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,480
Her pulse feels better now.

838
01:00:17,819 --> 01:00:19,879
If she continues to recover,

839
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,350
she will soon gain consciousness.

840
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:23,619
I knew it.

841
01:00:25,159 --> 01:00:26,920
It was because of the golden silkworm poison.

842
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,900
Oh, I...

843
01:00:32,330 --> 01:00:34,230
I have bad news, my lord.

844
01:00:37,230 --> 01:00:38,440
Good grief.

845
01:00:39,639 --> 01:00:41,670
What is it that you are making such a fuss?

846
01:00:43,670 --> 01:00:46,480
I found out something about Lady Yeoju.

847
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,610
Do not get shocked.

848
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,080
Lady Yeoju is the one...

849
01:00:50,210 --> 01:00:52,549
who murdered the left state councillor’s eldest son.

850
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:58,190
Did I not hear you correctly, or did you not speak to me clearly?

851
01:00:58,560 --> 01:00:59,989
Make it easy for me to understand.

852
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:02,459
At the inn,

853
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:05,029
I met a slave hunter looking for Lady Yeoju.

854
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,959
She was charged with the murder...

855
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,029
of Deputy Administrator of Pyeongyang.

856
01:01:08,799 --> 01:01:10,330
Lady Yeoju's name was Tae Ran.

857
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,670
There was a wanted poster with Lady Yeoju's face on it.

858
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:18,279
You may not know of this case because of the princess's funeral,

859
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:20,678
but it was an atrocious case that everyone in this country...

860
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:22,210
knew about.

861
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:25,278
How is the criminal of such a brutal case...

862
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:27,719
working as a peddler in Hanyang?

863
01:01:29,719 --> 01:01:31,960
It is more possible because it is Hanyang.

864
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:34,929
After all, all kinds of people gather in this place.

865
01:01:38,199 --> 01:01:39,960
I must confirm this in person.

866
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,889
What is it this time? Why did you want to meet at such a place?

867
01:02:12,029 --> 01:02:13,630
You told me your name was Soon Duk...

868
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,129
and you became a widow five years ago after losing...

869
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,500
your husband to an illness.

870
01:02:19,540 --> 01:02:20,600
Were those true?

871
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:25,610
Yes. Those were true.

872
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:30,549
Was there not even an ounce of lie?

873
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,719
How much longer did you think you could hide your identity?

874
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:44,360
What? How did you know?

875
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:45,960
You see...

876
01:02:46,259 --> 01:02:48,029
I was hoping it was not you.

877
01:02:49,670 --> 01:02:52,100
I feel extremely betrayed by you.

878
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,440
Our matchmaking contract...

879
01:02:55,369 --> 01:02:56,940
has ended as of this moment.

880
01:02:58,909 --> 01:03:00,738
My lord, I will explain...

881
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:01,980
Explain what?

882
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,778
Well...

883
01:03:06,779 --> 01:03:09,489
What sort of an excuse can a murderer make?

(Listen to "Half of My Heart" by THEO on all music platforms.)

886
01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,329
Do you think I have personal feelings...

887
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:55,730
for Lady Yeoju or something?

888
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:58,839
- Are you crying? - From what I see,

889
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,770
you are lovesick.

890
01:04:02,869 --> 01:04:05,709
My brother and I might be connected to that case.

891
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,939
As it seems like we are both after the same goal,

892
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,549
let us work together this time.

893
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:13,650
Find out in secret what Lord Gyeongunjae knows.

894
01:04:15,389 --> 01:04:17,319
You must surely know that...

895
01:04:17,619 --> 01:04:19,560
those two cannot become lovers.
