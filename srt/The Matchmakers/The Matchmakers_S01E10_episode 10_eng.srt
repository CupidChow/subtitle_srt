1
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,570

2
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,730

3
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,990

4
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,030

5
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:05,080
The reason I am anti-marriage?

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,150
It is because I feel sorry for my younger sister

7
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:12,320
who married into a family where she is sure to become a widow, all for the sake of my success as the son.

8
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,140
I cannot forgive my father, who forced my sister to marry into such a family,

9
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,450
so I do not plan ever to get married.

10
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,990

11
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,410

The Officer?

12
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,260
Gosh, I already forgot about him.

13
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:37,980
I have already decided to focus on Scholar Number 23, who is good at cooking.

14
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:43,180
Oh, washing my hair at Suseongdong Valley is the story

15
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,040
I wanted to try the most from what Mother told me

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,030
about Ssangyeonsulsa, which is why I asked Yeojudaek.

17
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:56,110
I am going to meet my destined one there, just like the ladies of Bukchon.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,720

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,830
I will not raise an issue of what you say while we are enchanted.

20
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,910
So you should also...

21
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,750
answer me without minding the current situation.

22
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,260
Why did you lie...

23
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,660
saying you do not like me?

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,540

25
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,380
In my opinion, it is certain you like me as well.

26
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:47,760
During tower circling, you said you would be my shield.

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,930
When I fainted at the inn,

28
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,130
you came to me running before anyone else.

29
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:56,120
And after hearing I was okay at the river,

30
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:59,640
you were sincerely relieved.

31
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,570
Additionally, you were talking to me as if you were calm,

32
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:08,360
but your pulse was beating faster than usual.

33
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:16,520
 If you look the other way, I will leave right after this match is over.

34
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,180
Based on all of these situations,

35
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,610
it is certain you like me as well.

36
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:33,600
Could it be I was mistaken because I am a shy nerd?

37
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,280
My heart was in pain...

38
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,230
when you did not look at me when you were speaking.

39
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,510
I did not know the reason back then.

40
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,890
But I think I know the reason now.

41
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,430
It was because...

42
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:17,110
I also had feelings for you.

43
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,900
However...

44
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,280
I cannot forget my deceased husband.

45
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,250
Until I die, probably.

46
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,920
So I cannot accept your feelings...

47
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,910
or give you my feelings.

48
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,850
So Cheon?

49
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:38,380
You are...

50
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:42,670
What brings you here, Your Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

51
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:46,580
Could it be you need a corpse again?

52
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,240
Well...

53
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,920
are you So Cheon, who wrote "The Scholar's Man?"

54
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,790
You came to me because of that novel after eight years?

55
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:18,110
That novel is about the murder of Pyeongyangbu's deputy mayor. Right?

56
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:22,450
Did you hear about it from someone?

57
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,070
I did not hear it from someone.

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,520
It is my personal experience.

59
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,070
You were the woman...

60
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,410
disguised as a man in the novel, huh?

61
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,960
  The numbers do not add up here.

62
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,000
  Do you not know or are you pretending not to know?

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,350
  It is what your uncle ordered, using the customs as an excuse.

64
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,950
  I truly did not know because it was my first time,

65
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:16,400
 so follow the rules rather than customs if that is the case.

66
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,480
  I will take the responsibility.

67
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:45,040
It did not make sense he cooperated with his enemy to hide his daughter's affair in the novel,

68
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,620
but it makes sense now.

69
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,790
Anyone would shake hands with their enemies to hide their sons' love for men.

70
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:58,390
Because their families' honor is at risk.

71
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,490
Looks like it was not a double suicide as it was in the novel.

72
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:05,580
Who killed Jo In Hyeon, and why did you bring about the false accusations?

73
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,760
Jo In Hyeon was...

74
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,120
killed by me.

75
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,250
Only if I did not go to him that day,

76
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,120
he might still be alive today.

77
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,940
Every day,

78
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,080
that is what I wonder.

79
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,090
 These are letters His Excellency Park Bok Gi exchanged with the interpreter from the Ming Dynasty.

80
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,280
 There should be enough evidence to prove he stole from the tributes.

81
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,810
 He will find out the letters are gone tomorrow.

82
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:39,550
 There is not much time.

83
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:43,210
 Write an appeal letter to the Royal Court tomorrow morning.

84
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,530
 I am sorry.

85
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,260
 I do not think I can do this.

86
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,730
 All right.

87
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,700
 I am sure it does not feel right to actually report your uncle.

88
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,680
 However, it will be better for you to do it since you are in the same family.

89
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,710
 These letters contain not only evidence of stealing from the tributes

90
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:10,990
 but also of treason for attempting to murder Grand Prince Woon Hae.

91
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,860
 What do you mean? I did not see such content.

92
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,280
 You will understand what I mean after tomorrow.

93
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,760
 I also thought I must report Uncle to correct an unjust custom.

94
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,560
 But if I write an appeal letter to the Royal Court with these letters as evidence,

95
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,590
 my entire family will be exterminated.

96
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,620
 Calm down.

97
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,660
 I am sure there is a way to resolve this.

98
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,490
 What are you doing right now?

99
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:33,320
 Are those rumors about you loving men true?

100
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,190
 I am sorry.

101
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,650
 Father! Father!

102
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:48,780
 F-Father! Father!

103
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:57,770
Although I was able to survive,

104
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,500
he lost his life at the scene

105
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,760
because he took the strike without resisting.

106
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:11,030
Does that mean Jo In Hyeon was killed by his father?

107
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:25,880
Do you know what the evidence of the planned murder of Grand Prince Woon Hae was in the letter?

108
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:44,240
His Excellency Park took the letter afterward, so I could not look at them again.

109
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,260
But I did not find such content when I read them before.

110
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,570
Even if I missed it,

111
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,450
since Grand Prince Woon Hae was unharmed at the time,

112
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:58,260
it looks like Dongno Party ceased their plan when he died.

113
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:05,390
Many innocent people lost their lives to hide that incident.

114
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:09,870
My father also passed away within half a year after it happened.

115
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:18,630
Now that I think about it, his existence and mine were misfortunes.

116
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:26,170
This is why I live my life taking care of abandoned corpses to atone for my sins.

117
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,880
I do not wish to talk about this matter anymore.

118
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,660
Why did you choose Temple Seonhwa?

119
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:56,430
Is this not the temple sponsored by Left State Minister Jo Young Bae's family?

120
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,780
He will not let you be if he finds out.

121
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:03,090
So I cannot understand why you chose to stay here.

122
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,780
That would be why he stays here, would it not?

123
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,130
Because his beloved person's memorial tablet is here.

124
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,310
I understand you are innocent,

125
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:36,060
but I think it could be difficult to prove your innocence legally.

126
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,560
As you said before, my lovesickness is my problem,

127
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,830
so do not worry about it.

128
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,860
You can continue matchmaking.

129
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:53,450
The only thing is, is that Officer said he would protect you until the wedding.

130
00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:57,080
So keep that in mind and be careful.

131
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,020
 These letters contain not only evidence of stealing from the tributes

132
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:40,600
 but also of treason for attempting to murder Grand Prince Woon Hae.

133
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,590
 What do you mean? I did not see such content.

134
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:49,600
What was the evidence of treason Jo In Hyeon mentioned?

135
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,470
Why did the undertaker monk not catch it when reading the same letter?

136
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,360
Gosh, Young Madam!

137
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,630
Young Madam!

138
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:03,090
My goodness!

139
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:05,760
Gosh, she went out again.

140
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,620
Gosh, what should I say this time?

141
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,250
I am here.

142
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,510
Goodness!

143
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,980
What are you doing out here this time?

144
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,690
My head is clustered as if it is full of cotton.

145
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,020
So I could not stay in the room.

146
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:33,010
Your head is not a quilt, so why is it full of cotton?

147
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,790
Hurry up and get up.

148
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:39,520
The Officer has come.

149
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,660
Orabeoni is here?

150
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,670
You could have gone to Temple Seonhwa with me, but why did you...

151
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,700
go with His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

152
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,320
I did not go with him.

153
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,280
He was waiting for me in front of Temple Seonhwa.

154
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:09,350
Orabeoni, my head is about to burst.

155
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,300
So, could you save the scolding for next time?

156
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,840
What about the writer?

157
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,470
Did you meet him?

158
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,210
Yes.

159
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,230
It was true Yeojudaek was falsely accused.

160
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:31,860
So, you know who the real culprit is, too?

161
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,680
He met the undertaker monk with the matchmaker at Temple Seonhwa.

162
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,100
At Temple Seonhwa?

163
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,190
Is he trying to learn how to bury corpses now?

164
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:49,750
Or is he trying to become a monk? Goodness! He is up to all sorts of nonsense.

165
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,180
As soon as he came back, he stopped by the Royal Investigations and Justice Bureaus to take the preliminary

166
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,730
investigations documents from eight years ago and even the documents

167
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,510
on the Memorial Gate for your daughter-in-law.

168
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,400
Could he be investigating the matter with Nephew?

169
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,980
Alas.

170
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,280
You will not even let me talk.

171
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:12,390
Bring to me the undertaker monk Gyeongwoonjae Prince met.

172
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,610
Yes.

173
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,050
He was killed by his father?

174
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,840
Are you okay?

175
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,370
I am not okay.

176
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,230
Who would have ever thought

177
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,010
clearing Yeojudaek's name meant exposing Father's crime?

178
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,020
What about His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae?

179
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:37,890
What do you think he will do?

180
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,790
He said Yeojudaek is indeed innocent,

181
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,000
but it will not be easy to clear her name.

182
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:48,660
Just because a father killed his son for loving men...

183
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,140
it is indeed hard to find him guilty. Except...

184
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,600
they just wanted to hide it because

185
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,050
it will bring shame to the family.

186
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,010
Orabeoni...

187
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,590
do you also think a family's reputation is

188
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:07,000
more important than its son's life?

189
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,200
Though I do not think so,

190
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,140
our father also forced you to...

191
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,050
marry into this family to save our family.

192
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:23,230
I made you do something you should not have done because I am lacking.

193
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,830
I am sorry.

194
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,090
What do you mean by that?

195
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,470
I was forced to get married?

196
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,250
I know all about it.

197
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:41,060
You fought with Father for days and nights before the marriage. Back then...

198
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,110
I should have opposed him more strongly.

199
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,680
Soon Deok,

200
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:52,200
if it is too hard on you to stay here,

201
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,470
you can come back home.

202
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,400
What is the matter with you now, Orabeoni?

203
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,370
I had fights with Father back then...

204
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,800
because he insisted he would not marry me off since my husband had an illness.

205
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,650
I was only trying to convince him otherwise.

206
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,460
Is that true?

207
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:23,460
 In my opinion, it is certain you like me as well.

208
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,680
  It was because... I also had feelings for you.

209
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,400
I...

210
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,360
I loved my husband so much...

211
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,400
Oh, is that so?

212
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,280
I had the...

213
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:53,000
w-wrong idea.

214
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,970
I am sorry.

215
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,380
Do not cry.

216
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:21,460

217
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,110

218
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,050
 Dano is coming soon, so I am sending you my feelings in this fan.

219
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,860
 Although summer brings abundance in all life,

220
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,340
 it can also make them rot at any moment.

221
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,800
 If you take public office after some time passes,

222
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,210
 please bring about wise winds like this fan and

223
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:25,930
 become an official who cares for the people.

224
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:41,140
Gosh, I thought I would win this time.

225
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,640
Just one more round, please.

226
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,740
I have to win at least one game during the Dano Competition this year.

227
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:50,120
I am getting paid to play you, so feel free.

228
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,400
Huh?

229
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:04,960
I-I have an urgent matter, so I will learn next time!

230
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,360
Sorry, my legs suddenly slipped.

231
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,780
Gosh, you should have been careful.

232
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,450
You are the one who dashed out suddenly.

233
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,060
From what I hear, you will marry the Left State Minister's only daughter.

234
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:38,130
I think you should focus on only one thing, both in wrestling and marriage.

235
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,900
W-What is his problem?

236
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,660
Young Madam.

237
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,020
Yes?

238
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,370
What are you doing?

239
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:27,550
Twist it now.

240
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:34,310
That wretched fox rain.

241
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,000
This is crazy.

242
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,450
I am reminded of him every other moment.

243
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,420
I will forget him after time passes.

244
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:12,670
He will not even disappear now?

245
00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,230

246
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,450

247
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,860
 These are letters His Excellency Park Bok Gi

248
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,990

exchanged with the interpreter from the Ming Dynasty.

249
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,170
 These letters contain not only evidence of stealing from the tributes

250
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:43,610
 but also of treason for attempting to murder Grand Prince Woon Hae.

251
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:49,070

Does that mean Jo In Hyeon was killed by his father?

252
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,750
 Many innocent people lost their lives to hide that incident.

253
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,910

254
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:08,330

The symptoms of the geumjam poison in a medical book from the Ming Dynasty I read recently was

255
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:13,060

way too similar to Princess' symptom eight years ago, so I was looking into it.

256
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,150
   [Year of the Red Monkey

257
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,710

258
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:31,380

You must have done this work for a long time since you speak Joseon's language well.

259
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,900
 And if I have?

260
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:37,110
 I wondered if anyone had looked for geumjam poison in the past.

261
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:39,840
 Who killed him?

262
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,890

The ones who ordered the kidnap of the crown prince probably killed him.

263
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,950
 To shut him up.

264
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:48,220

265
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,180

There is a good chance this court maid and the princess...

266
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,470

were both poisoned with geumjam poison.

267
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:08,270
Maybe Gyeongwoonjae is going to do the swing competition at Dano,

268
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:11,190
but he was riding the swing with the old bachelors.

269
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:14,630
Gosh, he is such an eyesore.

270
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:23,320
Still, it looks like there will be great progress in Hanseongbu regarding

271
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,500
the old bachelor and maiden problem.

272
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,200
What are you saying?

273
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:37,750
I heard all the old bachelors who hang out with Gyeongwoonjae will marry the old maidens.

274
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:43,110
I do not think we will be scolded anymore because of the old bachelors and maidens this year.

275
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,750
Sir Mayor,

276
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,930
the progress in Hanseongbu is not the problem right now.

277
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:56,360
We need to stop the marriage of the old maidens Gyeongwoonjae is working on.

278
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:01,000
What is the reason?

279
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,700
Gyeonmijijeo.

280
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,700

281
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:11,350
Did you forget what justification we used to stop the crown prince's marriage?

282
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:14,350
It was the issue of countless old bachelors and maidens in Hanyang.

283
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:18,100
But a member of the Royal Family, Gyeongwoonjae, took the reins and

284
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,420
married off three old maidens with old bachelors.

285
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,650
So, the Royal Family will use this to promote the crown prince's marriage.

286
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:45,860
As I thought, my sister was already reading all the signs.

287
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,300
Why do we not just get rid of Gyeongwoojae for good?

288
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,270
How do you thoughtlessly speak everything that is on your mind?

289
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,660
All right. Do you have a plan to stop Gyeongwoonjae?

290
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,410
Stop him?

291
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,800
Marrying old bachelors and maidens is a long-waited national project, is it not?

292
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:15,420
It would be a great thing if Gyeongwoonjae would do such a thing since he belongs to the Dongno Party.

293
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:20,590
On top of that, Master Maeng's three daughters' mother is from the Jo family, is she not?

294
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:25,560
Does that mean you are going to just sit still and watch the crown prince get married?

295
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,230
Do not worry.

296
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:33,150
The crown prince will not get married even if all the old maids in Hanyang get married.

297
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,210

298
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,410
Bring it to Namsan Village now.

299
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,810

300
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:36,240
 Thank you for the news in Hanyang.

301
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,160
 If I ever take public office, I will be a wise official who cares for the people, just like you wish.

302
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,680
 I also tried some drawing to pay back the favor.

303
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,190
 The fan with Mt. Mokmyeok on it is yours.

304
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:57,350
How did you know Maeng Ha Na and the crown prince exchanged letters?

305
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:00,300
The crown prince disappeared into Madam Seo's house.

306
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,690
But the queen did not punish them and actually sent a pil of silk. 
  (1 pil=5.3m)

307
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:08,850
I kept a close watch because it seemed odd.

308
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:15,330
It looks like Maeng Ha Na is the one who hid the crown prince that night.

309
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:19,180
What an outrageous wench! I will go and—

310
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,350
Next time.

311
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,790
I sent a letter to the crown prince and made it look like it was from Maeng Ha Na.

312
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:47,320
 Young Master, I will give you a tour of Hanyang if you come to Hanyang this Dano.

313
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,840
 Also, you will also be able to see my swing riding skills you were curious about,

314
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,860
 so please make sure to come.

315
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,970
 I will be waiting.

316
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,940
Mother will not allow me to leave, though.

317
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,910
What do I do?

318
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,920
For my son to create a poem now...

319
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,310
When did you grow up so much?

320
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,150
How is it?

321
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,790
It was good.

322
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:33,190
I especially like how you used "wu" for "to meet," not "wu" for "friend."

323
00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:36,500
I must show it to the Teacher as well.

324
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,620

325
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,710
There he comes.

326
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:43,220
Huh?

327
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,020
Already?

328
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,040
The teacher will feel pressured if he knows I listen in on his class,

329
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,870
so please keep this a secret.

330
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,340
Yes.

331
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,310

332
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,530

333
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,360
Have you been well?

334
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:16,380
Yes. Have you been well, too, Teacher?

335
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,800
I am having a bit of a hard time because something is weighing on my heart.

336
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,370
What is it about?

337
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,960
I am thinking about my wife, who died first.

338
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,620
The princess that you were

339
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,960
forced to marry, Teacher?

340
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,810
I heard it from my aunt.

341
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:40,540
I am sorry if my words offended you.

342
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,010
Everyone in Joseon knows it, so there is no need to be sorry.

343
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:50,620
This is a secret that I am only telling you.

344
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,520
I was not forced into marrying, as the rumors say.

345
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:11,690
I married the princess because I loved her enough to give up

346
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:15,740
on my dream of becoming the Chief State Minister.

347
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:20,620
I guess you were having a hard time because you miss the princess.

348
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,410
There are times I have a hard time because I miss my birth mother and father,

349
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:28,370
so I understand how you feel, Teacher.

350
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,270
At times like that, I think all you can do is hurt.

351
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:42,410
Do you remember your birth parents?

352
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,810
I was so young, so I do not remember much,

353
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:48,510
but I do remember they smiled a lot while looking at me.

354
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:53,070
And my mother told me that they were good people.

355
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:01,720
I always get this feeling that you have a good relationship with your mother.

356
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,100
Yes. I love my mother the most in the world,

357
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,200
and I am not scared of anything as long as she is with me.

358
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:19,510
After hearing your words, my stirred-up heart has grown calm.

359
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,080
Pardon?

360
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,230
Thanks.

361
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,670
"Ho gang bool ho hak.

362
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,580
Gi pae ya gwang."

363
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,370
If you like to be firm but not to learn,

364
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:48,630
the consequences are recklessness.

365
00:34:50,740 --> 00:34:53,770
I think it's time for us to end class.

366
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,400
Did I interrupt you?

367
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,110
We were about to end anyway.

368
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:12,150
Hearing my grandson study reminds me of the dead firstborn son.

369
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,860
He was a smart and kind son...

370
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,420
I am sorry.

371
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:27,890
When you grow older, you remember the past more vividly than what happened yesterday,

372
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:30,340
so I brought up something that made you uncomfortable.

373
00:35:30,890 --> 00:35:35,080
Thanks to you, Your Excellency, I think my grandson found interest in studying.

374
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:40,250
Your grandson is smart and has a good heart, so he would have done well even without me.

375
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:46,860
Oh, I heard that Master Maeng's daughters are getting married on the 25th of May.

376
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:51,220
You have done a great deed in solving the problem of the old maidens.

377
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:55,860
You even know the date of the wedding?

378
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:58,540
You are a major figure in the Dongno Party.

379
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,030
Of course, I should take an interest in what you are doing.

380
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:05,130
You are not just one of the sons-in-law like the king.

381
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,380
Is she saying that I should make my loyalties clear?

382
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:23,460
Pardon?

383
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:27,180
It appears she knows that the marriage of the old maidens will lead to the marriage of the crown prince,

384
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,540
so why is she so calm about it?

385
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,320
Who do you mean?

386
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,760
Who do you mean?

387
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,330

388
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,360
You can look around for a bit and then go to the tightrope walking at 12:00 p.m.

389
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:51,810
Everything has already been discussed with the madam of that family, so do not go elsewhere.

390
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,500
All right.

391
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,780
Oh, Gae Dong will save a good spot for you.

392
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,870
Geun Seok, you should obey your aunt well. Okay?

393
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:05,080
Sister-in-law, is it not too much that you put Geun Seok on me to watch me?

394
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,350
Geun Seok should play with his friends during Dano.

395
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:10,450
Aunt, I am fine.

396
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,840
I want to meet my future uncle, too.

397
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:16,560
You should be well-mannered in front of your future uncle. Okay?

398
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,930
Okay.

399
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:20,530
Do not let your guard down too much just because Mother entered the palace

400
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,190
to visit the Royal Consort Sookbin.

401
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,050
Sister-in-law, you should also come home on time.

402
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,990
Okay, okay. You should go now.

403
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,900
Let's go. I'll be going.

404
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,080
Geun Seok, we should go outside of the city.

405
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,340
Why? You need to go to meet your future uncle later.

406
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,380
I already met him last night.

407
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,930
Pardon?

408
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,030
  Orabeoni, my head is about to burst.

409
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:15,390
  You are the Young Master of the Chancellor's family. Right?

410
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,410
  I am.

411
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,120
  Gae Dong, please give us some space.

412
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,470
  I will be in the alley.

413
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,690
  I apologize for asking to meet at such a late hour.

414
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:42,320
  It is okay, but I am sure we were supposed to meet tomorrow.

415
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,850
  It is about that.

416
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:48,520
  Since it is my last Dano before getting married,

417
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,270
  I wanted to spend it with my friends.

418
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:56,850
  If it is okay with you, Young Master, I want to spend this Dano separately.

419
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:02,010
  Oh, I see. That is fine with me, so have a good time with your friends.

420
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,030
  Thank you.

421
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,980
 - Wait. 
 - Wait.

422
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:35,130
  I can say I got this from you on Dano. Right?

423
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:38,390
  And I got this from you.

424
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,140
  This will be our little secret. Okay?

425
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,860
  It's nice that we have a secret between us even before we get married.

426
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,560
  - Goodbye. 
 - Bye.

427
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,400
If you don't come quickly, I will leave you behind.

428
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,610
I should get my head on straight.

429
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:31,250
What is going on? You are here early, waiting for me.

430
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,680
There should be days like this, too.

431
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,330
To recap what the schedule for our Dano plan is—

432
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,020
The Suseongdong Valley at 2:00 p.m.,

433
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,090
the wrestling arena at 3:00 p.m.,

434
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:43,620
and the swings at 4:00 p.m. Is that not right?

435
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,900
It is.

436
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,530
Then shall we go first to the scene of the first romance spot at Suseongdong Valley?

437
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,760
How did you come here?

438
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,900
I came to see you with my nephew since it is Dano.

439
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,110
You wanted to see Geun Seok once, Orabeoni.

440
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,010
Wait, but...

441
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,730
What do you want to do today?

442
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,630
Let me see...

443
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,890
Have you been—

444
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,190
Hello.

445
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,740
Hello.

446
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:25,820
Men cannot enter Suseongdong Valley today.

447
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,910
Maybe I should have asked why he came.

448
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,450
Did you wait long?

449
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:10,170
No, I just arrived, too.

450
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,140
Let's hurry up and go.

451
00:43:17,130 --> 00:43:20,350
What is wrong? Are you nervous?

452
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,340
Well...

453
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,300
yeah.

454
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:27,990
Just think of it as just washing your hair.

455
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,550
Let us go.

456
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,610
I will be up on top.

457
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,430
Okay.

458
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:13,050
Officer!

459
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:18,520
I told you to protect Yeojudaek, so what are you doing here?

460
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,750
Men are forbidden from entering the valley below.

461
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,430
You are right.

462
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:28,630
Is Number 23 not here yet?

463
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,290
You are right. He should be here already.

464
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:35,010
- I will go look for him. 
 - Goodness.

465
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,460
I got too delayed while preparing food.

466
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:56,930
Oh, that is...

467
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:03,600
Geez. Miss, that is too tough to eat.

468
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:09,280
You need to pick the tender leaves that look like this.

469
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:13,470
No, not that one.

470
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:46,430
Not yet.

471
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,270
We cannot afford to be delayed here.

472
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,970
Gosh, I cannot do this anymore.

473
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:00,710
Gosh, I need to stretch my legs.

474
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,810
Oh, I have a cramp!

475
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:12,360
Oh, no!

476
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,010
Someone grab her!

477
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,200
O-Officer! Officer!

478
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,860
 I cannot believe a moment like this out of a novel would come for me.

479
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:57,010
 I won't have any regrets even if I don't get married now.

480
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:03,160
 No, if I can't marry the Officer, I won't marry anyone else.

481
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,190
Your Excellency!

482
00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:31,370
Oh, okay...

483
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,380
Gosh.

484
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:50,260
Did you not say there were no issues with the groom candidates?

485
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:53,650
But Number 23 did not come,

486
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:57,810
and why did you suddenly appear there, Officer?

487
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:02,350
I have no way of knowing why Number 23 did not come.

488
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:06,050
Is this marriage only important to me?

489
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:07,950
It is very important to me, too.

490
00:48:07,950 --> 00:48:11,540
Since my life is on the line.

491
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,800
- Pardon? 
 - Since the Officer caused this incident,

492
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:18,880
the Officer can take responsibility.

493
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:24,200
What do you mean the Officer will take responsibility?

494
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,520
All right.

495
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:31,030
How will he take responsibility?

496
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,450
My Lady,

497
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,920
if it is okay with you,

498
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,260
will you marry me?

499
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,220
Well...

500
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:21,380
Yes.

501
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,180
I would like that.

502
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,550
Okay.

503
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,110
Thank you.

504
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,100
Gosh! W-What...

505
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:40,110
What is going on? How could they suddenly...

506
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:44,360
I feel so relieved that the Officer is getting married.

507
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,440
We should give them space now.

508
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:51,470
Wait! Wait! How could this be?

509
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,240
Wait, but how could he suddenly propose—

510
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,070
Did you not tell me

511
00:50:09,070 --> 00:50:12,920
that it only takes a moment for a man and a woman to fall in love?

512
00:50:19,690 --> 00:50:24,380
From what I can see, I think the Officer suits Lady Sam Soon better than Number 23.

513
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,710
What do you think?

514
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:32,550
That is true, but what do we do about Number 23?

515
00:50:32,550 --> 00:50:35,150
I am sure he thinks he is marrying Lady Sam Soon.

516
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,660
Since he broke his promise, he has no choice.

517
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:43,760
I even gave him an extra tip on attracting a woman with tasty food.

518
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,560
How is it?

519
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,820
Then...

520
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,000
I made this, too.

521
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:02,630
Are you that happy that the Officer and Lady Sam Soon are getting married?

522
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,120
You have been smiling for a while now.

523
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,560
Me?

524
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,270
Does your heart not hurt anymore even though they are together?

525
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:15,140
Though my heart does pound extremely fast,

526
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,390
it does not hurt like before for some reason.

527
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:23,140
Rather, I think I feel pretty happy instead.

528
00:51:24,940 --> 00:51:29,000
  Other matchmakers hear sounds or

529
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,520
  recognize fate with energies from their bodies.

530
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:35,550
  I was wondering how you recognize them.

531
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,530
Your Excellency, by chance, are you—

532
00:51:39,530 --> 00:51:41,230
The wrestling match has probably started already!

533
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:43,530
No, if we go now, we can see it.

534
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:45,290
 Hurry!

535
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,740
Oh, right. The wrestling match.

536
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,800
We are late. Run!

537
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:00,440
When I pick up this rock, you have to pull up the fish with this basket. Okay?

538
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:06,060
Geun Seok! Catch a lot!

539
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,550
Aunt, if you yell like that, all the fish will flee!

540
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,010
Hush, quiet!

541
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:15,070
He is louder than me.

542
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,920
Shall we catch some fish?

543
00:52:19,350 --> 00:52:23,560
One, two, three!

544
00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:25,980
I caught it!

545
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,280
Wow!

546
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,610
Let's do it again!

547
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,230
All right. This time, let's try catching two at once.

548
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,660
Okay.

549
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,430
One, two, three!

550
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,230
Oh, we caught it again!

551
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,140
Geun Seok, you're good at catching fish!

552
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,420
Gosh, I don't see him anywhere.

553
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:55,730
Who am I supposed to give this honey water to?

554
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:57,570
Gosh, whatever, whatever.

555
00:52:57,570 --> 00:52:59,430
I did what I could.

556
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:01,490
Lady Du Ri!

557
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,440
Lady Du Ri!

558
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:06,640
You are Lady Du Ri, right?

559
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,540
Yeojudaek told me to save a seat for you, saying you will come.

560
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,240
Please come this way.

561
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:15,810
She is quite meticulous.

562
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:20,580
Excuse us! Excuse us!

563
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,600
Gosh!

564
00:53:30,330 --> 00:53:32,810
I was worried that you would not come.

565
00:53:32,810 --> 00:53:35,570
What are you talking about? It's not like that.

566
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:41,030
I will win and give the cotton cloth to this maiden!

567
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,970
Gosh, why would you? Don't do that!

568
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,470
All right, come to the center. We need to start.

569
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,570
All right.

570
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:55,990
What's wrong with him?

571
00:53:56,810 --> 00:53:59,920
All right! Grab each other's belts!

572
00:54:04,730 --> 00:54:07,510
Ready, go!

573
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:31,000
 My Lady...

574
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,150
One hit knockout!

575
00:54:43,150 --> 00:54:45,480
All right!

576
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:54,760
Gosh, that idiot! Why would he look at me there?

577
00:54:55,480 --> 00:54:57,660
Gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

578
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,170
You said you would win and give me the cotton cloth.

579
00:55:19,170 --> 00:55:21,440
How could you lose in the first match?

580
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,050
That guy was a champion candidate.

581
00:55:26,050 --> 00:55:28,670
Yes, of course.

582
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:31,220
You should drink this.

583
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,060
Did you bring it to give to me?

584
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:43,050
No. The person I was supposed to give it to didn't show up.

585
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,220
You know how it is not good to waste food.

586
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:49,580
I am grateful to that guy for not showing up.

587
00:55:57,330 --> 00:56:02,290
I cannot give you the cotton cloth, but I do have something to give you.

588
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:11,800
Why are you giving me this...

589
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,610
I bought it to apologize for what happened when we first met,

590
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:18,080
and I also thought it would look better on you.

591
00:56:53,230 --> 00:56:58,080
I am sorry you did not get to compete in the wrestling match because of me.

592
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:03,540
There are wrestling matches at Chuseok, too. It is okay.

593
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,080
Orabeoni.

594
00:57:08,090 --> 00:57:11,400
Live a happy life after getting married.

595
00:57:13,890 --> 00:57:18,570
Do not just farm. Also, take the state exam...

596
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,710
since you are smart, Orabeoni.

597
00:57:28,330 --> 00:57:29,700
Okay.

598
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:34,600
You should also live a happy life.

599
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:57,640
They are not there as well?

600
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,020
I need to check Lady Du Ri because she is unpredictable.

601
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,100
Goodness...

602
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:10,890
By chance, did you see Lady Du Ri at the wrestling match?

603
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:13,010
Oh, I did.

604
00:58:13,010 --> 00:58:17,670
She went that way somewhere with some scholar earlier.

605
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,020
Is he the one you matched her up with?

606
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,780
No wonder he was so handsome.

607
00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:27,090
Thank you for telling me.

608
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:33,620
Since things went well with Lady Du Ri, let us go to the swings.

609
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:40,810
Why does everyone say Number 24 is handsome?

610
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,640

611
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:58,020
 Welcome.

612
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:17,090

613
00:59:20,750 --> 00:59:23,080
What took you so long to get here?

614
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:24,960
I am so nervous!

615
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,320
Do not be nervous, and just do as you have practiced.

616
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,890
But why is Lady Ha Na not here?

617
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,540
There she comes.

618
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:57,180
 The key point of the swinging event will be the walk.

619
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:02,100
 You remember the scholar you met eyes with at Temple Seonhwa while giving him a tip in baduk?

620
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:07,670
 It is not that we met eyes but rather that the scholar unilaterally looked at me.

621
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:12,010
 That scholar will show up at the swinging competition on Dano.

622
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:15,090
 I thought he was just a nerd from a rich family. Not bad.

623
01:00:15,090 --> 01:00:19,820
 If you see the scholar at the swings, approach him naturally.

624
01:00:22,050 --> 01:00:24,880
 If you stop too close to him, you seem too easy.

625
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:30,780
 If you stop too far, the scholar will not recognize you with too many people.

626
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:36,840
 The point is to stop five steps away from him.

627
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,880
 If we are five steps apart,

628
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:42,120
 how will he speak to me?

629
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,360
 Oh, you are right.

630
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:49,510
 I really hate guys who yell.

631
01:00:54,230 --> 01:00:58,540
 The scholar will take the remaining four steps.

632
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:11,810
Don't they look so good standing together like that?

633
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:14,320
Let's not be so senseless in staying here.

634
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,860
Let's go back and watch them from there.

635
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,140
This is the first time I have watched the festivities of Dano like this.

636
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,560
It is not as bad as I thought.

637
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,810
Your first time?

638
01:01:50,860 --> 01:01:53,160
What did you do on Dano in the past?

639
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,770
I read books alone at home because I did not like the hectic environment.

640
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,230
That is also not as bad as you think.

641
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:07,790
Since you got to see it this year, do not just stay home starting next year.

642
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,890
Starting next year, I plan to watch the Dano festivities with you.

643
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:24,480
You do not need to forget your dead husband.

644
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,500
I also have not forgotten the princess.

645
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:32,530
Like you,

646
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:36,810
I probably will never be able to forget her.

647
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:40,770
However,

648
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,590
it is certain that I like you.

649
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,130
Is that not also...

650
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:51,330
true of you, too?

651
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:09,550

652
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:19,610
♫  The moment you faced me like the bright sunlight  ♫

653
01:03:19,610 --> 01:03:26,010
♫  You came down into me, blindingly  ♫

654
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:28,860

655
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:40,170
♫  Among fates as countless as the stars, I met you like a miracle  ♫

656
01:03:40,170 --> 01:03:44,490
♫  The wind is blowing again  ♫

657
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:47,060
  Do you think fate exists?

658
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:49,180
  The relationship between a man and a woman is...

659
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:50,420
 No!

660
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,600
  like fate in the end.

661
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,930
  Does that mean he knows everything you did to Nephew and his wife eight years ago?

662
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,480
  Do you have someone who comes to mind?

663
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:03,670
  Number 12, do not ever let go of this maiden!

664
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:07,560
  Hearing the symptoms, it sounds like Your Excellency is the Ssangyeonsulsa.

665
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,780
 Are you saying you will eliminate him?

666
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:14,110
 I think we should never meet again.

667
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:32,570
