1
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,400

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,540

3
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,220

4
00:00:52,220 --> 00:01:00,330

5
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:05,450

She is a woman, but I am certain she is a respectable spouse.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,900

We will cherish each other and live happily.

7
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:24,860

I believe I met someone who will greatly help my family.

8
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,010

I will fulfill all my duties as a husband.

9
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,910

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,330
Right now?

11
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,840

12
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,010
What is there to prefer or not when it is an arranged marriage?

13
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,590
I think the Defense Minister's family is equal to my family.

14
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,250

My partner is the most mature and respectable man I know, which is why I chose him.

15
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:10,750

The man I will be marrying is kind, brave,

16
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,050
smart, and— W-Wait!

17
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,930
He is handsome, most of all!

18
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:23,860

My older sister and younger sister met their fated ones, so I am fine.

19
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,700
I have nothing more to say.

20
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,450
Honestly, marriage is a crazy thing to do.

21
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,540

22
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,570

23
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:55,150
The reason I climbed the wall is not because I missed you.

24
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:02,250
I came to tell you not to send me any more letters.

25
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:07,240
Is it because you are worried about me?

26
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,110
- I— 
 - No.

27
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,190
As you said before,

28
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,680
my feelings have calmed down.

29
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,440
  Your feelings and mine are... probably just passing winds.

30
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:33,030
  After some time passes, these tempest-like hearts will also... quiet down.

31
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,410
I do not love you anymore, Madam.

32
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,090
Why are you telling me lies you do not mean?

33
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,710
You climbed over the walls of an annex where a widow lives to say

34
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:04,400
not to send you letters when you do not love me?

35
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,430
Did you kindly give me your arm for help so I can get down when you do not love me?

36
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,520
Did your heart race so much when you embraced me

37
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,520
when you do not love me?

38
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:30,520
 Stop meeting my daughter-in-law.

39
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,540
 If you keep meeting her,  will have to take the matter

40
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:39,920
 into my hands for my family.

41
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,380
My heart raced because I was afraid.

42
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,800
I was afraid you would assume my feelings like now

43
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,630
and bring me trouble as well.

44
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:08,250
Hearts naturally race out of fear and

45
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,300
also, when the drums beat.

46
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,040
Hence,

47
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,940
please mind your behavior so as not to cause me trouble.

48
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,080
You raised such a clever and brave daughter.

49
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,470
I did not raise her that way.

50
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,140
She was born that way.

51
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:11,020
Which is why I had a lot of worries.

52
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,820
In Joseon, talents in either the literature or the martial arts

53
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:22,170
are not welcomed traits for a woman.

54
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:28,690
However, they are necessary traits for a woman who is to become the queen.

55
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:33,630
My daughter may not be a docile wife,

56
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,460
but she is wise and sensible.

57
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:42,520
She will be a loyal subject and a dependable life companion for the crown prince.

58
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:47,950
She only needs to be a dependable companion to the crown prince.

59
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,480
I know the crown prince well.

60
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,960
He will surely become a kind husband.

61
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,660
Wow! I think Eldest Sister will become the crown princess!

62
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,370
That little kid must have been the crown prince.

63
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,480
Oh, that was why his stares were so rude.

64
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,010
So, do you think we will become the center of maternal royal relatives

65
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:29,900
and save Eldest Sister in the political strife of the Royal Palace?

66
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,350
What?

67
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,600
Do you really not know Sister?

68
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,130
Our sister does not need either of us to save her.

69
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,790
I decided on the title of the next novel.

70
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,650
"Ladies of the Palace." 
  (Title of a popular historical drama)

71
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,900
I do not feel like eating.

72
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,600
If you do not eat, it will be bad for you.

73
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,040
Take at least a bite.

74
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:22,820
The wedding is to go on as planned

75
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,800
when Father passed away?

76
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,510
What on Earth is Mother thinking?

77
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,910
Just what would people think?

78
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:34,680
Why worry about other people?

79
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,390
This is your wedding.

80
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,930
You are the most important one,

81
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:44,170
so you do not need to wed if you do not want to.

82
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,730
How can I?

83
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,450
Mother's mind is so firmly made up.

84
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,880
I can delay the wedding or

85
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,170
break it off without anyone ever knowing.

86
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,390
So just say the word.

87
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,580
Thank you for even saying that.

88
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,090
 Mother!

89
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,480
I told you Young Madam will take care of her.

90
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:24,040
Did you bring it for your aunt?

91
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,820
Do not even get me started.

92
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:30,450
I was so startled because Young Master had even come into the kitchen.

93
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,750
Gosh, if Madam had seen that...

94
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:41,360
I made you worry even though you are so young because I got so caught up thinking about myself.

95
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,840
I am sorry.

96
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,420
No need to be sorry.

97
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,860
You also took care of me all night when I was sick, Aunt.

98
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,690
That was—

99
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,270
Yes, thank you...

100
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,110
for caring for your aunt.

101
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,750
Please eat up right away.

102
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:03,310
I must see you finish the food.

103
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:07,800
Of course, I will eat.

104
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,980
You should eat first, Geun Seok.

105
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,310
  So are you saying it was right to be sentenced for treason,

106
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:21,510
  having Geun Seok and Ye Jin become slaves,

107
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:25,700
 and just watch the entire household fall apart?

108
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,000
Your Excellency, you got a letter.

109
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,490
Alas!

110
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:49,400
I told you not to receive the letter from the inn anymore!

111
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,600
This is from your brother in Wonju.

112
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,340
You must be waiting for a letter from the Left State Minister's Young Madam.

113
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,020
I am not.

114
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,810
They say people go to a minister's dog's funeral,

115
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,660
but no one will go when the minister dies.

116
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,020
Even the members of the Dongno Party who used to frequent his house so much did not come.

117
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,440
It looks like the Left State Minister's funeral is being held quietly without any notice.

118
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,640
I guess the Left State Minister's family is losing its power now.

119
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,810
I do not think we will have any more visitors.

120
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,270
So, give out all the food to all the servants and sharecroppers.

121
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,140
Yes, Mother.

122
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,460
Your Excellency!

123
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:48,270
Where are you headed?

124
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:58,860
 This is Geun Seok's mother.

125
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,720
Come in.

126
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:22,620
You should stop wearing a mourning dress now and focus on the wedding.

127
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,970
Yes.

128
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:31,080
Also, Ye Jin's wedding will be held with Master Maeng's daughters' at our house.

129
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,010
Prepare for their wedding as well.

130
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:35,080
Pardon?

131
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,010
As my daughter-in-law, not as Yeojudaek.

132
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,920
What do you mean by that?

133
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,320
Why would Young Lady Ye Jin have her wedding with Master Maeng's family?

134
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,620
You will find out when the time passes.

135
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,680
So, just do as I say for now.

136
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,810
Still, Young Lady Ye Jin will not appreciate it.

137
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:57,000
Marriage is also for one's family.

138
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,510
What is there to appreciate or not?

139
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:04,110
I will let Ye Jin know in person, so do not worry about her.

140
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:12,360
Since Master Maeng's eldest was chosen as the crown princess,

141
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,800
you only need to care for the other two's weddings.

142
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,720
Yes, Mother.

143
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,110
It looks like you knew their eldest would become the crown princess.

144
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,990
I am not reprimanding you.

145
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:38,630
I am commending your ability to recognize a person's use and quality.

146
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,890
Why would I wed together with the old maidens?

147
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,000
You should have stopped her since you knew the situation.

148
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,440
Does it make sense for my wedding to happen along with Orabeoni Boo Gyeom's?

149
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,700
I am not doing this.

150
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,100
I cannot!

151
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,430
Is having your wedding with that scholar the problem?

152
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:07,660
That scholar said he would not marry on the night of Dano.

153
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,750
So, Lady Du Ri is marrying a different person.

154
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,560
If you cannot forget that scholar,

155
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,020
you should tell me now.

156
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,220
Perhaps if things were like before...

157
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,900
But if I marry Orabeoni Bu Gyeom now,

158
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,600
people will think it is because my family is going down.

159
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,000
I do not want that.

160
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,610
What matters is your heart. Why do other people's opinions matter?

161
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,600
It matters to me!

162
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,510
I will marry into the Defense Minister's family, no matter what.

163
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,880
If that is what you think, you do that.

164
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,400
However, what matters more than your family...

165
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:56,120
is you, Ye Jin.

166
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,160
You will stay here until the wedding

167
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,810
and learn about court etiquette.

168
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,670
I understand.

169
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,410
Congratulations on your first daughter being chosen as the crown princess.

170
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,190
I heard about the wedding location from His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae.

171
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:14,060
Since the higher-ups decided to do it that way, I will have to obey.

172
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:19,600
We will make sure not to cause any inconvenience, so please rest assured.

173
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,510
I do not worry.

174
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:25,510
Because I know you will do a good job.

175
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,640
Wait, why would we wed in her house?

176
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,750
It is bad luck—

177
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,220
Gosh, p-pretend you heard nothing, Madam.

178
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,060
You are younger sister of Officer. Right?

179
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,880
You have such a gorgeous face.

180
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:55,550
By the way, have we met before?

181
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,570
You look familiar.

182
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,910
Is it because you are too beautiful?

183
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,900
Making useless flattery even before getting married...

184
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,120
We do know each other.

185
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:29,140
This is all thanks to you, Your Excellency.

186
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,930
Your Highness and Maiden Ha Na met because you two were fated to be.

187
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:36,660
I only put the spoon on a table already set.

188
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,110
Without a spoon, it is hard to eat regardless of the feast prepared before me.

189
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:51,200
Right, the Ssangyeonsulsa who said Maiden Ha Na and I were fated to be.

190
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:55,050
Does she happen to be a young widow?

191
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,260
Well, something like that.

192
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:03,330
As expected, the legends were true.

193
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,820
I found out about the sad fate of Ssangyeonsulsa while reading Suijeon, 
  (A collection of folklore from Silla)

194
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,120
so I was going to let you know.

195
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:24,170
In Silla, Ssangyeonsulsa were called sorcerers of loneliness, not love.

196
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:28,640
This is because their spouses die young when they marry their fated ones.

197
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:53,320
Being unable to be with the one they love.

198
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,930
I think their fates are too sad.

199
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,950
Just like a fox's trickery,

200
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,500
how can a person look so different just from makeup?

201
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,480
It is amazing.

202
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:17,160
I apologize for tricking you.

203
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,180
Please take good care of my brother.

204
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,280
I should be asking that of you,

205
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,190
Sister-in-law.

206
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,310
Enough is enough.

207
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:31,500
You have not even gotten married yet, but you are already saying "Sister-in-law"?

208
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,270
Should you not meet your groom before the wedding?

209
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,920
I said I was fine.

210
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,830
It is not like meeting him will change the groom.

211
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,130
You never know.

212
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:50,120
I know it could never happen.

213
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,270
Could it be you have someone else in mind?

214
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,050
I just do not like marriage.

215
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:04,290
May I ask why you do not want to get married?

216
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:24,260
Mother went blind because of me.

217
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:27,780
What do you mean?

218
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,410
Studying was the only thing Father knew,

219
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,390
so he had no interest in how his family was getting fed.

220
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,970
Mother fed our family through matchmaking,

221
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:43,920
but Grandmother and Father were ashamed of Mother.

222
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,070
Saying she did lowly work.

223
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,270
Once I grew up and started making money through sewing,

224
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:55,870
Grandmother fed Mother blinding medicine,

225
00:22:55,870 --> 00:23:00,830
so that Mother cannot go out and work.

226
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,200
Father knew it all along, but he did not stop her.

227
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,450
Why would that be your fault?

228
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,730
It was your grandmother and father's wrongdoing.

229
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,300
I know.

230
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,580
But whenever I see Mother,

231
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,190
it feels like I am to blame.

232
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:29,220
Sam Soon was too young to know back then,

233
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,940
but Sister and I vowed to live together until death do us apart

234
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,650
without marrying when we found out.

235
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:41,680
And I still feel that way.

236
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:44,410
This is why...

237
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:48,110
I do not want to get married.

238
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:27,660
Your Excellency, what brings you here?

239
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,110
If it is regarding this family's daughters' weddings, they will—

240
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,930
I know.

241
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,550
I stopped by to ask Master Maeng's wife something, not because of the wedding.

242
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:06,620
Ssangyeonsulsa's fated ones die young when they get married?

243
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,490
I have never heard of this story.

244
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:14,830
It is true Master Maeng did not die young.

245
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,110
Ha Na's father was not my fated one.

246
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,410
I had a fiancé before I got married.

247
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:28,400
He was my fated one.

248
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,350
A disease spread in my village one week before the wedding

249
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,250
and took his life before anything could be done.

250
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:39,570
We have been married on paper already since we got the certificate.

251
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:43,790
But both families agreed to void it as it never happened.

252
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,770
Does that mean...

253
00:25:45,770 --> 00:25:50,690
he lost his life because I am Ssangyeonsulsa?

254
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,280
I am uncomfortable, so please go ahead.

255
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,880
You can talk to me about it.

256
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,570
About what?

257
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,110
What you want to talk about.

258
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,130
You said you do not like me anymore,

259
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,290
but I still like you just the same, so please talk to me.

260
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,320
I have nothing to tell you.

261
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,580
You cannot see your own face,

262
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:06,150
but your face says you have a lot to say.

263
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:12,880
Even if I do have things I want to say, why would I tell you?

264
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,860
The fact you visited Master Maeng's wife means

265
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:21,790
the matter is about the maidens' marriages or Ssangyeonsulsa.

266
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:25,220
You can talk about both of them only with me.

267
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,850
So tell me about it.

268
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,290
Do not be scared.

269
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,050
Since you smiled, you will tell me. Okay?

270
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,000
I know a good place where we can talk.

271
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:04,880
I worked so hard to find out the reason for the princess's death.

272
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:11,710
You do not think the princess passed away because

273
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:14,330
you are Ssangyeonsulsa, are you?

274
00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:18,970
Is that really what you believe?

275
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:23,320
It is said only the havens know one's lifespan.

276
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,900
It is heavens, not havens.

277
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,840
Exactly.

278
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,140
Why do you believe in a legend from Goryeo when you are so smart?

279
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,740
Well, the thing is...

280
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,610
Master Maeng's wife's fiancé was also...

281
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,200
It is not like you asked all the Ssangyeonsulsas who ever lived.

282
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,630
This sounds like the error of hasty generalization to me.

283
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,410
Madam, why did you become smart all of a sudden?

284
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,780
I learned all of this from you.

285
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,870
Think about it rationally.

286
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,780
Why is it your fault the princess passed away?

287
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,740
The people who used poison for treason are to blame.

288
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:13,230
I still feel like it was my fault.

289
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:18,890
Only if she did not marry me, a Ssangyeonsulsa...

290
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,490
Do not think such things.

291
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:25,280
It was absolutely not your fault.

292
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,960
I am not unconditionally siding with you just because I like you.

293
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,580
This is a fact.

294
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,040
Therefore...

295
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,480
please do not blame yourself.

296
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,570
Thank you.

297
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,620
I am more thankful to you.

298
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,480
While talking to you,

299
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,200
I think I found the solution to what I was conflicted about.

300
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,290
I like...

301
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,180
you...

302
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,910
more...

303
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:20,010
and more, Your Excellency.

304
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:45,740
What did you talk to Yeojudaek about earlier?

305
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,650
Well, about what kind of person my groom is.

306
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:55,290
You also started anticipating your marriage, huh?

307
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:59,690
Gosh, I am so relieved.

308
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:03,520
I was worried you were forcing yourself to marry

309
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,120
just because of me when you hated marrying.

310
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,060
You think I went mad? To force myself to marry for your sake?

311
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,870
Exactly.

312
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:19,100
Gosh, Younger Sister!

313
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:23,490
Let us continue to get along even after we marry.

314
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,420
If you insist.

315
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,600
What is it you want to say?

316
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,410
I thought about your question from the other day.

317
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,300
All right.

318
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:55,710
Did you find a way to protect the family in that situation if you were in my shoes?

319
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,000
No.

320
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,410
I realized that trying to find a way itself was pointless.

321
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:12,430
Because I would not have foolishly decided to kill the crown prince in the first place.

322
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,830
"Foolishly."

323
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,850
Then, are you saying...

324
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,900
you would have just watched Prince Jin Seong lose his right to the throne?

325
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:29,100
If that is the natural course of life, we must obey.

326
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,320
Is it not something we can change by force?

327
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,660
People with power create a natural course of life.

328
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:40,280
Anyone with power will have made the same choice I had made.

329
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,200
In the end, because of that choice,

330
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,160
Father passed away, and you lost Uncle as well.

331
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:54,870
Is this the natural course of life you are talking about, Mother?

332
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,440
I have tried to take after you because I respected you,

333
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,890
but I realized I cannot be the person you want me to be.

334
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,050
Therefore,

335
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,010
I plan to find my own method from now on.

336
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,550
Sure, go ahead and find one.

337
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:23,010
Because you will have to lead this family at the end of the day.

338
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,410

339
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:05,570
Congratulations on Crown Prince's marriage.

340
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:09,970
I never thought I would ever be congratulated by you...

341
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:11,670
for Crown Prince's marriage.

342
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:16,970
Forgive us for what my child has done in the past.

343
00:34:16,970 --> 00:34:21,260
In the future, I will follow you loyally, Your Highness the Queen.

344
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,840
You may do so.

345
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:29,130
With that said, how about you send Prince Jin Seong

346
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:33,670
as the head of the envoys that are setting out in August?

347
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:38,800
Would you not feel more at ease as well if Prince Jin Seong is not in Joseon?

348
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,320
Do you think Prince Jin Seong would agree to go?

349
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:46,300
Especially since it is for bringing back the appointment letter for the crown prince.

350
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:50,300
If that is what you are worried about,

351
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:55,180
how about you send Prince Gyeongwoonjae with him?

352
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,940
- Prince Consort? 
 - If Prince Consort goes with Prince Jin Seong,

353
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,220
would you not feel better about it as well, Your Highness?

354
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:09,680
And this will be a great joy for Prince Consort as a royal family member.

355
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,980
I will consider it.

356
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:28,170
The wife of His Excellency Jo came to me and suggested sending Prince Gyeongwoonjae

357
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:31,970
with the envoys for Crown Prince to the Ming Dynasty.

358
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,350
Is that so?

359
00:35:33,350 --> 00:35:35,710
Hearing that, it seems to me...

360
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:42,580
Prince Consort is someone the crown prince really needs.

361
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,370
Therefore, so that Prince Consort can assist the crown prince well,

362
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:52,320
I would like for you to accept his marriage annulment appeal.

363
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,440
If I accept the appeal,

364
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,350
that would mean the princess passed away without getting married.

365
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,670
Would that be okay with you?

366
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,950
From the start, did you not say that the reason

367
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:11,560
Prince Consort made the appeal was because of the princess's will?

368
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:15,050
That is true.

369
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,670
I also found it a shame that Prince Consort's talent was being wasted,

370
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,740
so I felt bad every time I saw him.

371
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:27,160
Thank you for saying so first.

372
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,450
What brings you all the way here?

373
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:49,950
I came to have a drink with my son-in-law as a father-in-law, like an ordinary noble.

374
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,600

375
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:09,350
You must have been so lonely living here by yourself all those years.

376
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:11,440
I have kept myself busy during that time.

377
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,540
By writing up the marriage annulment appeals?

378
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,160
That was not the only thing I have been doing.

379
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:23,180
You said you were fine,

380
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:26,230
but after this wedding is over,

381
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:30,520
I am thinking of accepting your marriage annulment appeal as promised.

382
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,010
Your Majesty, I like how things are right now.

383
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:45,910
Did not the princess tell you to take a government position and help me?

384
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,950
Will you not fulfill the princess's dying wish?

385
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,950
I realized many things while matchmaking for people under Your Majesty's orders.

386
00:37:56,870 --> 00:38:00,580
  Love is everywhere and the beginning of everything.

387
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:06,340
  We must tell people the truth and turn the false rumor into a commendable story

388
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:09,520
  and even punish the most vicious murderer as well.

389
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,390
  If it is okay with Your Excellency, I would like to find the real culprit together

390
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:16,810
  since it still is my past, even though I have no memory of it.

391
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,630
I realized I do not need a government position to serve my country.

392
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:30,450
I will serve you loyally from my current place.

393
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:34,780
It appears you finally learned how things are in the world.

394
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,120
If you take a government position, you can do even more to serve me.

395
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:46,800
Thus, prepare yourself to work for your country and people.

396
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,330
This is what I am commanding you as your king, not as your father-in-law.

397
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,550
What?

398
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,530
Are you doing this because you do not want to work a lot?

399
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:04,930
How long will you just loaf around here?

400
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:12,310
I will obey the king's command.

401
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,520
Then...

402
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,030
I suppose you will need to take care of the old maidens' weddings first.

403
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:28,800
The crown prince asked to attend that wedding.

404
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,530
But that house is—

405
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,540
I know.

406
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,060
I also do not feel good about sending the crown prince to that house,

407
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:41,320
but if you think about it, it is the wedding of his future sisters-in-law,

408
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,540
so it makes sense for his attendance,

409
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:50,200
and I thought it was not bad for his first political action, so I allowed it.

410
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,210
Now, I have to show them that the crown prince is not someone to be feared.

411
00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:04,100
Thus, you should assist the crown prince by his side, Jeong Woo.

412
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:08,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

413
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:14,070
Pour me a drink.

414
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,190
Why did you not tell me?

415
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:43,310
- Oh, that is... 
 - You had so many opportunities to tell me.

416
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,220
Do not worry too much. My younger sister is—

417
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:53,040
Why would I worry?

418
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,310
I am so happy.

419
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,410
If Yeojudaek becomes my younger sister-in-law,

420
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:02,990
will she not actively support my novel-writing?

421
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,630
Oh, I see.

422
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:12,830
I will not tell you to stop writing.

423
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:17,300
But I would like you to tone down the maturity level.

424
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:22,430
By chance, are you telling me not to write anything erotic?

425
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,790
- Yes. 
 - I cannot do that.

426
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,250
Without that, the madams will quickly lose interest in my work.

427
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:33,610
Then, you should write something that is more realistic.

428
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:38,540
The see-through clothing that appears at the end of "Madam's Private Life," volume one.

429
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,270
How does that make any sense?

430
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:42,670
Oh, I see.

431
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,800
You are talking about the Madam's combat uniform, I see.

432
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,810
Such clothing does exist.

433
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,050
Do not make things up just because I do not know it.

434
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:57,860
You say you do not like erotic stuff, but you seem to remember it quite well.

435
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,140
Do you find this fun?

436
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,570
Yes.

437
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:09,010
Do not tease me.

438
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,910
Is it okay for you to go around now?

439
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:17,460
I had to run Mother's errand to find a matchmaker for Lady Ye Jin.

440
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,790
I thought all that was left was to have the wedding.

441
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,670
Why are you looking for a matchmaker?

442
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,270
Should I do it for you?

443
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:25,310
I already found someone.

444
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:27,740
Someone perfect for the job.

445
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:35,070
Gosh, it came in nicely.

446
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,530
It came in nicely.

447
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,200
Are you surnamed Lee?

448
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,940
Yes, I am. Why?

449
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,370
By chance...

450
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:54,620
We met at Temple Seonhwa on Buddha's birthday. Right?

451
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,380
Which family are you from?

452
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,310
She is the Young Madam of the Left State Minister's house.

453
00:42:58,310 --> 00:42:59,460
Show your respect.

454
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,250
Goodness, the one who is supposedly crazy?

455
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:05,160
Oh, well, I mean...

456
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:08,490
In any case, what brings you here?

457
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:11,670
Sam Wol's mother should have tipped me off about this.

458
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,080
The Yeojudaek, who was doing the matchmaking for our lady, suddenly disappeared,

459
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,850
so I am considering entrusting you with this since you have the most experience with this.

460
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:23,270
I would be honored to do matchmaking for the Left State Minister's family.

461
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,080
All you have to do is

462
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:29,650
receive the formal proposal letter and the box of wedding gifts from the Minister of Defense's family.

463
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,300
Watch yourself so no rumors spread.

464
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,200
Of course.

465
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,150
I am very good at keeping secrets.

466
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,160
I entrust you with this.

467
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,430
The Left State Minister's daughter and the Defense Minister's son are getting married?

468
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:55,940
It is a secret, so do not tell anyone.

469
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,240
Do not worry.

470
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,710
But do you know what is the craziest part?

471
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:03,890
Yeojudaek fled in the middle of the night.

472
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:06,600
- Why? Why? 
 - What do you mean why?

473
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,950
Seeing how the slave hunter is searching for her, she must be a runaway slave,

474
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:12,560
and she probably fled because she was afraid of being identified.

475
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,200
She did not seem like that.

476
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,950
What do you mean? She definitely seemed that way to me.

477
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:21,790
I should head off to the Minister of Defense's home now.

478
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,600
They always hire me for the important tasks.

479
00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:28,970
Amazing.

480
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:32,090
The Defense Minister's son and the Left State Minister's daughter are getting married?

481
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:34,110
The Left State Minister's family still has it.

482
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,160
Yeah!

483
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,320
Hyungnim! 
  (Another way to address older sister)

484
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,940
Amazing news! The Left State Minister's daughter...

485
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,260
and the Defense Minister's son are getting married.

486
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:46,510
What...

487
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:49,520
How did you know?

488
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,160
What is more amazing is—

489
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,880
Yeojudaek fled in the middle of the night?

490
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,950
 What...

491
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,930
She said it was a secret, yet she had told everyone herself!

492
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:04,830
By tomorrow, the news will have spread throughout all of Hanyang.

493
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:10,230
That is why you asked Lee, who has the biggest mouth.

494
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:15,800
I think Mother wants to show that our family is still holding strong.

495
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:22,440
As you have said, I think your mother-in-law is incredible, Madam.

496
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:31,840
I am thinking of selling this place and going to the Ming Dynasty

497
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:34,850
to open a facial powder business there.

498
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:37,320
With that Officer?

499
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:43,580
The officer and I are not like that.

500
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:47,120
What do you mean you are not? It is clear that you are.

501
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,840
That officer likes you, Yeojudaek.

502
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:53,810
You know that my deductions are like that of a psychic's.

503
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,410
I know.

504
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:06,450
I used those feelings of the officer in order for me to survive.

505
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:11,240
I knew he liked me.

506
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,800
That is why I asked him to spare me.

507
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:23,390
Because I knew he could not refuse me.

508
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:27,960
Because of that, he was removed from his position

509
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,560
and his life was ruined.

510
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:37,270
But you like him, too, Yeojudaek.

511
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:43,810
How could I dare to like him?

512
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:45,650
Gosh, it is so frustrating.

513
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,900
Madam, you should do something.

514
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:53,330
Mister said he was leaving today.

515
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:54,930
What?

516
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,680
Then why are you here?

517
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:02,540
Go and hold onto him.

518
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,140
There is no shame when it comes to love.

519
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,660
Did I not tell you to stop sending me letters?

520
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,730
Why are you not listening to me!

521
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,710
You came pretty early for someone angry.

522
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:24,690
I called you because there is something only you can fix.

523
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,750
I cannot do it.

524
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,050
Why not?

525
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:36,050
All you have to do is tell them they are a fated match.

526
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,230
When I saw them, my heart did not race.

527
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:43,750
They are not meant to be.

528
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,150
Then, just lie to them.

529
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:49,680
I told them you are a Ssangyeonsulsa, Your Excellency.

530
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,100
Why should I?

531
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,500
Since they are not meant to be,

532
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
they will be able to forget each other.

533
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,110
People who are not meant to be can still like each other!

534
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:03,330
Did we like each other because we were meant to be?

535
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,170
Mister!

536
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,660
Mister, don't leave.

537
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:20,950
You should live with us.

538
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:32,820
I need to go.

539
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:46,050
Please do not leave.

540
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:02,600
It is not your fault,

541
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,360
but because I liked you,

542
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:09,740
my wife could not get any medicine and suffered for a long time before dying.

543
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:14,350
I cannot live with you after all that.

544
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,260
I would feel so bad for my late wife if I did so.

545
00:49:27,510 --> 00:49:32,050
If you live such a harsh life, will you no longer feel bad?

546
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:38,850
As someone who can see connections,

547
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:43,730
I can see you two met again after all these years because you were meant to be.

548
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:49,210
So, forget about the past and live together.

549
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,360
Even if you leave right now, you two will meet again.

550
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,870
You two have such a destiny.

551
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,450
They will be happy together forever, for sure.

552
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,540
Though they may not be meant to be,

553
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,330
I can see they love each other so much.

554
00:50:45,330 --> 00:50:47,920
If they love each other that much,

555
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,210
they should not separate even if I do not lie to them, saying they are meant to be.

556
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:58,030
They had too many burdens on their hearts for that.

557
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:04,040
There is nothing like fate to help relieve those burdens.

558
00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:11,430
I will be going since I have done all I need to do.

559
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:13,330
Your Excellency.

560
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,830
Can you please stop this now?

561
00:51:20,830 --> 00:51:23,730
Acting like you do not like me.

562
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:30,570
I am going through a lot of difficulties as is...

563
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,940
You are going through difficulties?

564
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,400
Is something the matter?

565
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:41,660
Please say something!

566
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,720
You worry about me this much, and yet you try to act like you don't like me.

567
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,440
Then, what can I do?

568
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,080
I have no other way, but I get worried about you,

569
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:01,300
and I miss you to death.

570
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:06,280
Well, do you think I am doing this because I want to?

571
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:10,710
It is so much better that you are being honest.

572
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:18,950
Do you know what words I hate the most in novels?

573
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:22,400
The words, "I am leaving you because I love you."

574
00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,960
The day I climbed the walls of Gyeongwoonjae, I made up my mind

575
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:29,710
to be with you, Your Excellency.

576
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,620
But how?

577
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,880
I do not know the way yet.

578
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,190
However, do not worry.

579
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:46,860
I am the best in Joseon at bringing two people together.

580
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,460
The Minister's Wife is way more fearsome than you think—

581
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:02,520
I am way braver than you think, Your Excellency.

582
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:08,120
So, please trust me a bit and wait for me.

583
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:20,410
Did you hear the story?

584
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:21,580
Yes, I heard it.

585
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,130
So what are we supposed to do?

586
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:24,850
Shouldn't someone take responsibility?

587
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:28,620
Gosh, I am a bit late.

588
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:32,740
There is so much work at Hanseongbu.

589
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:35,800
All right.

590
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,170
I am thinking of having a Dongno Party meeting at my house.

591
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:41,640
What day will be good for you?

592
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,960
It appears you have not heard the news yet.

593
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:52,380
- What news? 
 - For successfully marrying off old bachelors and old maidens,

594
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,730
the king will be accepting Prince Gyeongwoonjae's marriage annulment appeal.

595
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:02,100
Then, should His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae not become the leader of the Dongno Party?

596
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,410
I know, right?

597
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,770
But still, we cannot make someone so young...

598
00:54:11,770 --> 00:54:16,300
He has no experience in politics. How could we make him the leader?

599
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,120
He is smart.

600
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,820
He is the youngest first place for the state exam in Joseon history.

601
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:28,030
Oh, did you not place third then, Mayor?

602
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:33,120
There are rumors that he will be appointed the Mayor of Hanseongbu after the appeal is accepted.

603
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:40,200
Nothing in Hanseongbu has been resolved, like the old maidens and high housing costs.

604
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,350
Goodness...

605
00:54:49,750 --> 00:54:53,570
This is my wedding gift to you.

606
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:58,580
Is this not the Art of War?

607
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:02,380
The Art of War is not only needed in battle.

608
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:05,550
You need to strategize when you are leading a family as well.

609
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:08,850
It will be helpful if you hold onto it and read it.

610
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:11,430
Yes, Mother.

611
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:16,020
After you get married, you have to follow and serve your husband.

612
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,350
However, that does not mean you must obey him, no matter what.

613
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:24,760
You need to know to direct your husband in the right direction.

614
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,130
That way, your husband will have confidence in you

615
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:31,110
and you two will be on equal footing in marriage.

616
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,120
I do not know if I can accept this.

617
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:51,890
I really wanted to give you a wedding gift.

618
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:54,830
So do not feel any pressure.

619
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,270
Thank you.

620
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,440
To be honest, I also prepared a wedding gift for Young Master.

621
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:05,960
My goodness.

622
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:09,820
Are you not busy with your own wedding preparations?

623
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:11,910
Thank you.

624
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,850
Gosh.

625
00:56:13,850 --> 00:56:16,630
It is pretty.

626
00:56:16,630 --> 00:56:18,370
It is pretty.

627
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:21,950
I embroidered a butterfly over here, so your son will be appointed

628
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:25,490
to a high position in the government.

629
00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:47,110
Have you come?

630
00:56:47,110 --> 00:56:49,150
I am leaving now.

631
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:16,960
What is it? Why are you following me?

632
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,790
I am not following you.

633
00:57:19,790 --> 00:57:22,750
It just happens we are heading in the same direction.

634
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,120
Where are you going?

635
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,570
Well...

636
00:57:27,570 --> 00:57:30,830
I am on my way to see a friend.

637
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:35,620
You know how I have a shaman friend in Namsan Village.

638
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,750
Is everything going well with your wedding preparations?

639
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:55,740
The government should be doing the preparations,

640
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:58,110
since such a precious old maiden is getting married.

641
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:01,780
Gosh, that is "awesomely amazing".

642
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:03,980
I guess you picked up a line.

643
00:58:07,410 --> 00:58:11,330
Crown Prince will be coming to the wedding?

644
00:58:11,330 --> 00:58:16,280
Thanks to that, officials will be attending the wedding.

645
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,610
They will come in droves after not showing their face at all at the funeral.

646
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,810
This is why I am having Ye Jin have a joint wedding with Master Maeng's daughters.

647
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:36,490
Ye Jin getting married off to the Defense Minister's family,

648
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:40,560
and the eldest daughter of Master Maeng becoming the crown princess

649
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,270
was all thanks to you.

650
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,890
Not only that, your orabeoni and the crown prince have become brothers-in-law.

651
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,840
Mother,

652
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:55,060
I did not do that for our family.

653
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,740
I just found a match that both sides wanted and connected them.

654
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:02,080
So, what is the difference?

655
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:06,510
In the end, are not the partner that Ye Jin wanted, the family background that I wanted,

656
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:10,180
and the marriages that you set up all the same?

657
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:16,280
- But— 
 - I will not stop you from finding your own way.

658
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,750
In the end, we are all on the same side.

659
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:38,870

660
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:42,450
You are here, new groom.

661
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:48,820
Let us go.

662
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:18,680
 They are coming!

663
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:21,020
 Goodness.

664
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:46,870
 They are coming.

665
01:03:00,790 --> 01:03:03,190
Why are you standing there, Madam?

666
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:05,490
Then why are you standing there, Your Excellency?

667
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:48,240

668
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:52,450
♫  Strange emotions fill me and confuse me  ♫

669
01:03:52,450 --> 01:03:57,860
♫  Because of you, because of you, I've got a lot on my mind  ♫

670
01:03:57,860 --> 01:04:01,180
♫  Love is falling again, love is coming to me again  ♫

671
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:03,400
♫  Love is coming to me again, my heart is racing by itself  ♫

672
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,240
 Where did Lady Ye Jin go?

673
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:08,840
 Do you think I prepared all this just so those old maidens can get married?

674
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:11,440
 Let us make a plan to marry off all three couples.

675
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,810
 From the wedding ceremony to the bridal chamber,

676
01:04:13,810 --> 01:04:16,490
 you must do what I tell you to do.

677
01:04:16,490 --> 01:04:19,030
 You must never show your face.

678
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:22,270
 Switch it with this and put it on the snack table.

679
01:04:22,270 --> 01:04:24,770
 Will it really be okay?

680
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:29,300
 Once this wedding is finished, let us run away together.

681
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:34,850
♫  Honestly, I am surprised by how I do not act like myself  ♫

682
01:04:34,850 --> 01:04:37,800
♫  Why do I keep being like this?  ♫

683
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:46,840

684
01:04:46,840 --> 01:04:49,750
