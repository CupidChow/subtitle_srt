1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:09,590

2
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,320

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,370

4
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:45,920

5
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:18,180

I am happy we get to live with Mister, thanks to the matchmaker madam.

6
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,860
Why do I like Mister?

7
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,400
Because he is responsible and a good person.

8
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,820
How would I know?

9
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,170
Can you not just tell by looking?

10
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,770

11
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,020

Mother is like the heavenly maiden from the fairytale Aunt told me.

12
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:54,040
One who came down from the heavens on a well bucket.

13
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,440
That is why it makes me happy and worried at the same time.

14
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,540
Because she might go back to the heavens when she gets her fairy dress back.

15
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,320
However, I am all grown up now and

16
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,140
I think I should get her fairy dress back as her son.

17
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,280

18
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:21,020
The crown prince will arrive by the time the wedding starts.

19
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,860
I did receive the word.

20
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,550
Royal Kitchen's court maids will help with the food preparation,

21
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,730
so please tell us the kitchen's location and anything they should know.

22
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,710
My daughter-in-law will inform them.

23
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,260
Please come this way.

24
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,880
Yes.

25
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,750
Madam!

26
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,500
His Excellency Park sent a jar of alcohol and

27
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,420
His Excellency Myeong of Pildong sent 40 croakers and a jar of honey.

28
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:56,070
Record all the wedding favors in detail

29
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,600
so none of them are omitted, including the sender's name.

30
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,710
Yes, Madam.

31
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,080
They did not even show face during the funeral,

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,680
but now are making a scene since the crown prince is coming, huh?

33
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:37,320
You can come in for now.

34
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,700
Your clothes are very pretty.

35
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,110
What's wrong? Do you not want me to get married?

36
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,250
Not at all. That is not even a question.

37
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,750
Marriages are celebrations for a family, are they not?

38
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:11,490
I am already sad because I might not be able to see you as much anymore.

39
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:18,650
I am also sad that I cannot hear the fun stories you tell.

40
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:20,420
Also,

41
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:26,270
I am also sad I cannot go fish with that big brother on Dano.

42
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,710
Did you really enjoy fishing with him so much?

43
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:40,150
Yes, I think I will remember it for a long time.

44
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,430
I also think...

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,210
I will remember it as long as I live.

46
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,370
 Gosh, what is this?

47
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,270
 Don't you dare take it off.

48
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:13,960
 Brother, live a happy life after getting married.

49
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,420
 Do not just farm.

50
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,700
 Also, take the state exam...

51
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,700
 since you are smart, Brother.

52
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:58,670
 You know I am making all of your wedding-favor futons. Right?

53
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,300
 I will sew a needle into your futons if you keep getting on my bad side.

54
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,370
Looks like I did not get on her bad side after all.

55
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,560
Sister, Eldest Sister and the palanquin are here, too! Hurry up and come out!

56
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,030
O-Oh, yes.

57
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,410
Young Madam!

58
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,720
Namsan Village's young ladies and Madam are here.

59
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,460
Really?

60
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:20,050
His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae came with them.

61
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,220
Sorry for the long trip you had to make.

62
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,670
It was comfortable, thanks to the palanquins you sent.

63
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,510
Geun Seok's Mother, please show the young ladies to their room.

64
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,460
Yes, Mother.

65
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,030
There is an inviting table in the men's quarters and the annex.

66
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,530
You can go first and take a look.

67
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,680
Once the grooms arrive, I will come over with Master Maeng's wife.

68
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,170
Please come with me.

69
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,360
Let us go.

70
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,060
Please come in.

71
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,580
The person who will help with your makeup and hair will come soon.

72
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,290
Wow.

73
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:59,570
So this is what Yeojudaek's room looks like.

74
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,320
Right, I should call you Madam, not Yeojudaek.

75
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,950
Incorrect. It is Sister-in-Law.

76
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,450
I love it, Sister-in-Law.

77
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:16,930
Would it be okay for me to write a novel with you as the main character?

78
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,840
Of course.

79
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,320
I will be in your care.

80
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,690
Let us go.

81
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,290
Goodness, Your Excellency Gyeongoonjae!

82
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,440
You must be awfully busy.

83
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,250
You crowded in quite early.

84
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,260
There is a lot of time left until the wedding.

85
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:52,190
This is the wedding of Hanseongbu's old bachelors and maidens.

86
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:57,550
As the mayor, I should come early and make sure everything is fine.

87
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,260
You had no interest just a few months ago.

88
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:05,570
It looks like you gained interest after learning the crown prince will also be coming.

89
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,220
 The groom is here!

90
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,260
Oh, looks like they arrived. Let us go!

91
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:32,750
He must be the Defense Minister's son, who will become this family's son-in-law.

92
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,890
He is handsome, just as I heard.

93
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,900
That man is the young master who was flirting in broad daylight.

94
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,510
Sorry?

95
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,670
That would mean...

96
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,810
 What do you think you're doing in broad daylight!

97
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,420
 A man and a woman should be separated.

98
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,280
He is Lady Du Ri's fated one.

99
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:02,700
Whoa! Officer is here, too.

100
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,930
He looks more manly today, perhaps because he is a groom.

101
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,070
At first, he was in-laws with the Left State Minister and

102
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,840
now, he is in-laws with the crown prince.

103
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,110
He was born with good luck if anything.

104
00:12:29,110 --> 00:12:32,220
However, you never know until you enter the newlywed room

105
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,720
whether it is good luck or bad luck.

106
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:41,680
Are there not a total of three grooms?

107
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,630
He will come when he is ready. Go inside and wait.

108
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,400
Well, okay, then.

109
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:54,030
I will take my sweet time to see if the banquet Your Excellency

110
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:58,370
prepared is successful to the very end.

111
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,310
Let us go in.

112
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,890
Go out and see how far away Scholar Number 16 is.

113
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,580
Yes.

114
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:21,150
The grooms are here.

115
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,250
You can put your hair up now.

116
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,910
Ye Jin disappeared? What do you mean?

117
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,280
She said she had an upset stomach and was going to the outhouse.

118
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,480
But she has not shown up no matter how much I wait.

119
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,920
She is nowhere to be found inside the house.

120
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:59,400
When I checked again, there was a letter left on her vanity.

121
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,850

122
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,950
 Mother, I am sorry.

123
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:17,710
 I already have feelings for someone else.

124
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:22,880
 I do not think I can wed when I have feelings for another man.

125
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,850
Mother, the crown prince will be arriving soon.

126
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:40,710
Where did Ye Jin go?

127
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:27,380
Mother, how about we postpone Ye Jin's wedding?

128
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,240
How can we postpone a wedding when even the crown prince is attending?

129
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,920
His Highness is attending as a guest for Master Maeng's daughters' weddings.

130
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,170
He will understand if we say Ye Jin is unwell.

131
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,720
You think I prepared this event merely to marry off some old maidens?

132
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,400
In fact, Ye Jin has been in love with someone for a long time.

133
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,930
Right now, she is probably going to

134
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,130
Did you think I did not know?

135
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:58,670
I will not let Ye Jin marry someone like him!

136
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,880
Mother, Ye Jin took the biggest courage of her life

137
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,280
because she does not want to regret it.

138
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,300
So, please let Ye Jin do as she wishes.

139
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,890
That is foolishness, not courage.

140
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,170
She might think the feelings of love are everything right now,

141
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,510
but only regret remains after living for a while.

142
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,650
I know Ye Jin the best.

143
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,860
She can never last with a man like him.

144
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,980
However, the crown prince is arriving soon, and we also need to hold the wedding.

145
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:35,410
We cannot hold the wedding without Ye Jin, can we? So—

146
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,250
We can just...

147
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,960
hold the wedding with any stand-in.

148
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,100
We just need to make sure she goes into the newlywed room.

149
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:54,860
Madam, the crown prince has arrived.

150
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:58,320
I think you have to go out now.

151
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,120
Bring me Bang Ja right now.

152
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,820
Pardon?

153
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,960
Have you arrived, Crown Prince?

154
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:25,370
I will escort you to where Her Highness the Crown Princess-to-be is.

155
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:33,380
I came to watch the wedding of old bachelors and maidens Prince Gyeongwoonjae set up.

156
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:37,200
So I will have Gyeongwoonjae escort me.

157
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:41,550
Please come this way.

158
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:57,270
Ye Jin must be at Yoon's, who helps out my side of the family.

159
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:00,040
Bring her back in two hours, no matter what it takes.

160
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,010
Yes, Madam!

161
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,860
Go to the palace right now, show them this letter,

162
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,570
and receive the bridal coat from Her Highness.

163
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,230
Yes.

164
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:20,000
Mother, is this not the same as fooling the Defense Minister's son?

165
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,700
- If they find out later— 
 - I will take care of it.

166
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:29,420
You go bring Geun Seok and come to the women's quarters.

167
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:41,010
I wanted to see how weddings were held in private homes.

168
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:46,310
Most of all, I wanted to attend because it was my sisters-in-law's wedding.

169
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,420
Have you arrived?

170
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,220
This is Honorable Lady Jeonggyeong Park and her grandson.

171
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:16,310
I heard from His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae that your grandson is brilliant and kind-spirited.

172
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:20,240
Thank you for looking at him favorably.

173
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:25,990
Seeing the preparations for the wedding,

174
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:31,950
I am reminded of the wedding between my eldest sister and Prince Gyeongwoonjae from eight years ago.

175
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,160
You had attended my wedding, Crown Prince?

176
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:42,020
I heard Sister could not eat anything since the morning that day,

177
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,170
so I brought her my yakgwa. 
  (A deep-fried, wheat-based snack)

178
00:19:52,890 --> 00:20:00,830

179
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,490
The entire palace will be busy on the day of the princess's wedding.

180
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,230
So replace it with this and put it on Grand Prince Woon Hae's snack table.

181
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,650
Will it really be okay?

182
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,960
The geumjam poison in this yakgwa does not leave any evidence.

183
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,070
So, no one will know even if he dies from eating it.

184
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,280
Sister really liked the yakgwa that day.

185
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,670
I did not know she would pass so vainly.

186
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,980
I did not know that had happened.

187
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,170
Was it your doing, Madam?

188
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:23,070
I also found out only today about what happened eight years ago.

189
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,540
I realized we were both out of luck.

190
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:30,330
Out of luck?

191
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,700
They are all things in the past.

192
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,440
The crown prince is alive and

193
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,090
His Majesty also decided to stay quiet about it for Prince Jin Seong.

194
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:47,340
Do you really think His Majesty dismissed this case for Prince Jin Seong's sake?

195
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:58,430
He did it for Brother In Hyeon, who died eight years ago.

196
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,950

These letters contain not only evidence of stealing from the tributes

197
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,600
 but also of treason for attempting to murder Grand Prince Woon Hae.

198
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,900
 The sentence for the Left State Minister was my reply to his son's loyalty.

199
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:21,100
 The Left State Minister's family was saved by their dead son, not his mother.

200
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:29,560
Hyungnim knew his family was going to poison the crown prince to death and tried to stop it.

201
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:35,590
His Majesty knew his loyalty and decided to preserve the Left State Minister's honor.

202
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:43,380
Your greed is what killed your son,

203
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,750
in addition to the princess.

204
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,190
I have decided.

205
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,420
D-Decided what?

206
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,800
I must let the Defense Minister's son know that his bride ran away.

207
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,060
Have you gone mad?

208
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,330
The wedding cannot happen if the groom is not here, either.

209
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,780
You cannot!

210
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:35,860
If Madam finds out, you will be in serious trouble!

211
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,310
We already have serious trouble.

212
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:42,420
It is right for me to take responsibility since I made the match.

213
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,490
Young Madam! Young Madam!

214
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:50,340
Gosh, seriously!

215
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,140
Your Excellency, this is bad!

216
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,700
What are you saying?

217
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,730
Number 16 already got married?

218
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,840
I went to his house since he did not show up.

219
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,370
They were having a feast already after he wed the daughter of Sir Chae of Gyedong.

220
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,170
 I wed the first daughter of Sir Chae the day before yesterday.

221
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,520
 W-Wait, did you not say you liked Lady Du Ri?

222
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,970
 I reckoned she would be of help to the family because she is good at sewing.

223
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,490
 So, I was going to let her marry me even though she was an old maiden.

224
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,610
 But I was not happy about it.

225
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,590
 W-Why did you not say anything when I came to see you five days ago?

226
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:47,610
 The mayor wanted to keep it quiet, so I could not help it, either.

227
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:51,640
 Sir Chae is an in-law of the mayor.

228
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,920
Why did Number 16 marry a different woman when he has Lady Du Ri?

229
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,320
I-I think the mayor is the one behind this.

230
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,850
From what I heard, he was promised a position at Hanseongbu.

231
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:07,000
He said he had feelings for Lady Du Ri for a long time.

232
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,050
How can his feelings change for a mere public office?

233
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,600
Is marriage a joke?

234
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,320
How can you manage your work like this, Your Excellency?

235
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,960
Well, the thing is...

236
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,110
Lady Du Ri might look strong,

237
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:31,670
but do you know how fragile her heart is?

238
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,690
How hurt would Lady Du Ri be if her groom did not show up on their wedding day?

239
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,820
It will haunt her for life!

240
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:43,770
Young Master Shi Yeol's bride will not be coming, either.

241
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:47,230
Gosh, how long have you been there?

242
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,310
W-Wait, what do you mean by that?

243
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,110
Well,

244
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,510
our young lady suddenly disappeared.

245
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:06,140
What about today's wedding?

246
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,370
What is going to happen?

247
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,260
This is totally a break-off.

248
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:14,040
Goodness, what is His Excellency going to do?

249
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,410
Gosh, they will take care of it just fine.

250
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,870
Who are you worried about?

251
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:22,760
The nobles are the last people you need to worry about.

252
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,010
Hence, I do not think your wedding can happen today.

253
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,050
I am sorry.

254
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:48,350
Gosh, Maiden Sam Soon will be disappointed if she cannot wed today.

255
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,880
 It is actually better!

256
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:54,500
- What? 
 - Huh?

257
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,540
Lady Du Ri is actually fated to be with Young Master Shi Yeol, not Number 16!

258
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,010
I knew it.

259
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,250
I actually have feelings for Lady Du Ri.

260
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,130
I thought I could forget her quickly, but I could not and it pained me.

261
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:17,950
As expected, my chest was not wrong!

262
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,590
Now, we just need to confirm Lady Du Ri's feelings.

263
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:25,720
Lady Du Ri also likes Young Master Shi Yeol.

264
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,590
Did you know about them already?

265
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,980
I also confirmed it after seeing the butterfly.

266
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,620
Here.

267
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,010
Lady Du Ri's socks have the same butterfly embroidery.

268
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,740
Were the two of you going to dare wear the

269
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,600
same butterfly socks and marry someone else?

270
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:09,980
It was an arranged marriage by my family, so I could not refuse.

271
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,910
But I am happy now that the marriage has been broken off.

272
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:16,650
You are happy the marriage was broken off?

273
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,700
How can you only think about yourself?

274
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,550
Thinking about how disappointed Maiden Sam Soon will be...

275
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,080
makes my heart break apart.

276
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,190
That Young Master should have honestly said he did not want to marry from the beginning.

277
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,900
What are we going to do now?

278
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,650
Would he be a noble if he was honest?

279
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:39,510
They live off of saving their face.

280
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,200
All right, everyone calm down.

281
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,500
In summary, one groom did not come, and one bride ran away.

282
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,120
But Lady Du Ri and the Defense Minister's young master were secretly dating.

283
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,300

284
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:04,610

285
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:06,320
We will not be able to wed today.

286
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,080
Today's weddings will happen as planned.

287
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,720
How can we wed as planned when the bride ran away?

288
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,970
- I do not want to! 
 - Hold on.

289
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:25,200
Are you saying we should have Lady Du Ri marry Young Master Shi Yeol

290
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,570
instead of Lady Ye Jin, so we will have only two couples wed?

291
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,280
Oh, that is what she meant.

292
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,830
No.

293
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,310
We are going to have all three couples wed today.

294
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,520
Wait! We only have two couples right now.

295
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:47,150
The other couple is our Lady Ye Jin and Scholar Number 24.

296
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,260
Number 24 was...

297
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,440
 I have another woman I have feelings for.

298
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,920
 I do not think I can marry Master Maeng's second daughter.

299
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,440
 I am sorry.

300
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,770
Oh, t-the old bachelor who gave up marriage on Dano!

301
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:06,070
Oh, yes, yes.

302
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,120
W-Why did you come here?

303
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:42,460
Brother, why did you say you were not going to marry?

304
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,000
Is it not your wedding today?

305
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,130
Just answer my question. Why did you say you will not marry?

306
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:57,840
Because I could not bring myself to marry someone other than you.

307
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,000
How fortunate.

308
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,900
I could not go through with it, either.

309
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,940
Marrying someone else other than you.

310
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:14,890
So, you take responsibility for me now.

311
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:24,420
Let us now make a plan to wed all three couples.

312
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:27,420
Gae Dong and Butler, come closer, too.

313
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,880
Everyone, gather closer.

314
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:41,110
 There is no way Bang Ja will bring back Lady Ye Jin.

315
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:43,270
 So you go and bring her back.

316
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,910
 You must bring the scholar as well.

317
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,010
Would she come back willingly when she ran away on her wedding day?

318
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,570
I told her to tell Ye Jin that I would make sure she married the man she wanted,

319
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,540
so she will come for sure.

320
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,070
However, we cannot manage this in time.

321
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,730
We should tell the crown prince what happened, and

322
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,080
just wed the second and the third daughters.

323
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,670
We cannot do that.

324
00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,670
Mother will never give up on marriage with the Defense Minister's family.

325
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:19,690
So, if we say Lady Du Ri will wed Young Master Shi Yeol,

326
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,610
she will stop it by referring to the wedding customs.

327
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,700
If that happens, Lady Ye Jin cannot marry the person she wants.

328
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:27,080
Right.

329
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:32,310
So today, we will make it look like all three couples are getting married as planned,

330
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:34,680
and enter the newlywed rooms so it cannot be undone.

331
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:39,530
Then, Lady Ye Jin and Young Master Shi Yeol will be able to marry the person they want.

332
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,980
I understand what you mean.

333
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:48,430
But how can we do a wedding without the bride and groom?

334
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:53,290
We will use a fake at the ceremony and let the right people enter the newlywed rooms.

335
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,000
Who are we going to use as a fake?

336
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:07,440
Why are you looking at me?

337
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,560
 You have to fill in as a stand-in,

338
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:24,670
 so bring the attire needed for weddings.

339
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,460
You must do exactly as I say, starting from the ceremony to the newlywed room.

340
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:40,720
Young Master Shi Yeol, do not get confused and make sure to stand at the first wedding table.

341
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,620
Do not worry.

342
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,650
More importantly, you must not get confused about which newlywed room to enter.

343
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,950
 I will tie a yellow handkerchief on the doorknob.

344
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:56,030
 So do not make a mistake.

345
00:33:56,030 --> 00:34:01,200

346
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,620
I understand.

347
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,660
One more thing to be careful about is...

348
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,780
you must not show your face,

349
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,690
especially to Mayor and Madam Park.

350
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,230
Will things really go as we planned?

351
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:32,020
As long as there are no variables.

352
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,800
Let us run away now.

353
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,260
What?

354
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,690
People will come to get me from home.

355
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:43,480
So we must hide for today, wherever it may be.

356
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,820
- Let us go. 
 - Hold on!

357
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,060
Let's go, I said!

358
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,300
What if we do get a variable?

359
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:55,160
Your Excellency, a Ssangyeonsulsa, will take care of variables on the grooms' side.

360
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:59,570
I, the goddess of matchmaking, will take care of variables on the brides' side.

361
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,190
Please do not worry.

362
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,610
Everything will be fine.

363
00:35:09,870 --> 00:35:14,180
The wedding is one thing, but I am worried about you.

364
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,480
Pardon?

365
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:20,600
Once she knows the marriage with the Defense Minister's family failed because of us,

366
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:23,670
Madam Park will not let you be.

367
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,050
Mother will...

368
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,990
get angry, of course.

369
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:37,540
However, Ye Jin will be able to marry the person she wants.

370
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,160
That is enough for me.

371
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,900
Once this wedding is over, let us run away, far from here.

372
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,040
All right.

373
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,720
Once this wedding ends in success,

374
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,780
I will do as you say.

375
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:39,410
Today is a very joyous day when three joint weddings are happening.

376
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,250
The meaning of this wedding is profound because Prince Gyeongwoonjae made the matches

377
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:49,770
for Master Maeng Sang Cheon of Sungkyunkwan's aged daughters upon His Majesty's order

378
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:55,040
and many old bachelors met their partners in the process.

379
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:06,150

380
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,100

381
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:22,490
With this example, the Royal Court will continue to care about marrying off

382
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:25,450
old bachelors and maidens of Joseon.

383
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:31,050
Also, the food and drinks here are gifts from His Majesty.

384
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:35,220
So eat to your fill and congratulate the brides and grooms, everyone.

385
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:51,500
We will now commence the wedding ceremony.

386
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:00,610
Tell the brides and grooms to enter!

387
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,730
 Why are they not coming out?

388
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:46,030
 How much longer are we going to have to wait?

389
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,140
 Gosh, when do they plan to come out?

390
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,440
 - My goodness. 
 - Seriously.

391
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,630
 Hurry up and come out.

392
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,120
 What is going on?

393
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:12,100
Why are the brides and the grooms not coming?

394
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,350
I am not sure why.

395
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:20,120
Prince Gyeogwoonjae, the top contributor to the wedding, cannot be seen, either.

396
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:24,370
Alas, the crown prince is waiting here!

397
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:32,450
Mayor, I am fine, so lower your voice.

398
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:36,990
The brides and the grooms are today's owners, not me.

399
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,030
I got carried away because I was worried.

400
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,290
The grooms are entering there.

401
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,300
This cannot be happening!

402
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:24,770
Mayor, stop being so noisy and sit back down.

403
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:27,750
I-I apologize.

404
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:37,030
One, two, three?

405
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,510
I married one of them for sure.

406
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:44,450
Why are there three?

407
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,420
Gosh, just how much makeup is she putting on her face?

408
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,600
I think we need to go since the grooms have entered.

409
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,540
Is something wrong?

410
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,380
It is nothing hard.

411
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:10,260
Just do not lift your head.

412
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,460
I am so scared.

413
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,180
Is she still not ready?

414
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:30,300
Sam Wol is too nervous, so...

415
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,490
Stop crying right now!

416
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,030
What is the matter?

417
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,540
Geun Seok's Mother,

418
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,580
you put it on.

419
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:50,010
Pardon?

420
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:03,220
It is easier to move since I am wearing it a second time.

421
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,130
I could not even walk the first time.

422
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:18,240
Geun Seok, what is happening right now is...

423
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,890
Mother, you are like a heavenly maiden.

424
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:24,490
You are so beautiful.

425
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,580
Huh?

426
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,180
A heavenly maiden?

427
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:33,400
Aunt told me about it one day.

428
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,640
That you are like a heavenly maiden who finds people their fated ones.

429
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:42,270
I thought she was sleeping instead of listening to me.

430
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,830
But she was listening the whole time.

431
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,060
Are you on the way to connect nuptial fates?

432
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,790
Yes, you are right.

433
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:57,690
I disguised for a moment to find Aunt her fated one.

434
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:04,370
Please connect Aunt with the big brother who was fishing with me on Dano.

435
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:08,420
- Huh? 
 - Aunt likes him a lot.

436
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:14,430
She did not even meet Young Master Shi Yeol on Dano, huh?

437
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,200
You are the son the Matchmaker Madam boasted about.

438
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:22,490
Who are you?

439
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:25,030
I am friends with the Matchmaker Madam.

440
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:27,100
You are friends with Mother?

441
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,770
No way.

442
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:31,570
You have a really kind heart.

443
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:33,960
I like that.

444
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:03,930
The brides are late.

445
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:08,100
The brides have a lot to prepare.

446
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:11,510
The bride's wedding attire is hard to walk in.

447
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,450
That is true.

448
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,970
- Goodness, she is so pretty! 
 - Goodness.

449
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,100
Bride, bow twice.

450
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:42,830
Why are you standing there, Madam?

451
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:47,350
Why are you there, Your Excellency?

452
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,550
T-The thing is, something came up and...

453
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,530
 Your Excellency, it l-looks like I can't do this.

454
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,580
 Take it off. I will stand in.

455
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,290
Something also came up on my side.

456
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:33,570
Groom, bow in response.

457
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:41,120
I hope nothing more comes up.

458
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:17,270
Wait! Why are you here alone? Where is Young Lady?

459
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,540
Looks like she ran away.

460
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,920
I am going to get kicked out.

461
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,810
Goodness, this is nuts!

462
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:28,790
Madam said to bring the Young Lady and the Scholar without fail!

463
00:47:28,790 --> 00:47:30,460
Goodness...

464
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:33,640
How can you not drink on such a joyous day?

465
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,210
When will we ever get to live another great day like this?

466
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,730
I married off one of the grooms with my wife's niece.

467
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:46,310
I can't understand how the weddings were conducted.

468
00:47:46,310 --> 00:47:49,130
Could it be that someone stood in as a replacement?

469
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:52,370
Have you never had a wedding?

470
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:56,190
That is not something you can just up and take—

471
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,070
 I married one of them off for sure.

472
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:04,440
 One, two, three?

473
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,840
 Why are there three?

474
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:11,630
 One, two, three?

475
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:19,920
The tall guy. No way.

476
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,210
It is him.

477
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:27,080
His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae would have no problem obtaining the attire and

478
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,600
that is why he could not be seen during the ceremony.

479
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,390
To stop the weddings from failing,

480
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,040
did he trick me with Madam Park?

481
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,900
Everything makes sense now.

482
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:50,340
Gosh, I am so pissed!

483
00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:53,790
What if we expose them now?

484
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,410
How can we expose them when everything is over?

485
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,520
No, not quite.

486
00:49:03,530 --> 00:49:06,970
If Gyeongwoonjae is inside the newlywed room as a groom,

487
00:49:06,970 --> 00:49:11,660
that would be what you call deceiving the Royal Family.

488
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:16,610
Not even comparable to breaking off an old maiden's wedding.

489
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:38,720

490
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,640
Did Young Master Shi Yeol go into the right room?

491
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,790
Yes.

492
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,520
We just need Lady Ye Jin and Scholar Number 24

493
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:30,200
to come before peeking at the newlywed room ends.

494
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,870
- Will they come before it ends? 
 - They must.

495
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,850
If anything else comes up, we are in big trouble.

496
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,240
Protecting the newlywed room has started, lower your head!

497
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,860
Young Master Shi Yeol will pull it off. Right?

498
00:51:01,610 --> 00:51:03,210
What are they doing?

499
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,980
Why are the bride and the groom only talking?

500
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,300
I wish he would turn around.

501
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,500
Exactly, let me see the handsome Defense Minister's son's face!

502
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:16,590
Defense Minister's son's newlywed room is that one over there.

503
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:18,620
Really?

504
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,450

505
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,650
 I am sorry I doubted you.

506
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,700
What the heck am I crying about?

507
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:49,160
Why are you coming into this room?

508
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:54,530
I will tell you the specifics later.

509
00:52:54,530 --> 00:52:57,250
Let me lower your head first.

510
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:02,020
H-How do you—

511
00:53:07,570 --> 00:53:10,550
Explain what is going on first.

512
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:13,240
We are in a rush, so do not say anything

513
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:16,280
and hear out your husband from now on.

514
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:19,390
M-My husband?

515
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,490
Maiden Du Ri, look at the door.

516
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:34,190
The door?

517
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:37,650
Your actions in the newlywed room are the most important.

518
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,970
 Once the spectators poke a hole in the door,

519
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:44,210
 stare at the hole with Lady Du Ri.

520
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:47,650
 Why do they need to do that?

521
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:52,260
 They will confirm your marriage to Lady Du Ri.

522
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,350
This room is as sweet as ever.

523
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:09,770
Did she just kiss him on the cheek?

524
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:15,130
Why are the Defense Minister's son and Lady Du Ri together?

525
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,250
I know, huh?

526
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,790
Defense Minister's son was going to marry the Left State Minister's daughter, was he not?

527
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:25,350
What do you mean? He was going to marry Lady Du Ri from the beginning!

528
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:28,610
His Excellency is the one who set up the old maidens.

529
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,930
Goodness, Hyungnim, you should not get confused about this.

530
00:54:31,930 --> 00:54:35,050
What are you going to do if you are this forgetful already?

531
00:54:35,050 --> 00:54:36,490
No way.

532
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:39,670
Who on Earth did the Left State Minister's daughter marry, then?

533
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:42,120
Move aside, everyone.

534
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:54,640
How long must we stare at the door?

535
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,900
W-Well, I think we are done now.

536
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:01,560
So, let us hurry up and spend our first night together.

537
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:07,430
Hold on!

538
00:55:07,430 --> 00:55:09,610
I must hear how this happened.

539
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:12,330
T-The thing is— Lady—

540
00:55:12,330 --> 00:55:15,240
 Stop what you are doing for a second!

541
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:19,060
 We only need to check the groom's face.

542
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,780
This is why I said we have to hurry up and get to it!

543
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:26,710
What are you going to do now?

544
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,190
Do you think we will ever get a chance like this in our lifetime?

545
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:01,030
What kind of bloody moron dares to open the newlywed room door?

546
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:06,250
I will sew up your entire body inch by inch with a large needle and pickle you up in salt water!

547
00:56:16,890 --> 00:56:20,170
I think I am bleeding from my ear.

548
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,900
What is taking them so long?

549
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:33,730
Madam! Madam!

550
00:56:33,730 --> 00:56:35,440
This is bad.

551
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:41,920
The Mayor is going around every newlywed room to check the brides and the grooms.

552
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:57,460
How long are you going to keep drinking?

553
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:59,530
Well, the thing is...

554
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,030
I am quite nervous.

555
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:09,380
I have something to show you.

556
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:15,090
What are you doing right now?

557
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:19,750
The groom is supposed to take off the bride's attire.

558
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,510
Oh, that is right!

559
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:27,330
I wrote so many scenes of undressing on the first night,

560
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:29,460
but I was just impatient.

561
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,560
We cannot help it.

562
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,640
Wait! We should first put...

563
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:40,380
- the light out, should we not? 
 - No!

564
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:43,570
You can't put the light out.

565
00:57:45,620 --> 00:57:48,160
You have to see this.

566
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,600
That outfit is...

567
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:21,510
the battle attire Madam in "Madam's Private Life" wore.

568
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:25,020
You said this outfit does not exist in real life, right?

569
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,140
Will you believe me now?

570
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:32,760
 We are checking the grooms' faces, so let me open the door for a moment.

571
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:53,120
I-I am sorry.

572
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:15,520
I think all the peepers went to Lady Du Ri's room.

573
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,640
So let us get changed quickly first.

574
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,790
That is a good idea.

575
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,480
It will be hard to take it off alone since it is supposed to be removed by the groom.

576
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:42,520
I know as well.

577
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:47,000
Right, you had also been there once, too.

578
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:51,410
But you did not even get to spend the first night, did you?

579
00:59:51,410 --> 00:59:55,150
I learned it from the court maids over three days.

580
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:09,250
Do not forget you promised to do as I say once this wedding ends.

581
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:13,590
I understand.

582
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:16,900
However, you have to wait a bit for me.

583
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:20,120
About five to seven years.

584
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,390
I have to marry off Geun Seok as well, so...

585
01:00:22,390 --> 01:00:24,820
I cannot do that.

586
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:30,320
You said you love me, but you cannot wait that much for me?

587
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:37,220
I do not want to leave you in this house even a day more.

588
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:50,820
 Why are you being rude and trying to open this newlywed room door?

589
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,380
 Because I must check something!

590
01:00:55,380 --> 01:00:58,070
It looks like the Mayor caught on.

591
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,220
Let us run away.

592
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,600
If we get caught here like this, we are both done for.

593
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:45,810

594
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:58,700

595
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:04,490
 Is your method having an affair...

596
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:09,000
 with another man and ruining our family's future?

597
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,640
 M-Molest? Gyeongwoonjae did?

598
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,210
 If you tell me Madam Park tricked you...

599
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:21,180
 Tonight, His Excellency Gyeongwoonjae will be ordered to die by poison.

600
01:02:21,850 --> 01:02:26,250
 Gyeongwoonjae is no longer alive already.

601
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,620
 I am telling you so it will be easier for you to decide.

602
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:36,410
♫  I'm only thinking of you today as well  ♫

603
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:51,130
