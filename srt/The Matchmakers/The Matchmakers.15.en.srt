(Bok Hee, 8 years old, Lady Yeoju's daughter)

7
00:01:10,339 --> 00:01:11,939
Thanks to Lady Matchmaker,

8
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,239
we are living together with Mister. That makes me happy.

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,440
(Note: Has a good eye for people)

10
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,410
You ask why I like him?

11
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:20,750
He is a responsible and kindhearted man.

12
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,619
How do I know that?

13
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,789
Is it not obvious by looking at him?

00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,338
(Jo Geun Seok, 12 years old, Note: Ardent and smart)

15
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:45,969
Mother is like the fairy...

16
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,979
from "The Fairy and the Woodcutter" Aunt told me about.

17
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,910
The fairy that came down from paradise on a bucket.

18
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,580
So, I am happy, yet anxious at the same time.

19
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:58,220
She might go to paradise again once she finds her winged clothes.

20
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,660
But I am all grown up now.

21
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,389
As her son,

22
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,690
I believe I should find Mother's winged clothes.

(Episode 15: The Wedding Operation)

24
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,069
The Crown Prince will come in time for the bow.

25
00:02:18,769 --> 00:02:20,239
I already got the message.

26
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,039
The kitchen court maids...

27
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,079
will help with the guests' feast.

28
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,508
Please tell them the kitchen location...

29
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:28,220
and anything they should be aware of.

30
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:31,350
My daughter-in-law will inform them.

31
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,789
Come this way.

32
00:02:33,889 --> 00:02:34,889
Yes, my lady.

33
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,660
My lady!

34
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,870
Lord Park's family sent us a jar of alcohol.

35
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,668
Lord Myoung's family of Pil-dong sent us...

36
00:02:46,669 --> 00:02:49,470
two strings of twenty dried corvinas and a jar of grain syrup.

37
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:53,669
Make sure to record who sent what wedding gifts.

38
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:56,079
Do not miss any of them.

39
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,340
Yes, my lady.

40
00:03:00,509 --> 00:03:02,549
Nobody showed up at the funeral.

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,220
But everyone is going all out as the Crown Prince is attending.

42
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:33,710
You can come in for now.

43
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,030
The garment is really pretty.

44
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,370
What is it?

45
00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:54,329
Do you hate that I am getting married?

46
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,539
No. How can I hate that you are getting married?

47
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,239
Marriage is a happy occasion in the family, right?

48
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:04,680
As for me,

49
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,680
I am already upset as I might not be able to see you often.

50
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,150
I, too, am...

51
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,189
upset as I cannot hear your fun stories...

52
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,690
from now on.

53
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:17,389
And...

54
00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:20,288
I cannot catch fish with that man...

55
00:04:20,289 --> 00:04:22,700
at the May Festival, which is a shame.

56
00:04:28,739 --> 00:04:30,470
Was catching fish...

57
00:04:31,609 --> 00:04:32,910
that memorable?

58
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,580
Yes. I will remember it for a long time.

59
00:04:40,249 --> 00:04:41,320
Same here.

60
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,720
I will forever remember it.

61
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:04,510
What is with this?

62
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,239
Do not take it off.

63
00:05:06,869 --> 00:05:07,939
Listen.

64
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,340
Live a happy life with your future wife.

65
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:13,080
You should also take the state examination...

66
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,150
and not just focus on farming.

67
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,289
After all, you are smart.

68
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,059
You do know I am making all of your wedding blankets, yes?

69
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,489
Keep getting on the wrong side of me,

70
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:01,700
and I might sew up your blankets with a needle inside.

71
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:10,770
At least I did not get on the wrong side of her.

72
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,520
Doo Ri.

73
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:29,720
Both Ha Na and the palanquin are here. Hurry.

74
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,489
All right.

75
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:04,020
Lady Jung.

76
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:09,799
The ladies and madam of Mount Nam Valley have come.

77
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:11,330
Is that so?

78
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,369
Lord Gyeongunjae has come as well.

79
00:07:39,729 --> 00:07:41,299
It was tough getting here, was it not?

80
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,999
The palanquin you sent us saved us the trouble.

81
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,770
Soon Duk. Guide the ladies to the room.

82
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,239
Yes, Mother.

83
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,410
The tables with wooden geese...

84
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,479
are in the reception room and the garden.

85
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,080
You may look around first.

86
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:03,479
Once the grooms arrive,

87
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,150
I will go over with Erudite Maeng's wife.

88
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,220
Please follow me.

89
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:12,789
Let us go.

90
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,869
Please come inside.

91
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,060
Help will come soon to do your wedding hair and makeup.

92
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:52,529
Goodness.

93
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,070
So this is what your room looks like, Lady Yeoju.

94
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:00,868
Oh, right. It should be Lady Jung, not Lady Yeoju.

95
00:09:00,869 --> 00:09:03,379
No, I am Soon Duk to you.

96
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,950
"Soon Duk." I like it.

97
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,050
May I write a novel with you...

98
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,119
as the main character?

99
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,619
Of course.

100
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:17,920
Please write a good one.

101
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:08,739
Let us go.

102
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,529
Gosh.

103
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,100
Oh, how are you, Lord Gyeongunjae?

104
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,070
You had a lot to do.

105
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:43,810
You all came here quite early.

106
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:45,850
The ceremony is many hours away.

107
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,320
Multiple Capital District bachelors and spinsters will be married today.

108
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:52,590
As chief magistrate, it is only right I come early...

109
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,489
to ensure there are no problems.

110
00:10:55,159 --> 00:10:57,060
You were not interested at all a few months ago.

111
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,989
I guess you are interested only now that...

112
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:02,029
the Crown Prince will attend.

113
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,430
A groom is here!

114
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:09,769
Someone is here. We must go.

115
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:19,649
Goodness.

116
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,748
The Minister of Defence's son...

117
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,690
who will marry Lord Jo's daughter.

118
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,889
He is as handsome as rumours said.

119
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,460
He is the man...

120
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,600
who flirted in broad daylight.

121
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,560
What?

122
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,200
Then...

123
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,970
How dare you touch each other in the middle of the day?

124
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,909
Men and women are to remain separated!

125
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,080
He is Lady Doo Ri's match.

126
00:11:56,979 --> 00:11:59,119
The lieutenant is here also.

127
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,359
Dressed like a groom, he looks even more imposing.

128
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,269
His sister married Lord Jo's son,

129
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,009
and now he will be in-laws with the Crown Prince.

130
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,379
He was born with incredible luck.

131
00:12:26,749 --> 00:12:29,619
However, you never know until the wedding night.

132
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,180
The luck could run out.

133
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,060
Should there not be three grooms?

134
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,489
He will be here soon.

135
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:42,399
Go inside and wait.

136
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:44,330
Well,

137
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,830
I will, then.

138
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,200
I will take my time, enjoy myself,

139
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,200
and see just how well the ceremony...

140
00:12:51,609 --> 00:12:54,909
you prepared so hard for goes, Lord Gyeongunjae.

141
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,040
Let us go inside.

142
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,019
Go and see how far out Bachelor 16 is.

143
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,619
Okay.

144
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:18,330
The grooms are here.

145
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,670
You can put on the head ornaments.

146
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:42,460
Ye Jin has gone?

147
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,789
- What do you mean? - She had a stomachache...

148
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,690
and said she would go to the toilet.

149
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,159
I kept waiting, but she did not come back.

150
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
We searched the grounds and could not find her.

151
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,940
We looked again and found a letter on her desk.

152
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,009
(Dear Mother)

153
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,720
I apologize, Mother.

154
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:14,350
I have given my heart to another.

155
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:19,259
I cannot marry a stranger knowing I do not love him.

156
00:14:27,869 --> 00:14:30,340
Mother, the Crown Prince will arrive soon.

157
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:37,210
Where is Ye Jin?

158
00:15:19,649 --> 00:15:20,649
Mother.

159
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,920
How about we postpone Ye Jin's marriage?

160
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,898
How can we postpone...

161
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,359
when the Crown Prince will be here?

162
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:34,269
His Highness is attending as a guest of Erudite Maeng's daughters.

163
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,768
He will understand if you say Ye Jin fell ill.

164
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,638
Do you think I set this all up...

165
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,170
to marry off three spinsters?

166
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,139
The truth is,

167
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:46,680
Ye Jin has been in love for a while.

168
00:15:47,149 --> 00:15:48,518
She will have gone to...

169
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,920
Do you think I do not know that?

170
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:52,850
I cannot...

171
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,690
marry Ye Jin off to that fool.

172
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Mother.

173
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,159
Ye Jin made the biggest decision of her life...

174
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:03,100
in order not to live a life of regret.

175
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,769
So please, let her have her way.

176
00:16:07,899 --> 00:16:08,899
What she did...

177
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,340
is foolish, not courageous.

178
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,670
Right now, she thinks love is everything,

179
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:18,009
but if you live long enough, all you are left with is regret.

180
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:22,180
I know Ye Jin well.

181
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:25,019
She cannot stand living with such a man.

182
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,550
But the Crown Prince will arrive soon,

183
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,290
and the ceremony will take place.

184
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,859
We cannot marry a woman who is not here.

185
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,830
- So... - The ceremony...

186
00:16:35,659 --> 00:16:37,359
can go on with a stand-in.

187
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,399
I just need her back in time to consummate the marriage tonight.

188
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,710
Lady Park.

189
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,009
The Crown Prince is here.

190
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:54,810
You must attend to the guests.

191
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Go and...

192
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,350
summon the servant.

193
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,790
Pardon?

194
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,070
Welcome, Your Highness.

195
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:22,639
I will escort you to where your future bride waits.

196
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,810
I am here for the wedding between the couples...

197
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,750
that Lord Gyeongunjae brought together.

198
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,719
So I would like Lord Gyeongunjae to show me the way.

199
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,889
Come this way.

200
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,408
Ye Jin will be at the house of the Yoon family...

201
00:17:53,409 --> 00:17:54,968
that runs errands for my parents.

202
00:17:54,969 --> 00:17:57,609
You must bring her back within two hours at the latest.

203
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,780
Yes, my lady.

204
00:18:00,949 --> 00:18:03,280
Go to the palace, show this letter,

205
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,590
and get Royal Noble Consort Suk's ceremonial robe.

206
00:18:06,189 --> 00:18:07,189
Yes, my lady.

207
00:18:13,189 --> 00:18:14,189
Mother.

208
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:16,959
You will be deceiving the Minister of Defence's son.

209
00:18:17,659 --> 00:18:20,070
- If he were to find out... - I will handle it.

210
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:25,869
Bring Geun Seok to the main mansion.

211
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:37,879
I had wanted to witness a noble wedding,

212
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,249
and more than anything, I did not want to miss...

213
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,790
my sisters-in-law's wedding.

214
00:18:48,189 --> 00:18:49,359
Your Highness.

215
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,730
Lord Jo's wife Lady Park and her grandson.

216
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:09,080
Lord Gyeongunjae said...

217
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,689
your grandson is bright and has a kind heart.

218
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:16,790
Thank you for your praise.

219
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:22,929
The preparations remind me...

220
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,659
of eight years ago,

221
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,330
when you married my eldest sister, Lord Gyeongunjae.

222
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,740
You were there at the ceremony?

223
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:38,649
I had heard my sister had not eaten all day,

224
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,480
so I brought her my yakgwa.

225
00:19:50,219 --> 00:19:56,899
(8 years ago)

226
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,169
The palace will be busy on the day of the princess' wedding.

227
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:11,080
Switch this with the yakgwa that will be served to the prince.

228
00:20:11,909 --> 00:20:13,209
Will it really be okay?

229
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,919
The golden silkworm poison inside...

230
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,719
cannot be traced.

231
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,560
Even if he dies eating this, no one will know the cause.

232
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:34,570
That day, my sister really enjoyed the yakgwa.

233
00:20:35,939 --> 00:20:38,070
I did not think she would die so suddenly.

234
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,409
So that is what happened.

235
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,669
Was it your doing?

236
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:19,449
Only just now did I figure out what happened eight years ago.

237
00:21:22,379 --> 00:21:24,149
A great misfortune befell us both.

238
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,820
"A great misfortune?"

239
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,020
It is in the past.

240
00:21:32,359 --> 00:21:33,760
The Crown Prince lived,

241
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,229
and the King decided to bury the truth...

242
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:38,030
for Prince Jinsung's sake.

243
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,929
Do you truly think His Majesty covered it up...

244
00:21:41,469 --> 00:21:43,800
for Prince Jinsung's sake?

245
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:54,850
He did so for In Hyun who died eight years ago.

246
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,789
(Found the untraceable poison you asked for.)

247
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,820
This letter proves not just Lord Jo's corruption...

248
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,218
but also proof of treachery to kill a prince.

249
00:22:05,219 --> 00:22:06,830
My treatment of Lord Jo...

250
00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:10,429
was a show of my appreciation of his son's loyalty.

251
00:22:12,169 --> 00:22:14,530
Lady Park did not preserve Lord Jo's household.

252
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,669
Their dead son did.

253
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,369
In Hyun knew...

254
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,638
his family would poison the Crown Prince.

255
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:25,879
He tried to prevent it.

256
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,219
His Majesty acknowledged his loyalty,

257
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,949
and that is why he preserved Lord Jo's integrity.

258
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,189
Your greed...

259
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,760
killed the princess...

260
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:43,129
and also your own son.

261
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,429
I have decided.

262
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:18,629
What?

263
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:20,069
To do what?

264
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:23,669
I will tell Minister of Defence's son that Ye Jin ran away.

265
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:25,500
Have you lost your mind?

266
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,770
There will be no wedding if the groom leaves too.

267
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,080
No.

268
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,679
Things will get really bad if Lady Park were to find out.

269
00:23:34,409 --> 00:23:35,820
Things are already bad.

270
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,749
I was the matchmaker, so I must...

271
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,090
tell the truth and apologize.

272
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,719
Lady Jung!

273
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:47,060
Oh, dear...

274
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,600
My lord, I have bad news.

275
00:24:01,169 --> 00:24:02,439
What do you mean...

276
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,040
Bachelor 16 is married?

277
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:08,250
I could not find him, so I went to his home.

278
00:24:08,449 --> 00:24:11,448
He had married the daughter of Lord Choi from Gye-dong...

279
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,919
and was celebrating.

280
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:16,819
The day before yesterday,

281
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:19,060
I married Lord Choi's eldest daughter.

282
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,230
Were you not in love with Lady Doo Ri?

283
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,628
She is good at sewing,

284
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:27,330
so I was willing to...

285
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:30,570
take the plunge and marry her to support her family.

286
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:32,369
I was not pleased with her.

287
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,239
When I visited you five days ago,

288
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,179
why did you not say anything then?

289
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,879
Chief Magistrate Kim said we should keep things quiet.

290
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,649
I had no choice.

291
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,090
That Lord Choi is a relative of the chief magistrate's wife.

292
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,719
Why did Bachelor 16 dump Lady Doo Ri...

293
00:24:52,629 --> 00:24:54,260
to marry another woman?

294
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:58,399
I think Chief Magistrate Kim was behind it.

295
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:01,330
He told me he was promised a position in the office.

296
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,540
He said he had liked Lady Doo Ri for a long time.

297
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,469
How could a man do such a thing over a title?

298
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,320
Is marriage a joke to you?

299
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,949
Is this how shoddy you do your job?

300
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,589
Well, I just...

301
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,789
Lady Doo Ri may seem gruff and stern,

302
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,429
but do you know how gentle she is inside?

303
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:32,469
If her groom were to not appear on their wedding day,

304
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:34,100
how distraught would she be?

305
00:25:34,369 --> 00:25:35,840
She will be scarred forever!

306
00:25:37,439 --> 00:25:40,169
Your bride will also not appear.

307
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:43,639
How long have you been standing there?

308
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,679
What are you talking about?

309
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:51,949
Well...

310
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,889
My sister-in-law disappeared.

311
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,459
What about the wedding?

312
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,830
What happens now?

313
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,300
It all fell through.

314
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,240
Poor Lord Gyeongunjae.

315
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:13,840
I am sure he will manage.

316
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,139
Why worry?

317
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:19,280
The most pointless thing you can do is worry about the nobles.

318
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,310
So...

319
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,020
I do not think you can marry today.

320
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:25,679
I apologize.

321
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,699
Lady Sam Soon will be very upset if we do not marry today.

322
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,369
- It is for the better. - It is for the better.

323
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,980
- What? - What?

324
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,310
Why...

325
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:58,820
Lady Doo Ri...

326
00:26:59,689 --> 00:27:02,719
is meant to marry this man and not Bachelor 16.

327
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,090
Yes.

328
00:27:05,689 --> 00:27:08,260
The truth is, I like Lady Doo Ri.

329
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:10,198
I thought I could forget about her,

330
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:12,698
but I could not, and it tormented me.

331
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:15,300
Yes! My heart is not wrong!

332
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:18,299
We just have to ask how she feels.

333
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,309
Yes.

334
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,139
Lady Doo Ri likes him back.

335
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,010
You knew about this already?

336
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,820
I realized for sure when I saw the butterfly.

337
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:33,649
Right here.

338
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,459
I saw the same butterfly on Lady Doo Ri's beoseon.

339
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,349
Why were you wearing identical butterfly beoseon...

340
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,780
to get married to different people?

341
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:06,820
I could not refuse a spouse my family had decided on.

342
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,990
Now that it has fallen through,

343
00:28:09,619 --> 00:28:10,859
I feel much better.

344
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,330
How can you be pleased it fell through?

345
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,300
Why do you think only of yourself?

346
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,429
When I think of how disappointed Lady Sam Soon will be...

347
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:21,500
My heart breaks.

348
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:29,179
He should have said from the start that he did not want to marry.

349
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,179
What are we to do now?

350
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:33,879
If he were honest, he would not be a noble.

351
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,780
They live for their reputations.

352
00:28:39,619 --> 00:28:41,290
Calm down, everyone.

353
00:28:41,889 --> 00:28:42,959
Let me summarize.

354
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:46,490
One groom did not show up, and one bride ran away.

355
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,159
But the leftover bride and groom...

356
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:51,060
were dating in secret.

357
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:56,569
(Maeng Doo Ri, Han Jong Bok, Jo Ye Jin, Jung Si Yeol)

358
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:01,310
(Maeng Doo Ri, Jung Si Yeol)

359
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,908
There will be no wedding today.

360
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,040
There will be...

361
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:07,580
a wedding today.

362
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:14,619
How can we go on as planned with a bride missing?

363
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:17,189
- I refuse. - Wait.

364
00:29:19,429 --> 00:29:22,659
Instead of your sister-in-law, will you marry him...

365
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,000
with Lady Doo Ri to form just two couples?

366
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:29,669
Oh, right.

367
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:30,899
No.

368
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,770
Today, we will marry off three couples.

369
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:37,679
We have just two couples.

370
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:40,280
The third couple...

371
00:29:40,609 --> 00:29:43,679
is my sister-in-law and Bachelor 24.

372
00:29:45,649 --> 00:29:47,090
Bachelor 24...

373
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:48,850
I have...

374
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:50,959
someone else in mind.

375
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:55,760
I cannot marry Erudite Maeng's second daughter.

376
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,560
I apologize.

377
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,169
Oh, the bachelor who backed out during the May Festival.

378
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,500
Yes.

379
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:35,698
What are you doing here?

380
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:38,740
Why did you say you would not marry?

381
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,608
Is today not your wedding day?

382
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:42,908
Answer my question.

383
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,679
Why did you say you would not marry?

384
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:51,719
Because I cannot marry...

385
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:54,449
anyone other than you.

386
00:30:58,419 --> 00:30:59,429
Good.

387
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,090
I also could not...

388
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,330
marry anyone but you.

389
00:31:08,129 --> 00:31:09,129
So...

390
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,369
I am yours now.

391
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,850
Let us come up with a plan to marry all three couples.

392
00:31:22,179 --> 00:31:23,919
You two, join us.

393
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,050
Okay.

394
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,419
Everyone, come closer.

395
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,000
He will not be able to persuade her to come back,

396
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:40,699
so you should go and bring her back...

397
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,500
with that scholar.

398
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:50,080
She ran away on the day of her wedding, so she will not come back.

399
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:52,638
I told her to let Ye Jin know...

400
00:31:52,639 --> 00:31:55,780
that I would be sure to help her marry the one she wants to be with,

401
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,179
so she will return.

402
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,290
Even so, she will not make it for the ceremony.

403
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:04,189
We should inform the Crown Prince of the situation...

404
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,589
and just marry off the 2nd and 3rd daughters.

405
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,629
No, we cannot do that.

406
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,399
My mother-in-law will never...

407
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,530
give up on marrying her off to the Minister of Defence's son.

408
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,968
So if she hears that Lady Doo Ri...

409
00:32:14,969 --> 00:32:16,939
and Young Master Si Yeol are getting married,

410
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,069
she will use the wedding customs to stop them.

411
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:22,540
If that happens, Ye Jin cannot marry the man she wants to be with.

412
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:24,139
Right.

413
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,079
Hence, we must deceive her and make her believe...

414
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,619
that the three couples are all getting married today...

415
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,218
and put them in their matrimonial rooms to seal the deal.

416
00:32:32,219 --> 00:32:34,389
That is the only way both Ye Jin and Si Yeol can marry...

417
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,119
the ones they truly wish to be with.

418
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,429
I get what you are saying,

419
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,429
but how could the wedding take place without the bride and groom?

420
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,600
We will hire stand-ins for the ceremony...

421
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:49,939
and put the real couples in the matrimonial rooms.

422
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,540
But who would agree to be a stand-in?

423
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,020
What? Why are you looking at me?

424
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,659
We need you as a stand-in,

425
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,199
so go and get the groom's costume.

426
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,409
From the ceremony to the moment you enter your matrimonial room,

427
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,909
you must follow my instructions to a tee.

428
00:33:32,949 --> 00:33:34,780
Young Master Si Yeol, do not be confused.

429
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,350
You have to go to the first table.

430
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,850
Do not worry.

431
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,889
More importantly, do not go to the wrong matrimonial room.

432
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,659
You will see a yellow handkerchief tied to the doorknob.

433
00:33:50,429 --> 00:33:52,459
Do not go into the wrong room.

434
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:01,469
Well understood.

435
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,409
You must also remember this.

436
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:07,949
You should never reveal your faces.

437
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:11,050
Especially in front of the chief magistrate and Lady Park.

438
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,319
Right.

439
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,799
Do you think everything will go according to our plan?

440
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,569
Yes, unless there is a random variable.

441
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,139
We should elope.

442
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:35,369
What?

443
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:38,309
My family will send someone to catch me,

444
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,880
so I must find a place to hide.

445
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,448
- Come along. - Wait.

446
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:43,480
Come on.

447
00:34:44,819 --> 00:34:47,690
Then what if we encounter an unexpected variable?

448
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,219
If it has something to do with the grooms, you will handle it.

449
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,088
If it concerns the brides,

450
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:56,060
I will take care of it as the matchmaking master.

451
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:02,069
Do not worry.

452
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,170
Everything will go well.

453
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:10,710
The wedding is one thing, but I am worried about you.

454
00:35:12,779 --> 00:35:13,779
Pardon me?

455
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,109
If Lady Park finds out that she failed to marry Ye Jin off...

456
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,520
to the Defence Minister's family because of us,

457
00:35:18,319 --> 00:35:20,250
she will not let it slide.

458
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,759
Of course, my mother-in-law...

459
00:35:26,889 --> 00:35:28,529
will be angry.

460
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,259
But this way,

461
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,170
Ye Jin can marry the man she truly loves.

462
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:36,770
That is enough for me.

463
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:40,969
When this wedding is over,

464
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,409
let us run far away together.

465
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,830
Sure.

466
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,060
Once we wrap up this wedding successfully,

467
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:09,330
I will follow your wishes.

468
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,619
On this joyful day,

469
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,729
we are gathered here to celebrate...

470
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,389
the joint wedding of the three couples.

471
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,799
This wedding is truly meaningful...

472
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,469
for Lord Gyeongunjae found matches...

473
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,468
for Erudite Maeng Sang Chun's daughters...

474
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:45,539
who were way past the marriageable age...

475
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,170
as per His Majesty's order.

476
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:49,639
And in that process, a number of old bachelors...

477
00:36:49,779 --> 00:36:51,440
also found their spouses.

478
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:03,619
(Bachelor 12's Wedding)

479
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,529
(Bachelor 23's Wedding)

480
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:17,339
The royal court will learn from this experience...

481
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:19,839
and continue to pay attention to the issue...

482
00:37:20,009 --> 00:37:21,969
of marrying off the old bachelors and spinsters in the country.

483
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,380
Also, all the food and drinks here today are gifts...

484
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,980
from His Majesty who wishes to congratulate the brides and grooms,

485
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:31,779
so please enjoy them and congratulate the brides and grooms.

486
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,130
We will now begin the ceremony.

487
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,080
The brides and grooms may come out!

488
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:39,650
- What is going on? - What is taking them so long?

489
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,589
- How much longer must we wait? - My goodness.

490
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,360
Gosh, why were we told to come here so early?

491
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,799
Right? I wonder too.

492
00:38:55,969 --> 00:38:57,369
Where are they?

493
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:08,980
What is taking the brides and grooms so long?

494
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:10,949
I do not know.

495
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,849
Lord Gyeongunjae, who organized this wedding,

496
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,790
is also nowhere to be seen.

497
00:39:17,759 --> 00:39:18,819
Such insolence!

498
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:20,929
You are keeping His Highness waiting!

499
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,400
Chief Magistrate.

500
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:28,799
I am okay, so lower your voice.

501
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,468
This event is not about me.

502
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:33,670
We are here to congratulate the brides and grooms.

503
00:39:35,409 --> 00:39:37,440
I was simply concerned. That is all.

504
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:42,779
Oh, here come the grooms.

505
00:40:13,009 --> 00:40:15,480
My gosh. This cannot be.

506
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,020
Chief Magistrate.

507
00:40:18,219 --> 00:40:21,290
Do not make such a fuss. Please be seated.

508
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:24,259
I apologize, Your Highness.

509
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,799
One, two,

510
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:34,029
three?

511
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:38,969
I swear, I married off one of them.

512
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:41,139
How come there are three grooms here?

513
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:50,020
Gosh.

514
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,350
Is she getting completely dolled up? Why is she not here yet?

515
00:40:52,949 --> 00:40:55,549
The grooms have gone out, so we should follow them out too.

516
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,219
I wonder if something happened.

517
00:41:02,989 --> 00:41:04,299
It is nothing hard.

518
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:06,560
Just keep your head down.

519
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,040
I am so scared.

520
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:21,909
Is she still not ready?

521
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,920
Sam Wol is very nervous.

522
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:30,520
Stop crying at once.

523
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,290
What is the matter with you?

524
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,170
Soon Duk.

525
00:41:41,130 --> 00:41:42,170
You should do it.

526
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:46,969
Pardon me?

527
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,589
I can move in this since it is my second time wearing this.

528
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:02,520
The first time I wore this, I could not even walk.

529
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,469
Geun Seok.

530
00:42:14,029 --> 00:42:15,729
Let me explain.

531
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,739
Mother.

532
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:18,699
You look like a fairy.

533
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,909
You look so beautiful.

534
00:42:22,739 --> 00:42:23,779
What?

535
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,980
"Fairy?"

536
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:30,480
Aunt once told me...

537
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,190
that you were like a fairy that finds soulmates.

538
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,159
I thought she was asleep and could not hear me.

539
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,360
Turns out, she heard everything.

540
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,400
Are you heading out to connect soulmates?

541
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:50,699
Yes, I am.

542
00:42:51,469 --> 00:42:54,270
I disguised myself as a bride to find Auntie Ye Jin's soulmate.

543
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,569
Then you should...

544
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,980
find the man who caught fish with me on the day of the May Festival.

545
00:43:02,009 --> 00:43:03,009
What?

546
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:05,020
Aunt likes him very much.

547
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,060
She did not even meet Young Master Si Yeol at the May Festival.

548
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,759
You must be Lady Matchmaker's son she spoke so proudly about.

549
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,830
Who might you be?

550
00:43:20,069 --> 00:43:22,170
I am Lady Matchmaker's friend.

551
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,239
You and my mother are friends?

552
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:25,839
No way.

553
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,770
Young Master, I see that you have a heart of gold.

554
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,580
I like you.

555
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:00,569
The brides are late.

556
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,880
The brides have a lot to prepare.

557
00:44:05,739 --> 00:44:08,909
And they can barely walk in their wedding dresses.

558
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,250
That is right.

559
00:44:14,589 --> 00:44:16,789
- Oh, my. - How beautiful.

560
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:17,860
- My gosh. - How pretty.

561
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:20,060
- My goodness. - They look stunning.

562
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,770
The brides will now bow twice.

563
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:39,869
What are you doing here?

564
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:41,710
What about you?

565
00:45:42,369 --> 00:45:43,880
Why are you here?

566
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,190
Well, I have run into an unexpected variable.

567
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,069
My lord.

568
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,230
I do not think I can do this.

569
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:14,170
Take it off. I will do it.

570
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,350
So have I.

571
00:46:27,989 --> 00:46:30,150
The grooms will now bow to their brides.

572
00:46:34,889 --> 00:46:37,699
I truly hope we do not encounter another variable.

573
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:03,520
My gosh.

574
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,489
Gosh! My goodness.

575
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,259
Oh, dear.

576
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,569
What? Where is Lady Ye Jin? Why are you sitting here alone?

577
00:47:14,799 --> 00:47:15,900
She must have run away.

578
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:18,839
I will get kicked out.

579
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,839
My gosh. This is crazy!

580
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:25,980
Lady Jung said to bring her and the scholar no matter what.

581
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:27,949
My goodness.

582
00:47:28,009 --> 00:47:29,309
We must drink on this happy day.

583
00:47:29,310 --> 00:47:31,218
- Yes, absolutely. - Oh, my.

584
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:33,850
Hey, hurry up and pour me one.

585
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:38,790
I married my niece-in-law off to one of the grooms.

586
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,130
How on earth did this wedding happen?

587
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,029
I do not understand.

588
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:45,659
Maybe someone filled in for the groom.

589
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,130
Did you not have a wedding?

590
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:52,900
You cannot fill in for...

591
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:56,210
I swear, I married off one of them.

592
00:47:57,509 --> 00:48:00,679
One, two, three?

593
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,049
How come there are three grooms here?

594
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,420
One, two,

595
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:08,650
three?

596
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:16,630
He was very tall. Could it be...

597
00:48:19,299 --> 00:48:20,369
Yes.

598
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,400
It must have been easy...

599
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:24,339
for Lord Gyeongunjae to find the groom's costume.

600
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:28,270
I bet that was why he was nowhere to be seen during the ceremony.

601
00:48:36,009 --> 00:48:37,650
To make sure the wedding would not fall through,

602
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:39,750
he and Lady Park must have conspired together.

603
00:48:41,949 --> 00:48:43,119
Now, it all makes sense.

604
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,889
Gosh, I am so angry.

605
00:48:49,159 --> 00:48:51,199
How about we expose the truth now?

606
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,060
What is the point? It is already all over.

607
00:48:58,400 --> 00:48:59,400
No.

608
00:49:01,139 --> 00:49:03,670
If the late princess' husband is in one of the matrimonial rooms,

609
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:07,850
we can prove that he deceived the royal court.

610
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:11,080
It is much better than ruining...

611
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:13,250
the spinsters' wedding.

612
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:07,069
Did Young Master Si Yeol find his room?

613
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:13,850
Yes.

614
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,989
Now, we just need Ye Jin and Bachelor 24...

615
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,420
to arrive before people are done peeking into the rooms.

616
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,929
- Will they arrive before that? - They must.

617
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,360
Even just one more variable will get us in trouble.

618
00:50:39,339 --> 00:50:41,039
People are now guarding the room.

619
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,069
Keep your head down.

620
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:48,650
Young Master Si Yeol...

621
00:50:50,279 --> 00:50:51,350
will do a good job, right?

622
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:00,829
What are they doing?

623
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:03,388
Why are they just talking?

624
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:05,729
- Turn around and look this way. - Yes, please.

625
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,529
I hear the Defence Minister's son is handsome. I want to see his face.

626
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:11,299
The Defence Minister's son...

627
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,209
is in that room over there.

628
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,270
Really?

629
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:43,130
I apologize for suspecting you.

630
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:16,900
Why am I crying? How embarrassing.

631
00:52:44,199 --> 00:52:45,630
Why are you here?

632
00:52:50,529 --> 00:52:52,068
I will explain later.

633
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,670
Let me take off your head ornaments first.

634
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,639
How do I do this?

635
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:00,949
Like this. I see.

636
00:53:05,319 --> 00:53:07,020
First, explain what is going on.

637
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:10,859
Time is of the essence, so do not say anything.

638
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,889
Listen carefully to what your husband is about to tell you.

639
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:15,860
What? "Husband?"

640
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:26,799
Lady Doo Ri.

641
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:29,210
Stare at the door.

642
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,080
The door?

643
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:34,279
What matters the most is how you behave in the matrimonial room.

644
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,678
When people come and poke a peep hole on the door,

645
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:40,819
stare at the hole with Lady Doo Ri.

646
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:44,860
Why should he do that?

647
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,860
They will confirm that you and Lady Doo Ri are now married.

648
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:03,908
Oh, my. The couple in this room is very romantic.

649
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:06,239
Did he just kiss her on the cheek?

650
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,480
Why is the Defence Minister's son with Lady Doo Ri now?

651
00:54:12,719 --> 00:54:13,879
I wonder too.

652
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:17,350
I thought he was marrying the Left State Councillor’s daughter.

653
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:19,420
No.

654
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:22,489
They said from the get-go that he would marry Lady Doo Ri.

655
00:54:22,929 --> 00:54:26,158
My master was the one who found matches for the spinsters.

656
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:29,368
My goodness. How could you be confused about something like that?

657
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:31,770
You should not be so absentminded at your age.

658
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,670
No.

659
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,639
Then whom did Lord Jo's daughter marry?

660
00:54:37,339 --> 00:54:38,409
Move aside.

661
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:50,719
How much longer do we have to stare at the door?

662
00:54:52,219 --> 00:54:55,130
Oh, I think we can stop staring at the door now.

663
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:58,130
Let us hurry and get down to business.

664
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,469
What? Wait.

665
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:07,069
First, I must hear what happened.

666
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:09,710
The thing is... My lady.

667
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:11,639
Stop what you are doing for a moment.

668
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:15,610
We just need to check the groom's face.

669
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,619
This is why I said we should hurry and just do it.

670
00:55:22,489 --> 00:55:23,750
What will you do now?

671
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:26,690
Do you think we will have another opportunity like this?

672
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,259
Who is this stupid jerk that flung open the door?

673
00:55:58,589 --> 00:56:00,658
I will fold you in half and stitch you up with a giant needle,

674
00:56:00,659 --> 00:56:02,630
then threw you into the ocean!

675
00:56:14,509 --> 00:56:16,869
I think my ears are bleeding.

676
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,520
What is taking her so long?

677
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:30,719
My lady.

678
00:56:31,290 --> 00:56:32,560
We have a problem.

679
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,190
The chief magistrate is checking every room...

680
00:56:36,330 --> 00:56:38,529
to confirm the identities of the brides and grooms.

681
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:54,509
Will you drink all night?

682
00:56:55,110 --> 00:56:56,150
Well, this is...

683
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,779
I am nervous.

684
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,819
I have something to show you.

685
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,929
What are you doing?

686
00:57:12,659 --> 00:57:16,369
The groom is supposed to undress his bride.

687
00:57:17,330 --> 00:57:18,369
Oh, right.

688
00:57:20,339 --> 00:57:22,209
I wrote dozens of scenes where the groom...

689
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,369
undresses his bride on their wedding night.

690
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:25,980
I was just so eager to show you.

691
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,150
It is too late.

692
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,380
Then we should...

693
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:36,589
blow out the candle.

694
00:57:36,819 --> 00:57:37,860
No!

695
00:57:38,759 --> 00:57:40,060
Do not blow out the candle.

696
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,630
You need to see this.

697
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,290
You are wearing...

698
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:18,429
the Lady's battle dress portrayed in "The Lady's Private Life."

699
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,000
You said this dress did not exist in real life.

700
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,270
Now, do you believe me?

701
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,709
I am checking each groom's face.

702
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:29,270
I will open the door for a moment.

703
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:49,389
Sorry about that.

704
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:12,779
Everyone who was peeping into the room went to see Lady Doo Ri,

705
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:14,690
so we should get changed now.

706
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,750
Okay, good idea.

707
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:33,638
The groom is supposed to do this,

708
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:34,909
so it is hard to do by yourself.

709
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,080
I know that.

710
00:59:40,909 --> 00:59:43,380
Right, you have done this before.

711
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:47,850
But you never had a proper wedding night. Am I wrong?

712
00:59:48,989 --> 00:59:51,690
The court ladies taught me everything for three days.

713
01:00:01,929 --> 01:00:03,230
Do not forget that you promised...

714
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:05,839
to follow my wishes once this wedding was over.

715
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:09,839
Okay, I will not forget.

716
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:13,380
But you will have to wait a little.

717
01:00:14,509 --> 01:00:17,080
About 5 to 7 years.

718
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:19,449
I must marry Geun Seok off.

719
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,389
I cannot do that.

720
01:00:23,350 --> 01:00:25,059
You said you truly loved me,

721
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:26,790
yet you cannot even wait?

722
01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:30,460
I do not want...

723
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:33,600
to leave you in this house even for another day.

724
01:00:43,540 --> 01:00:47,409
Why must you get into my daughter's matrimonial room?

725
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:52,179
I must check something.

726
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:54,489
The chief magistrate must have caught on.

727
01:00:55,049 --> 01:00:56,849
Hurry up and get out of here.

728
01:00:56,850 --> 01:00:58,960
If we are caught here now, we are both doomed.

730
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:00,750
You fell for another man...

731
01:02:02,250 --> 01:02:05,690
and ruined the future of the family. Is that your way?

732
01:02:07,489 --> 01:02:09,830
He lay with her by force? My son-in-law?

733
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,829
If you say you fell for Lady Park's trap...

734
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:14,900
Tonight,

735
01:02:15,799 --> 01:02:17,770
Lord Gyeongunjae will be executed with poison.

736
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,339
Lord Gyeongunjae is already dead.

737
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,109
I am telling you so that it is easier for you...

738
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:27,210
to decide.
