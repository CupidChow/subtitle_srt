00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Sign this

2
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,840
promising you'll never join the board.

3
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,400
That's impossible.

4
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,600
Look at you,

5
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,340
showing your true colors.

6
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,000
Playing tricks on me.

7
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,280
Likewise.

8
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,480
I believe everyone can make their own judgment now.

9
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,039
This commitment letter is invalid.

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:09,960
I

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,820
don't acknowledge it.

12
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,600
Fine.

13
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
You can refuse to acknowledge this.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,200
But this

15
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
share transfer agreement with your stamp

16
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,000
and fingerprint...

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
You can't deny that, can you?

18
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:29,920
Mr. Sheng,

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,640
are you really transferring all your shares

20
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,800
to President Sheng?

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:36,960
Hurry up and explain to everyone

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,600
what you're thinking.

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:42,039
Sheng An.

24
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,000
I want to see

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,920
which you'll give up -

26
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,840
your shares or Qiao Wan.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,860
The anesthetic has taken effect.

28
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,360
Put down the scalpel.

29
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,480
Who are you people?

30
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,320
Get out of here now!

31
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,720
Don't interrupt my experiment.

32
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,840
You won't be doing any more experiments.

33
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,520
Stop resisting.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:14,800
Get out immediately!

35
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,440
Rush him to the hospital!

36
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,920
Yes.

37
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,250
What are you going to do?

38
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,320
Untie him.

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,040
Are you here to rescue me?

40
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,770
You're free now.

41
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,920
Thank you.

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,480
Thank you.

43
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
Deep down, you know

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
who's more suitable to lead the group.

45
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,200
Congratulations

46
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,530
on making a wise choice.

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,680
Everyone.

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,720
Whether it's now

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,079
or in the future,

50
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,440
I am still the largest shareholder of Shengye.

51
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,650
Does anyone object?

52
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,920
I object.

53
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,000
Who are you?

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,460
How dare you barge in here?

55
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm Sheng An's secretary.

56
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,060
My name is Qiao Wan.

57
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,560
Didn't I tell you to stay at home?

58
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,280
I apologize for interrupting the board meeting.

59
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,560
That wasn't my intention.

60
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,690
I'm here to confess.

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,160
Sheng Huaijing used me

62
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,040
to steal Sheng An's fingerprints.

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,770
Sheng An knew nothing about it.

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,200
Therefore, this authorization letter

65
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,120
is invalid.

66
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,320
Do you understand

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,320
the consequences

68
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,680
of what you're saying?

69
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,240
I understand completely.

70
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:36,800
And

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,680
I'm willing to accept the company's investigation

72
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,160
and any punishment.

73
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,650
He won't escape either.

74
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,380
Qiao Wan, you've gone mad.

75
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,600
What's so good about him

76
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,200
that makes you go this far?

77
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,480
Fine.

78
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,120
Start the internal investigation procedure immediately.

79
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,840
According to protocol.

80
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,560
Wait.

81
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,079
You haven't verified

82
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,340
if the authorization letter is genuine.

83
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,840
Come in.

84
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,640
Mr. Sheng.

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,800
The authentication agency compared

86
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,760
the fingerprints on the authorization letter

87
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,960
with Young Master Sheng An's fingerprints.

88
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,960
They don't match.

89
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,040
Young Master.

90
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,930
The fingerprint film is ready.

91
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,680
For both you and Qiao Wan,

92
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,600
one wrong step leads to another.

93
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,200
Think it through carefully.

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,100
Since the authorization letter is fake,

95
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,160
everything you said is invalid.

96
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Uncle.

97
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
To bring me down,

98
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,160
you would rather

99
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,560
create a fake authorization letter to fool everyone.

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,840
Are you that afraid of me?

101
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Sheng An,

102
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,180
you've really outdone yourself.

103
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,840
Grandmother, you're awake.

104
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,600
Madam.

105
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,860
That's wonderful!

106
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,120
Heaven truly protects the good people like you.

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
Your leg.

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,920
This old body of mine

109
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,880
has been to death's door

110
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,300
and barely made it back alive.

111
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,760
Even if I have to use a wheelchair from now on,

112
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,120
it's still a blessing from heaven.

113
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,170
Ladies and gentlemen of the board,

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm here today to announce

115
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,920
that I have

116
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:53,720
transferred all my shares

117
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,600
to Sheng'an.

118
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,560
What

119
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,000
what's going on here

120
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,080
ma'am?

121
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,000
Did you know about Sheng An

122
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,960
impersonating Sheng Ze?

123
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,600
I've known all along.

124
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,680
I helped him keep it secret.

125
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,800
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

126
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
Grandmother,

127
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,160
why did you do this?

128
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,160
Why did I do this?

129
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,880
You should all ask him.

130
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,840
Sheng Huaijing wanted to take over the company.

131
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,520
Harming me was one thing,

132
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
but he repeatedly tried to poison Sheng An.

133
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,480
That's right.

134
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,880
I do want to control the company.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,130
The current Shengye

136
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,880
has strayed from my father's original vision.

137
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
I want to set it right,

138
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,480
so I had no choice but to do this.

139
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,610
Stop trying to glorify your ambition.

140
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,600
You've lost

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,840
the trust of every director present.

142
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,500
Whether you believe it or not,

143
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,800
Shengye started by making medicinal plasters.

144
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,320
It's because of the people that we are where we are today.

145
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:00,960
Now

146
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,720
it's time for Shengye to give back to society.

147
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,800
I'm not in a hurry.

148
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,640
This time,

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,560
I won the bid at a low price,

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,360
which proves my commitment.

151
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,680
Sheng An,

152
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,320
you haven't disappointed your father.

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,360
Everyone has seen his abilities, haven't you?

154
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,250
The CEO position has been vacant for too long.

155
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,890
Since everyone is here,

156
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,680
let's make a decision today.

157
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,000
I vote for Sheng An.

158
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,320
I agree.

159
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,720
I agree too.

160
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,360
Director Lin.

161
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,740
Our combined shares already exceed his.

162
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,720
Then we'll be in charge of the group.

163
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,480
That's what we agreed on before.

164
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,640
Please reconsider.

165
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,000
You can't let this young upstart

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,080
walk all over you.

167
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,680
Director Lin.

168
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,040
I won't try to persuade you anymore.

169
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,720
But you know best

170
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,520
about Shengye's future

171
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,160
and who should take control of it.

172
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,920
I approve Sheng'an as president.

173
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,600
Good.

174
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,930
Unanimously approved.

175
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,600
Now I announce

176
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,040
that Sheng'an officially assumes the position of

177
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,680
Shengye Group President.

178
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,840
From now on,

179
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,680
I hope everyone will still call me Shengze.

180
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,120
Mr. Sheng.

181
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,440
Mr. Sheng, we were ambushed by Shengze's men.

182
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,600
They've taken the director as well.

183
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,360
How's the food today?

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,120
Delicious.

185
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,250
It's good, isn't it?

186
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,880
Mom,

187
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm going on a trip.

188
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,800
Did you come to see me off?

189
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
A trip?

190
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,640
It was this gentleman

191
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
who brought people to rescue your mother

192
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,480
and arranged for me to accompany her abroad for treatment.

193
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,160
Your mother has already had her examination.

194
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,290
All her health indicators are normal.

195
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,480
I've made all the arrangements

196
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,810
to send her abroad for further treatment.

197
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Mom,

198
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,800
I have to go now.

199
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,400
Beibei will stay with you.

200
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:54,800
Uncle Chang,

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:56,960
thank you.

202
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,080
If you want to thank someone,

203
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,410
thank the young master.

204
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,290
I'm just following his instructions.

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,520
What are you looking at?

206
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,400
Are we there yet?

207
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,320
We're here.

208
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,840
Did you arrange this?

209
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,440
Yes.

210
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,280
You're finally doing

211
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,280
what you've always wanted to do.

212
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,540
It's painting, right?

213
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,050
What I want to do most

214
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,800
is actually this.

215
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
I only have this one wish

216
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,640
and you can't even fulfill it for me.

217
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
You're a CEO now.

218
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,570
Can you stop being so childish?

219
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,240
Well, if I'm the CEO,

220
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,960
shouldn't you be listening to me,

221
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,560
Secretary Qiao?

222
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,760
Alright, alright.

223
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
Stop fooling around.

224
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,280
Fine.

225
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,080
Do you want to know

226
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,650
why I was determined to take over the company?

227
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,400
Why?

228
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,680
Do you remember once

229
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,040
when you pushed my wheelchair during a walk

230
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,370
and we ended up in a slum?

231
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,480
We saw some children suffering from parasitic disease,

232
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,210
tortured beyond recognition.

233
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,960
That's when I realized

234
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,800
Shengye wasn't the same company anymore.

235
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
So I made up my mind

236
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,280
to become the CEO.

237
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,760
I want everyone

238
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,000
to still be able to afford

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
our Shengye traditional medicine.

240
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,800
So that time,

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
did you deliberately take me there?

242
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,640
Thank you.
