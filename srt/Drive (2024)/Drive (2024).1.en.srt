- Please do.
- Yes, ma'am.

177
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:11,976
A typo in the call sheet.
That's a big mistake.

178
00:12:13,102 --> 00:12:17,689
But on the bright side,
you just made ten grand.

179
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:20,817
You'll pay me the money for sure?

180
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:23,029
Cheer up.

181
00:12:25,906 --> 00:12:30,952
Ten grand? What? You two planned this?

182
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:36,542
Give me a heads-up next time.
Anyhow, that was awesome.

183
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:40,045
You should love your work, too.

184
00:12:40,046 --> 00:12:43,132
Yes, ma'am. With all my heart.

185
00:12:43,883 --> 00:12:46,385
- Let's get ready.
- Sure.

Ms. Han!

187
00:12:48,181 --> 00:12:50,514
Wait.

188
00:12:50,515 --> 00:12:52,933
This way, fast.

189
00:12:52,934 --> 00:12:54,476
- How'd she get in here?
- Ms. Han!

190
00:12:54,477 --> 00:12:56,770
No idea. Go get the gear.

191
00:12:56,771 --> 00:12:58,480
Got it.

192
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,274
Wait!

00:13:05,237 --> 00:13:07,781
Hello there.

00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:10,909
- Are you a stalker?
- I told you I'm a subscriber.

Yes, Detective Park.

Go bother someone else.
Why do you keep bothering me?

200
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:24,423
Because you're the hotshot of the moment.

201
00:13:24,424 --> 00:13:28,051
Shooting a promo isn't that hard.
Think of it as charity.

202
00:13:28,052 --> 00:13:31,388
Isn't it exploitation if
one's forced to do it?

203
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:37,353
You don't have to put it like that.
Can't you do it for your fans?

204
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:41,732
They're fans in name only.
Many of them are creeps.

205
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:45,652
My son's your fan too.
He'll be sad to hear that.

206
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,700
You probably think I make
easy money doing this.

207
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:56,538
But you know,
my job requires loads of emotional labor.

208
00:13:56,539 --> 00:14:03,420
So, next time, offer me fair payment
for this kind of work.

What do you think you're doing?

Come to think of it,
your idea was too good.

228
00:15:38,891 --> 00:15:41,518
A little too good to be kept just to you.

229
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,562
This is a breach of our contract.

230
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:47,315
You took the deal, 50 percent of my profit.

She promised me the whole

I know you're the top player,

up-and-comers like Ria.

Yes.

- Yes, of course.

Well, too late. I already have a partner.

If you kick it in panic mode,
it'll be big trouble, huge trouble.

All in the script.

685
00:51:50,645 --> 00:51:58,026
Guys, when a TV station stages a hoax,
they sure don't fool around.

686
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:00,904
No, Yoon-seok. That's not true.

687
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:04,324
They're all lies, fabricated.
I've never received...

688
00:52:04,325 --> 00:52:06,325
Isn't lying your specialty?

689
00:52:06,326 --> 00:52:11,673
No, I'm telling you. I've
been kidnapped for real!

690
00:52:11,674 --> 00:52:14,426
That's enough, Yuna.

691
00:52:16,712 --> 00:52:18,130
Didn't you get paid?

692
00:52:18,131 --> 00:52:19,174
What?

693
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,594
Deposit of $350,000!

694
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:30,224
You stab me in the back to get into MBS?

695
00:52:30,225 --> 00:52:32,977
No, that's a lie.

696
00:52:32,978 --> 00:52:35,188
I'm telling you the truth!

697
00:52:35,189 --> 00:52:37,606
I can explain everything.

698
00:52:37,607 --> 00:52:41,653
Trust me this once. I beg you, please!

699
00:52:43,864 --> 00:52:45,073
Yoon-seok.

700
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:47,116
Hey!

701
00:52:47,117 --> 00:52:54,461
[Live event has ended.]

702
00:53:19,608 --> 00:53:21,818
Yuna, this is Park Jeong-suk.

703
00:53:21,819 --> 00:53:22,944
Who?

704
00:53:22,945 --> 00:53:24,904
Detective Park, Seoul Police.

705
00:53:24,905 --> 00:53:27,073
The promo video!

706
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:29,575
I was watching your live stream.

707
00:53:29,576 --> 00:53:33,748
Tell me honestly. Is this real?

708
00:53:44,383 --> 00:53:45,925
Yes.

709
00:53:45,926 --> 00:53:51,472
This is all real. I'm really kidnapped.

710
00:53:51,473 --> 00:53:54,225
Okay, I trust you.

711
00:53:54,226 --> 00:53:57,646
From now on, you talk to me. Okay?

712
00:53:59,148 --> 00:54:02,025
Earlier, your car almost crashed, right?

713
00:54:03,318 --> 00:54:04,652
Yes.

714
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:07,280
One of the cars behind called the police.

715
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:10,699
We have your location, and are on our way.

716
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:14,329
Yuna, don't worry. I'll get you out.

717
00:54:15,664 --> 00:54:17,374
Thank you.

718
00:54:18,083 --> 00:54:23,922
Don't take any risks. Comply with
the demands and buy some time.

719
00:54:23,923 --> 00:54:25,632
But...

720
00:54:26,758 --> 00:54:29,177
How did you know?

721
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:31,429
That this is not a hoax...

722
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,759
I told you my son is your fan.

723
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:38,019
Now, promise me you'll shoot that promo.

724
00:54:40,564 --> 00:54:43,274
But isn't it strange?

725
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:47,278
How did the kidnapper know
about your deal with MBS?

726
00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:50,496
It was all secret up till now, right?

727
00:54:50,497 --> 00:54:53,459
Well, I received the money from...

728
00:55:02,117 --> 00:55:05,463
[Crusader: Be sincere
if you want other people's money.]

729
00:55:05,464 --> 00:55:08,591
Detective, I think I know who Crusader...

730
00:55:08,592 --> 00:55:11,429
Wait! I found you!

731
00:55:15,891 --> 00:55:18,685
I can't see well. Get closer, please.

732
00:55:21,988 --> 00:55:25,198
8671. Yes, that's me!

733
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,847
There's Yuna's Cadillac!

734
00:56:38,848 --> 00:56:42,727
Hi everyone, I'm your Revealer,
reporting live from the chase.

735
00:56:45,981 --> 00:56:48,191
You see? Here's the Cadillac!

736
00:56:48,192 --> 00:56:50,526
And Yuna's inside that trunk!

737
00:56:50,527 --> 00:56:52,658
You're looking at the trunk...

738
00:56:53,447 --> 00:56:55,865
she's waiting to be rescued!

739
00:57:00,704 --> 00:57:02,956
Hey, stop the car!

740
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:05,166
This is a very dangerous situation.

741
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:10,964
But I'll stay on it for
everyone's right to know!

742
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:15,634
The Cadillac is still on the run,
chased by the police cars!

743
00:57:15,635 --> 00:57:18,054
We're almost there!

744
00:57:18,055 --> 00:57:20,640
Now you're done, you bastard!

745
00:57:39,534 --> 00:57:41,661
Yuna, I'm coming!

746
00:57:47,084 --> 00:57:49,544
Open the trunk!

747
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:56,384
It's not that car.

748
00:57:58,844 --> 00:58:00,513
No...

749
00:58:00,514 --> 00:58:04,392
No! It's not that car!

750
00:58:07,437 --> 00:58:11,024
I only had a sip, really.

751
00:58:11,025 --> 00:58:14,986
All of these for one drunk driver?

752
00:58:20,492 --> 00:58:22,702
[Gangwon-do Province]

753
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:33,713
[Be sincere if you want
other people's money.]

754
00:58:42,013 --> 00:58:44,723
[Revealer: Sorry I couldn't save you.
I'll pray for your safe return.]

[Crusader: $100 / Nice work.]

757
00:58:49,396 --> 00:58:51,314
That was clever.

758
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:54,275
Now, it's my turn.

759
00:58:55,194 --> 00:59:00,823
Guys, I finally figured
out who Crusader is.

760
00:59:00,824 --> 00:59:02,867
He is...

761
00:59:06,538 --> 00:59:08,997
Na Jin-su, the Executive Director of MBS.

762
00:59:08,998 --> 00:59:12,501
I'm going to call him right now.

763
00:59:19,509 --> 00:59:21,595
He doesn't pick up.

764
00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:25,431
Are you busy driving?

765
01:00:19,068 --> 01:00:21,487
Oh my god!

766
01:00:31,122 --> 01:00:33,124
Please...

767
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:48,160

There is a...

768

[Muto: Yuna, don't cry.]
[LetsKill: Is it really a dead body?]

769
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:51,642
There's a dead body.

770

Get me out of here. Please...
[Konmo: She just said so.]

do everything you say.

774

that you should show your real self.

I'll never make it out, right?

797
01:04:10,675 --> 01:04:13,594
Because I've never been my real self.

798
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:19,065
Never thought I would...

799
01:04:23,146 --> 01:04:26,065
say my goodbyes so soon, like this.

I'm sorry, everyone.

For a long time...

802
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:43,544
You were just a number in my view counts,
and I never cared for you.

803
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:51,674
I've told so many lies.

804

I'm sorry, Dad.

You were sick and lonely
when you were dying,

808
01:05:14,113 --> 01:05:17,616
but I only used you to
get people's attention.

809

I really wanted to do it right this time.

810
01:05:27,293 --> 01:05:30,212
