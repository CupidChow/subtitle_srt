PREVIOUSLY…

00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:06,423
<i>At the base of Mount Fuji,</i>

3
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,758
<i>in Fuji-Asada, lives Kiyomi Endou.</i>

4
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>Her colleague,</i>

5
00:00:10,176 --> 00:00:12,178
<i>Takahashi, who's an alien,</i>
<i>saves Kiyomi's life.</i>

6
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,263
‪Are you okay?‬

7
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,347
<i>That secret</i>

8
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,267
<i>is only known to her childhood friends</i>
<i>Hacchi and Minapuu.</i>

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,269
I hear you're an alien!

10
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:20,478
Please absolutely don't tell anyone.

11
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,106
<i>Takahashi is caught up in a series</i>
<i>of trivial incidents</i>

12
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>that occur in this town.</i>

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:30,530
<i>Meanwhile, his colleague,</i>
<i>Yumi, has a certain suspicion.</i>

14
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,490
There's a chance that Onodera is an alien.

15
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:33,950
He's a little private, isn't he?

16
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:36,828
Right. His personal life is a mystery.

17
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>In the midst of all this,</i>

18
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:41,041
<i>cracks slowly begin to appear.</i>

19
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,834
<i>And today,</i>

20
00:00:42,917 --> 00:00:45,420
<i>Kiyomi and her friends' secret</i>
<i>is at risk of being exposed</i>

21
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,881
<i>by a man who just arrived in town.</i>

22
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,313
Do few tourists come here?

23
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,025
This area is a bit off the beaten path
from the tourist spots.

24
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,569
Right.

25
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,074
But it's a nice place, isn't it?
The old townscape is still here.

26
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,078
Yeah, I think it's a hidden gem.

27
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,504
NIPPON TELEVISION

28
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:29,214
THREE DAYS AGO

29
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,799
I see.

30
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:38,723
-February 23 is Mount Fuji Day?
-Yep.

31
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,267
-Did you know?
-No.

32
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:45,271
Seems like that's just how things
are over there. Events are everywhere.

33
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,356
I see.

34
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:51,069
I recently went to Shizuoka
and Yamanashi for a shoot,

35
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,154
and I felt there were more ideas
to explore.

36
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,906
What was the shoot about?

37
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,449
It was about the typical debate.

38
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,453
-About which prefecture owns Mount Fuji.
-I see.

39
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,539
Didn't you get into some trouble for that?

40
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,582
Not really.

41
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,127
-I did receive a complaint though.
-For what reason?

42
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,753
He filmed somewhere he wasn't supposed to.

43
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,756
Oh, I see.

44
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,967
We had to go apologize the next day.

45
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:19,806
By the way, in Yamanashi.

46
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,475
They have a system known as <i>mujin.</i>

47
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,394
-What's that?
-Ah…

48
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:29,149
A few friends meet up
for a meal once a month,

49
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,861
and they pool their money to save up.

50
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,737
Really?

51
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,322
-Oh, this?
-Yeah.

52
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,365
MUJIN

53
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,826
-I didn't know it was spelled like that.
-Yeah.

54
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,579
-There are other names for that too.
-Really?

55
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,833
I have a hunch that there are lots
of local gems to find,

56
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,253
so I’m thinking about going over there
to film some street interviews.

57
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:52,589
Is that alright?

58
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,925
Well, if you're feeling confident,
why not?

59
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,260
Okay.

60
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,054
Thank you.

61
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,889
MONT BLANC

62
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,308
Sorry to keep you waiting.
This way, please.

63
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,190
Isn't it getting kinda crowded?

64
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,194
Tourists, here?

65
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,322
But it's more surprising
that there's a line outside Mont Blanc.

66
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,241
It's a good thing we came early.

67
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,952
Queuing up at cafés
should be banned by the government.

68
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:04,911
Why?

69
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,704
Take restaurants, for instance.

70
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,958
They're places for eating,
but cafés aren't really about that, right?

71
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,959
What do you mean?

72
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,878
It's a place where you can chill
and chat, not just eat.

73
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,046
Okay.

74
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,214
Of course, if you sit

75
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:18,757
for hours with one cup of coffee,
that's too much.

76
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:22,011
A café is somewhere you can relax
for a reasonable amount of time.

77
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:25,223
But even if lining up was banned,

78
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,309
there would still be people lurking
nearby, ready to enter.

79
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,477
Yeah, absolutely.

80
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,772
It would cause trouble
for neighboring stores and the café too.

81
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,359
That's no good. I take it back.

82
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,944
-Sorry to burst your bubble.
-It's okay.

83
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:39,779
Sorry to keep you waiting.

84
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:41,948
For some reason,
there's a huge line outside.

85
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,493
-You're right. What should we do?
-Shall we leave?

86
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,078
Maybe we should.

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,957
Are you all free after this?

88
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,792
-Yeah.
-Me too.

89
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:53,918
Wanna go to Jona-sama's?

90
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,336
-Sure.
-Yeah.

91
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,839
<i>Ever since in middle school,</i>

92
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,758
<i>we've called Jonathan's "Jona-sama's."</i>

93
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,968
Thank you for the food.

94
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,722
<i>That's because up until then,</i>
<i>our town had no family restaurants</i>

95
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,682
<i>with self-service drinks,</i>

96
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,601
<i>and Jonathan's opening in the neighborhood</i>

97
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,729
<i>felt, to us back then,</i>

98
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,732
<i>like a massive, life-changing event.</i>

99
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,817
Thank you.

100
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,652
<i>As such,</i>

101
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,739
<i>as a sign of respect to Jonathan's,</i>

102
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,324
<i>we started calling it Jona-sama's.</i>

103
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,366
Here.

104
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,953
Is <i>katsudon</i> with a beaten egg topping
not available here?

105
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,414
We do have it,
but we call it "sauce <i>katsudon.</i>"

106
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,625
Oh, because the sauce
is the basis for the dish?

107
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,877
Yes, that's right.

108
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,506
Have you experienced any noteworthy
personal events or news lately by the way?

109
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,134
Personal news?

110
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,970
My grandpa

111
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,639
was interviewed for a TV show.

112
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,767
So was he on TV?

113
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,769
No, his part was cut.

114
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,645
Oh, what a shame.

115
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,152
There's this supermarket called Ichiyama.

116
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,571
There's a lady at the register
who's really quick.

117
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,906
How quick?

118
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,492
It's like she's on double speed.

119
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,660
Double speed? That's pretty fast.

120
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,204
Yeah.

121
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,124
Even when there’s a line,
she breezes through it so quickly

122
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,294
that all the regulars prefer
to queue at her register.

123
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,588
That sounds impressive.

124
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,299
Do you think she really
goes at double speed?

125
00:06:23,382 --> 00:06:25,676
God knows.

126
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,512
If it's true, it'll be entertaining.

127
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:31,516
More often than not, they usually turn out
not to be that impressive.

128
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,434
Right?

129
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,354
Just in case, can you find out
if we’re able to interview her?

130
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,814
Okay.

131
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,233
You know,

132
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:44,487
I kinda hope Mont Blanc doesn't take off.
Is that me being selfish as a regular?

133
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,197
Well, yeah.

134
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,240
Yeah, that's selfish.

135
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,284
But don't you hate it when you can't
get in because of the crowd?

136
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,205
Yeah, but if it doesn't do well enough,
it might go under, right?

137
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:59,085
What about wanting them to barely get by,
just enough not to go under?

138
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,087
-That's being selfish, yeah.
-Agreed.

139
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,171
Yeah.

140
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,132
Okay.

141
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,758
Instead of just barely getting by,

142
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:09,011
what if the owner is just about
making a decent profit?

143
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,139
And where would you draw that line?

144
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:15,393
Of course being able
to live comfortably is a given,

145
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,187
and then maybe just being able
to take a domestic trip once a year

146
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,816
and an international one every three years
would be nice. What do you think?

147
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,443
That's selfish too.

148
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:24,485
Really?

149
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:28,197
Deciding things for the owner
is selfish in itself.

150
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,699
I can't win, huh.

151
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,453
I work in urology,

152
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,704
and my senior

153
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:39,125
has this incredible knack for retrieving
urine cups with just the right timing.

154
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,003
Retrieving urine cups
with just the right timing?

155
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,964
It's hard to gauge the timing
for when to retrieve the cup.

156
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,424
If you open the window too quick,

157
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:49,635
you may have an accidental face-to-face
with the patient, and it's awkward.

158
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:50,845
I see now!

159
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,598
My senior always opens the window
at the perfect moment

160
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,224
and never encounters the patient.

161
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,976
-That's amazing.
-Yes.

162
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,481
Our hospital is usually pretty quiet,
but it gets busy a few times each year.

163
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,650
-Really?
-I hate it when it's busy,

164
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,320
so I hope it stays empty all the time.
Is that selfish of me too?

165
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:09,363
That's like

166
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,575
the selfishness
students working part-time often have.

167
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,410
They have no sense of responsibility.

168
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,912
This is part-time job selfishness?

169
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,789
It's like a part-timer’s prank, but yeah.

170
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,208
If the place isn’t packed,

171
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:24,045
it means few people are facing
urinary issues, which is good.

172
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:25,546
But, Minapuu,

173
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:28,966
that's not the real reason
you don't want the place to be packed.

174
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,510
-Well, yeah.
-Right?

175
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,385
You just really dislike being busy,

176
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,389
so I guess that makes you selfish, right?

177
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,350
-I see.
-Yeah.

178
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,727
Have you experienced any noteworthy
personal events or news lately?

179
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:42,855
Let me think.

180
00:08:42,938 --> 00:08:46,442
Oh, yes. My bike was stolen the other day.

181
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,860
What, really?

182
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,155
Yes. Just when I thought I wasn't going
to get my bike back,

183
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,074
the culprit

184
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,660
robbed a convenience store
and was apprehended by the police.

185
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,328
What happened after that?

186
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:01,123
They found out the bike had been stolen,
and that's how I got it back.

187
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,043
-That's quite the coincidence.
-Yes.

188
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,213
Is there anything else?

189
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,881
Anything else?

190
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,010
Anything else… Hmm…

191
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,931
Ricchan, do you have any ideas?

192
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,059
There was someone who was really fast.

193
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,020
Someone who was really fast?
What do you mean?

194
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,355
You mean they ran really fast?

195
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,527
How fast were they?

196
00:09:31,028 --> 00:09:32,071
Like a car.

197
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,657
A car? That's really fast!

198
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,285
-When did you see that? Was I there too?
-Yeah.

199
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,996
What? Was there a person like that?

200
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:42,081
Do you remember what kind
of person they were?

201
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,001
A person like this.

202
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,753
Someone like this? Oh, glasses?

203
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,506
Someone who wears glasses?

204
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,008
When was that?

205
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,344
Kiichan, when's your night shift, again?

206
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,430
At 4 p.m.

207
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:00,266
But Wakaba's not at home today.

208
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:03,644
-So I can still relax a little longer.
-I see.

209
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,730
My husband is away
on a business trip today.

210
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,231
Is that so?

211
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,025
You have plans after this too,
right, Hacchi?

212
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,653
-Yeah.
-What should I do for dinner?

213
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,572
When it's just me,
I don't feel like cooking.

214
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,240
Right? I'd rather have instant ramen.

215
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:18,242
Yeah.

216
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,119
I'm thinking of U.F.O. noodles.

217
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,205
You should have a proper dinner.

218
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,957
Hey, why don't you invite Aya-nyan?

219
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,001
That's what I thought, and I texted her.

220
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,754
-But she hasn't replied.
-I see.

221
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,173
If you're going to have instant ramen,

222
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,426
why don't you go to Ichiyama
and buy some side dishes to go with it?

223
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,844
Side dishes, huh.

224
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,723
Ichiyama's side dishes are surprisingly
high quality, and they're cheap too.

225
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:41,807
I know, right?

226
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,352
That sauce <i>katsudon</i>
for 350 yen is a steal!

227
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,979
Their sauce <i>katsudon</i> is really delicious.

228
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,690
Their food really stands out
from the rest.

229
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,442
Hey, Minapuu.

230
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,610
Wanna go to Ichiyama after?

231
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,903
Ichiyama?

232
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:54,945
Let's buy side dishes.

233
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,448
Side dishes, huh.

234
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,575
You shouldn't sleep
on Ichiyama's side dishes.

235
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:03,287
I'm already accustomed to U.F.O.

236
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,624
You prefer that?

237
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,919
I slammed on the brakes,
but it was too late.

238
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,337
Just when things looked bad,

239
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,006
I saw a shadow zooming in from the side.

240
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,636
-A shadow?
-It was like the bike just zipped away.

241
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,972
Like it was teleported somewhere else.

242
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,974
-Teleported?
-Yeah.

243
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,478
No one believes me when I tell them.

244
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:32,191
Do you perhaps still have the footage
on your dashcam?

245
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,486
No. It was a month ago.

246
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,904
Right.

247
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:39,657
Can you tell if that shadow was a man or…?

248
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,117
It was a man.

249
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,411
What kind of person was he?

250
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,039
It was dark
so I didn't quite see him clearly,

251
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:50,126
but I think he was wearing glasses.

252
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:52,253
Glasses?

253
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,840
MESSAGE FROM AYANO

254
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,091
It's from Aya-nyan.

255
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,968
What did she say?

256
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:01,178
If I'm okay with Ricchan coming,
then she's coming.

257
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,763
That's great, isn't it?

258
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,265
Have dinner with her.

259
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,642
-I don't know.
-What? Why?

260
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,477
I'm used to eating U.F.O.

261
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,521
You're that far gone?

262
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,981
So what are you going to do now?

263
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,983
I'm definitely down to eat with her…

264
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,277
Yeah, you should.

265
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,988
…but I wonder if there are any places
around that serve U.F.O.

266
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,865
That's selfish.

267
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,242
Welcome! Are you a group of two?

268
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,326
Feel free to take any vacant table.

269
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,453
Okay.

270
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,875
-Let's sit here.
-Okay.

271
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,921
I've contacted the supermarket
and the hospital.

272
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,383
-They're available tomorrow afternoon.
-Really?

273
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,219
It's nothing to do with Yamanashi,
but it'll do.

274
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,472
Yeah.

275
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,765
What about the truck driver's story?

276
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,225
Teleportation?

277
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:49,935
Yeah.

278
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,228
No way that's true.

279
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,564
As a story, it has that special something.

280
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,984
But it's just something he said he saw.
I don't see how we could dig any further.

281
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,655
Same goes for that little girl's story.

282
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,158
The person who ran as fast a car?

283
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,954
Yeah, though the fact
that both wore glasses is interesting.

284
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,415
But neither of them had any evidence.

285
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,752
-Yeah.
-That should be fine.

286
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,755
For now, let's keep going until evening
and do the rest tomorrow.

287
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:18,797
Okay.

288
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,634
I'll have number 121.

289
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:22,760
No rice.

290
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:23,844
-Without rice?
-Yeah.

291
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,724
-I'll be heading out now.
-Thank you for your work.

292
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,893
FRONT DESK

293
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,688
Mr. Itadaki's luggage has arrived.
He's set to check in today.

294
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,857
Mr. Kamura has been reassigned
to Room 205.

295
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,984
Noted. I'll take up the luggage.

296
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,529
-Understood.
-Understood.

297
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:57,795
-I found something amazing today.
-What is it?

298
00:13:57,878 --> 00:13:59,338
Have a look!

299
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:00,965
10 YEN COIN

300
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,551
Isn't this amazing?

301
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,429
Yeah. Where did you get it?

302
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:11,892
-I found it in the office at lunch.
-I see.

303
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,060
Who do you think did this?

304
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:17,106
Hmm, I wonder…

305
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,567
<i>I know who it was, but I can't say.</i>

306
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,028
Oh, manager.

307
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,072
Do you have a moment?

308
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:26,824
Do you have a moment?

309
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:28,284
What's wrong?

310
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,039
Are you able to bend a 10 yen coin?

311
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:35,958
A 10 yen coin?

312
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,960
Could you try doing it once?

313
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,173
There's no way I can do that.

314
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,387
See? I couldn't.

315
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,306
That's what I thought.

316
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,099
-Thank you.
-What's the matter?

317
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,019
Could you have a look at this?

318
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,271
What is this?

319
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,024
I found this on the floor in the office.
Isn't this amazing?

320
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,526
Yeah, well, I mean.

321
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,569
Who did this?

322
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,655
I don't know.

323
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,325
But the only one among us
who could do something like this

324
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,368
is Onodera, don't you think?

325
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,495
Huh? No,

326
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,581
even Onodera would find this impossible.

327
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,584
But if it's one of us,
it has to be Onodera, right?

328
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,461
-You think so?
<i>-For now,</i>

329
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,588
<i>Let's just go with that.</i>

330
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,968
I'm here on vacation, so I don't know much
about this place.

331
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,470
Oh, okay.

332
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:30,721
But,

333
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,515
I've been here since last week.

334
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:36,644
-And when I took a photo of Mount Fuji…
-What happened?

335
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,604
Have a look at this.

336
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,190
What is this?

337
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,610
-I don't know, but it's captured on film.
-I wonder what that is.

338
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,278
A luminous body?

339
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,490
It's too close to be a UFO.

340
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:55,871
-Oh, Takahashi.
-Yes?

341
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,957
Do you have a moment? Just a moment?

342
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,999
Okay.

343
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,133
What's the matter?

344
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,261
Are you able to bend a 10 yen coin?

345
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,429
What?

346
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,227
-Why?
-Could you try doing it once?

347
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,938
Sure.

348
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,606
I definitely can't.

349
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,442
I couldn't.

350
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,903
I figured. Thank you.

351
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,364
What's the matter?

352
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,867
Could you have a look at this?

353
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:37,037
Isn't this amazing?

354
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:39,957
-What's this?
-Who do you think did this?

355
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,627
I don't know.

356
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,837
This is just a hunch.

357
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:48,716
-But I think it was Onodera.
-Really?

358
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,510
Yeah, because out of all of us
the only one who seems capable of this

359
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,178
is Onodera. Don't you think so?

360
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,681
Oh.

361
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,976
-Yeah, I can totally see him doing that.
-Right?

362
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:01,812
-He's young and does look strong.
-Surprisingly toned--

363
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,690
<i>-He shifted the blame really well.</i>
-He told me he was working out.

364
00:17:04,772 --> 00:17:06,650
-Really?
-Yeah.

365
00:17:07,734 --> 00:17:10,738
I work part-time at a convenience store,

366
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,321
but I was robbed the other day.

367
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,159
-Were you okay?
-Yes.

368
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,161
A man who happened to pass by

369
00:17:17,243 --> 00:17:20,539
threw a paintball at the culprit
while I was calling the police.

370
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,833
-One of those orange ones?
-Yes.

371
00:17:22,915 --> 00:17:25,877
The culprit was caught right after that.

372
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,546
That's great to hear.

373
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:30,340
But the strange part

374
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,134
is that the culprit fled on a bike,

375
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:35,387
so it’s hard to believe the ball would hit
from that distance.

376
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,681
Then how did he do it?

377
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,516
Well…

378
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,520
he was either super-fast
or he had insane shoulder strength.

379
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,190
Even then, I still think
it would be tough.

380
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,859
By the way, what kind of person was he?

381
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:51,236
He was just
a typical old guy with glasses.

382
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
-Glasses?
-Yes.

383
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,328
It's the glasses guy again.

384
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:02,039
Now I'm a little curious.

385
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,084
-Mr. Kishimoto.
-Yes?

386
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,587
-He said the guy threw a paintball, right?
-Yeah.

387
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,882
Do you remember the photo
the tourist before him showed us?

388
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,801
-Oh, that one of something flying?
-Yes.

389
00:18:14,885 --> 00:18:15,886
Could it be…

390
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:20,474
It's orange.

391
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,479
Onodera is really something else.

392
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,524
That's some serious
grip strength, isn't it?

393
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,818
But the question is…

394
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,654
Why did he do this?

395
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,780
What do you mean?

396
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,325
Leaving this in the office

397
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,161
could be him trying to send a message.

398
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,872
-A message?
-Yes.

399
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,249
Such as?

400
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:48,043
I don't really know,
but maybe there was something

401
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,754
he wasn't happy about at work.

402
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,340
-Not happy?
-Yes.

403
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,345
But I haven't done anything
to make him feel that way.

404
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:01,557
When it comes to bullying and harassment,

405
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,476
people almost always become perpetrators
without even realizing it.

406
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:08,522
<i>The conversation has somehow headed</i>
<i>in a completely different direction.</i>

407
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,989
Are you from Tokyo?

408
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,241
Oh, yes.

409
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,994
I gave your colleague
a ride the other day, right?

410
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,830
Me? Really?

411
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:28,125
I accidentally turned the SOS alert on.

412
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,127
Oh, I remember now.

413
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,379
Yeah, a passerby alerted me.

414
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,631
Oh, right.

415
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,800
That person

416
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,218
was weird, wasn't he?

417
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,595
What do you mean?

418
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,098
He appeared out of nowhere.

419
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,183
Did he?

420
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:49,104
I didn’t see anyone in the rearview mirror
while I was driving,

421
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,856
but he appeared as soon as I stopped.

422
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:00,616
Does the younger generation
practice <i>mujin</i> as well?

423
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,992
Yeah, most likely.

424
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,411
Really? That's cool.

425
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:06,622
It's our custom.

426
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,249
Hold on.

427
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,169
Yes?

428
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:15,380
-Your SOS alert is on.
-What?

429
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,176
Oh, you're right!

430
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,012
Sorry about that.
I accidentally switched it on.

431
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,180
I figured.

432
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,807
Sorry about that.
Thanks for going out of your way!

433
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,184
Don't mention it.

434
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,114
That person…

435
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,825
Didn't he have glasses on?

436
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,869
I think so.

437
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,162
-Right?
-Yeah.

438
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:53,710
Ah.

439
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,631
Did something come to mind?

440
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:02,427
-Well, my birthday was in August.
-Okay.

441
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,055
Onodera gave me a present.

442
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:06,682
Oh, that's right, he did.

443
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,476
But I completely forgot

444
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,020
about Onodera's birthday

445
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,981
and didn't give him anything.

446
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,941
When was his birthday?

447
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,068
-October.
-What?

448
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:20,320
That must be it.

449
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,405
-Why?
-You see?

450
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,408
He bent a 10 yen coin.

451
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,118
Ten as in the tenth month?

452
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:29,538
The message is his birthday was crushed.

453
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:34,876
-Really?
<i>-The conversation is getting weirder.</i>

454
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:44,720
-What should I do?
-Hmm.

455
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,805
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

456
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:48,056
Are you checking in?

457
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,975
Yes. I'm Matsuzaki.

458
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,687
Mr. Matsuzaki. Please give me
a few moments to verify your information.

459
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,525
-Mr. Matsuzaki and Mr. Kishimoto, yes?
-Correct.

460
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:02,112
Please fill out this form.

461
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,780
Your cooperation is appreciated.

462
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,001
You think we might be able
to interview the people here too?

463
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,086
I'm not sure. Shall we ask?

464
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,546
Yeah.

465
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,174
-Let's go back.
-Okay.

466
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,343
What do you think I should do?

467
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,388
About Onodera?

468
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,557
Yeah.

469
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:33,435
It’s actually those quiet types
who can suddenly snap

470
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,729
and commit serious crimes.

471
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,440
Really?

472
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:41,026
-He doesn't seem like that type.
-Exactly.

473
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,819
What?

474
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,906
You know how coworkers always claim
they never noticed anything off

475
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:49,826
about the suspect in interviews?

476
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,411
I guess you've got a point.

477
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,663
Thinking back,

478
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,041
he's probably been dropping hints.

479
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,711
You mean the 10 yen coin?

480
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,379
Yeah.

481
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,257
I'm back.

482
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,219
<i>Things are getting out of control.</i>

483
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,935
Excuse me.

484
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:17,437
I'm a producer at Nippon Television.

485
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,773
My name is Kishimoto

486
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:23,110
and I would like to ask permission
to conduct interviews here.

487
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,111
Um…

488
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,281
-Has there been an incident?
-Oh, no.

489
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,826
We're asking locals
about their personal news

490
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,663
for our <i>Monday Late Show.</i>

491
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:37,457
Oh, I see.

492
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,627
As long as it's not too much of a bother,

493
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:45,340
I'd be grateful
if I could interview your staff as well.

494
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,052
Well…

495
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,887
if they're okay with it, it's fine.

496
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,764
Thank you.

497
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,807
Thank you.

498
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,604
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

499
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:03,525
Did you interview me before
for another show?

500
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:04,442
Oh, did I?

501
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,862
Yes, you interviewed me in front of Aeon.

502
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,906
Oh, thank you for accepting
the interview back then.

503
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,034
Was my part cut due to it
not being up to standard?

504
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,954
Oh, no. It was just for timing reasons.

505
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,914
-I see.
-Yes.

506
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,794
-Okay, let's get straight into it.
-Okay.

507
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:26,673
Have you experienced any noteworthy
personal events or news lately?

508
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,009
-Personal news?
-Yes.

509
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,638
To tell you the truth,
in our back office today,

510
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,932
this was on the floor.

511
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,436
What? Who did that?

512
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,022
A staff member called Onodera.

513
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,523
-Onodera?
-Yes.

514
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,150
That's quite the strength he has.

515
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,234
Right?

516
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,861
What was his profession before this?

517
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:51,281
It's not so much that,

518
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,242
but rather, he's probably an alien.

519
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:55,952
An alien?

520
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:59,331
Yes. Well, there was already a rumor.

521
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,290
Really?

522
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,334
Yes.

523
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:05,045
Because he's always incredibly fast
when leaving work.

524
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,714
What do you mean?

525
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,591
Every time after his shift ends,

526
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,052
and he enters the back office to change,

527
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,678
he only takes a minute or so, right?

528
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,639
Well, I guess.

529
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:18,141
In any case,
he gets changed really quickly.

530
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,768
-He gets changed quickly?
-Yes.

531
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,853
So, between us

532
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,730
we had this alien theory going on.

533
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,191
-Because he changes really quickly?
-Yes.

534
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,985
Oh, that's not all, of course.

535
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,863
He's mysterious

536
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,990
and doesn't share anything
about his private life.

537
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,952
Maybe there's a chance that he's an alien.

538
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,328
I see.

539
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,538
<i>There's no way they would buy that.</i>

540
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:47,128
By the way, while we were out today
doing some interviews,

541
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,966
we heard a few people mention seeing
a guy who was really fast.

542
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,551
<i>-What?</i>
-Someone who's really fast?

543
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:56,304
Some even liken it to teleportation.

544
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:57,931
<i>That's Takahashi.</i>

545
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,600
That person is probably Onodera.

546
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,102
-You think so?
-Yes.

547
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:05,772
The common thing about those testimonies
is they all said he was wearing glasses.

548
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,440
-That's Onodera!
-He wears glasses?

549
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,525
-Absolutely.
-What?

550
00:26:08,608 --> 00:26:09,567
He so does.

551
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,152
-Do you want to see a picture?
-Yes.

552
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,196
<i>This is bad.</i>

553
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:15,824
Oh, he's wearing glasses!

554
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,242
-He sure is!
-He really is.

555
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,201
He sure is.

556
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,245
-He sure is.
-Yeah.

557
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,997
He might just be it.

558
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,707
Oh, thank you, that's all.

559
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,791
Really?

560
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,711
Yeah, and they seem really hooked.

561
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,717
Well, if Onodera denies it,
won't things end there?

562
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,679
With things as they are,
I feel like even if he denies it,

563
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:41,474
it will feel like that's what
he's being forced to say.

564
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,310
I see.

565
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:48,398
If they twist Onodera's words like that,

566
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,026
I'll feel bad for him.

567
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,611
Yeah, but it's not like

568
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:57,907
I can come out and say,
"Actually, I'm the alien."

569
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,120
Or perhaps,

570
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,247
after this, we could

571
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:06,958
come up with another topic

572
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,627
that overshadows the story about Onodera.

573
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,629
-Another topic?
-Yes.

574
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,174
Something that will get
the production team hooked.

575
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,051
But there isn't anything.

576
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,471
I'm done. Kiyomi, are you ready?

577
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:20,597
Oh, yeah.

578
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,107
I hope you don't mind us
taking a bit of your time.

579
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:32,442
Not at all.

580
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,777
-Let's get right to it.
-Okay.

581
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,945
Have you experienced
any noteworthy personal events

582
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,697
or news lately?

583
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:38,823
Yes.

584
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,871
-Um…
-Anything is okay.

585
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,917
In my neighborhood,

586
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,461
there's this café called Mont Blanc,

587
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,130
and it's really popular right now.

588
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,299
-Mont Blanc?
-Yes.

589
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,177
The place has a great vintage vibe,

590
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:01,388
and I totally suggest you try it.

591
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,806
I see.

592
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,516
This is what it looks like.

593
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,728
It looks nice.

594
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:10,313
-Right?
-Yeah.

595
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,815
And check this out,

596
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,275
-the menu is packed with so many options!
-Is that so?

597
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,820
-See?
-Oh.

598
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,655
-And this.
-You're right.

599
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,073
See? Isn’t that amazing?

600
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,075
-What do you recommend?
-My recommendation?

601
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:25,745
Let me see.

602
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:27,163
Um, I'd suggest

603
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,457
the Hidden Surprise Parfait.

604
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,252
-Wow, everything really is hidden.
-Yes!

605
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:36,214
And even with all this cream,

606
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:38,174
you won’t feel the slightest bit
of heartburn.

607
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,593
-That sounds like a must-try.
-Yes.

608
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,432
So anyway, what kind of person
is Mr. Onodera?

609
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,476
-Onodera?
-Yes.

610
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,478
<i>It didn't resonate with him at all.</i>

611
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,108
He strikes me as a really pleasant
and cheerful young man.

612
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,111
When's the next time he'll be here?

613
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,199
Onodera is on the morning shift tomorrow.

614
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,952
-So I think he'll be in by 7 a.m.
-I see.

615
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:10,999
I enjoy assembling <i>gunpla</i> as a pastime.

616
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,208
<i>Gunpla?</i>

617
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,209
Yes.

618
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,004
They're plastic models
that look like this.

619
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,757
Oh, you're really good at it.

620
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,178
This is the Best Mecha Collection Gundam
Revival version.

621
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,140
I chose to stick with the old kit's
seam lines, and added some detailing

622
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,310
to make it look
like the original Best Mecha Collection.

623
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,896
-I just did it for fun.
-That's amazing.

624
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,566
There's still more.
This is my most recent project.

625
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,360
Zaku from <i>Requiem for Vengeance.</i>

626
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:40,737
That's very lifelike!

627
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,906
I tried to recreate the wear and tear
in the scene

628
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,493
as closely as possible
by watching the footage multiple times.

629
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,453
You have high standards.

630
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,331
Not at all.
It's nothing more than a hobby.

631
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:55,502
So, do you ever meet up
with Mr. Onodera in private?

632
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,296
-Onodera?
-Yes.

633
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,175
I don't see him at all outside of work.

634
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:04,594
<i>Even</i> gunpla <i>didn't work…</i>

635
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,018
Looks like this time we'll be focusing
on Onodera.

636
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:16,731
If we combine it well
with street interviews…

637
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,235
and frame it as an urban legend,
it might work, right?

638
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,487
Is the guy with glasses
we heard about in the interviews

639
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:24,489
really Onodera?

640
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,699
Who knows?

641
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,326
But I'd love to hear from him.

642
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,702
Oh,

643
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,622
and didn't she say something about aliens?

644
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,750
Yeah, I'm not sure about that, but
if that’s what the reception staff say,

645
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,961
we might as well go with it
and see where it leads.

646
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,629
Yeah.

647
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,882
The person mentioned earlier
who was really fast

648
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,592
is probably Onodera, right?

649
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,302
What? No way.

650
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,221
But he can bend a 10 yen coin.

651
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:51,850
-That's not confirmed yet.
-But…

652
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,143
There are claims
that the person had glasses on,

653
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,354
so isn’t it hard to think of anyone
but Onodera?

654
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:57,605
But there are plenty

655
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,232
of people who wear glasses.

656
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,485
I don't think that's it.

657
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:05,864
But it's true that I actually got
a birthday gift from Onodera,

658
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:07,448
but I didn’t give anything back.

659
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,576
-Oh, really?
-And

660
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,828
Onodera's birthday was in October.

661
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,246
October?

662
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:15,331
It's the 10th month,
so he used a 10 yen coin.

663
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,000
Is that what the 10 yen coin meant?

664
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,460
So far, that theory seems the most likely.

665
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,963
I still think it's a bit of a stretch.

666
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:25,466
We still don’t even know
if Onodera actually did it to begin with.

667
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:29,512
Yeah, there's a possibility
that a guest did it.

668
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:30,471
-Hold on.
-What is it?

669
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,225
If I recall correctly,
the gift you received from Onodera was…

670
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:37,103
A 10-in-1 multi-tool knife.

671
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,648
Another 10?

672
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,692
Surely it's just coincidence.

673
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,027
-Wait.
-What?

674
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,612
Come to think of it…

675
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,156
-What's the matter?
-Well.

676
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,535
I remember Onodera was talking before
about wanting to get a new pillow.

677
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:55,872
I meant to give him a birthday gift too.

678
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:59,751
-So I subtly asked what he'd like.
-Okay.

679
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:03,713
Guess what?
He said he wanted a Tempur pillow.

680
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:06,799
"Ten."

681
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,052
Ten.

682
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:11,304
Everything clicks.

683
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,265
You're really trying
to force a connection, huh.

684
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:17,936
Hello, front desk speaking.

685
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,856
Some slippers? Understood.

686
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,775
I'll bring them to you immediately.

687
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,195
-I'll go deliver the slippers.
-Okay.

688
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,533
I'll go check my emails.

689
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,535
Um, manager.

690
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:37,455
You don't have to dwell on it too much.

691
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:39,499
Okay.

692
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,009
FRONT DESK

693
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,679
This has become a real pain, hasn't it?

694
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:55,264
-Yeah.
-We really must.

695
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,100
We have to stop this soon,

696
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,560
otherwise it wouldn't be fair to Onodera.

697
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,853
Yeah.

698
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,651
-Um, this is just a suggestion.
-Okay.

699
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:11,322
Let's tell Yumi and manager the truth.

700
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,448
What do you mean?

701
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,909
That you're an alien

702
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,828
and you were the one who bent the coin.

703
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:18,579
We can't do that.

704
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,708
But at this rate, everyone will be
walking on eggshells around Onodera

705
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,710
even though he hasn't done anything.

706
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,795
-Yeah, but…
-And who knows about the TV.

707
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:29,132
How that is going to portray stuff.

708
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,010
That doesn't mean I have to
let them interview me about it.

709
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,177
That's exactly why

710
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,723
I suggest we tell them the truth

711
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,933
and resolve the misunderstanding
with Onodera first.

712
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:43,146
Afterwards, we can find a way to deal
with the TV crew. Isn't that better?

713
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:45,148
Hmm…

714
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,316
I've got a feeling
that Isomura will let it slip.

715
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,528
If we communicate well,
she's sure to cooperate.

716
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,363
Really?

717
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,367
Rather than keep lying

718
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,162
and let the situation spiral out
of control,

719
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,873
I really think it's better
just to come clean to both of them

720
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:04,709
for the sake of the future.

721
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,882
Let's put our trust in both of them.

722
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,071
Um, manager.

723
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,906
Yes?

724
00:34:35,864 --> 00:34:38,659
I've got something to tell you.

725
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,579
What is it?

726
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:45,708
Regarding the 10 yen coin
incident earlier…

727
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,293
Oh.

728
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,422
The person who did that wasn't Onodera…

729
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,553
-It was actually me.
-Huh?

730
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,474
No way that's true--

731
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,935
Okay, I'll prove it to you.

732
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,354
Um…

733
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,609
So from this… to this.

734
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,781
That's how I did it.

735
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,618
That's unbelievable.

736
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:21,994
You can touch it if you'd like.

737
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,582
Then…

738
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,129
do you have a grudge against me?

739
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,340
Oh, no. Not at all.

740
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:37,176
-Really?
-Yes.

741
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,971
-That's a relief.
-As for why…

742
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,975
How I'm able to do that…

743
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,603
um…

744
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,232
to tell you the truth…

745
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:56,028
I'm actually an alien.

746
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,198
Huh?

747
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,742
An alien?

748
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,245
Yes.

749
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,581
Huh?

750
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,126
What do you mean…?

751
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,130
-You're an alien?
-It's just as it sounds.

752
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,550
I'm an extra-terrestrial life form.

753
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,761
An extra-terrestrial life form?

754
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,433
You are?

755
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:26,893
Yes.

756
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,772
Oh.

757
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,821
I bet you're thinking I've got
a screw loose.

758
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,656
-Oh, no.
-It's fine.

759
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,367
I get why you'd react that way
after I revealed this out of the blue.

760
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:48,247
But let me show you one more ability.
May I?

761
00:36:48,331 --> 00:36:51,292
It'll be quick.
I don't want to take up your time.

762
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,960
Sorry about this.

763
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,463
It'll be quick.

764
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,637
Here I go.

765
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,275
I can do things like this as well.

766
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:18,819
What was that?

767
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,446
Do you believe me now?

768
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:23,574
I don't know what to say.

769
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,035
Huh?

770
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,497
Humans aren't able
to move like that, right?

771
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,292
Well, I guess…

772
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,420
Are those your alien abilities?

773
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:40,383
In simple terms, yes.

774
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,178
The truth is,

775
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:47,974
I intended to keep this a secret,

776
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:52,353
but I’m worried it might inconvenience
Onodera at this rate.

777
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,813
So,

778
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:57,608
I thought it'd be smarter
to discuss it with you

779
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:01,237
and then request you keep this a secret.

780
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,158
Of course I'll keep this a secret,

781
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,202
but honestly,

782
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,746
all of this seems too unreal.

783
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,999
I understand.

784
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,712
I don't even know how to feel about this.

785
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,506
As far as I'm concerned,

786
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:23,175
I promise I won’t be a bother,

787
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,387
so it'd really help if you'd treat me
just like you always have.

788
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,307
-I see.
-However.

789
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,310
I'd find myself in a difficult situation
if this were to get out,

790
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,061
so I'd appreciate it

791
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,521
if you could keep this a secret.

792
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,231
Of course.

793
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:41,068
I understand.
I definitely won't tell anyone.

794
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,071
Thank you.

795
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:57,585
I wonder what the two
of them are talking about?

796
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:02,089
It seems like an important discussion.

797
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,507
An important discussion?

798
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,345
I think you might also hear something

799
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,930
from Takahashi.

800
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:11,349
Me too?

801
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,522
You heard the truth?

802
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,107
Yeah.

803
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,193
So you knew?

804
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,195
I heard not too long ago.

805
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,613
What's this all about?

806
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:30,326
I think it’s better to hear it
from Takahashi directly.

807
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,914
-Is he quitting?
-Oh, no.

808
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,334
Isomura, do you have a moment?

809
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,339
This is creeping me out.
Are you sure it's okay?

810
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,300
Yes. I think you should know

811
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,802
about this too, Isomura.

812
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,053
Really?

813
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,305
Isomura.

814
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,475
Huh?

815
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,773
Well…

816
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,235
My thoughts are still
a bit jumbled right now.

817
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,694
I know how you feel.

818
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:08,823
Although I've gotten
pretty used to it now.

819
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,199
I see.

820
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,412
Then, the person mentioned earlier

821
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,288
who was really fast…

822
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,832
I think that was Takahashi.

823
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:20,751
I see now.

824
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,254
Wow.

825
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,964
Now

826
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:28,968
all that's left is how
to handle the TV coverage.

827
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,761
Oh.

828
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,764
Isomura told them a lot of things.

829
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:35,099
Yeah.

830
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,267
As of now,

831
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:39,103
Onodera being an alien who is really fast

832
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,938
is the narrative that's been concocted.

833
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,773
Right.

834
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,152
-He has absolutely nothing to do with it.
-Yeah.

835
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,532
If we told the truth to the both of you
when the 10 yen coin first showed up,

836
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,160
we wouldn't have to be dealing
with this mess now.

837
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,498
Don't worry. I'll deal with this somehow.

838
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:11,510
This is Okuda, the manager.

839
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:14,805
This is with regard
to your interviews earlier,

840
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:17,516
I checked with the hotel owner,

841
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,061
and he does not want us to be featured.

842
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,982
I sincerely apologize
for any inconvenience this may cause.

843
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,569
Thank you for your understanding.

844
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,198
Did it work out?

845
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,951
They're disappointed,
but they understood our position.

846
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,870
That's great.

847
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:42,374
<i>In the end, we successfully</i>
<i>cleared up suspicion about Onodera</i>

848
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,544
<i>and avoided the TV coverage.</i>

849
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,924
<i>I'm glad we decided to come clean</i>
<i>to the manager.</i>

850
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,259
<i>All that's left is Yumi.</i>

851
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:56,764
See you.

852
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,141
You're leaving already?

853
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,393
Yeah, it's 6 p.m.

854
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,853
-Is it?
-Yeah.

855
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,980
Did you hear from Takahashi?

856
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,732
Oh, yeah.

857
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,068
He's amazing, isn't he?

858
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,445
-He showed you?
-Yeah, I'm surprised.

859
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,489
I didn't know he could do that.

860
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,325
You can't tell anyone, okay?

861
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,661
Of course, I'll keep this a secret.

862
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,829
Well, I'll be off.

863
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,499
-See you.
-Thanks for your hard work.

864
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,545
-She doesn't seem to be affected much.
-Right?

865
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,131
How did it go?

866
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,049
Terribly.

867
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:34,051
What do you mean?

868
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,179
That's a lot of coins you bent.

869
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,847
I bent them all.

870
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,934
She kept taking them out,
one after another.

871
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,271
That's rough.

872
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:47,648
Even after all that, she refused

873
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,191
to believe I'm an alien.

874
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,276
What?

875
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:53,237
-But you bent so many coins.
-I know, right?

876
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,864
What about the side-to-side jumps?

877
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:57,366
I showed her that too.

878
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:59,660
I'd say I did twice as many as before.

879
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,829
-That didn't convince her either?
-No.

880
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,416
She was impressed at my abilities,

881
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,126
but when it came to my being an alien,

882
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,836
she wouldn't listen at all.

883
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,464
But she's the one
who loves that kind of talk the most,

884
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,509
and she was also the one
who theorized Onodera was an alien.

885
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,803
At the end of the day,

886
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,847
people love urban legends

887
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,391
when it's just for fun,

888
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,435
but when they’re brought up
in a serious way,

889
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,811
it’s hard to take in.

890
00:43:27,229 --> 00:43:30,899
But she blabbered on and on
with the TV crew.

891
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,861
It seems she was just exaggerating
on purpose

892
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:35,195
to get some attention.

893
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,864
Oh.

894
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,533
She was just trying to predict
what the production team wanted.

895
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,618
Most likely.

896
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:44,079
Wait,

897
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,165
then how does she

898
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,542
view you now?

899
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,085
Well, to her…

900
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,964
I'm probably just a middle-aged man
with amazing physical abilities.

901
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,592
I see.

902
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,720
I think that's an understatement.

903
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,890
Well, it seems she'll keep this a secret,

904
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,725
so I'm fine with that.

905
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,477
Right.

906
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,146
<i>For the time being,</i>
<i>it looks like the secret is safe.</i>

907
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:10,439
Are you okay?

908
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,232
Yeah.

909
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,526
MONT BLANC

910
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,570
Sorry to keep you waiting.
This way, please.

911
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:20,908
It's kinda wild that even after all that,
she still doesn't believe it.

912
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,495
Right? We've been trying to not let
the cat out of the bag,

913
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,539
but she wouldn't believe it
even though he told her the truth.

914
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,751
I mean, we found it hard
to believe as well.

915
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,337
-The TV crew didn't probe further?
-Yeah.

916
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,422
They said they'd find other topics
and left.

917
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,050
-So that's why they came to our hospital.
-What?

918
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:41,762
The crew from <i>Monday Late Show</i> came
to our hospital for a shoot the other day.

919
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,763
-What?
-Why?

920
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:43,889
Didn't I say?

921
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,892
My timing for retrieving
the urine sample cups is next level.

922
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:49,978
-Yeah, you did.
-They asked me to demonstrate,

923
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,563
so I performed it live on camera.

924
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,856
What?

925
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,901
-Are they going to show it on TV?
-I think there's this segment

926
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,695
that features local craftsmen.
The cashier at Ichiyama will appear too.

927
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,447
That's cool! When does it air?

928
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,449
Probably next month.

929
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,493
I'm excited for it. I'll definitely watch.

930
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,203
By the way, one of the staff

931
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:08,205
interviewed me
for another show previously.

932
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,833
-Oh, the one about Mount Fuji?
-Yeah.

933
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,835
My part for that was completely cut,

934
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:14,545
so this time I told them
I'd better be featured.

935
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:16,046
Do you think it'll happen?

936
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:18,966
I'm feeling confident this time.
They had good reactions.

937
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:23,720
<i>It's all about getting used to it.</i>
<i>From their age and aura.</i>

938
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,972
<i>This person seems quick,</i>

939
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,224
<i>or this person may need more time.</i>
<i>I can tell.</i>

940
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,811
<i>If there was an international</i>
<i>urine sample cup retrieval contest,</i>

941
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,813
<i>I think I'd do quite well.</i>

942
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,190
This concludes

943
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:39,820
the investigation regarding the craftsmen
living at the base of Mount Fuji.

944
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,788
THE INVESTIGATION REGARDING THE CRAFTSMEN
LIVING AT THE BASE OF MOUNT FUJI.

945
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,416
I don't think we can air this…

946
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:53,917
