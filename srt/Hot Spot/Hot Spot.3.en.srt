<i>At the base of Mount Fuji,</i>

<i>in Fuji-Asada, Yamanashi, Kiyomi Endou</i>

4
00:00:10,301 --> 00:00:11,803
<i>and her childhood friends, Hazuki</i>

5
00:00:11,886 --> 00:00:14,389
<i>and Minami, come to discover the secret</i>

6
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,599
<i>of Kiyomi's colleague, Kousuke Takahashi.</i>

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:20,061
-Mr. Takahashi, I heard you're an alien!
-Well.

8
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,272
Yeah. Please absolutely do not
tell anyone.

9
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,108
<i>The trio get Takahashi</i>
<i>to use his abilities</i>

10
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:28,445
<i>to solve their trivial</i>
<i>day-to-day problems.</i>

11
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:31,156
Will you be okay from the side effects?

12
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,867
I'll recover to some extent
if I soak in the hotel's hot spring.

13
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,662
<i>The minerals in our hotel's hot spring</i>
<i>are pretty unique.</i>

14
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:39,706
<i>They can help heal our bodies.</i>

15
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,876
<i>Their daily lives, which have begun</i>
<i>to change,</i>

16
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,961
<i>are set in motion again today.</i>

17
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,977
<i>I'm running for the position of mayor</i>
<i>in Fuji-Asada city.</i>

18
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>My name is Masako Umemoto.</i>

By the way,

27
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,350
17 consecutive zero-balance checkouts.
A new record!

28
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,768
What? That's impressive!

29
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:42,811
I know, right?

30
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,856
<i>A zero-balance checkout</i>
<i>means there are no additional charges,</i>

31

<i>and guests only need to return</i>

32
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,654
<i>On busy mornings at the front desk,</i>

33
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,614
<i>it's particularly appreciated.</i>

34
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,908
What was our previous best?

35
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,785
I think it was 11.

36
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,995
Then we've come a long way.

37
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,331
It makes me want to try aiming for 20.

38
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,791
Yeah.

39
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,502
<i>It was pure luck anyway,</i>
<i>so that goal is impossible.</i>

41
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:15,593
See you.

42
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,929
-Thanks for your work.
-Thanks for your work.

43
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,686
Isn't Onodera really quick?

44
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,603
Yeah.

45
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:27,313
Was he changing at a crazy speed?

46
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,317
But with the tie and buttons
on his uniform, isn't it difficult?

47
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,445
Maybe he started stripping
the moment he walked in there.

48
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:35,405
That could be it.

49
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,740
Otherwise there's no way
he'd make it out that quick.

50
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,078
Or maybe there's a chance
that Onodera is an alien.

51
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,581
Onodera, really?

52
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:45,832
He's a little private, no?

53
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:49,002
Right. His personal life is a mystery.

54
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,545
-He can't tell us anything.
-Because he's an alien?

55
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:51,880
Yeah.

56
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:55,425
<i>I’m not sure if Onodera is an alien</i>
<i>or not,</i>

57
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,262
<i>but the alien I know takes forever</i>
<i>to leave</i>

58
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,889

Ms. Matsuda.
You have one unsettled bill for breakfast.

71
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,803
-We kindly ask for your payment.
-Yes.

72
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:44,432
That will be 950 yen.

73
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,977
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

74
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,229
Thank you.

75
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,107
We hope you stay with us again.

76
00:03:59,072 --> 00:03:59,906
Streak broken.

77
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,242
It's fine. Let's just move on.

78
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,619
<i>It was pure luck anyway,</i>

79
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,789
<i>so no point in saying, "It's fine,"</i>
<i>or, "Let’s just move on."</i>

00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,917
ONE UNREAD MESSAGE FROM MINAMI

81
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:16,005
DO YOU TWO HAVE THE DAY OFF ON SATURDAY?

82
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:20,635
YEP!

83
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:23,972
I HAVE WORK IN THE MORNING,

84
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:27,433
BUT I'M FREE IN THE AFTERNOON.

85
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:32,313
WANNA MEET FOR LUNCH?

86
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,440
SURE!

87
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,318
<i>This group that's been dead for ages</i>

88
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,446
<i>has started buzzing with activity lately.</i>

89
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,364
YEAH!

90
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,282
OKAY.

91
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:44,284
Please enjoy your stay.

92
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,536
-I'll help with the luggage.
-Thank you.

93
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,623
This way to the elevator.

94
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,420
Please go ahead.

95
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,673
When guests get on or off the elevator,
we use a hand to keep the door open.

96
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,425
But isn't that actually pointless?

97
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,342
What do you mean?

98
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,928
It's not as if the door is going
to close immediately.

99
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:05,972
I mean, there's a button for "open."

100
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,308
Yeah, we can just press the button.

101
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,185
If we do that, the door won't close.

102
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,855
Using our hands is precisely
what makes the door close.

103
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:17,734
It almost feels like we're doing it
on purpose to make it close, doesn’t it?

104
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,527
-A self-made drama.
-Right?

105
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:21,571
I wonder what the point of that is?

106
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:22,697
Maybe it's for show?

107
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,157
What do you mean?

108
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,410
Like, instead of pressing the open button,
we hold the door with our hands

109
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,787
to look like we’re putting
ourselves on the line.

110
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,041
We do look more involved than if we just
pressed the button and waited.

111
00:05:33,124 --> 00:05:34,459
Yeah, it's like,

112
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,210
"'Don't worry about me, just hurry up!"

113
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:37,920
Ah, the whole self-sacrificing vibe.

114
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,422
"Don’t worry about my hand!"

115
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,506
It's all an act.

116
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,424
Yep.

117
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,051
But it's really pointless.

118
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,469
Right.

119
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,636
It really is.

120
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,430
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

121
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:49,724
<i>At the end of the day, we do it</i>
<i>because it's our job.</i>

122
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:52,518
<i>So this conversation</i>
<i>is what's actually pointless.</i>

123
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,854
That's all I have.

124
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,148
Sorry.

125
00:05:58,232 --> 00:05:59,817
I'll be heading off now.

126
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,861
Thank you for your work.

127
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:03,362
I'll go get some supplies.

128
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,739
-Okay.
-Yes.

129
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,372
Are you going to use the hot spring today?

130
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,665
Of course.

131
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,000
It must be tough.

132
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,543
Well, it feels good,

133
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:19,754
and soaking in itself is not hard at all.

134
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,047
I see.

135
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,466
I do agree that hot springs are soothing.

136
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,759
Yeah.

137
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,679
In my case, compared to what most people
feel when they're soaking in a hot spring,

138
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,972
it feels a lot better for me.

139
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,641
Really?

140
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,559
We think it's pretty soothing.

141
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,394
I'm sure you do,

142
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,439
but it's on a whole other level for me.

143
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:41,317
I get warm to the core when I soak
in the hot springs.

144
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,694
That's a given.

145
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,780
In my case, my body fully recovers.

146
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,117
When we soak in the hot springs,
it feels like we're coming back to life.

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,743
Yeah, but that's being figurative.

148
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm literally being healed.

149
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,664
I'm being serious, we really feel
like we're being revived.

150
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,415
<i>The debate we're having</i>

151
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,752
<i>is probably more pointless</i>
<i>than the one about elevators.</i>

152
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,087
My body literally heals.

00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,881
CHANGING ROOM

154
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,133
See you.

155
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,176
Thanks for your work.

156
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:15,309
<i>By the way, Yumi is the quickest</i>
<i>when it comes to leaving work.</i>

157
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,814
Oh, did you know that Yumi

158
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,316
suspected you were an alien?

159
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,985
How did that happen?

160
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,238
Because you don’t share anything
about your personal life.

161
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,197
Huh?

162
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,991
But then again,

163
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:33,327
she suspected Onodera
for the same reason too.

164
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,163
I think you should be fine.

165
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,374
-You didn't tell her, right?
-No.

166
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,543
The only ones that know are Minapuu
and Hacchi.

167
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,295
Well, okay then.

168
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:46,340
Speaking of which, I'm having lunch
with them again this Saturday.

169
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,802
-Is that so? You three meet often, huh?
-Yes!

170
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,722
We've been meeting once a week lately.

171
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,682
Sometimes, even twice a week.

172
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:57,059
You three are close.

173
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,562
I also have close friends
back in my hometown,

174
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,564
but we don't meet often.

175
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,942
But you were the catalyst

176
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,694
for us to start meeting up again.

177
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,112
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

178
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,072
Do you want to join?

179
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,784
-Me?
-Yeah. Only if it's convenient, of course.

180
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,287
I'll let you know.

181
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,164
Okay.

182
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,416
No need to force yourself, okay?

183
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,251
I know. I'll try to make it.

184
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,962
<i>"I'll try to make it,"</i>

185
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,465
<i>is usually what people say</i>
<i>when they probably won't show up.</i>

186
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:28,549
I'll try to make it.

187
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,761
<i>But when Takahashi says it,</i>
<i>you can bet he'll show up.</i>

188
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:34,472
Do you have a shift on Saturday?

189
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,474
Nope.

190
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:38,476
But I'm not sure if I have other plans.

191
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,144
Do you have anything on that day?

192
00:08:40,227 --> 00:08:43,438
Not sure, I'll need to check.
I'll get back to you.

193
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,236
<i>Yamanashi is home to a bunch</i>
<i>of interesting folks.</i>

194
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,779
-<i>Folks who are known nationwide.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

195
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,282
Your lunch money is on the table.

196
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,867
Thanks, Mom.

197
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,910
When will you be back?

198
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,079
-I think it'll be a little late.
-Okay.

199
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,705
-What about dinner?
-I'll be back for it.

200
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:00,873
Okay.

201
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,041
What about you, Mom?

202
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,460
I don't have work today,

203
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,421
so I'm going shopping
and having lunch with my friends.

204
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,715
You three have been
meeting up a lot lately.

205
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,883
Yeah.

206
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,761
-Enjoy yourself.
-Thanks.

207
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,096
I'm leaving now.

208
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,722
See you.

209
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,601
<i>Takahashi is probably going</i>
<i>to be there as well,</i>

210
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,272
<i>but I didn't feel like explaining it all,</i>
<i>so I left that part out.</i>

211
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:27,775
I watched <i>E.T.</i>

212
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,277
Oh, really? It's great, no?

213
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,361
Yeah.

214
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,571
What was <i>E.T.</i> again?

215
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,157
It's a movie about an alien,
like Mr. Takahashi.

216
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,242
Oh, right.

217
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,243
So you watched it?

218
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:38,786
Yeah, on a streaming platform.

219
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,580
Are you able to do something like that?

220
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,081
Like what?

221
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:42,999
Making your finger glow.

222
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,667
Of course not. I have normal fingers.

223
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,502
-The alien in it has glowing fingers?
-Yep.

224
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,588
It can also heal injuries.

225
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,131
That's cool.

226
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,924
-Can't you heal injuries too?
-No.

227
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,301
Then what about

228
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,845
not an injury, but a spot on your face?
Can you remove that?

229
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:57,138
I'd love that. A glow… poof!

230
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,681
You can do that with lasers.

231
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,224
My fingers don't glow to begin with.

232
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:01,726
Then, what about

233
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,103
making bicycles fly?

234
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,187
That's impossible.

235
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,981
-The bicycles fly?
-Yeah.

236
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,065
In the final scene,

237
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,943
the protagonist flees with E.T.
in the front basket.

238
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:11,861
From who?

239
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,030
From government agents.

240
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,824
In the end, the bicycle,
along with the protagonist and E.T. flies.

241
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,993
-Through the sky.
-That's cool.

242
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,412
It's a famous scene. But reality is harsh.

243
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,830
But if the government was after you,

244
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,749
wouldn't you fly as well?

245
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,585
Like a fight-or-flight response?

246
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,046
That's not going to happen.
I'll just outrun them on foot.

247
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,213
I see.

248
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:32,798
I don't even want to be chased.

249
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:34,884
-That's a pity.
-What do you mean by that?

250
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,345
This is totally unrelated,

251
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,597
but do you have any friends,
Mr. Takahashi?

252
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,681
Huh?

253
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,726
Of course. Lots.
What makes you think otherwise?

254
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,603
You've been joining us lately.

255
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,188
That's because I was invited.

256
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,857
Yeah, but you join us regularly.

257
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,276
Why do you have to put it like that?

258
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,279
-So I'm not supposed to join?
-Of course I don't mean that.

259
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,948
But it's because you join us so regularly
that I'm worried.

260
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,534
I'm fine. I have friends,

261
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,036
and it just so happens I'm free.

262
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,621
Then it's okay.

263
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,291
What are your friends like, Takahashi?

264
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:11,671
Like anyone else's.
Old classmates and so on.

265
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,047
I have a lot of friends.

266
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,174
Are there any aliens among them?

267
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:17,009
I was born and raised here,

268
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,219
so I only know humans.

269
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,512
Right.

270
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,430
Which middle school did you go to?

271
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,224
-North.
-Really?

272
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,434
What do you do with your friends?

273
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,896
We go drinking and so on.

274
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:31,232
What things do you guys talk about?

275
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,234
Mostly just stories from back then.

276
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,819
It's like us then.

277
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,986
I guess.

278
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,073
Do your friends know you're an alien?

279
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,575
They don't. I've been hiding it from them.

280
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,120
-Not a single person knows?
-Nope.

281
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,414
So we're really the only ones who know?

282
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,499
Yeah, that's why
you really mustn't tell anyone.

283
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:51,919
To live for more than 50 years
with your true identity hidden

284
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,879
must have been quite difficult, surely?

285
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,673
Right.

286
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,051
I'd say it's more lonely
than it is difficult.

287
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,177
Lonely?

288
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,640
I had this group of close friends
back in elementary school.

289
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,517
We were just like you three.

290
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,313
We could talk about anything,
that's how close we were.

291
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,858
But I'm the only one who was hiding
a secret from them,

292
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:17,820
so I've always felt guilty somehow,

293
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:18,863
or like

294
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,199
I was the only one being left out.

295
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,201
Did you think about telling them?

296
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,580
I considered telling just them in secret,

297
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,497
but my parents

298
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,293
always told me never to tell them,

299
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,545
so I never did.

300
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,046
I see.

301
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,091
Wait, you bought this?

302
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,344
Yeah, the condition of the screen
was really bad.

303
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,679
It sure was.

304
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,098
It's like the opening from <i>Lupin III.</i>

305
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,349
What do you mean?

306
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,601
Oh, you haven't seen it?

307
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,854
There's a scene where a bullet
causes the screen to crack all over.

308
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,397
Hey.

309
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,233
Why did you ask
if you’re not even interested?

310
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,819
Sorry. But we were listening.

311
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,988
Yeah, right. You were talking about Lupin.

312
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,490
Don't you know it, Takahashi?

313
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:04,366
Yeah, the part where his name gets shot.

314
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,077
Yes. That's how bad her phone was.

315
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,162
I see.

316
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,915
Come to think of it, your phone is always
in bad shape, isn't it?

317
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,502
You're right. Since the flip phone era,
her phones have always ended up like that.

318
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,212
-Right?
-No screen protector?

319
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,797
-I don't use one.
-Why not?

320
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,299
I used to have one.

321
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,426
But having to put them on
every time is bothersome

322
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,136
and I can't even do it perfectly.

323
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,638
You can just do it at a store.

324
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,097
But then you have to pay.

325
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,724
That can't be helped.

326
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,808
It's kind of a waste, no?

327
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,810
Better than having
a cracked screen, surely?

328
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:35,773
If I'm going to pay, I might as well
just be careful not to break it.

329
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,358
But it's obviously not working out.

330
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,484
Yeah.

331
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,945
Aren't there stores that do it for free?

332
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:41,987
-Do they exist?
-Yeah.

333
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,072
I can find one for you.

334
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:45,699
-But isn't it a bit awkward to ask?
-Why?

335
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,118
The staff are basically working
for nothing.

336
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,328
You're right.

337
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,996
I feel a bit bad for them.

338
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,041
You know, sometimes you stress
over the weirdest things.

339
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,877
Your screen is going
to crack again, though.

340
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,923
That's why I bought one this time.

341
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,633
-You didn't ask them to do it for you?
-No.

342
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,261
By the way, I met Aya-nyan at the store.

343
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,637
Really? How's she doing now?

344
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,721
She's doing fine.

345
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,890
-That's great.
-I want to see her.

346
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,350
I should have invited her.

347
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:13,310
Yeah.

348
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,731
Sorry, we're talking about
another of our classmates.

349
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:18,899
I see.

350
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,026
Mr. Takahashi.

351
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,194
Could you do it for me?

352
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,029
Huh, me?

353
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,281
I'm really bad at this.

354
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,365
I'm bad at it too.

355
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,742
Can't you do it with just a touch
using your abilities?

356
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,707
Listen, I get it.

357
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,627
I can kinda understand wanting
to catch a thief or something.

358
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,964
And just so you know, I shouldn't have
helped with the volleyball,

359
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,341
but you seemed to have a lot going on,

360
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,594
and it was my alma mater,

361
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,139
so I thought I'd be flexible
and help you out.

362
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,516
But asking me to apply a screen protector?

363
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,476
Come on, you can get it done at a store!

364
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,061
But I have to pay for it.

365
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,230
Then go to a store that does it for free.

366
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,232
Like I said, I feel bad for them.

367
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,693
Oh, so you feel bad asking the staff,
but not me?

368
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,112
Fine. I'll pay for your drink
so please do it for me.

369
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,615
That's a bit cheap.
It costs at least 1,000 yen at stores.

370
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:10,534
-Well, that's for stores.
-Huh?

371
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:13,537
In your case, Mr. Takahashi,
I'm factoring in the sushi we bought

372
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,582
after the volleyball case the other day,
which was roughly 3,400 yen,

373
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,626
so in terms of labor and price parity,

374
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,003
-I thought a drink would cover it.
-Stop being stingy.

375
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,171
I've had enough.

376
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,172
You started it.

377
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,174
Okay, fine.

378
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,216
You don't have to pay.

379
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,885
-You mean it?
-Only this time.

380
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:29,178
Thanks.

381
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,977
Which abilities do you want me to use?

382
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,731
I don't know, maybe the ability
to concentrate?

383
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,484
Oh, and the ability to have good
hand dexterity?

384
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,444
-Right.
-Dexterity?

385
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:48,614
Okay, I'll give it a try.

386
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,865
Sorry for the trouble.

387
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,200
Welcome!

388
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,576
Hello.

389
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,161
-It's Aya-nyan.
-Aya-nyan!

390
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,579
Hey, what's up?

391
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,289
It's been a while.

392
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,624
Yeah.

393
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,459
-We were having lunch together.
-Really?

394
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:02,711
Hi, Ricchan.

395
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,338
What do you say, Ritsu?

396
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:05,381
Hello.

397
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:07,716
How old are you now?

398
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,345
Oh, five years old!

399
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,681
Do you remember Auntie Kiyomi?

400
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,475
You don't remember, huh.

401
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,644
-Are you meeting up with someone?
-No.

402
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,270
-Then why don't you join us?
-Oh.

403
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,897
-Is it okay?
-Yeah.

404
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,441
-Okay then.
-Excuse me, could you add two more seats?

405
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:25,526
-Sure.
-Is that okay?

406
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,610
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

407
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,987
MONT BLANC

408
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,113
This is random, okay?

409
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,322
What is it?

410
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,534
Earlier you asked
if Ricchan remembers you.

411
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,494
I haven't seen her in a while.

412
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,079
When I heard that,

413
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:39,581
I was like, "Wait, you're that old?"

414
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:41,834
You really think so? Well,

415
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:42,960
I'm already over 40.

416
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:44,795
Yeah, logically I understand that,

417
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:47,131
but I still kinda see you
as your middle-school self.

418
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,465
I get what you're saying.

419
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:50,926
Also, I was like,
‘Wait, doesn't that make us old too?’"

420
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,636
We're definitely at that age.

421
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,514
But everyone has their own way
of looking at it,

422
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,016
so there’s no need to dwell on it.

423
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,309
Yeah, you can still
see yourself as "Miss."

424
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,562
But as soon as Kiichan said
"auntie" back there,

425
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,105
it was like we all became aunties.

426
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,397
Because we're the same age?

427
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,692
I guess I branded you all
with the "auntie" label.

428
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,361
And if I still insist I'm not old then,
isn't it just painful?

429
00:17:09,444 --> 00:17:10,945
-Yeah.
-Right.

430
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,575
Hold on. You’re acting
like this has nothing to do with you,

431
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:16,868
but you’re in the same boat
as the rest of us, Hacchi.

432
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,954
What? I'm still in my thirties.

433
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,998
Nah, we're all old.

434
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,416
Didn't you say it was all
about perspective?

435
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,127
She branded us all with the label.

436
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,088
So I've become an early auntie?

437
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,965
Huh? You're just the right age.

438
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,426
It's done.

439
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,137
Thank you so much!

440
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,055
It looks clean.

441
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,723
There are no air bubbles at all.

442
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,725
-Right?
-It went unexpectedly well.

443
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,977
You're really good at this.

444
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,939
This is my senior
from work, Mr. Takahashi.

445
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,608
Hello, I'm Takahashi.

446
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,777
Nice to meet you, I'm Ayano Okada.

447
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,778
He did a great job.

448
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,488
Yeah, I saw. It's so impressive.

449
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,406
Mr. Takahashi is really good
with his hands.

450
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,283
-Is that so?
-Not at all.

451
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:01,914
Um… if you wouldn't mind.

452
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,417
Could you do it for me as well?

453
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,169
Pardon?

454
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,755
I also just bought a screen protector

455
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,048
and I haven't applied it.

456
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:13,383
-I see.
-Yeah.

457
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,052
You didn't ask the staff to do it?

458
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,887
It feels kinda a waste to pay for it…

459
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,888
It's expensive, right?

460
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,766
Yeah, and when I do it myself,
it's always full of air bubbles.

461
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,935
-It happens.
-Right?

462
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,354
Would it be okay?

463
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,690
-I can do it.
-Really?

464
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,109
Thank you!

465
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,652
Sorry about this.

466
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,364
Your parfait is here.

467
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,492
It looks cute!

468
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,662
Okay, wipe your hands.

469
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,706
When did people start calling you
"uncle," Mr. Takahashi?

470
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,624
What?

471
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,210
Don't people get called
uncles or aunties in their forties?

472
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,295
I've always looked older than my age

473
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,881
so I've been called "uncle"
since my twenties.

474
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,758
Oh, you're one of those cases.

475
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,265
Thank you so much.
Wow, it's really nicely done!

476
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:02,432
He's really good at it.

477
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,227
Why are you so good at this?

478
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,356
I don't know, I just
have a knack for it, I guess.

479
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,440
But it's really good.

480
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,569
You think so?

481
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,697
Didn't you used to work
at one of those stores?

482
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,412
Oh, right. A little.

483
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,706
So that's why.

484
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,333
You're amazing. Thanks once again.

485
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,418
Don't mention it.

486
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,800
Thank you…

487
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,469
There's no way you can just do that.

488
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:41,263
What about it?

489
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:42,347
Did you see what he did?

490
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:43,932
Sorry, what?

491
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,685
My phone almost fell,

492
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,313
and he caught it like it was nothing.
Kiichan, did you see?

493
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,355
Yeah, I saw.

494
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,940
His reflexes are next level, right?

495
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,525
-Yeah.
-Usually it would be impossible.

496
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,443
Yeah.

497
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,571
-Right?
-Well, I guess it just kinda happened.

498
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,865
Yeah…

499
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,785
-He used to play table tennis.
-Huh?

500
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,204
-Table tennis?
-Yeah.

501
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,873
Weren't you in the table tennis club
in middle school?

502
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,709
Oh, yes, that's right.

503
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,294
So that's why.

504
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,338
It was really amazing.
The motion was so smooth.

505
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:15,839
Yeah.

506
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,718
Oh, the bathroom? We'll be right back.

507
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,470
Okay.

508
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,013
Off to the bathroom you go.

509
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,103
Um…

510
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,356
there are a few things I'd like
to point out.

511
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:33,315
What are they?

512
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,693
First, wasn't my introduction
a little late?

513
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,487
Was it?

514
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,155
It was.

515
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,242
You kept talking and treated me
like I was invisible.

516
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,953
I guess we kinda did. Sorry.

517
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,412
That's not all.

518
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,915
I got to know her name beforehand

519
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,167
so I knew she was your classmate

520
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,419
but I'm sure she was clueless
as to who I was.

521
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,714
"Who's this applying a screen protector
like nobody's business?"

522
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,840
Sorry.

523
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,342
This is just the start.

524
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,677
Okay, what else?

525
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,637
The way you twisted
my background was weird.

526
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,554
Really?

527
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:08,392
What's with having worked at those stores
and being in the table tennis club?

528
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,436
I thought I'd cover for you.

529
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,647
I was surprised when you said
that out of nowhere.

530
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,191
But she bought the story.

531
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:17,859
In that case, it's okay.

532
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,196
But if you think about it, isn't it weird?

533
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,323
That some random old guy is with you.

534
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,159
I properly introduced you as my senior.

535
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,288
Yeah, but what business
does that senior have

536
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,125
at a gathering of childhood friends?

537
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,170
Now that I think about it,
it's a little unnatural.

538
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,256
-Right?
-I see.

539
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,091
We didn't really explain that to her.

540
00:21:41,174 --> 00:21:42,009
Yeah.

541
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,510
But it's not

542
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,429
like we can tell her he's an alien.

543
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,596
That's the hard part.

544
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,016
How should we explain it
without talking about that?

545
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,143
-Right?
-It was because of that.

546
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,603
We had to lie about his background.

547
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,105
I see.

548
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,943
Maybe we can tell Aya-nyan about it.

549
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,903
-That I'm an alien?
-Yeah.

550
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,449
-She's trustworthy. You can rest assured.
-Yeah.

551
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,117
-She's tight-lipped.
-Yeah.

552
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,785
If anything, she's the most trustworthy.

553
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:10,871
No, we can't tell her.

554
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,873
But if we hide it from her,

555
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:15,459
then it's hard to explain

556
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:18,712
why you're having lunch with us.

557
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,922
As of now, you're a random old guy

558
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,675
who's weirdly good at applying
screen protectors and has great reflexes.

559
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,886
Weirdly? You were the one
who made me do it.

560
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,471
But that's how she'd see it.

561
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,140
That may be true.

562
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:34,186
But I don't think I can handle
any more people knowing about my identity.

563
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,520
I see.

564
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,649
Let's meet up again, Aya-nyan.

565
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:42,194
-Yeah, let's.
-See you.

566
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:43,528
See you.

567
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,197
Bye.

568
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,114
See you.

569
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,657
See you.

570
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,950
Bye.

571
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,495
-There.
-Thanks.

572
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,663
Okay!

573
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,501
-Oh, that's not good.
-Woah.

574
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,502
-What?
-Yikes.

575
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,003
Oh-oh.

576
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,713
-What?
-Huh?

577
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,714
Woah!

578
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,092
-I've done it now.
-Are you okay?

579
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,052
It's totally stuck.

580
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,929
What should I do?

581
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,639
Think we can lift the car up?

582
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,724
I think it'd be tough.

583
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,851
Right.

584
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,395
I think I'll get a contractor to come.

585
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,939
-Um…
-Yeah.

586
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,859
Why don't we have a go at lifting it?

587
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:24,402
What?

588
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,863
With so many of us,
we might have a chance.

589
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,615
What?

590
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:30,367
-I don't think so.
-Yeah, there's no way.

591
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,410
It's fine. I can call a contractor.

592
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:35,580
But there's no harm in trying, right?

593
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,626
-Right. Let's give it a try.
-Yeah.

594
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,461
It's fine.

595
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,839
Let's just try. If we fail,
you can call the contractor.

596
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,048
-Yeah.
-It's settled.

597
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,343
-Sorry about this.
-Don't mention it.

598
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,595
We'll need you to hold the wheel

599
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,389
while we lift and shift the car.

600
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,723
Okay.

601
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,399
Will you be okay on your own?

602
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:03,775
Yeah.

603
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,528
-Here I go.
-Okay.

604
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,863
MONT BLANC

605
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,532
Ready, set, go!

606
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:16,371
Oh!

607
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,415
-Come on!.
-We're almost there!

608
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,625
We're doing it!

609
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,472
We did it!

610
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,726
Thanks!

611
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,227
You guys are amazing!

612
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,396
With four people,
we're surprisingly strong.

613
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,148
I was a former volleyball player, so.

614
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,275
Takahashi is strong too despite his looks.

615
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,276
Really?

616
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,944
But you played table tennis, right?

617
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:51,990
You did judo in high school, no?

618
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,241
Huh?

619
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,409
You were in the judo club?

620
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,661
Yeah.

621
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,330
So that's why.

622
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,623
-Yeah.
-He's amazing.

623
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:00,540
Glad I could help.

624
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,626
Thank you for everything today.

625
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,002
-Don't mention it.
-Thank you.

626
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,004
Drive safely, Aya-nyan!

627
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,298
-Yeah.
-Stay safe.

628
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,384
-Did you all see that?
-See what?

629
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,803
You didn't notice?

630
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,931
That taxi has the SOS alert on.

631
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,140
Really?

632
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,350
What's the SOS alert?

633
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,477
Um, you know,

634
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,522
in cases of emergencies or robberies,
taxis have this alert.

635
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,482
Is that so?

636
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,608
This.

637
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,567
TAXI SOS ALERT

638
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,526
WHAT TO DO

639
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,322
Hold on, that's bad, isn't it?

640
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,490
What should we do?

641
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,325
But the taxi is already gone.

642
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,743
But for those kind of things,

643
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,704
usually the company would be notified
if the alert is on.

644
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,622
Really?

645
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,874
I'm not sure, but I feel like
that might be the case.

646
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,876
But shouldn't we call the police
just in case?

647
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,378
Yeah.

648
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:47,754
Hold on.

649
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:50,966
Wait in the car for a bit, okay?

650
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,217
Sorry!

651
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,604
Hello there.

652
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,400
Let's see…

653
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:42,058
<i>This is killing me.</i>
<i>I shouldn't have kept going.</i>

654
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,077
-Ah, this brings back memories.
-The younger generation does it too?

655
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,581
-Yeah, most likely.
-Really?

656
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,124
-That's cool.
-Yeah.

657
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,294
Hold on.

658
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,340
Yes?

659
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,009
Your SOS alert is on.

660
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:17,886
What?

661
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,388
You're right.

662
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,726
Sorry about that.
I accidentally switched it on.

663
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,519
-I figured.
-Sorry about that.

664
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:28,855
-Thanks for going out of your way!
-Don't mention it.

665
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,035
I'm in the parking lot of Mont Blanc.

666
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:46,081
-The taxi was headed to…
-Oh?

667
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,502
Just a few minutes ago--

668
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:53,963
-The issue was resolved.
-Really?

669
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,298
Huh?

670
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,885
After verifying, it seems the driver
accidentally switched it on.

671
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:01,012
Is that so?

672
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,556
Sorry, it seems the issue
has been resolved.

673
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,559
Yes. I'm sorry for any trouble
I may have brought about.

674
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,687
How were you able to do that?

675
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:12,565
I ran to check it out

676
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:16,319
and it just stopped around the corner
at the end of the street.

677
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,946
Really?

678
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,740
The driver was chatting happily
with the passenger.

679
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:23,368
That's a relief.

680
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:24,953
Wait.

681
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,248
Did you really just go and come back
in such a short span of time?

682
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,334
Well, yeah.

683
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,838
It happened to stop on the corner
over there.

684
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,383
But that's still quite the distance, no?

685
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,390
You were in the track and field club
in university, right?

686
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,642
Yeah.

687
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:50,603
So distances like that

688
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,021
are not a problem for me.

689
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:54,941
I see.

690
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,486
You're a real all-rounder.

691
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,948
Well, yeah.

692
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:07,328
-Let's do something about the drain.
-Yeah.

693
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,621
-I'll do it.
-It's fine,

694
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,706
I'll do it.

695
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,040
We can all help.

696
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,130
Let's keep in touch.

697
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,047
Let's have lunch again.

698
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:19,716
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

699
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,842
See you.

700
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,469
Bye.

701
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,016
Sorry for all of this.

702
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,226
It's fine. I'm helping people for real.

703
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,771
Isn't applying screen protectors
helping people too?

704
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,814
Others can do that.
It doesn't have to be me.

705
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:38,026
But was the case earlier
really just a false alarm?

706
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,569
-Huh?.
-What do you mean?

707
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:43,031
I thought maybe it was really
a taxi robbery,

708
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,617
but because Aya-nyan was there,
he chose to lie.

709
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,076
Is that true?

710
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,080
Well… yeah.

711
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:51,998
What?

712
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,750
So it was really a taxi robbery?

713
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,293
-Yeah.
-Figured.

714
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,878
Well, it's not

715
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,547
like I could really say
I stopped a taxi robbery

716
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,007
in such a short time, right?

717
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,217
Yeah.

718
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,427
What happened, exactly?

719
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,264
Um, well, there were two shady guys

720
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,682
who had knives with them.

721
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:10,892
Were you okay then?

722
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,019
-Yeah.
-So you fought them off?

723
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,189
It's not so much that, it's more
like I took the knives from them,

724
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,567
held them down,
and had the driver call the police.

725
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,194
What? That's so cool!

726
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:22,862
It's not that big of a deal.

727
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,948
That's amazing. You're like a hero.

728
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,241
You're exaggerating.

729
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,159
You did something great

730
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,995
but can't claim credit for it.
Isn't it kind of sad?

731
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,456
Right. It was the same
in the previous case.

732
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,043
I don’t do things like this

733
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,045
for recognition.

734
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,842
Like with the screen protector earlier,
that wasn’t something only I could do.

735
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,427
But with stuff like this,

736
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,514
if I didn’t step in,
it could’ve turned out really bad, right?

737
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:53,685
As someone with these unique abilities,

738
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,270
I just can’t ignore it.

739
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,523
<i>After everything I went through,</i>

740
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:00,775
<i>I think I deserve to tell</i>
<i>at least this small lie.</i>

741
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,693
It's really nothing.

742
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,987
Come to think of it,
you used quite a few abilities.

743
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,614
-Will you be okay with the side effects?
-Oh, right.

744
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,869
I'll have a fever, and it's likely going
to take a toll on my legs and hips,

745
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:13,705
but I'll be okay if I use the hot spring
on the night shift tomorrow.

746
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,206
That's good, then.

747
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,833
Tomorrow?

748
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,628
I don't recall you having a shift.

749
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,796
No way.

750
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,839
What?

751
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,883
It's me and Eri for night shift.

752
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:25,967
Really?

753
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,218
See?

754
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,847
-It's true, I don't have a shift.
-Right?

755
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,725
Sorry, can I switch with you?

756
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,937
No, asking at this point
is cutting it a little close.

757
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,731
If you're okay with it, then we're good.

758
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:42,567
People will think I bailed out last minute

759
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,235
and it won't leave a good impression.

760
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,653
No, I don't mind switching.

761
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,323
Even if you're fine with it,

762
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,492
bailing on a shift last minute is going
to leave a bad impression.

763
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,579
Weren't you idolizing me
as a hero just a while ago?

764
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,998
That and this are two separate matters.

765
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,083
If I bail, I'll lose my pay too.

766
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:00,752
-Right.
-Okay, fine.

767
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:02,545
I'll pay you for that shift.

768
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,047
What?

769
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,133
But I don't want to bail last minute.

770
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,428
Come on, I'm begging you.

771
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,306
If I don't soak in it tomorrow,
my body will be in bad shape.

772
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,516
Can't you soak in the hot spring
and then leave?

773
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,769
-Just use the hot spring?
-Yeah.

774
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:21,397
-You have a point.
-I can't use the hot spring on my day off.

775
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,357
Just don't get caught.

776
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,776
-What?
-You've got a point.

777
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,195
I can help with that.

778
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:28,863
What?

779
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:35,411
LAKE HOTEL

780
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,767
WELCOME
LAKE HOTEL

781
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,979
We need more guests.

782
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,897
Right?

783
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,400
But you know…

784
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:07,443
Oh, Eri. Have you had ice cream?

785
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,195
-We have ice cream?
-Yeah, in the fridge.

786
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,280
She brought it for everyone.

787
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,825
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

788
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:16,577
That's so nice of you.
Have you had some, manager?

789
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,162
Yeah, it was great.

790
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,039
-What about you, Kiyomi?
-I haven't had it yet.

791
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:20,957
Why not?

792
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,875
I'm full.

793
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,043
I see.

794
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,714
We're not that busy now.
You can go get some ice cream.

795
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,881
Should I?

796
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,384
-Go ahead.
-Don't mind if I do.

797
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:38,808
Oh, manager. If you'd like,
you can have my portion too.

798
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:39,934
What?

799
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,436
Are you sure?

800
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,645
Yeah, I'm full.

801
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,107
Right. Maybe I will.

802
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,401
Go ahead.

803
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,028
I’ll take you up on that offer.

804
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:52,822
-Please cover us for a bit.
-Okay.

805
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,157
Enjoy.

806
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,794
Now's your chance.

807
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:09,422
-Where's the manager?
-He's in the back office. Eri too.

808
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,382
I'll get going now.

809
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,175
If you put it like that,
it sure seems pointless.

810
00:34:54,257 --> 00:34:55,342
Right?

811
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:57,637
It's all an act.

812
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,263
To be honest, yeah.

813
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,850
Speaking of which,
receipts are also unnecessarily long.

814
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,644
Ah, the receipt problem.

815
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:06,062
Guests complain too sometimes.

816
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,231
-Really?
-Yes, sometimes.

817
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,941
That's to be expected.

818
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,361
Also, some people say
it doesn't need to be put in an envelope.

819
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:16,197
Yeah. They just stuff it
into their wallets.

820
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,615
Right?

821
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:19,242
Is that also an act on our part?

822
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,619
Yeah, it's to show politeness.

823
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,037
A pointless appeal.

824
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,747
You're right.

825
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,748
Can we stop doing it?

826
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,917
Of course not.

827
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,918
Why is that?

828
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:31,045
Well, if we didn’t put them in envelopes,

829
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,464
some would say,
"Why didn’t you put it in an envelope?"

830
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:35,133
Do people like that exist?

831
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:37,051
I think so.

832
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,138
Besides, other hotels do it
as a matter of course,

833
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,639
so if it was only us who didn't,

834
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,308
people would say,
"This hotel just hands over your receipt."

835
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:46,811
What a hassle.

836
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,187
Yeah.

837
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:54,485
Um, is it okay if I have a bath break?

838
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,611
Oh?

839
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,446
That's pretty rare.

840
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,700
Well, you know, I ate two portions
of ice cream.

841
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,952
-I feel a bit chilly now.
-Sorry.

842
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,162
It's all my fault.

843
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,581
Don't worry about it.
It was tasty after all.

844
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,499
Why don't I get you some warm tea?

845
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,085
It's fine. I'll be done in a flash.

846
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,212
How about you grab some tea first?

847
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,756
If you're still chilly,
you can go for a bath.

848
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:18,759
-Hmm.
-Okay?

849
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,969
I'll go make it now.

850
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,429
On second thought, it's fine.

851
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,638
I'll be done in a flash.

852
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,098
-See you.
-Yeah.

853
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,437
<i>This is bad.</i>

854
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,958
-If you'd like, I can buy a hand warmer.
-Oh.

855
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:54,253
It's okay. I just need to have a dip
in the hot spring.

856
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,424
<i>This is real bad.</i>

857
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,176
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

858
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:06,015
MEN

859
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,260
MEN

860
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,983
REQUESTS TO OUR GUESTS

861
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:08,953
MANAGER WENT IN. LEAVE NOW.

862
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,038
<i>He seems to have read the message.</i>

863
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,165
<i>Will it be okay?</i>

864
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:46,490
PLEASE SHARE THE WASHING AREA WITH OTHERS

865
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:19,959
Huh?

866
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:27,675
What?

867
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,721
What the…

868
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,181
BATH

869
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,922
Welcome back.

870
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,798
-Welcome back.
-I'm back.

871
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,425
I feel all warmed up now.

872
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,010
That's great.

873
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,428
It's been a while,

874
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,764
and it's really soothing.
I feel so refreshed.

875
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,229
By the way, in the bath

876
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,649
I found boxers.

877
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:10,277
What? That's dirty. Whose are they?

878
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:13,030
Perhaps they belong to one of the guests.

879
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:14,740
Yeah, likely.

880
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,617
But why would they be in the bath?

881
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,202
You've got a point.

882
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,703
That's strange.

883
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:22,331
Shall I keep them as lost and found,
just in case?

884
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,707
Yeah.

885
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,395
It's the cheapest after all.

886
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,150
-Oh, take a look at this!
-What is it?

887
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,652
It's from that show the other day.

888
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,195
Did you watch it?

889
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,197
-See? Fifty-three yen.
-That's dirt cheap.

890
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,323
Right?

891
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,577
And when it's on sale,

892
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,246
it becomes a whopping thirty-six yen!

893
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:04,498
-That cheap?
-I know right?

894
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,208
But you surprised me.

895
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,544
Sorry, I got too excited.

896
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,629
I'm freezing!

897
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,056
Takahashi?

898
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,560
What are you doing here?

899
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:27,271
Well, er…

900
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,772
I happened to pass by here.

901
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,568
Wait, you're soaked.

902
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:36,447
I was speeding on my bike

903
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,198
and hit a puddle.

904
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,950
A puddle?

905
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,286
Are you okay?

906
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,165
Could I borrow a towel?

907
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,667
-Of course.
-Really?

908
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,878
But shouldn't you dry your clothes too?

909
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,880
You're right.

910
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:54,340
Wanna use the bath?

911
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,592
Can I?

912
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,093
I'm going to dry your clothes.

913
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:01,013
-So feel free to come on in.
-Thank you.

914
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,222
Come on.

915
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:04,683
-Sorry about this.
-Will you be okay?

916
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,479
Please come on in.

917
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,564
Takahashi.

918
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,359
Good evening.

919
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:15,361
-I'll bring you a towel.
-Thank you.

920
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:17,821
What happened?

921
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,698
It's a long story.

922
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,368
Are you okay?

923
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,370
Yeah.

924
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:44,348
<i>When we soak in the hot springs,</i>

925
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:46,225
it feels like we're coming back to life.

926
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,601
That's being figurative.

927
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,977
I'm literally being healed.

928
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:51,855
<i>I'm being serious, we really feel</i>
<i>like we're being revived.</i>

929
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:57,319
<i>I'm definitely the one</i>
<i>who's being brought back to life.</i>

930
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,249
I feel refreshed.

931
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,259
You're not going to bathe?

932
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:21,677
No, I'm okay.

933
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,036
