00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,338
PREVIOUSLY…

2
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:06,965
<i>At the base of Mount Fuji,</i>

3
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,510
<i>in Fuji-Asada, Kiyomi Endou</i>

4
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:13,012
<i>gets her alien colleague,</i>
<i>Kousuke Takahashi, to use his abilities</i>

5
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,765
<i>to solve her trivial day-to-day problems.</i>

6
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,979
<i>The only others who know this secret</i>
<i>are her childhood friends Hazuki</i>

7
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,063
<i>and Minami.</i>

8
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,815
You guys are amazing!

9
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:24,774
Takahashi is strong.

10
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,694
-Will you be okay with the side effects?
-I'll be fine after using the hot spring.

11
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:30,697
<i>The minerals in our hotel's hot spring</i>
<i>are pretty unique.</i>

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,866
<i>They can help heal our bodies.</i>

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,369
<i>And today, yet another incident awaits.</i>

14
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:37,662
<i>It's a long story.</i>

15
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:44,377
That was delicious.

16
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,553
<i>I'm working the night shift today,</i>

17
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,431
<i>so I'll do housework until then.</i>

18
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>I finally got around to washing my uniform</i>
<i>after a week!</i>

19
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,022
<i>Like I mentioned before,</i>

20
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>this isn’t unusual at all.</i>

21
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,862
<i>If we're going to compare,</i>
<i>Eri does it every ten days!</i>

22
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,616
<i>We can't wait to test</i>
<i>the suction capabilities in the studio.</i>

23
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>Allow me to present</i>

24
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>the cleaning robot Bodis,</i>

25
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:21,164
<i>which boasts a unique brush</i>
<i>that adjusts seamlessly to any floor,</i>

26
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,083
<i>picking up everything</i>
<i>from large pieces of trash to hair</i>

27
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:25,710
<i>-and even fine dust.</i>
<i>-We do our cleaning by hand.</i>

28
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,963
<i>The fact that you can even</i>
<i>put one of those down to begin with</i>

29
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:32,300
<i>means your house</i>
<i>is already pretty spacious and tidy.</i>

30
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,803
<i>What I really need is a robot</i>
<i>that can clean up enough</i>

31
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,597
<i>to make room for one of those</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,645
<i>The weather is cold today,</i>
<i>so I'm driving to work.</i>

33
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,316
I'm freezing.

34
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,736
TOFU

35
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>Do we still have dressing?</i>

36
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,127
<i>No, I don't think we've got much left.</i>

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,548
<i>Wait.</i>

38
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,135
<i>Didn't I buy one last time</i>
<i>with the same idea in mind?</i>

39
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,761
PERILLA DRESSING

40
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,307
<i>No. I was going to buy it,</i>

41
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:23,935
<i>but I followed the same train of thought,</i>
<i>and when I got home,</i>

42
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:26,312
<i>there really wasn't much dressing left.</i>

43
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:32,527
No, hold on.

44
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,614
<i>I totally did the same thing last time</i>

45
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,325
<i>and came home with dressing,</i>
<i>even though I didn't need to buy it.</i>

46
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,786
<i>I’m pretty sure I’ve got a couple</i>
<i>of bottles piling up in the fridge now.</i>

47
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,414
PERILLA DRESSING

48
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,542
<i>Yeah, I'm confident this time.</i>

49
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,335
Kiichan!

50
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,921
Oh, hey, Aya-nyan!

51
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,423
-On your day off today?
-Nope.

52
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,925
-I'm working the night shift from 4 p.m.
-That's rough.

53
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,802
I'll take care of this.

54
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:02,765
<i>By the way,</i>

55
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,935
<i>we're intentionally queuing up</i>
<i>in the longer line,</i>

56
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,813
<i>and there's a reason for that.</i>

57
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,650
<i>-It's because…</i>
-2,357 yen in total, please.

58
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,778
<i>-She's on this register.</i>
-Thank you!

59
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,324
<i>For about ten years now,</i>
<i>she's been working as a cashier.</i>

60
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,826
<i>Her speed and precision are top-notch</i>

61
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,162
<i>compared to everyone else</i>
<i>in this supermarket.</i>

62
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,372
<i>Incidentally,</i>

63
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,083
<i>if the difference in the number</i>
<i>of people in line is five or fewer,</i>

64
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,128
<i>I always pick her register.</i>

65
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,505
Oh right. I went to Nonchan's store
the other day.

66
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,508
-Really? How's she doing?
-She's doing fine.

67
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,428
She was complaining about
how we don't visit her at all.

68
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,265
-Let's visit her someday
-Yes, let's.

69
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,476
Thank you for waiting.

70
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,853
Welcome!

71
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:56,194
<i>I've decided next time I'll only choose</i>
<i>her if the difference is three or fewer.</i>

72
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,782
-You came here by car?
-Yeah.

73
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:03,534
-What about you, Aya-nyan?
-I came by bike today.

74
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:04,994
-Really?
-Yeah.

75
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,081
My husband bought an e-bike,
but he's not using it at all.

76
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,500
-So I thought I'd ride it instead.
-I see.

77
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,670
-Which one is it?
-I parked it around here.

78
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,463
I was thinking of adding a baby se--

79
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:19,050
-Huh?
-What's wrong?

80
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,469
-It's gone.
-What?

81
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,513
Seriously?

82
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,474
This has to be a joke.

83
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,727
This is terrible.

84
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,604
Huh?

85
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,565
Should we report this to the police?

86
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,445
Sorry to bother you before your shift.

87
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,073
Don't mention it. It's on my way to work.

88
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:46,494
This is so frustrating.
I've only ridden the bike twice.

89
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,955
Oh, I feel you.

90
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:52,208
Seriously, taking someone else's stuff.

91
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,002
-That's just pathetic.
-I agree.

92
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:58,548
For real, trash like that are just a waste
of space in the world.

93
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,761
<i>It's been a while since I heard</i>

94
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:06,556
<i>such strong language.</i>

95
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,602
<i>By the way, the one I heard it from last</i>
<i>was Aya-nyan too.</i>

96
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:18,026
<i>That sharp tongue of hers</i>
<i>is still as impressive as ever!</i>

97
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:22,030
<i>I’d love to record it and listen</i>
<i>when I’m feeling stressed.</i>

98
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,782
<i>I want a best-of collection</i>
<i>of all her best lines so far.</i>

99
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,784
…you piece of shit.

100
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:27,785
Sure.

101
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:31,331
But first, you want
to get your bike back, right?

102
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,875
Yeah, I guess, but it seems impossible.

103
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,918
Really?

104
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,296
<i>Despite what I said,</i>

105
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,591
<i>I kinda feel that way too.</i>

106
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,551
<i>Hold on.</i>

107
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,222
<i>Takahashi may be able to find it.</i>

108
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,433
This is so annoying.

109
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:54,228
At this point, I don’t even care
about the bike. I just want to at least

110
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,022
dunk his head in the mud.

111
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,483
That's how I'd feel too.

112
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,360
<i>I'm not sure about the last part,</i>

113
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,821
<i>but I think we might be able</i>
<i>to get her bike back.</i>

114
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,033
But I think it's still too early
to give up.

115
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,910
-Dunking him in the mud?
-No, your bike.

116
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,870
-Oh, that?
-Yeah.

117
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,665
-You think we'll be able to find it?
-Of course.

118
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,584
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

119
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,421
But seriously, this piece of crap
is getting under my skin.

120
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,221
YAMANASHI PREFECTURE
FUJI-ASADA POLICE STATION

121
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,599
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

122
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:32,767
Sorry I can't be with you.

123
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,769
-It's fine. Have a good night shift.
-Thanks.

124
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,729
-Bye.
-Bye.

125
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,523
<i>It just so happens</i>

126
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,359
<i>I'll be seeing Takahashi</i>
<i>on my shift today. I'll try asking him.</i>

127
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:55,623
<i>If memory serves me right…</i>

128
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,793
<i>there's dressing in the fridge.</i>

129
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,588
<i>Or rather, I really hope there is.</i>

130
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,138
CONDIMENTS

131
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,431
<i>There's hardly any left.</i>

132
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:14,308
TOFU

133
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,602
TOFU

134
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,562
<i>But I have tofu.</i>

135
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,692
<i>Damn it.</i>

136
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,418
<i>I get to work at 3:45 p.m.</i>

137
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,505
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you for your work.

138
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:48,134
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

139
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,385
CHANGING ROOM

140
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:52,930
I'll take up the luggage.

141
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,807
Understood.

142
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,769
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

143
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,646
<i>Every year around this time,</i>

144
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,316
<i>a few students leave home to study</i>

145
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,401
-<i>for their exams at hotels.</i>
-It's going to be cold today,

146
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,527
so please keep yourself warm.

147
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:09,614
-Thank you.
-<i>He’s been staying here for a week.</i>

148
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,242
<i>It seems tomorrow is the day of his exam.</i>

149
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,121
Tomorrow is the day.

150
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,457
-You mean the exam?
-Yeah.

151
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,543
If he passes, he'll become my junior.

152
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,753
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

153
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:26,005
-Which university did you go to?
-Kaibun University.

154
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:29,592
-Really?
-Yep.

155
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,178
Which university did you go to, again?

156
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,929
Yamanashi. School of Medicine.

157
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:37,183
Wait, you went to Yamanashi University?

158
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:38,476
Yes, the school of medicine.

159
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:41,229
What? Then you're really smart.

160
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,188
It's not that big of a deal.

161
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:46,275
Wait. Could it be you used your abilities?

162
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,237
-Well, yeah.
-Hey, that's not fair.

163
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,156
Huh? They're my abilities.

164
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,617
I guess you're right.

165
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,663
But you didn't become a doctor even
though you went to the school of medicine?

166
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,248
I dropped out.

167
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,833
What? That's a waste. Why did you do that?

168
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,587
At the end of the day, even if I boost
my intelligence and cram for an exam,

169
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:09,423
I can't keep up
that level of smarts forever.

170
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,592
That's just how it is, I guess.

171
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,803
Sure, I might see a boost
in knowledge temporarily,

172
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:17,014
but I can't rely
on my abilities every day.

173
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,308
-Your body can't handle it?
-Yeah.

174
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,351
And my scalp too.

175
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,229
-Scalp?
-Yeah, so it seems.

176
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:25,856
If I enhance my brain,

177
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,608
the side effect is hair loss.

178
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,318
Really?

179
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,612
That's why my hair's a little thin, right?

180
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,952
Right.

181
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:39,245
I'm not naturally bald, okay?

182
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,871
What?

183
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,582
I'm like this because of my abilities.

184
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,668
Oh, that's what you meant.

185
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,504
But doesn't soaking
in the hot spring help?

186
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,715
That's what I thought too,

187
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,758
but in this case, it just doesn't work.

188
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,802
Is that so?

189
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,305
I think it's like how humans

190
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,808
can naturally heal from injuries
and sickness,

191
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,185
but hair thinning doesn't work that way.

192
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,440
I see. The power of the hot spring
doesn't apply to balding.

193
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:08,524
I think so.

194
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,359
Wow, okay.

195
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,780
<i>Perhaps it happened sooner than expected</i>

196
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,699
<i>and even if he didn't use his abilities,</i>

197
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,536
<i>he was going to lose his hair naturally.</i>
<i>That's what crossed my mind,</i>

198
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,040
<i>but I decided to stop probing</i>
<i>further into it.</i>

199
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:25,499
Hold up.

200
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,337
You're thinking I was going to go bald
anyway, except it came ahead of schedule.

201
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:32,673
-No.
-You definitely were.

202
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,884
Then what's with that awkward silence?

203
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:37,470
Hey.

204
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,223
-It did cross my mind a little.
-I knew it.

205
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,769
Can you not see me that way?

206
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:46,395
It's really not the case.

207
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,272
Sorry.

208
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,819
Oh right. Takahashi.

209
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,197
I've got something to ask you.

210
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,615
-What is it?
-Um.

211
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,076
Do you remember Aya-nyan
from the other day?

212
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,161
Yeah. What about her?

213
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:04,288
Well, to tell the truth,

214
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,667
her new e-bike got stolen.

215
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,585
Okay?

216
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:14,423
So I'm wondering if you could help find it
with your sense of smell, like before?

217
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,300
There's no way I can do that.

218
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,511
But you managed to find the TV last time.

219
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,472
That was because
it was still within the hotel area.

220
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:23,724
You don't even know
where the bike is now, do you?

221
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,393
You've got a point.

222
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:28,396
I'd need to sniff all around town.

223
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,816
-I see.
-Who knows how long that would take.

224
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:34,110
My sense of smell
will be badly damaged if I do that.

225
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,612
Right.

226
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:39,115
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid this time
I can't be of help.

227
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,118
I understand.

228
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,833
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

229
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,585
-Are you heading out?
-Yeah, just for a little while.

230
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,213
It's cold today, so please take care
to avoid catching a cold.

231
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,882
Yes, I figured.
That's why I layered up quite a bit.

232
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,510
-Then you're good to go.
-Oh, Mr. Murakami.

233
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,720
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon, Yumi, dear.

234
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,889
-Are you heading out?
-Just for a bit.

235
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,141
Do you need a taxi?

236
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,268
No, it's only walking distance away.

237
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:10,271
Okay. Please be careful on your way there.

238
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,606
Thank you. Well, I'll be off now.

239
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,233
-See you.
-See you.

240
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,324
What do you guys think
Mr. Murakami does for a living?

241
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,202
Hmm, let me think.

242
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,831
I think he's pretty much retired from work

243
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:32,918
and is just enjoying a laid-back life now.

244
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,378
Right.

245
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,381
<i>But living in a hotel</i>

246
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,675
<i>means he's got</i>
<i>quite a lot of savings, right?</i>

247
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,094
<i>Well, he must have</i>
<i>a decent amount saved up.</i>

248
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:45,890
<i>Maybe he used to be</i>
<i>the chairman of some big company</i>

249
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:49,768
<i>and now he's just</i>
<i>enjoying a fancy retirement.</i>

250
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:53,731
If that's true, then shouldn't he stay
somewhere more luxurious?

251
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,651
-Maybe it's intentional.
-What do you mean?

252
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,986
Well,

253
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:01,906
he's probably stayed at huge resort hotels

254
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,408
more times than he could count,

255
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,994
so maybe a place like this
feels more relaxing for him.

256
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,871
Really?

257
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:12,708
So, I tend to be quite friendly
toward Mr. Murakami.

258
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,919
-Why is that?
-You know why.

259
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:17,505
Sometimes it's good to be nice
to a wealthy elderly person.

260
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,175
-It can really pay off later.
-Yeah.

261
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:26,055
That's why I’m treating Mr. Murakami
better than anyone else here at the hotel.

262
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,348
I see.

263
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:32,228
<i>By the way, I'm also friendly</i>
<i>toward Mr. Murakami.</i>

264
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,272
<i>And I mean, more than anyone else</i>
<i>at this hotel.</i>

265
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,610
<i>I'm not going to let his inheritance fall</i>
<i>into anyone else's hands.</i>

266
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,007
Come to think of it, are you able
to sense spirits, Takahashi?

267
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,425
-Sense spirits?
-Yes.

268
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,426
Why do you ask?

269
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,972
Apparently hotel corner rooms
are haunted by spirits.

270
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,765
Oh, that story?

271
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:10,683
Really?

272
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,477
-Yes, a guest told me the other day.
-I see.

273
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,982
-Isn't that just superstition?
-Right?

274
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,610
Speaking of which,
do you believe in aliens?

275
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,446
Aliens? Why?

276
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,866
I'm not sure if spirits do exist,

277
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:28,617
but I'm confident aliens do.

278
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,743
-Is that so?
-Yes.

279
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,204
Are you an alien, Takahashi?

280
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,040
Me?

281
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,835
No, I'm not.

282
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,004
I kinda expected that.

283
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,298
Why did you think I was?

284
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,133
Well, you're kinda

285
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,094
mysterious, because you don’t share much
about your personal life.

286
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,679
-You think so?
-Yes.

287
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,639
I'm not trying to be secretive at all.

288
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,225
-Really?
-If you'd like, ask me anything.

289
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,643
What are your hobbies?

290
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,811
-My hobbies?
-Yes.

291
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,772
<i>Gunpla</i> and radio-controlled cars.

292
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,024
I see.

293
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,775
Do you want to see my collection?

294
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,319
Yes.

295
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,571
-Wait, let me think.
-What's the matter?

296
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,948
My shift is over.

297
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,034
It won't take long
just to have a look, right?

298
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,954
-Yeah. I'll have a look then.
-This is a rare chance.

299
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,205
-See?
-Okay.

300
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,333
These are the ones.

301
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,627
What's this?

302
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,421
It's <i>ν Gundam</i>, which appeared
in <i>Char's Counterattack</i>.

303
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,089
That's cool.

304
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,966
Did you assemble it yourself?

305
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,843
Of course. I painted it myself too.

306
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,970
-Wow, that's awesome!
-Yeah.

307
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:33,349
-Okay, I'll be going now.
-Huh?

308
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,601
-See you.
-Thank you for your work.

309
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,062
She's not interested in it at all.

310
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,357
Did you make this with your abilities?

311
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,900
No, I did this with my own hands.

312
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,818
Really?

313
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,405
Wait, did I hear that right?

314
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:50,282
What?

315
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,451
That means using your abilities

316
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,495
doesn't count
as doing it by yourself, right?

317
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,415
No.
Of course using my abilities would count,

318
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:02,378
but it's kinda, you know.

319
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,131
Don't worry about it.

320
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,719
But honestly, am I giving off alien vibes?

321
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:14,014
I don't think so.

322
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,850
Right? I'm glad to hear that.

323
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:21,021
I try to keep my posture straight here,
you know?

324
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,942
Right.

325
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:27,361
<i>I think that mindset</i>

326
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,488
<i>has more to do</i>
<i>with being a good hotel worker</i>

327
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:33,659
-<i>than with seeming like an alien.</i>
-Me slouching and not is very different.

328
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,746
I was really worried, you know?

329
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,999
LAKE HOTEL

330
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,376
<i>After midnight…</i>

331
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,503
-I switched off the lights.
-Okay.

332
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,715
<i>We focus mainly on administrative tasks.</i>

333
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,264
Oh, Takahashi. You can take a break.

334
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,141
I'll do the administrative tasks.

335
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,019
Are you sure?
Then I'll take you up on that offer.

336
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,484
<i>Lately, I’ve been relying on him a lot,</i>

337
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,238
<i>and I genuinely want to repay him</i>
<i>by cutting him some slack,</i>

338
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:14,491
<i>but when he accepted it so quickly,</i>

339
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,036
<i>I was a bit annoyed.</i>

340
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,621
<i>By the way,</i>

341
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:23,916
<i>the workload of front desk staff at night</i>
<i>is a lot more than you might expect.</i>

342
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:28,797
<i>Just so you know, the bulk</i>
<i>of it is room assignments.</i>

343
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,049
<i>Room assignments</i>

344
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,635
<i>involve deciding where to place guests</i>
<i>according to their reservations,</i>

345
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,513
<i>and it can be surprisingly tricky.</i>

346
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:38,390
<i>That's because</i>

347
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,976
<i>it’s not just about putting people</i>
<i>in any available room.</i>

348
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:44,938
<i>The guests' profiles, how many</i>
<i>are in their party, their requests,</i>

349
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,399
<i>and overall efficiency.</i>
<i>I have to consider all that</i>

350
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,235
<i>when assigning the rooms.</i>

351
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,322
<i>For instance, you might want</i>
<i>to keep a group on the same floor</i>

352
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,825
<i>or put regulars on higher floors.</i>

353
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,411
<i>It’s like solving a puzzle!</i>

354
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:02,915
I'll get it.

355
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,294
Hello, front desk speaking.

356
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:12,508
I'm really sorry. I'll replace it shortly.
Please wait a moment.

357
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:19,807
Seems like the light bulb in the bathroom
of room 301 is dead.

358
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,935
-I'm going to go replace it.
-Sorry about that. Go ahead.

359
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,106
-Wait.
-What?

360
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,360
I was thinking, isn't room 301
a corner room?

361
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,486
What?

362
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,698
That conversation? Spirits don't exist.
It's just superstition.

363
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,341
Welcome back.

364
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,388
Um, Endou.

365
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,889
Yes?

366
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,350
I'm sorry, but could you go replace
the light bulb?

367
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:05,519
Huh? Didn't you go replace it?

368
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,772
Well, there's a spirit in there.

369
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,691
You're joking.

370
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,986
No, I'm serious. As I was about to step
into the bathroom,

371
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:16,655
I saw a face looking in
from the bedroom window.

372
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,408
Really?

373
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:23,036
-There wasn't anyone outside or anything?
-It's the third floor, so there's no way.

374
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,288
You're right.

375
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:28,292
I didn't bring it up earlier,

376
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,836
but I can actually sense spirits well.

377
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,546
Is that so?

378
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,550
I'm sorry. I'll do the room assignments,
so can you replace the light bulb?

379
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,304
Okay, I'll go.

380
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,514
-Sorry about this.
-It's okay.

381
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:43,849
-I'm counting on you.
-Okay.

382
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,809
Sorry.

383
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,776
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

384
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,112
-I'm so sorry about this.
-It's fine.

385
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,281
I'm sorry for any trouble
that may have caused you.

386
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,033
It's okay.

387
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,331
I'll be taking my leave.

388
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,379
<i>There really was one.</i>

389
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:18,926
I'm back.

390
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:20,469
Thanks.

391
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,805
Did you see it?

392
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,350
-Yeah.
-Right?

393
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:28,101
But it's not a spirit.

394
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,895
What?

395
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,774
Yes?

396
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,653
-Sorry for disturbing you again.
-Huh?

397
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,408
-May I come in for a moment?
-Why?

398
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,536
Pardon me, but I need to check something.

399
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:59,216
Do you have a companion with you?

400
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,969
What? Um, no.

401
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,471
My friend just dropped by.

402
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,473
I see.

403
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,311
I hate to say this,

404
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,273
but only one guest is currently checked in
under this room.

405
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,650
Either your companion will need
to leave immediately

406
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,487
or we'll have to charge an additional fee
for the extra guest.

407
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,115
Is that how it works?

408
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,828
I'll pay the additional fee.

409
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,288
Very well.

410
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,790
So what I saw was just a reflection?

411
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,585
Yeah. So I got him
to pay the additional fee.

412
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,962
I see.

413
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,800
-Sorry you had to deal with that.
-It's fine.

414
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,805
You may continue.

415
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,850
Okay.

416
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,186
<i>I was the one who offered</i>
<i>to do the administrative tasks,</i>

417
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,356
<i>so I was planning to take over</i>
<i>without being asked,</i>

418
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,735
<i>but when he urges me to take over,</i>

419
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,820
<i>it kinda annoys me.</i>

420
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,536
<i>He hardly made any progress.</i>

421
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,668
I didn't know
that aliens could sense spirits well.

422
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,420
Of course we can.

423
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,006
Well, I just assumed

424
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,884
aliens and spirits couldn't coexist.

425
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,343
-Coexist?
-Yeah.

426
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,097
Aren't aliens and spirits
completely different concepts?

427
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,558
In movies, yeah.

428
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,227
Now that I think about it,

429
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:37,272
can aliens ever get possessed?

430
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,607
Of course.

431
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,736
No way a spirit would have the nerve

432
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,697
to possess an alien, don’t you think?

433
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,408
Well, if the alien looks almost identical
to a human,

434
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,368
the spirit may possess
the alien unknowingly.

435
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,746
You've got a point.

436
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,168
-Endou.
-Yes?

437
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:01,171
It's kinda hard to say this
in this situation, but…

438
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,092
Oh, your break?

439
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,137
Well, I'm sort of taking a break already,

440
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,848
but I have to soak in the hot spring.

441
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,685
Right. I understand, you can go ahead.

442
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,479
Thanks.

443
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:24,778
<i>He possesses some abilities</i>
<i>that are beyond human,</i>

444
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,781
<i>but if I’m being honest,</i>
<i>as front desk staff,</i>

445
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,658
<i>I think he's worse than a human.</i>

446
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,575
Thank you.

447
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,833
MEN

448
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,879
Okay, all done.

449
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:49,886
Hello, front desk speaking.

450
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,390
I'm really sorry to hear that.

451
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,685
Could you please wait a moment
while I investigate the cause?

452
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,397
Thank you.

453
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,279
<i>Apparently, the shower in the room</i>
<i>isn't producing any hot water.</i>

454
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,081
Hello?

455
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,086
What? Hold on.

456
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:25,255
It’s probably an issue
with the water heater,

457
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,007
so all the rooms will have a problem.

458
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,050
<i>Right.</i>

459
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,553
No hot water here, either.

460
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,389
I'll come back for the time being.

461
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:45,942
How is it?

462
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,778
I just reset it, but it's still the same,

463
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,114
so the water heater might be broken.

464
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,408
I see.

465
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,327
Could be due to the heavy rain
the other day.

466
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,204
I think so.

467
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,081
In any case, I'll let the manager know.

468
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,458
Could you contact a contractor?

469
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:02,918
Okay.

470
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,051
No one is picking up.
I'm getting automated messages.

471
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,302
Same for the manager.

472
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,512
Maybe he already went to bed.

473
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,307
I'll drop him a message for now.

474
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,770
Hello, front desk speaking.

475
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,981
Yes? I'm really sorry about that.

476
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:27,234
I'll promptly investigate and take action,

477
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,444
so please bear with us for a moment.
Excuse me.

478
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:34,074
We're in a bind.

479
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,702
Takahashi.

480
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,163
Can't you repair the water heater?

481
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,290
-Me?
-With your abilities.

482
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,626
Repairing machinery is out of my league.

483
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,379
But you said you were able
to boost your knowledge.

484
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,381
Even if I become smarter,
I can't fix things.

485
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,341
You were able to assemble things
like <i>gunpla.</i>

486
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,385
If complicated things
like <i>gunpla</i> are possible…

487
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,720
No, <i>gunpla</i> and water heaters
are completely different.

488
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,556
I see.

489
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,309
I know nothing of water heaters
to begin with, so it's no use.

490
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,311
Okay.

491
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,316
What's the matter?

492
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,528
So you just need the knowledge, right?

493
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,282
I guess. But I don't have it.

494
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:17,867
What are you doing?

495
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:21,246
I'm trying to find a manual of some sort.

496
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,790
-For the water heater?
-Yeah.

497
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:27,168
Manuals have everything
you need to know, right?

498
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,004
You're not wrong, but…

499
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,422
I found it.

500
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:34,426
Please have a look.

501
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:37,095
Even if I read this,
there's no way I can fix it.

502
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,430
I'm an amateur.

503
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,228
Oh, it's the manager.

504
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,733
Hello? Yes.

505
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,693
That's right.

506
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,529
We've already received five calls so far.

507
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,449
Yes.

508
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,162
Really? Okay.

509
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:03,955
Thank you.

510
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,251
He's on his way here, anyway.

511
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,961
I see.

512
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:12,380
It's past his working hours.
I feel bad for him.

513
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,215
Yeah.

514
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:19,429
Even if you won't read it all,
can't you just take a look?

515
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:21,639
Reading it is really not going to help.

516
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:24,851
Why not just give it a shot
and see if it works?

517
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,437
You won't be able to use your abilities
if the manager's here.

518
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,898
Otherwise,

519
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,483
if we don't do anything,

520
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,194
it's going to be a hassle dealing
with the complaints tomorrow.

521
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,238
-You've got a point, but…
-And worst-case scenario.

522
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,657
We might have to refund half the price
of all the rooms.

523
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:43,578
It's tough enough to keep the hotel going.
If that happens,

524
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,372
it'll be a real disaster.

525
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:49,209
So can't you at least take a look?

526
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,753
No, you see…

527
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,172
As I said earlier,

528
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:58,718
the side effect of enhancing my brain
is that I'll go bald.

529
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,099
I see how it is now.

530
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,435
Is that why you're reluctant to do this?

531
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,731
It’s not that I don’t want to do it,
but the cost is just too high.

532
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,236
You want to avoid going bald at all costs?

533
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,196
If I can, that is.

534
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,323
My hair won't grow back, after all.

535
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,369
If this was a life-or-death situation,

536
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:28,123
I’d totally be willing to lose some hair
to help out,

537
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:32,460
but a broken water heater?
That’s just a common hotel issue.

538
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:37,006
Losing my hair over that?
No, that’s a bit much.

539
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,476
-Thank you for waiting.
-Hey,

540
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,186
The shower has no hot water.

541
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,938
I'm sorry about that.

542
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,858
We're currently looking into it,
so just bear with us for a moment.

543
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,609
How long exactly do we have to wait?

544
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:59,070
I'm really sorry.

545
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,239
I'm afraid we don’t have
a clear estimate yet,

546
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,283
so I can’t give you a definite time.

547
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,702
So we may not even be able to shower?

548
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,911
Oh, no.

549
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:09,164
I'm currently investigating it,
and once I identify--

550
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,790
I've heard enough of that.

551
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,667
I won't be able to shower, is that right?

552
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:16,504
Yes, for the time being…

553
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:19,424
Are you for real?
And you still charged me extra.

554
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,510
This is absurd.
Your facilities aren't even working well

555
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,804
and yet you dare take money for two.

556
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,015
Think you can look down on us?

557
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,683
Not at all.

558
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,602
Then what are you going to do?

559
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,646
Could you give us a little more time?

560
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,648
How long exactly
is what I've been asking you.

561
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,861
Could you give us an hour or--

562
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:43,031
That's too long.
Thirty minutes is the most I can give.

563
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,285
I understand.

564
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,704
-Please wait for 30 minutes.
-In return.

565
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,957
If the issue isn't resolved
after 30 minutes, I demand a full refund.

566
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,959
I regret to inform you

567
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,004
that in the event
the water heater malfunctions,

568
00:29:58,087 --> 00:29:59,798
only a partial refund is given.

569
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:03,468
What a joke. You want to keep half
of the money when there's no hot water?

570
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:05,595
What gives you the right?

571
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,601
I understand.

572
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,437
-We'll return the full amount.
-That's more like it.

573
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,315
We'll be back in 30 minutes.
You'd better keep your promise.

574
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:23,154
WE ENSURE OUR GUESTS ARE IMPRESSED
AND HAPPY WITH OUR TOP-TIER HOSPITALITY

575
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:25,824
Please give us a moment. Thank you.

576
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,912
Were you dealing with the guest
from room 301?

577
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,955
Yeah.

578
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,750
He definitely took the chance
to get back at you.

579
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,127
That's probably part of it.

580
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,880
Did he want to look cool
in front of his girl?

581
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,131
Probably.

582
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,219
If the issue is not resolved
after 30 minutes, he's not going to pay.

583
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,471
That's unreasonable.

584
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,891
Well, we can't fix it ourselves,

585
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,352
so let's just wait for the manager
to arrive.

586
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,479
-Hm?
-What's wrong?

587
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:57,981
Hold on.

588
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:02,318
It might not be as challenging
as we thought.

589
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:04,112
-Really?
-Yeah.

590
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,321
Let me see.

591
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:09,492
I found some instructions here
for when the water heater isn't working.

592
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,369
-What does it say?
-Well…

593
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,247
If the water heater itself is broken,

594
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:17,834
then we definitely need
a professional's help.

595
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:22,714
Otherwise, we could probably take care
of it on our own.

596
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:24,632
Is that so?

597
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,718
I'll get it.

598
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,388
Front desk speaking.

599
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,224
-<i>I might be able to fix it.</i>
-I'm really sorry.

600
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:35,560
<i>In fact, I really want to fix it</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

601
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,853
I'll promptly investigate and take action.

602
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,063
<i>I refuse to let that guy have his way.</i>

603
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,066
I'm very sorry. Please bear with us.

604
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:49,198
<i>By the way, there are two cases</i>
<i>that I'll be able to handle myself.</i>

605
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:54,037
<i>If this issue is one of those,</i>
<i>it'll be resolved in no time.</i>

606
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,346
<i>"First off, try unplugging it</i>
<i>and plugging it back in."</i>

607
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:14,933
<i>Just like when your computer acts up,</i>

608
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:18,895
<i>this simple trick can fix</i>
<i>a surprising amount of issues.</i>

609
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,607
Please…

610
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,153
…work.

611
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,035
Hello?

612
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,996
Could you check whether
the hot water from the sink is working?

613
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,332
Yes, sorry about this.

614
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,963
<i>Please tell me it is.</i>

615
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,925
Hello?

616
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,014
Oh, okay. I understand.

617
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:57,642
<i>It didn't work.</i>

618
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,481
<i>Twenty minutes left.</i>

619
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,151
<i>Only one thing left to try.</i>

620
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,406
<i>The water heater has a pipe</i>
<i>connected to it.</i>

621
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,201
<i>Apparently, if the filter gets filled</i>
<i>with junk,</i>

622
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,995
<i>the heater won't work</i>

623
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,288
<i>and you won't have hot water.</i>

624
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:23,042
<i>In that situation, all you need to do</i>

625
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,087
<i>is clean the filter,</i>
<i>and hot water will flow again.</i>

626
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,297
<i>This is</i>

627
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:31,926
<i>my final shot at fixing this.</i>

628
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,978
<i>Fingers crossed</i>
<i>that it all comes together.</i>

629
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:45,732
<i>Looking back…</i>

630
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,193
<i>I lost the bet on the dressing.</i>

631
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,862
<i>I also lost the tofu bet.</i>

632
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,031
<i>I really want to win</i>

633
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:55,992
<i>at least this one… or rather…</i>

634
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,370
<i>I refuse to lose.</i>

635
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:01,831
<i>Please!</i>

636
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:11,591
<i>Okay.</i>

637
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:13,092
<i>There's junk in it!</i>

638
00:34:35,572 --> 00:34:38,034
<i>All that's left is for hot water</i>
<i>to run again.</i>

639
00:34:40,953 --> 00:34:41,829
<i>Three minutes left.</i>

640
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,212
Hello?

641
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:51,880
Could you check the hot water again?

642
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,507
Yes.

643
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:00,556
<i>Come on!</i>

644
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,853
Really?

645
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:08,940
I'm glad it worked.

646
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,444
Could you let room 301 know about this
first of all?

647
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:18,116
Yes, that's right. Thank you.

648
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,873
<i>I did a great job.</i>

649
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,253
<i>I'm a genius!</i>

650
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,382
Yes. I understand.

651
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,761
I sincerely apologize
for any inconvenience caused.

652
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:41,347
Thank you for your patience.

653
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,602
How did they react to it?

654
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,856
He was like, "Oh…"

655
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,400
He tried to play it cool,
but he was definitely annoyed.

656
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:54,694
I take that as a win.

657
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,365
Thank you for your work.
So, what was the issue?

658
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:03,494
Turns out the water heater pipe
was just full of junk.

659
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,830
I cleaned it up,
and now it’s running smoothly again.

660
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,123
I see.

661
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,041
I'm exhausted.

662
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,752
You're amazing. You saved us there.

663
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,881
Thank you for your hard work.

664
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,676
This time was a bit… you know.

665
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,554
As long as it doesn't require brains,
I'm totally up for it.

666
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,975
Then, I'm counting on you
when it's something that needs brawn.

667
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,686
You can trust me on that.

668
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,563
-Thank you for your work.
-Not at all.

669
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,315
We're really in a bind, huh.

670
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:35,276
Manager.
We really appreciate you coming, but…

671
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,528
-What happened?
-The issue has been resolved.

672
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,989
What, really?

673
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,491
-Yes.
-How did you fix it?

674
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:46,454
I checked the water heater
and found that the pipe was full of junk.

675
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,248
Is that so?

676
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,001
I did some cleaning,
and now it's running smoothly again.

677
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,004
-I see.
-Yes.

678
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,298
I'm glad to hear that.

679
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:59,884
-The two of you did a really great job.
-Don't mention it.

680
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,596
We're fine on our own now.

681
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,223
That's great.

682
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,225
I'm leaving it to you guys.

683
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:09,894
You can count on us.

684
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,437
Okay.

685
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,898
That's great.

686
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,650
<i>In this way,</i>

687
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,819
<i>I was able</i>
<i>to resolve the problem this time</i>

688
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,155
<i>without needing Takahashi's help.</i>

689
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,868
<i>Also, in regard to the manager's comment</i>

690
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:28,955
<i>about how we both did a great job,</i>

691
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:31,832
<i>the fact that Takahashi claimed credit</i>
<i>like it was nothing</i>

692
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,043
<i>annoyed me a little.</i>

693
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:35,962
-Um.
-Yes?

694
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,007
It's a little awkward for me to say this…

695
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,261
but can I go bathe?

696
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,518
Oh, right. Yeah, go ahead.

697
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:53,813
Sorry about this.

698
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,988
Were you annoyed at me?

699
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,490
Not at all.

700
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:08,995
<i>I'm actually super annoyed.</i>

701
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,663
LAKE HOTEL

702
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,039
We'll take care of your luggage.

703
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:12,957
Thank you.

704
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,376
The exam is today, isn't it?

705
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,212
-Yes.
-The day has finally come.

706
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,630
Do your best.

707
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,217
-I will.
-I'm sure you'll do well.

708
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,719
Thank you.

709
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,723
It's common to mess up
during exams due to stress,

710
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,891
so stay calm and do things
as you normally would.

711
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:32,518
Yes.

712
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:35,688
I recall when I applied to the School
of Medicine at Yamanashi University,

713
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,065
I accidentally got on the wrong train.

714
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,110
Luckily, I made it just in time
and ended up passing,

715
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,070
but I was really close to being late.

716
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,031
I'll be careful.

717
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:50,244
-Well then, I'll be going now.
-Good luck.

718
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,749
<i>He's a nice boy, so I hope he passes.</i>

719
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,045
<i>-And…</i>
-You went to Yamanashi University?

720
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:00,963
Yes, the school of medicine.

721
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,966
-That's amazing!
-<i>Him casually mentioning his faculty.</i>

722
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,552
<i>Just to flex a little.</i>

723
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,138
<i>It really annoyed me.</i>

724
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,980
I'm going to check
on room 402's door latch.

725
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:19,440
Understood.

726
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,819
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

727
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,405
I found this in room 208.

728
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:31,202
-An exam admission slip.
-That's right.

729
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:34,413
The bus has already left.

730
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,666
We'll take it from here. Thank you.

731
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,379
What do we do?

732
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,425
Could you take this to him, Takahashi?

733
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:48,010
-Me?
-Yeah.

734
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,638
-I'm not a car.
-You just need to sprint.

735
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:52,181
-What?
-I mean it.

736
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:54,141
Wouldn't it be faster if you drive?

737
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,936
If I drive, I might get caught
in a traffic jam.

738
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:57,937
What?

739
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,273
Didn't you say I can count on you
in times like this?

740
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,944
I did, but Kaibun University
is quite a long distance from here.

741
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:07,988
I handled all the administrative tasks
by myself yesterday,

742
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,117
replaced a light bulb,
and even fixed the water heater.

743
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,788
-Okay, fine.
-Thank you.

744
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,434
KAIBUN LINE

745
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,251
Welcome.

746
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,881
Open the register.

747
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,300
Hurry up!

SURVEILANCE CAMERAS IN USE
ANTI-CRIME PAINTBALL

749
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,495
What's wrong?

750
00:41:38,913 --> 00:41:41,040
-Our store was robbed.
-What?

751
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:45,920
By the man in black on a bike?

752
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,755
Yes.

753
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,426
Could I have that for a moment?

754
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:54,428
Yes.

755
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,139
Please call the police.

756
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,474
Okay.

757
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,165
I called the police.

758
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,047
This way to the exam venue.

EXAM VENUE GUIDE

762
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:17,303
Hold on.

763
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:18,762
No way.

764
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:19,847
Where did I put it?

765
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,234
I'm glad I made it.

766
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,572
You left this behind.

767
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,033
That's it!

768
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,578
Good luck.

769
00:43:42,661 --> 00:43:43,954
Thank you so much.

770
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,295
MONT BLANC

771
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:53,380
That's great, isn't it?

772
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:56,008
And we received a call
from his parents afterward,

773
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,385
informing us that he passed the exam.

774
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,845
That's good.

775
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,930
I'm so happy for him.

776
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,975
Isn't Mr. Takahashi amazing?
He not only delivered the exam slip

777
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,478
but also thwarted
a convenience store robbery on the way!

778
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,855
But he was a complete dead weight
on the night shift.

779
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,232
He also didn't help retrieve the bike.

780
00:44:13,442 --> 00:44:16,195
About that, the bike the robber used…

781
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,112
Uh-huh?

782
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,280
…was actually Aya-nyan's.

783
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,573
Really?

784
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,991
-What a turn of events.
-Right?

785
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:22,868
That means he managed to get the bike too.

786
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,286
-Exactly.
-Damn.

787
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,663
A happy ending for everyone.

788
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,914
Yeah.

789
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,875
It's good she got her bike back, but…

790
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,673
-It's all over the bike, huh.
-Yeah.

791
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,218
It's anti-theft so the paint
doesn't come off easily.

792
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:40,427
What?

793
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,014
Can't the store get rid
of the paint for us?

794
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,725
<i>Fortunately…</i>

795
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,604
How is it going?

796
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:52,940
Wow, you can paint too?

797
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,441
I'm good with stuff like this.

798
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:58,153
You frequently paint
your plastic models too, right?

799
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,406
-Yeah, that's true.
-True?

800
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:04,618
I mean, it's all true.

801
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:06,703
But that's what I'm best at.

802
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,664
<i>…Takahashi came to the rescue.</i>

803
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,916
Doesn't it look great?

804
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,544
-It's really well done.
<i>-On his own.</i>

805
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:17,631
Didn't know it'd come apart this much.
