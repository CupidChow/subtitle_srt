1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,632
<i>Oh, didn’t I tell you?</i>

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:09,426
<i>About what?</i>

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,678
That Mizupon has supernatural powers.

4
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:13,805
Huh?

5
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:18,018
It's not that big of a deal.

6
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,185
What do you mean?

7
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:21,396
She can easily delete data like that.

8
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:25,191
How?

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,569
Uh, I just put my hand on it…

10
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:34,743
You see, both of us were interviewed
the other day too…

11
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,787
The thought of that airing nationwide
is embarrassing.

12
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,414
-For me too.
-Really?

13
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,375
I'm basically wearing loungewear.

14
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,044
I really hope they cut that part out.

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,212
I know, right?

16
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,381
<i>Afterwards,</i>

17
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>-I was giving Yumi a ride to the hotel.</i>
-They got Takahashi.

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:54,512
<i>We saw Mr. Takahashi talking</i>
<i>to the TV crew.</i>

19
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,807
In any case, really unfortunate things

20
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,684
are going to start happening around you.

21
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,229
<i>-So after I dropped Yumi off…</i>
-Forget today ever happened.

22
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,648
<i>-I watched from the car.</i>
-It’s better for both of us.

23
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,275
<i>Then,</i>

24
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:10,987
<i>when they wrapped up and got into a taxi,</i>

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,490
<i>I thought, "This might be my chance,"</i>

26
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,742
<i>so I tailed them.</i>

27
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,624
FUJI-ASADA STATION

28
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,594
Still not done copying?

29
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,096
-It just finished.
-Okay.

30
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,183
-There's still time.
-Yeah.

31
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,102
I'm going to the restroom real quick.

32
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,020
Okay.

33
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:49,275
<i>Initially, I was going to ask them</i>
<i>to cut the footage.</i>

34
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,238
<i>But I got nervous thinking about what</i>
<i>happened between them and Mr. Takahashi.</i>

35
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,374
<i>Then it just so happened that they left</i>
<i>the laptop unattended for a second…</i>

36
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:11,464
<i>so while I did feel bad about it…</i>

37
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,766
<i>I deleted the data and left.</i>

38
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:25,478
<i>By "the data," you mean</i>
<i>everything that was on there?</i>

39
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>Yeah. I can’t pick and choose,</i>
<i>so that's just how it is.</i>

40
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,482
<i>I see…</i>

41
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,693
<i>I was talking to Yumi about</i>
<i>how I did them dirty.</i>

42
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,819
<i>Right.</i>

43
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,239
<i>But the footage of Takahashi was on there,</i>
<i>so it’s for the best that it’s gone.</i>

44
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,032
<i>Wow.</i>

45
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,742
You really do have supernatural powers.

46
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,245
Oh, no. It's not that impressive.

47
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:45,165
By the way, do you have any other powers?

48
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,251
Mine are all tech-related.

49
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,168
Meaning?

50
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,422
Like deleting data from laptops and stuff.

51
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:57,051
I can also shut down electronic devices
so they stop working.

52
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:58,052
Whoa.

53
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,263
But that's really all I can do,

54
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,765
so I wouldn't really
call them supernatural powers.

55
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,351
-No, that's already pretty incredible!
-Yeah!

56
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,145
No, it doesn't have many practical uses.

57
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:10,607
But if someone's laptop or phone is broken
and they want to dispose of it,

58
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,610
Mizupon can just wipe the data instantly.

59
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,653
-Which is super convenient!
-You've got a point.

60
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,864
Could you do that
to my old phone sometime?

61
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,532
Sure, anytime.

62
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,825
My laptop as well.

63
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:22,994
-No problem.
-Really? Thanks!

64
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,162
Isn't that great for us?

65
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:27,206
-Oh, sorry for holding you up for so long.
-No worries.

66
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,501
-See you.
-Okay.

67
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,379
That's amazing!

68
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:34,589
Now that I think about it,

69
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,426
this town has an alien, a time traveler,
and someone with supernatural powers.

70
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,761
It's crazy!

71
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:43,056
Maybe there’s just something
about this town that attracts them.

72
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,892
Well, if any of that were actually true.

73
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:49,395
I mean,

74
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,565
you guys seem to believe it
without question, but it can't be true.

75
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:56,069
But based on what we’ve just heard,
she seems to be telling the truth.

76
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,613
Oh, come on now!

77
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,157
You were skeptical
about me being an alien,

78
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,952
so why do you just accept
time travelers and the supernatural?

79
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:07,747
-Probably because of you.
-Huh?

80
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:11,084
Yeah, after all that, we kinda got used
to the sci-fi stuff.

81
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,336
Like I said, I'm not sci-fi.
I'm non-fiction.

82
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,712
Don't lump us together.

83
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,548
Then why don’t we have her prove it?

84
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,801
-Prove what?
-Whether she has supernatural powers.

85
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:20,802
What's your plan?

86
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,595
Could I borrow your phone for a second?

87
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,098
-What for?
-To see if she can really delete data.

88
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,724
I'm not going to let her do that!

89
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,351
But you think she's lying, right?

90
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,145
It would suck if it turns out she's not.

91
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,232
Then how about asking her
to drain the battery to zero?

92
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,318
Oh, that works too.
What's your battery percentage now?

93
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,486
-Now?
-Yeah.

94
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,989
78%.

95
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:44,993
If she can drop that to zero instantly,
that means she's the real deal, right?

96
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,496
Let me have that real quick.

97
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,167
Leave my data alone, okay?

98
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,294
No worries.

99
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,255
Sorry to interrupt you during your meal.

100
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,090
Um, leaving the data intact.

101
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:02,552
-Could you drain the battery to zero?
-Yes.

102
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,845
-Here goes.
-Okay.

103
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:08,016
-What?!
-It's done.

104
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,017
‪That was quick!‬

105
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,310
Sorry about this.

106
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,394
-No, it's okay.
-Thank you!

107
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:17,817
This could be big. Go on.

108
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,737
Can you check it?

109
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,327
-What?
-It's not switching on.

110
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,871
You've got to believe it now, right?

111
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,080
Do you believe it?

112
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,417
-No.
-Why is that?

113
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,418
In the first place,

114
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,087
they didn’t believe
that I was an alien, okay?

115
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,465
-Is that so?
-Yes.

116
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,133
When I said I was an alien,

117
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,886
the two of them just smirked.

118
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,304
Oh…

119
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,933
Since they're used to supernatural powers,

120
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:55,354
seeing your abilities doesn’t really count
as proof of you being an alien.

121
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,524
They probably just thought,
"Oh, people like this exist."

122
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,651
So I’ve decided I’m not going
to believe it.

123
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,361
-Oh?
<i>-People who come from the future.</i>

124
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:06,491
<i>-And those with supernatural powers…</i>
-At least until they believe me, I won't.

125
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,201
<i>They are less stubborn</i>

126
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,745
<i>compared to aliens.</i>

127
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,844
<i>I'm the mayor of Fuji-Asada.</i>
<i>My name is Masako Umemoto.</i>

128
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,429
<i>After graduating from university,</i>

129
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,058
<i>I worked for one of the largest banks</i>
<i>in Tokyo for ten years.</i>

130
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,227
<i>Later, I returned to my hometown,</i>

131
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,062
<i>and in 2013,</i>

132
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,315
<i>I was elected to the Fuji-Asada</i>
<i>City council for the first time.</i>

133
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,443
<i>In 2019, I was appointed deputy mayor,</i>

134
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,487
<i>and this January,</i>

135
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,948
<i>I was elected as mayor of Fuji-Asada</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

136
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,366
Oh, Ms. Umemoto!

137
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,952
-Hello!
-Hi!

138
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,787
I saw your interview.

139
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,580
-Oh, the one on <i>Wide News</i>?
-Yes!

140
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,541
I liked the local development part.

141
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:59,252
Really? How did I look?
Was the footage good quality?

142
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:03,339
-Yes, you looked great!
<i>-I believe in people-centered politics.</i>

143
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,843
<i>I try to be out in the town</i>
<i>as much as possible,</i>

144
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,095
<i>so I can engage with the citizens.</i>

145
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,221
Hello, Ms. Umemoto.

146
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,516
Oh, Ms. Shinozaki. Hello!

147
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,351
<i>-But…</i>
-I went to the city hall yesterday.

148
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,729
The flower bed
at the entrance had been spruced up!

149
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:21,899
-Ah, the volunteers did that last week.
<i>-We’re wearing the same jacket.</i>

150
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,318
<i>-So I want to end the conversation soon.</i>
-Oh, really?

151
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:26,571
It looks so lovely!

152
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,281
You think so?

153
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,617
I'm glad to hear that!

154
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,119
LAKE HOTEL

155
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,413
I went to the owner's office
and talked things over.

156
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:40,585
She does feel bad about the situation
for everyone here,

157
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,796
so she wants to offer
as much compensation as possible.

158
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,216
That means she's still going
to sell the hotel, right?

159
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:51,679
For now, that hasn’t changed…

160
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:57,185
But we still have some time,

161
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,729
so I’ll keep trying to dissuade her.

162
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:03,483
If I may ask, what kind of compensation
is she giving us?

163
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,360
The other hotel the owner runs,
Asada Resort Hotel,

164
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,529
is short-staffed at the moment.

165
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,866
So she’s offering to transfer anyone
who wants to work there.

166
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,578
Isn’t Asada Resort Hotel
a really grand one?

167
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:17,914
Yes, I suppose.

168
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,373
Could it be…

169
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,669
the pay is better as well?

170
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,882
-Hmm…
<i>-Thanks to our manager’s efforts.</i>

171
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:32,010
-It could be.
<i>-The staff won't be jobless afterwards.</i>

172
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,932
<i>In fact, we might even end up</i>
<i>in a better situation than we are now…</i>

173
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,894
<i>Well, except for Takahashi, that is.</i>

174
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,605
-Thank you for your work.
-Thanks for your work.

175
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>I think I had the owner all wrong.</i>

176
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,943
What do you mean?

177
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,987
When I first heard the hotel
was being sold,

178
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:53,449
I was seriously thinking,
"That greedy old hag can go to hell."

179
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,661
But it turns out
she actually cares about us.

180
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,412
Yeah, I guess.

181
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:01,749
The manager feels guilty about all this,

182
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,543
but we should really be grateful, right?

183
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,337
-Yeah, I guess.
-Right?

184
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,883
<i>Our staff</i>

185
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,554
are apparently going to be transferred
to Asada Resort Hotel.

186
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:15,763
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

187
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,558
I guess you can take a breather for now.

188
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,814
But…

189
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:30,152
I love the Lake Hotel.

190
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,240
I don’t want to see it go after all.

191
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:37,243
It's the same for me.

192
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,835
By the way,

193
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:50,464
didn’t you say they were going
to build a municipal facility there?

194
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,967
-Yeah.
-What kind of facility is it?

195
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,969
Well…

196
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,806
I think it was supposed
to be a multipurpose center.

197
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,142
-A multipurpose center?
-Yeah.

198
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,103
They said it was for local development,

199
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:08,065
and bought up the land around here,
constructing various buildings,

200
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,901
but it's not as if
that would attract more people.

201
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,656
If anything, it just ruined the scenery.

202
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,658
I see…

203
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,038
I know they were trying
to improve the city,

204
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,416
but honestly, I think it was a mistake.

205
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,461
<i>This was a mistake.</i>

206
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,297
<i>I didn't need the shopping cart.</i>

207
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,592
Ms. Umemoto, hello again.

208
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:39,180
<i>My coat was a mistake too.</i>

209
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,650
MONT BLANC

210
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,234
Ah…

211
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,112
But this is a problem
for you too, right, Mr. Takahashi?

212
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,030
Yeah.

213
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,283
Well, the manager knows
about Takahashi’s situation,

214
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,160
and he genuinely cares about this hotel,

215
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,497
so he’s still trying to come up
with another solution…

216
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,375
<i>-Wait, who's buying the hotel again?</i>
<i>-Asada City itself.</i>

217
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:09,669
<i>Oh right. They're going</i>
<i>to build a municipal facility.</i>

218
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,798
<i>Oh yeah, Ms. Umemoto has been advocating</i>
<i>for local development since the election.</i>

219
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,967
-Thank you for coming.
-But according to Mr. Murakami,

220
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,470
it’s not really going to make a difference

221
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,972
and it's only going to ruin the scenery.

222
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,016
Really?

223
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,435
If someone from the future said so,
it must be true.

224
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,646
Yeah.

225
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,026
Oh, you don't believe
he's from the future.

226
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,446
Well, no.

227
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,991
-Can't we just go with it at this point?
-Huh?

228
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,285
We don't have the time
to debate this now, right?

229
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,872
What do you mean, debate? Believing
or not believing is a personal choice.

230
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:50,167
But the fact is, everything is happening
as Mr. Murakami said it would.

231
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:55,131
I guess. That's why I see him
as someone who leaps through time.

232
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,966
You can believe in that?

233
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,050
Well, yeah.

234
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,928
You know what I was thinking?

235
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,597
<i>If the city is buying the land,</i>

236
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,143
<i>wouldn’t it be faster to negotiate</i>
<i>with them instead of the hotel owner?</i>

237
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,603
<i>I think the city hall has a suggestion box</i>

238
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,605
<i>so we could try submitting a request.</i>

239
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,608
<i>If it's Ms. Umemoto,</i>
<i>I feel like she would look at it.</i>

240
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,901
Yeah,

241
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,153
that could be worth a shot.

242
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:22,241
Wait, doesn't Aya-nyan's husband
work at the city hall?

243
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,325
You're right!

244
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,495
<i>-Yeah, I think so.</i>
<i>-Right? Shall I ask Aya-nyan?</i>

245
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,456
<i>-Yeah, you should.</i>
-…shouldn't be a problem.

246
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,332
-Would you like a full tour?
-Yes, please.

247
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,542
‪Okay.‬

248
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,043
-I'll show you around.
-Thank you.

249
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,297
Aya-nyan says she's coming over now.

250
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,007
-Really?
-Yeah.

251
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,091
Oh, before I forget.

252
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:43,262
Takahashi.

253
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:49,894
Can we tell Aya-nyan your secret?

254
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:50,811
No.

255
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:55,274
Explaining this whole situation
without revealing your background.

256
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,277
-That's going to be a little difficult.
-Hmm…

257
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,364
Yeah, if she understands that
this is a life-or-death situation for you,

258
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,366
she’ll probably be more willing to help.

259
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,496
She's really trustworthy.
Don't worry about it.

260
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,498
Out of all of us,
she's the most dependable.

261
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,042
Didn't you receive dorayaki from her?

262
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,919
-What?
-Oh, yeah.

263
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,506
Didn't you receive them after
carrying Mr. Morimoto back to the hotel?

264
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,633
-Oh, from Ms. Okada? That was her?
-Yes.

265
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,303
I should've told you. It was a thank-you
gift for everything you’ve done.

266
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,722
Now everything makes sense.

267
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,935
Aya-nyan will definitely keep this
a secret,

268
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,854
and in fact, she probably won't even
be that surprised.

269
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:37,483
-Really?
-Like, "I'm sure others like him exist."

270
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,902
-Is she that understanding?
-She really is.

271
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,737
And her dad

272
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,990
is originally from Kyushu,

273
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,035
so she’ll likely see this
as a more distant version of that.

274
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,037
Yeah.

275
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,080
Hold on.

276
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,207
By any chance,

277
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,918
-have you already told her?
-No, we haven't.

278
00:13:57,795 --> 00:13:59,838
Excuse me, we have another friend
coming in.

279
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,132
-Could you add one more seat?
-Sure.

280
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,593
-Sorry about this.
-Thank you.

281
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,220
-Oh, there you are!
-Hello!

282
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,638
You're here, Aya-nyan.

283
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,014
Hello, Mr. Takahashi.

284
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:10,099
-Hello.
-Sorry this is so sudden.

285
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,850
No worries.

286
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:14,770
-Thanks again for my bike the other day!
-Don't mention it.

287
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,855
I should be thanking you for the dorayaki.

288
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:21,068
No problem! Honestly, I wasn’t sure
what kind of snacks aliens like,

289
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,488
so I was worried you might not like them.
Were they to your taste?

290
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,739
They were delicious.

291
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,907
That's a relief!

292
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,577
That store's confections
are out of this world!

293
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:31,829
Yeah, I guess.

294
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,248
-Here's the menu!
-Thanks.

295
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,249
Have you eaten?

296
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,750
-Yeah.
-I see.

297
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,378
Welcome!

298
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,463
I see how it is…

299
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,425
If the hot spring goes,
won't that be really bad for you?

300
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,385
-Yeah.
-I knew it.

301
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:50,264
That’s why we were wondering if,
since your husband works at the city hall,

302
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,933
he might know something.

303
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:56,770
He hasn't said anything about the hotel,
but he did mention local development.

304
00:14:56,854 --> 00:14:58,522
Is that so?

305
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,524
He’s in charge of urban planning,

306
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:03,152
so he definitely knows something
about the hotel.

307
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,862
You think so?

308
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,240
In times like this, how do we
bring this up with the city?

309
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,200
Protesting against construction, huh?

310
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,953
Yeah. Should we start a petition
or something?

311
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,997
Hmm… I don't know.

312
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,624
Let me ask my husband.

313
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,375
-You'd do that?
-Thank you.

314
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,795
-He should be off work right about now.
-Oh.

315
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:23,756
Thank you.

316
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,056
Listen, I have something
I'd like to address.

317
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,892
-I know what you're going to say. Sorry.
-We're sorry.

318
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,935
You already told her.

319
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,978
We apologize.

320
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,022
It was an accident.

321
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,609
Yeah, we’ve been seeing each other
a lot lately, so we just blurted it out.

322
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,985
Could you not do that?

323
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,320
Sorry.

324
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:48,364
He's coming over.

325
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,199
Really? Thank you so much!

326
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,993
Ritsu is at her grandparents’ place too,
so it's all good.

327
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,371
-That's great to hear.
-I see.

328
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:56,997
In any case,

329
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,458
it's getting crowded in here.
Should we go somewhere else?

330
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,502
Right.

331
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:05,547
We could ask Nonchan for a favor.
Her bar is empty before opening hours.

332
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,674
Will that be okay?

333
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,301
I’ve been there before. It should be fine.

334
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:12,012
Thank you.

335
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,347
Oh, right.

336
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,475
Ms. Nakamoto just sent me those photos
from the other day.

337
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:19,645
Oh, I think I received them too.
Haven’t looked yet, though.

338
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,649
She asked if it’s okay to post them
on her social media. What do you think?

339
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,777
Not like she has many followers.
It should be fine.

340
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,904
-Right?
-Oh.

341
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,656
Nonchan says it's okay. She'd love it.

342
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,449
Thank you.

343
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:35,786
I'll let my husband know to meet us
at Nonchan's bar.

344
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,038
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

345
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,043
Oh, Takahashi.

346
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:45,254
Um…

347
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:51,010
we’re going to consult Aya-nyan’s husband
about a few things,

348
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,303
but doing so without revealing your secret

349
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,514
is going to be pretty difficult.

350
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,850
Yeah.

351
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,811
Is it okay if we tell Aya-nyan’s husband?

352
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,979
Hmm…

353
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,483
-Okay, it's an exception.
-Thank you.

354
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,109
-Ah!
-What's wrong?

355
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,320
Well, we’re going to Nonchan's bar, right?

356
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:14,282
So naturally, I think she'll be there too.

357
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,200
Uh-huh.

358
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,412
It’d be a bit awkward to ask the person
who let us use their space

359
00:17:18,494 --> 00:17:21,165
to step out for a moment, you know?

360
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:25,586
Especially since we’re all childhood
friends. It’d be weird to leave her out.

361
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,628
It's an exception, okay?

362
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,381
Got it.

363
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:36,388
-Hello!
-Hello! Sorry about this.

364
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,765
Hello! Thank you!

365
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,518
-Sorry about this, Nonchan.
-Not at all. I'm happy you're here.

366
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,188
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

367
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,608
This is my senior
from my workplace, Takahashi.

368
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,692
Hello, I'm Takahashi.

369
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:50,694
Nice to meet you.

370
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,864
I'd like you to see something.

371
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,532
What is it?

372
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:57,618
Could you show her that?

373
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:58,786
-Okay.
-Here.

374
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,830
Huh? What?

375
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:06,668
-Um… This 10 yen coin right here…
-Okay.

376
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:09,755
What?

377
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:11,006
…becomes this.

378
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,424
Wait, this is amazing!

379
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,426
-How did you do that?
-That's amazing!

380
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,096
As for why I'm able to do this,

381
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,974
it's because… I'm an alien.

382
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,645
Oh, so that's why.

383
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,398
How long have you been here?

384
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,444
Oh… uh, my mom is human,

385
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:34,238
so I was born and raised in Asada.

386
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,949
I see.

387
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,742
-So you're half-human.
-Yeah.

388
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,245
But… you don’t look like an alien.

389
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,539
-Right?
-I get that a lot.

390
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,415
Okay.

391
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,503
You’re not really surprised, huh?

392
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:51,421
No, I really am!

393
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,842
I mean, for someone
who’s just heard the word "alien,"

394
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:55,843
you're taking it well.

395
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,220
You think so?

396
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,933
Well, we’ve had a lot
of foreign guests recently,

397
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,893
so I guess I’m kind of used to it.

398
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,187
-Yeah.
-Is that how it works?

399
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,983
Also, Micchan has supernatural powers, so…

400
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,568
-Really?
-You knew that?

401
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,611
She told me during the job interview.

402
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,071
Is Micchan that girl from before?

403
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,906
Yeah, apparently
she has supernatural powers.

404
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,324
Really?

405
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,868
Of course, our guests don't know.

406
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,870
Right.

407
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,206
-Oh, he's here.
-Oh?

408
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,708
-Hello.
-Hello.

409
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,961
-This is my husband.
-Welcome.

410
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,462
I think we last met at your wedding.

411
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,589
Oh, yes.

412
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,840
It's been seven years, huh?

413
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,968
It's been a while. Sorry to bother you
when you're busy.

414
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,344
Sorry about this.

415
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:43,140
Oh, and this is my senior
from my workplace, Takahashi.

416
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,099
Hello, I'm Takahashi.

417
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,809
Nice to meet you. I'm Okada.

418
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:49,229
So, we have something we’d like you
to see first.

419
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,736
Huh? What's happening?

420
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,030
The reason I'm able to do this

421
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,949
is because I'm an alien.

422
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,662
Huh? What does he mean?

423
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,540
-Just what he said. He's Mr. Alien.
-Huh?!

424
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,170
Huh?

425
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,589
And you all just believe him?

426
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,299
Yeah, we're used to it by now.

427
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,217
Seriously?

428
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:24,973
-But an alien--
-That's not our focus, so just accept it.

429
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,016
What?

430
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:30,145
-Really?
-Yeah, we don’t have time for that now.

431
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,188
Come on, now…

432
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,902
LAKE HOTEL

433
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,291
The city is definitely moving forward
with buying that place.

434
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,668
We figured.

435
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,795
In fact, we were there today
for an inspection.

436
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,171
I didn't know that.

437
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,422
Can we stop them?

438
00:20:57,506 --> 00:21:00,968
Like with a petition or something?

439
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,511
I think it'll be difficult.

440
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,263
Is that so?

441
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:08,350
I was thinking since it's Ms. Umemoto, she
might at least hear what we've got to say.

442
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,560
No, I doubt she'll be open to it at all.

443
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:12,604
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

444
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,024
What kind of person is Ms. Umemoto?

445
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,277
She's…

446
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,154
quite the shrewd type.

447
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,531
-Is she?
-Yeah.

448
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,491
She was the deputy mayor until last year

449
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:28,370
<i>and she was well-trusted</i>
<i>by the former mayor, Mr. Furuya.</i>

450
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,789
<i>Even after his term ended,</i>

451
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:35,752
<i>Mr. Furuya was planning</i>
<i>to have her continue as deputy mayor.</i>

452
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:40,007
<i>Here are the candidates</i>
<i>for the Fuji-Asada mayoral election…</i>

453
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,218
<i>But Ms. Umemoto went behind his back</i>
<i>and ran for mayor.</i>

454
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,345
<i>Is that so?</i>

455
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,223
<i>Naturally, he didn't see this coming</i>
<i>and was furious.</i>

456
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,891
<i>Right.</i>

457
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,769
<i>But it seems that during her time</i>
<i>as deputy,</i>

458
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:57,024
<i>Ms. Umemoto had already</i>
<i>got supporters lined up,</i>

459
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,067
<i>and by the time Mr. Furuya found out,</i>

460
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,194
<i>most of them were already on her side.</i>

461
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,821
-<i>Wow.</i>
-What's going on?

462
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:05,699
Naturally, the city hall was in chaos,

463
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:08,160
with the management splitting
into two camps.

464
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,619
I see…

465
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:12,831
If I may ask, which side are you on,
Mr. Okada?

466
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,624
-Oh, me?
-Yes.

467
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:18,962
Naturally, I can't pick a side publicly,

468
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,672
but deep down, I'm for Mr. Furuya.

469
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,215
Really?

470
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:27,471
Mr. Furuya has an old-school air
and he's made a lot of gaffes,

471
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,974
but he really cared about
preserving nature for the kids

472
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:34,728
and was someone who really thought
about the city's issues, no matter what.

473
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:36,354
I didn't know that.

474
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:38,690
He did a lot for child support too, right?

475
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,443
-You're right.
-Oh, I see.

476
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:43,445
Despite his poor image,

477
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,447
he never did anything dishonest.

478
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:47,407
I see.

479
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:52,871
Wait, so you mean that Ms. Umemoto
is the opposite?

480
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,667
Well, this is just between us…

481
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,920
<i>but about two months ago,</i>

482
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:03,465
<i>-a colleague reached out to me about that.</i>
-Sorry for calling you out on a weekend.

483
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,926
<i>He's from the policy planning department,</i>

484
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,054
<i>and was in charge of land-use planning.</i>

485
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,597
<i>And on his superior's desk,</i>

486
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,975
<i>he saw a list of contractors</i>
<i>for a project.</i>

487
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,436
<i>That project was not publicly announced,</i>

488
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,482
<i>yet a list of contractors</i>
<i>had already been decided.</i>

489
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:25,821
<i>Normally, that shouldn't be the case</i>
<i>until the project is made public.</i>

490
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,531
-… that's what I thought.
-<i>Unless</i>

491
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,199
-Really?
<i>-there’s corruption involved.</i>

492
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,326
Chief is on Umemoto's side.

493
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,871
So, you're saying he's acting
on Ms. Umemoto's orders?

494
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,789
Without a doubt.

495
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,667
Okay…

496
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,003
So now I'm planning to take photos
of the documents.

497
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,673
What? Isn't that risky?

498
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,926
-Be careful.
-I will.

499
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,514
But, seriously…

500
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,393
-Don't you have anything?
-Huh, me?

501
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,478
Anything is fine, just talk.

502
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,231
Was he able to get photos
of the documents?

503
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,734
No… He got caught trying
to sneak them out,

504
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,278
and so he was fired.

505
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:08,071
Oh dear.

506
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:12,492
So, does that mean that
in the case of the Lake Hotel,

507
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,787
there’s also some kind
of corruption involved?

508
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,372
That's what I suspect.

509
00:24:17,455 --> 00:24:19,708
-Oh…
-Okay.

510
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,003
To begin with, I just don’t see
how building something new there

511
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,214
-would attract people.
-I agree.

512
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,799
<i>And yet,</i>

513
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,261
<i>even before the sale, the construction</i>
<i>plan was already in motion.</i>

514
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:34,264
<i>Not to mention, the purchase price</i>
<i>for the land was 100 million yen.</i>

515
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,141
<i>Is that overpriced?</i>

516
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,684
<i>By a huge margin, yes.</i>

517
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,145
<i>The fair market value</i>
<i>is only around 63 million.</i>

518
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,731
<i>Wow, that's quite the difference.</i>

519
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,525
-Do you have a moment, Chief?
-What's the matter?

520
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,778
Is this purchase price
for the Lake Hotel accurate?

521
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,447
Yes.

522
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,450
But isn't 100 million a little high?

523
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,577
Not at all.
We even have the appraisal report.

524
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,038
‪CHIEF‬

525
00:24:58,121 --> 00:24:59,122
See?

526
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,040
APPRAISAL REPORT

527
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,291
You're right.

528
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,543
Sorry for taking up your time.

529
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:11,259
<i>That was likely issued by an appraiser</i>
<i>who has ties to Ms. Umemoto.</i>

530
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,056
<i>But no matter how I looked at it,</i>
<i>the price was inflated,</i>

531
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,599
<i>so I figured the Budget Committee</i>

532
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:21,186
<i>would reject it. But when I tuned</i>
<i>into the internal livestream,</i>

533
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,145
<i>it turned out…</i>

534
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,730
<i>Are there any questions?</i>

535
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:24,898
<i>No questions.</i>

536
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:25,941
What?

537
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,360
<i>-No one said a word…</i>
<i>-We will proceed with the plan.</i>

538
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,947
<i>-And it was approved just like that.</i>
<i>-Why is that?</i>

539
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,367
<i>Well, thinking back, the whole committee</i>

540
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,745
<i>was packed with people Ms. Umemoto</i>
<i>won over when she was deputy mayor.</i>

541
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,705
<i>No one dared to object.</i>

542
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:44,125
But why would Ms. Umemoto
pay so much for that land?

543
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,628
Most likely, she’s in cahoots
with the hotel owner.

544
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:49,422
The city buys it for 100 million,
and in return,

545
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,634
she gets a bribe from the hotel owner.

546
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,845
So these kind of things do happen.

547
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:57,806
-Kiichan.
-Yeah?

548
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,183
Have you seen
the pictures Ms. Nakamoto sent?

549
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,601
Not yet. Why do you ask?

550
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:04,312
Because if you look closely,

551
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,481
the mayor is in the background.

552
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,358
What?

553
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,069
You're right.

554
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:14,572
Wait, isn't this the hotel owner?

555
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,865
Yeah.

556
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:18,076
-Then it's confirmed.
-Pretty much.

557
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,663
-Ugh, this woman is the absolute worst!
-Isn't she just?

558
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,250
It seems like she's putting in a lot
of effort and money into her looks,

559
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,418
but vermin like her--

560
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,436
-…knock some sense into her, am I right?
-Yeah.

561
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,024
-Right, no arguments here.
-Exactly.

562
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,069
But this might actually be our chance.

563
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,446
What do you mean?

564
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:55,989
If they

565
00:26:56,072 --> 00:27:00,535
did all this fair and square,
there’d be nothing we could do.

566
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,204
But if this is corruption,
then exposing it

567
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,832
could thwart the entire project.

568
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,459
You've got a point.

569
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,420
-Alright, let's expose her.
-Yeah.

570
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:11,880
-Let's do it.
-We'll expose her.

571
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,090
But the question remains,
how are we going to do it?

572
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,009
Is whistleblowing not an option?

573
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,470
We'd need proof for that.

574
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,512
Right.

575
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,391
Is it difficult to get your hands
on those documents you mentioned earlier?

576
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:27,520
Yeah. After the last incident,
my chief is being extra cautious.

577
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,148
Then, what do we do?

578
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,109
Why don't we ask Minoken?

579
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,278
-What?
-Minoken?

580
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:39,199
Yeah, he comes here sometimes.
He’s a lawyer now.

581
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:40,492
No way!

582
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,619
-That booger burner?
-Booger burner?

583
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,497
He burned his boogers on the oil stove.

584
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,291
Are you serious? That's really disgusting.

585
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,460
-By Minoken, you mean Kenji Minota?
-Yeah.

586
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,504
Nonchan, do you have
Minoken’s contact details?

587
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,881
Yeah. I'll drop him a message.

588
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,176
Hey, about the oil stove and Minoken,
is it really true?

589
00:27:58,259 --> 00:27:59,219
Yeah, apparently.

590
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:02,222
-What? I toasted bread on the stove.
-Me too.

591
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,224
-Really? Let's both sue him.
-Yeah.

592
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,850
Oh, Takahashi.

593
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,811
-When Minoken gets here,
-A lawyer, really?

594
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,020
we're going to consult him

595
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:09,979
about this matter.

596
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,439
-And I think--
-It's an exception.

597
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,942
-He's crazy.
-Oh, do you know his brother's nickname?

598
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,989
-Oh, he's here!
-Hello.

599
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,658
Oh, it's Minoken.

600
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:22,659
Endou!

601
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,993
It's been a while, Minoken.

602
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:24,953
Wait, Hibino?

603
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,371
-Yeah.
-What about me?

604
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:27,789
Ayano Kobayashi!

605
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,583
What's going on? Everybody's here.

606
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,796
So, there’s something we wanted
to consult with you about.

607
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,131
What is it?

608
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,674
But first…

609
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,010
Whoa.

610
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:43,096
This is incredible.

611
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:46,307
As for why he's able to do this,

612
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,226
it's because Takahashi is actually--

613
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:49,644
An alien.

614
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,982
-Huh?
-Sorry, Minoken.

615
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,109
We really don’t have time
to get hung up on this.

616
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,737
Come on! What do you mean he's an alien?!

617
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,114
We get it, but that's not the main focus.

618
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,409
-Then what is?
-Sorry, Minoken. Can I get straight to it?

619
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,579
I see…

620
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,166
Well, putting the feasibility aside,

621
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,085
the fastest way
is to find their letter of agreement.

622
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,962
What's that?

623
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,047
You never know when someone
might bail on a deal

624
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,508
after you've already paid them,

625
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,636
so it’s a good idea to have a signed
agreement in place beforehand.

626
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,346
I see.

627
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:28,349
Would that be in the mayor’s office?

628
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,770
No, she probably already got rid
of her copy.

629
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,062
Really?

630
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,982
The agreement mainly benefits the briber.

631
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,026
So the hotel owner
would still have a copy?

632
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,569
That’s more likely.

633
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,362
Where’s the owner’s office?

634
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,697
Uh… I think

635
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,491
it's in Asanohara, right?

636
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,117
Yeah, I think so.

637
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,495
I’ll ask the manager later.
He'll be going there again.

638
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:49,579
Is that so?

639
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:53,416
Yeah, I’ll ask him to check the room
layout for me when he's there, too.

640
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,918
Thank you.

641
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,757
Hello,

642
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,675
Haraguchi speaking.

643
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,720
Thank you again for earlier.

644
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:10,058
No, no, I appreciate it…

645
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:16,523
By the way, about that matter.
How is it going?

646
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,857
I was just about

647
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,443
to update you on that.

648
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:21,528
MAYOR

649
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:25,240
Yes, both the committee
and the council approved it.

650
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,202
Yes, for 100 million? That's no problem.

651
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,454
Yeah.

652
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:32,705
Someday,

653
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,000
we should meet up for a meal
and discuss what's ahead of us.

654
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,878
Right, sounds good.

655
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:42,549
I look forward to it. See you.

656
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:55,270
We’re finally making progress.

657
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,397
Yeah,

658
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,649
but the hard part starts now.

659
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:00,650
Right.

660
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,153
Hey, uh, thanks.

661
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,366
What's this all of a sudden?

662
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:12,370
I mean, you’re all going this far for me.

663
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,958
I’ll thank your friends
properly later too,

664
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,128
but I'm really grateful
to the three of you.

665
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,257
Don’t mention it.

666
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:27,468
You’ve helped us plenty too, right?

667
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,470
Yeah. It goes both ways.

668
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:32,265
It's just our turn to return the favor.

669
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:33,892
Is that so?

670
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,061
Have I helped that much?

671
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,313
Huh?

672
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,734
You literally saved my life.

673
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,820
Well… yeah,

674
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,239
but other than that?

675
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,201
-Other than that?
-Yeah.

676
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,871
Well, you helped Hacchi too.

677
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:57,916
Yeah. You helped me retrieve
the volleyball, remember?

678
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,250
What was it again?

679
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,544
Oh, when I stopped those graffiti vandals.

680
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,379
Yeah, that too.

681
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,340
But that's about it, right?

682
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,260
No, you helped Minapuu too.

683
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,220
Huh? Oh yeah!

684
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,557
You put the screen protector on my phone.

685
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,185
Well, a store would’ve charged you
about 1,000 yen for that.

686
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,227
Yeah.

687
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,104
But that's about it, right?

688
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,567
<i>It's a fact that Takahashi</i>
<i>has helped the three of us,</i>

689
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,111
<i>and I'm thankful for that…</i>

690
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,949
<i>but there was a brief moment</i>

691
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,202
<i>when I considered not lending him</i>
<i>a hand this time.</i>

692
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:37,705
In any case, thank you, really.

693
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,415
Don't mention it.

694
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,543
The hard part is still ahead.

695
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:46,673
I just need to sneak into the office
and find the letter of agreement, right?

696
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,966
Yeah.

697
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,385
Think you can pull it off?

698
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,679
If I use my abilities, I should be fine.

699
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,013
That's reassuring.

700
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,141
You don’t need to come along.

701
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,603
I'll go on my own.

702
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:04,315
Okay.

703
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,193
All the best.

704
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,529
Thanks.

705
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,490
I'll try my best to not get caught.

706
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,075
Good luck.

707
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,411
You'll be fine, Mr. Takahashi.

708
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,870
Thanks.

709
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:19,789
When this over, we'll treat you
to <i>yakiniku.</i>

710
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,874
Good idea.

711
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,711
You're not coming?

712
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,672
What?

713
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,298
I thought you’d insist on coming along.

714
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:32,885
Well, you said you'd go on your own.

715
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:35,179
Yeah, but I figured you might

716
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,849
be worried and want to come along.

717
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,560
But you said we didn't need to come, so…

718
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,395
What else was I supposed to say?

719
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,439
I can't possibly ask you to come along.

720
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,234
What? You're totally the type
of person to do that.

721
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:49,152
Huh?

722
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:53,239
You refused to go to the school gymnasium
unless we went with you.

723
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:56,409
So when you said we didn't need to come,

724
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,328
we figured it meant we really shouldn’t.

725
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,248
And we wouldn't want to get
in your way, you know?

726
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,168
Is that so?

727
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,670
-Do you want us to come?
-What?

728
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,382
If it's better for us to come, we will.

729
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,802
I'm fine either way.

730
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,679
What should we do?

731
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,476
-Okay, I'll try to make it.
-Huh?

732
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,061
Me too.

733
00:34:23,143 --> 00:34:24,728
Yeah, same.

734
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,855
So you're not coming.

735
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,440
That’s not true! I’ll totally come!
If I can make it.

736
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:30,485
Yeah, definitely. If I can make it.

737
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,277
Just say you're not coming.

738
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:34,322
<i>And just like that,</i>

739
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,158
<i>we made a promise</i>

740
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:38,909
<i>to "try and make it."</i>

741
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,661
Can't you be clear for once?

742
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,670
<i>In regard to the window lock</i>
<i>of the first-floor restroom,</i>

743
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,632
<i>I have discreetly left it unlocked.</i>

744
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,511
<i>Located directly ahead at the top</i>
<i>of the second-floor stairs</i>

745
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,929
<i>is the hotel owner's room.</i>

746
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,140
<i>I'm sorry that this is all I can do.</i>

747
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,169
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

748
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:32,088
Mr. Takahashi…
Oh, he's not looking this way.

749
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,256
Mr. Takahashi!

750
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:35,258
Hello.

751
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:37,552
-We came.
-Yeah.

752
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,220
Get in the back seat.

753
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,596
-Here.
-Mr. Takahashi?

754
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,181
Oh, he noticed.

755
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,058
‪-No reaction from him!‬
‪-Hey.‬

756
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,105
You really came.

757
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,566
Yeah.

758
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:55,695
Aya-nyan drove the others here.
Look, they're waving at us.

759
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:56,612
I see.

760
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,282
-Both of you came too?
-Yeah.

761
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,660
I mean, it's definitely better
for Ms. Mizuki to come, right?

762
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,120
-Why is that?
-You see.

763
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,746
She'll have to disable the security.

764
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,873
What do you mean?

765
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:09,167
Yeah, this operation
is impossible without me.

766
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,586
Is that so? Can you do it?

767
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,880
Well, I’ve never done it before,

768
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,883
but if I mess with the main power
I'll be able to shut everything down.

769
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,260
Really?

770
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,262
Okay, shall we go?

771
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,847
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

772
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:31,147
Oh, before I forget.

773
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,357
This is from Mizupon and me.

774
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,693
-Yay!
-Let's all have some.

775
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,570
Thank you.

776
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,613
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

777
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,364
Is tea okay for you, Kiyomi?

778
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,451
-Here you go.
-Hey,

779
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:44,702
is this for me?

780
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,288
There's a lot of bitter ones, though.

781
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,581
Oh.

782
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:52,251
-I thought someone would like them.
-They're for me, right?

783
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:58,424
It’s been a while
since we did something like this.

784
00:36:58,507 --> 00:37:01,761
Yeah, we don’t get together
as much anymore.

785
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,179
Right.

786
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:05,681
We used to hang out all the time.

787
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,060
Well, marriage kinda changes that.

788
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,603
Hacchi, we haven't met since…

789
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,230
Five years ago, isn't that right?

790
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,065
Yeah!

791
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:16,275
Which elementary school
are you teaching at now?

792
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,069
Asahi Elementary.

793
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,528
-Wait, really?
-Yeah.

794
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,572
My son will be enrolling there this year.

795
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,574
No way! I'm looking forward to seeing him!

796
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:24,867
Hey,

797
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,663
if you end up teaching him,
you absolutely have to play favorites.

798
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,956
Absolutely?

799
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,250
Yeah, absolutely.

800
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,585
-I'm begging you!
-She's nuts.

801
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,879
Always bump his test scores by ten.

802
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,256
What kind of parent are you?

803
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,975
The switchboard is in front
of the building.

804
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,476
Got it.

805
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,355
-You come after I go and kill the power.
-Okay.

806
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,148
Do you know where her room is?

807
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,734
Yeah, the manager drew
a rough sketch for me.

808
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,611
He also left the restroom window unlocked.

809
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:03,281
Oh, wow. Then you should be fine, huh?

810
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,407
Want to take some sweets with you?

811
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,953
I'll eat them when I'm back.
Don't pass me the bitter ones.

812
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,162
You don't want them?

813
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,956
Fine, I'll take one.

814
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:13,958
Good luck.

815
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,459
-Good luck.
-I'll do my best.

816
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,794
Good luck.

817
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,213
-Good luck.
-See you.

818
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,176
-It's done.
-Did it go okay?

819
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,844
Yeah, I just had to touch it.

820
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:07,845
Want some sweets?

821
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,263
Yeah!

822
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,396
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

823
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,997
I was touching
the switchboard earlier, right?

824
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:20,668
So, now the energy is stored here.

825
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:23,796
If I focus my strength on my fingers…

826
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,132
What? No way!

827
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:27,716
Is this real?

828
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,301
-This is amazing!
-Right?

829
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,222
Can you use it to heal injuries?

830
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:35,433
Nope, I can only make it glow.

831
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,812
Ah, that's all.

832
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,397
-That's so cool!
-Right?

833
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,525
-Absolutely.
-But it has no practical use at all.

834
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,736
Oh, by the way,

835
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,655
we met Minoken at Nonchan's bar.

836
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,199
Minoken? It's been forever!

837
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,325
How is he doing?

838
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:55,828
-He's doing fine. He's a lawyer now.
-Yeah.

839
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,163
Really?

840
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,457
-Minoken, that is?
-Yeah.

841
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,625
The guy who always wore shorts
and T-shirts.

842
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,377
Don't forget the Tokyo Verdy cap.

843
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,004
Right!

844
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,423
-He did wear one.
-Can't believe you still remember!

845
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,216
-He even wore it in class.
-Hm?

846
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,968
Isn't that…

847
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:12,803
a security company's car?

848
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,930
-You're right.
-What is it doing here?

849
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,642
Maybe they noticed the security system
went down, and rushed over.

850
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,937
That must be it. Oh no, I need
to let him know about this!

851
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:47,630
-You take the first floor.
-Okay.

852
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,374
-Hey.
-What's wrong?

853
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,168
Isn't that the hotel owner's car?

854
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,294
What?

855
00:44:32,378 --> 00:44:33,337
That one over there.

856
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,883
-Wait, you're right.
-Oh no.

857
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,302
Did the security company contact her?

858
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:42,513
Will he be okay?

859
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:23,929
