1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>At the base of Mount Fuji,</i>

2
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:10,593
<i>in Fuji-Asada, Yamanashi, Kiyomi Endou</i>

3
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:14,055
<i>and her childhood friends,</i>
<i>Minami and Hazuki,</i>

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,224
<i>enjoyed a peaceful life.</i>

5
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:18,435
Are you still on
the moms' volleyball team?

6
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,769
Yeah. I'm the captain now.

7
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:20,812
Oh wow. Really?

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,313
-Welcome.
-<i>Then one day…</i>

9
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:27,736
<i>Kyomi's colleague,</i>
<i>Kousuke Takahashi, saved her life.</i>

10
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:28,862
Takahashi?

11
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,990
I'm actually an alien.

12
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,161
<i>As much as Kiyomi</i>
<i>found it hard to believe,</i>

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:41,249
<i>she, Minami and Hazuki</i>
<i>bore witness to Takahashi's abilities,</i>

14
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>and accepted the reality.</i>

15
00:00:43,793 --> 00:00:44,794
…do not tell anyone about this.

16
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,463
Yes, of course.

17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,882
<i>Their ordinary lives</i>

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,760
<i>quietly began to change.</i>

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,565
Homeroom is about to start,
so return to your classrooms.

20
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:08,526
-Come on, return to your classrooms.
-You guys have seen enough.

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,071
Now, go back to your classrooms.

22
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:14,991
Guys, return to your classrooms.

23
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,620
Return to your classrooms!

24
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:22,248
You guys too! Hurry up
and return to your classrooms.

25
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,710
Return to your classrooms!

26
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,361
Will you be home late today?

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,322
I'll be back in the evening.
I have cram school today.

28
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:56,658
What about dinner?

29
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,327
I'm eating out.
Are you heading out somewhere, Mom?

30
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,122
Yep, I'm having lunch
with Minapuu and Hacchi.

31
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,790
-Oh, nearby?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,959
-Where?
-At Mont Blanc.

33
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,086
I figured it would be there.

34
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,838
What about you and your friends, Wakaba?

35
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,839
Probably Saizeriya.

36
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:12,298
You really love that place, huh.

37
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,050
Because we can chill there after we eat.

38
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,468
Want to consider Mont Blanc?

39
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,053
I'm good. I'm leaving now.

40
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,638
See you.

41
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:25,812
<i>Since weekends are my days off,</i>

42
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,149
<i>I finish the laundry</i>
<i>and cleaning that has piled up.</i>

43
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,517
<i>After the incident with Takahashi,</i>

44
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:08,021
<i>we started</i>
<i>getting together regularly again.</i>

45
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,981
Thank you!

46
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,442
-Oh, there's an egg in the middle.
-Looks delicious.

47
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,528
-Yeah.
-This part of the avocado is made for it.

48
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,071
It's just perfect to hold the eggs.

49
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,823
It's like the spot for eggs in ramen.

50
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,700
You're right.

51
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,785
-Okay, let's dig in!
-Yeah.

52
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:29,792
By the way, there was a shoot
in front of Aeon the other day.

53
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:30,793
For which TV show?

54
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,254
What was it again?
The name was one I hadn't heard before.

55
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,464
Were there any celebrities there?

56
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,675
No, it was the kind where they interview
random people on the street.

57
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,676
I see.

58
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,720
-They even approached me.
-Really?

59
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,305
-You got interviewed?
-Yeah.

60
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,098
Wow. What did they ask?

61
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:45,016
It went like,

62
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:48,770
"Shizuoka or Yamanashi, which side
do you think Mount Fuji belongs to?"

63
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,231
-Here we go again.
-Are people still debating that?

64
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:52,732
It's getting old. Like who cares?

65
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,733
So what did you say?

66
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,777
Yamanashi, duh.

67
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,403
You don't even think that.

68
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,405
But if I don't exaggerate,
I won't be featured.

69
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,324
You know what the production wants.

70
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,117
You bet. And guess what he said next?

71
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,996
"But Shizuoka's population is larger."
Oh, the cheek of him.

72
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,832
-Ugh, how annoying.
-Right? He's desperate to spark rivalry.

73
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,209
What did you say afterward?

74
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:15,463
I was like, "Nah, we have Lake Kawaguchi
and the Shingen-ko Festival."

75
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,673
I was desperate to be featured.

76
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,800
Then what?

77
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:22,512
He was like, "Actually, because the summit
doesn't have an official designation

78
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,098
Mount Fuji doesn't belong to either,
did you know that?"

79
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,057
Of course we know.

80
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,059
Right? But I still played along.

81
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,143
What did you say then?

82
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,729
"Wait what, really? Since when?"

83
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,482
-You went all in, huh.
-I've gone too far now.

84
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,150
I want to watch that show.

85
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,151
What's it called?

86
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:41,155
-Hmm… I did ask, but I can't recall.
-Is it <i>Kenmin Show?</i>

87
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,241
-If it was that I'd remember it.
-Right.

88
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,535
It's not a regular show,

89
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,704
it's a one-off that airs
on Sunday afternoons.

90
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,290
-Like a pilot episode?
-Yeah.

91
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,333
The title was
something I'd never heard of.

92
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,460
On which channel?

93
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:58,256
Which was it again?
I asked for it, but I can't recall.

94
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,424
Channel 4?

95
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,384
-I can't say for sure.
-Channel 8?

96
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,094
Channel 1? Two?

97
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,472
I've completely forgotten,
so I wouldn't know even if you were right.

98
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,100
-Oh, come on.
-I wanted to watch.

99
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:11,311
Doesn't our memory get worse as we age?

100
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,021
Really? I don't feel like mine is.

101
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,274
I'm sure it is. Like how you can't recall
a certain actor's name. Right?

102
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,401
I'm almost 40, but still in my thirties.

103
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:22,155
It's not like your memory deteriorates
the moment you hit 40, right?

104
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,032
Look, my memory's fine.

105
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,241
You're definitely faking.

106
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,951
No, I'm not. My memory's real strong.

107
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,704
You must have forgotten about the fact
your memory has got worse.

108
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,164
That's a bit of a stretch.

109
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,999
Why are you acting like
you're not part of this?

110
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,792
Because it doesn't apply to me.

111
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:36,377
<i>Actually,</i>

112
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,381
<i>we had a similar conversation</i>
<i>six months ago.</i>

113
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,468
<i>and they both probably forgot about it.</i>

114
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:49,223
Oh yeah, I want to consult you
on one thing.

115
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,142
-What is it?
-Let me guess.

116
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,769
You're not going to get it.

117
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,895
Now I'm curious.

118
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,980
-Give me a hint.
-A hint?

119
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,982
It's about my work.

120
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,734
It's school-related. What could it be?

121
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,819
You can't remember a student's name.

122
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,738
That's not it. Isn't that just you?

123
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,198
Rude. I can remember their names.

124
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,574
Oh, I know.

125
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,870
The school song was written by a musician
who is an alumnus of the school,

126
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,914
but the musician is a questionable person,

127
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,666
and the lyrics are so lame
that you don't really want to sing it.

128
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,378
That's not it. Even if that was the issue,
what's the point in telling you?

129
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:22,173
-You have a point.
-I know. You can't remember the lyrics.

130
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,008
Nope. As I said earlier, that's just you.

131
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,051
Excuse me?

132
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,762
-Okay, I'm out of ideas.
-So, what is it?

133
00:06:27,845 --> 00:06:31,933
Well, it's…
Not that it's a big deal or anything

134
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:34,894
but on Friday, during gym class…

135
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:37,563
Make sure you don't leave a gap.

136
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,190
Okay.

137
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,985
-We're going to do warm-ups, line up!
-Okay!

138
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,321
Come on, over here.

139
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,658
A ball is stuck.

140
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,909
When did that happen?

141
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,285
What's the matter?

142
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,747
Miss, look up there. A ball is stuck.

143
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,083
You're right.

144
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,627
What is it doing there?

145
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:04,590
It was probably the moms' volleyball team.
Okay, line up!

146
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:05,883
Is it okay to leave it there?

147
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:06,843
Huh?

148
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:11,222
When people come and change the bulbs,
we can ask them to get the ball for us.

149
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:12,974
No need to worry. Come on, line up!

150
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,350
Can't you get it yourself?

151
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,936
-Me?
-Go on, get it!

152
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:20,314
-Go on, get it!
-There's no way I can do that.

153
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,568
Please get it down for us, Miss!

154
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,279
<i>When they get like this,</i>
<i>it's not easy for them to settle down.</i>

155
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:29,365
You can do it!

156
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,285
Please get it down for us, Miss!

157
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:38,875
Maybe a little more.

158
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:39,709
27 YEARS AGO

159
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,377
Practice is about to start, Kiichan.

160
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,088
Just give me a bit longer and I'll get it.

161
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,803
You're not even close.

162
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,971
Pass me a ball.

163
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,639
Here you go.

164
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,315
It's no use.

165
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,692
Mind if I try?

166
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,277
Oh, you think you can do it, Hacchi?

167
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,612
I'm not sure but I'll try.

168
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,039
-Yes, you did it!
-You're awesome!

169
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,250
That's so cool!

170
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,920
Miss, come on. Get the ball down!

171
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,548
-Get it!
-Okay, fine. I'll do it.

172
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,260
<i>Fueled by the enthusiasm of the kids,</i>

173
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,513
<i>my instincts as a former volleyball player</i>
<i>kicked in.</i>

174
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:40,811
Here's the deal. I get the ball down,
you guys will do your warm-ups.

175
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,188
Okay!

176
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:44,649
Okay, here goes.

177
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,987
That was weak.

178
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,323
-It didn't reach!
-Yeah.

179
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,076
Trust me, I'll make this work.

180
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,918
You're not even close!

181
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,422
Okay, here goes!

182
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,552
<i>Oh no.</i>

183
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,554
Miss, you got the ball stuck!

184
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:19,350
I'll get that down too.

185
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,645
I'll get that down too. Don't worry.

186
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,484
Wow, she did it again!

187
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,739
Settle down.

188
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:37,201
I'll get the balls down later.
Let's begin our class for the time being.

189
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,620
I'll get the balls down later.
Let's begin class.

190
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,414
-Aw! But Miss…
-No buts.

191
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,458
I still can't believe how it got stuck
on the ceiling.

192
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,460
It brings back so many memories.

193
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:49,255
Didn't we get it down by hitting it
with a ball before practice?

194
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:52,174
Yeah, we did. Speaking of which,
you were sensational, Hacchi.

195
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,051
Right. Your control was amazing.

196
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:57,305
Right? I was successful back then,

197
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,056
so I thought I'd show my cool side.

198
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,310
Of course. If you managed to do it
in front of the kids, you'd be a hero.

199
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,936
Yeah.

200
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,523
But I couldn't, and instead,
I added two more balls to the ceiling.

201
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,525
Well, you haven't done volleyball in ages.

202
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:13,154
In a way, it's kinda impressive
you managed to add two to the ceiling.

203
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:18,200
Now that I think about it, the ceilings
are designed so that balls get caught.

204
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,494
Oh, you're falling back
on your ramen concept?

205
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,829
Isn't a perfect fit strange?

206
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:24,081
-It's a deadly trap.
-Right?

207
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:29,170
We'll get the contractors to take it down
when they change the bulbs so no big deal.

208
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,588
You're going to ask them?

209
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:35,009
They come once a year. I'll ask them
to do it when they're changing the bulbs.

210
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,053
When is the next time they'll come?

211
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,888
They just changed them for us
at the start of the year.

212
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,223
-I see.
-Then they won't come until next year.

213
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,141
Yeah.

214
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,392
Wouldn't it bother you

215
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,646
if your ball stayed stuck up there
for a whole year?

216
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:49,106
And they know you're the one who did it.

217
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,776
Yeah, and what's more…

218
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,861
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

219
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:56,572
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

220
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,075
Hey, I heard.

221
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,661
You got a ball stuck
on the ceiling of the gym?

222
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,454
Who did you hear that from?

223
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:06,499
A few kids from your class were just
talking about it in the corridor.

224
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,875
What did they say?

225
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,378
I think they said
you interrupted the class

226
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,881
and hit the ball, and it got stuck
on the ceiling.

227
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:17,051
I was only trying to get down
the one which was initially stuck.

228
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,053
Oh, I see how it is.

229
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:21,430
And just for the record,
I didn't interrupt the class.

230
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,431
-Okay.
-Yeah.

231
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,849
-Ms. Nakamura.
-Yes?

232
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:27,019
Did your class play a game where they trap
a ball against the ceiling?

233
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:31,565
-A game?
-My class said they want to play it.

234
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,567
We didn't play a game like that.

235
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,611
-Is that so?
-Yes.

236
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,113
Sorry about that.

237
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:41,450
<i>News spread like wildfire.</i>

238
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,869
And the rumors keep getting further
from the truth.

239
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,456
-Kids tend to exaggerate things.
-Yeah.

240
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:52,461
-They'll be talking about it for a while.
-At least until they graduate.

241
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,171
That's annoying.

242
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,965
Then there's that bit, right?

243
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,843
The part of the graduation ceremony
where they recount memories.

244
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,512
Oh, that? Where you go, "It was fun."

245
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,306
-"The school trip."
-Yeah, like that.

246
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,350
Oh, in that tone, huh?

247
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,561
"My teacher trapped something
against the ceiling."

248
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,688
"It was a volleyball!"

249
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:14,150
As if I'd let them say that. The homeroom
teacher writes the speech, anyway.

250
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,734
Oh, is that so?

251
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,821
But kids can really harp on things.

252
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,030
-Yeah.
-Right?

253
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:23,659
Kids their age will harp on trivial things
like a teacher's spelling mistakes.

254
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:28,831
-Yeah, we sure did at their age.
-Teachers don't often make mistakes.

255
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,625
I also don't want them
to spread false information

256
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,669
to their parents and make things weird.

257
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,005
Yeah, it's likely they would tell
their parents.

258
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,924
-Right.
-But I don't see an issue with that.

259
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,094
Nah, parents nowadays contact the school
for literally anything.

260
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,596
Oh, really?

261
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,515
If the school does get a call,
they can't just ignore it

262
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,477
so they'd ask, "What's that about?"
and it's going to get very tricky.

263
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,769
Yeah, I'd want none of that.

264
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,731
-Being a teacher is rough sometimes.
-Yeah.

265
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,817
In the past, it would've been fine
leaving it as it is.

266
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,236
Right.

267
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,700
Wait, was that what you wanted
to consult me about?

268
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:06,243
Yeah.

269
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:09,205
Do you want me to get the volleyball
down for you?

270
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,957
No, I think that'd be tough.

271
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,834
If even you can't do it, I've no chance.

272
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,794
Right.

273
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,923
But Mr. Takahashi may be able to.

274
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,760
Takahashi, huh.

275
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,721
-Yes, he can.
-He definitely can, right?

276
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:28,349
-Yeah.
-He just needs to jump to the ceiling.

277
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,101
Do you think you could ask him for me?

278
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,438
Sure, I'll ask him when I see him.

279
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,234
I think he'll probably help.

280
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,403
No!

281
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,489
It's a no go, huh.

282
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,659
Listen, I get it.

283
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:50,162
I can be flexible, right? Let's say
something happened like it has previously,

284
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,456
like almost getting hit by a car

285
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,333
or a theft occurring in a guest's room,

286
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:58,420
then I might be willing to help.

287
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,340
But seriously, asking me
to get a ball stuck on the ceiling?

288
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,217
What kind of silly request is that?

289
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:07,179
-You're right.
-Of course.

290
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,683
But while it might come off as silly,

291
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,519
for the person involved,
it’s quite a big deal.

292
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,854
It's not that big of a deal, is it?

293
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,024
Every gym's ceiling
has a ball stuck up there.

294
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,526
This is just a school thing.

295
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:24,655
But it's a different kind of guilt
when it's a ball you yourself hit.

296
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,324
That's not my problem.

297
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:29,410
-Why don't you ask the contractors?
-But then.

298
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,371
The contractors will only come
in January next year.

299
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,289
Then wait for them.

300
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:36,166
But that would mean until then

301
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,879
she'd always be teaching under the ball
she herself trapped against the ceiling.

302
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,463
It's going to be quite stressful.

303
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:43,173
Then don't look up.

304
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,886
But even if she doesn't look up,
the kids will be harping on about it.

305
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,804
Are they that annoying?

306
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,139
Yeah.

307
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,225
From how they look at it, it's the same
as having dirt on the teacher.

308
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,020
And kids are persistent.

309
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,939
Well, that's her fault.
She's the one who did it.

310
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:00,983
That's true,

311
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:05,112
but it's surprisingly small things
like this that lead to classroom chaos.

312
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,697
No, that's stretching a bit too far.

313
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,782
No, it happens.

314
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:13,954
When kids get the upper hand even once,
they start disobeying the teacher.

315
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:18,459
Some teachers even end up falling ill
because of it.

316
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,088
What? From just a ball getting stuck
on a ceiling?

317
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:28,093
I don't think the ball
being stuck is a big problem either,

318
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,429
but if an issue should arise

319
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:34,350
and she looks back thinking,
"That was what started it all,"

320
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,269
don't you think it'd be really frustrating
for her?

321
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,859
-Kiyomi, I need you at the front desk.
-Okay.

322
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,795
We hope you stay with us again.

323
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:13,514
Oh, by the way, I had a TV interview
the other day in front of Aeon.

324
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:15,391
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

325
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,893
Hold on, was it about that?

326
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,688
-Which prefecture Mount Fuji belongs to?
-Yes, that's the one!

327
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:23,691
-Did they interview you too, Kiyomi?
-No, they interviewed my friend.

328
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,068
-Really?
-Yeah. By the way, what did you say?

329
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,153
"Yamanashi, duh."

330
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,238
-Figured.
-Yeah.

331
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,365
To be honest, I think either answer works.

332
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,033
I just thought, you know, maybe…

333
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,827
-You know what they're looking for.
-Yeah.

334
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,286
And guess what happens next?

335
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:40,749
He was like "But Shizuoka's population
is way larger." Oh, the cheek of him.

336
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,835
So I was like
"But we have Fuji-Q Highland."

337
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,878
-You handled that smoothly.
-I sure did.

338
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,048
-Then what?
-Then he asked if I knew.

339
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:52,136
That it belongs to neither
as the summit has no official designation.

340
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,513
-What did you say then?
-"Wait what, really?"

341
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,974
-I think you nailed it.
-Yeah.

342
00:16:57,057 --> 00:16:59,268
-What about your friend, Kiyomi?
-She went all in.

343
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,186
-Oh, same as me?
-Pretty much the same.

344
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,771
Right.

345
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,358
I'll definitely watch the broadcast.
What is the TV show called?

346
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:08,068
<i>Chuusai Japan.</i>

347
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:09,778
-Really?
-Yeah.

348
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,407
<i>But, this whole Mount Fuji debate</i>

349
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:19,663
<i>may have been enlivened</i>
<i>thanks to people like them.</i>

350
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:25,127
I should reply to the inquiries
we got while I can.

351
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,670
Thank you.

352
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,968
-Are you heading home already?
-Yeah.

353
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,431
Takahashi, is there any chance
you could help?

354
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,433
Man.

355
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:42,895
This is a matter that could affect
my childhood friend's career as a teacher.

356
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,021
I really need your help.

357
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,315
You're overexaggerating.

358
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,483
Of course,

359
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,694
I'll make sure to thank you properly
for that recent incident too.

360
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:55,074
Okay, fine.

361
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,077
-Really?
-Only this time.

362
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,912
Thank you so much!

363
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,307
I'll be leaving now.

364
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,643
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you for your work.

365
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,441
Can I share my own urban legend with you?

366
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,568
An urban legend? What is it?

367
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,947
The theory that Takahashi is an alien.

368
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:37,866
Sorry, what?

369
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,036
Takahashi as in that Takahashi?

370
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,079
Yep.

371
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,790
Oh, okay. Why?

372
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,625
He's shrouded in mystery, don't you think?

373
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,626
Mystery?

374
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,379
He doesn’t share anything
about his personal life.

375
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,756
Really?

376
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,633
I don't think that's the case.

377
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:57,261
But nobody knows where Takahashi lives

378
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,721
or anything about his family, right?

379
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,432
He was born and raised
in Asada, apparently.

380
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,017
Wait what, really?

381
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,979
Also, he seems to have gotten his looks
from his mom.

382
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,188
Really?

383
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,357
How did you know that?

384
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,402
He was just talking about it casually.

385
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,903
I see.

386
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,822
Oh, he seems to have hyperesthesia.

387
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,408
Me too.

388
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,870
Aw, so he's just a normal human being.

389
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,581
Right.

390
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,044
By the way, that theory about Takahashi
being an alien.

391
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,838
It's just you talking about it, right?

392
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:34,464
Yeah, I came up with it.

393
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,719
Then that's not really
an urban legend, is it?

394
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,179
Really?

395
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,347
Yeah. Urban legends

396
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:47,060
are credible rumors that get passed
around in various places.

397
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,854
You're right.

398
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,815
That theory of yours
is just your own imagination.

399
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,777
Oh, then it's just the legend
of Yumi Isomura.

400
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:01,992
If you put it like that,
then it's like your own heroic tale.

401
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,244
You've got a point.

402
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,293
<i>My heart skipped a beat</i>
<i>for a second there.</i>

403
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,381
I can't tell
if she's being perceptive or not.

404
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,722
Thank you for coming today.
I really appreciate it.

405
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,016
This is an exception, okay.

406
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,518
Then, let's get started right away.

407
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:31,313
Oh wow. Did you draw that, Hacchi?

408
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:34,024
This is the floor plan of our school.

409
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,400
This is the gymnasium.

410
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:36,610
Okay.

411
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:41,531
By the way, our school's security is tight
so I thought we should hatch a plan first.

412
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,244
Oh, really? I had the impression schools
are easier to infiltrate at night.

413
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:49,248
We have CCTV now, so security will
come flying if you're caught on camera.

414
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,666
Is that how it works?

415
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,335
These are the cameras' positions.

416
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,170
There's quite a few.

417
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,882
But if you follow these arrows,
you're safe from the cameras.

418
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,885
But I can't get through here.
What's the plan?

419
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:06,181
Oh, okay.
This is the window at the top of the gym.

420
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,684
And this part
kind of sticks out, like this.

421
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,561
Then this here is the path.

422
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:16,024
You can jump from here
and enter through the top window.

423
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,527
You expect me to jump from here?

424
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,071
But isn't the window of the gym
quite high up?

425
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:24,908
Oh, no. You see,
this part of the window sticks out,

426
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:28,996
and the path here goes up like this,

427
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,998
-so they're the same height.
-Oh, the same.

428
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,207
Isn't the window locked?

429
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,837
Oh, I left the window at the far end
unlocked, so no worries.

430
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,255
Right.

431
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:42,175
Wait, isn't this illegal trespassing?

432
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,553
Well, yes.

433
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,346
What if I get caught?

434
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,515
Try your best not to get caught.

435
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,475
There'll be no risk of that
if I don't go in.

436
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,228
I'm sorry, but please
find a way to manage it.

437
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,189
Can't I enter from the yard?

438
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,360
Um well, if you can avoid getting seen
by the cameras, then it's fine.

439
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:02,904
But I thought my way would be better.

440
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,072
I see.

441
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,575
Well, I'll give it a shot.

442
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:07,993
Thank you.

443
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,619
-Only this time, okay?
-Yes.

444
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,663
Please contact me if you need anything.

445
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:13,790
-Okay.
-I'm counting on you.

446
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,045
-Speaking of which, Mr. Takahashi.
-Yes?

447
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:21,298
-I have a little favor to ask you too.
-What is it?

448
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:25,343
Lately, perhaps because of my age,
I've been forgetting things frequently.

449
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,971
-Oh, it happens when you're past 40.
-Right?

450
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,682
Like sometimes I can't recall
a certain actor's name.

451
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:34,644
I feel you. I can't tell the difference
between these new young groups, either.

452
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,313
Can this be treated?

453
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,522
-No.
-Really?

454
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,483
Of course. What do you want me to do?

455
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,527
Like put your hand over my head…

456
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,863
Listen, that's supernatural power.

457
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:45,822
I see.

458
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,659
-Hold on.
-You're able to do something?

459
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,952
No, I can't. That's not it.

460
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,996
Did you say,

461
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,123
"Please contact me if you need anything"?

462
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,625
Yes.

463
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,754
-Wait, you're not coming along?
-No.

464
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,005
I'm by myself?

465
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,299
Yes. I won't be able to enter.

466
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:08,553
But you can wait for me somewhere, right?

467
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,681
I won't be able to help with anything
even if I'm there.

468
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,393
I think you're missing the point here.
This is your problem.

469
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,812
You have to be present at least.

470
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,856
Hm…

471
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,942
Okay. I'll come.

472
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,902
-Please do.
-Yes.

473
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,613
Both of you too.

474
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,282
-Huh?
-Both of you have to come too.

475
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,829
But this has nothing to do with us.

476
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:35,539
I'm the one who's least involved.

477
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,624
But you're the one
who accepted her request.

478
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,252
If you're going to put it like that,
I'll make my own request.

479
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,254
-For what?
-For both of you to be present.

480
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:47,259
Or else, I won't do it. Three of you
are to be present, otherwise call it off.

481
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,261
-What do you mean by that?
-Don't act stupid.

482
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:52,013
Three of you present, I'll do it.
Or else, I won't do it. Simple.

483
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,849
What do we get from doing this?

484
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,226
You expect to get something in return?
You're nuts.

485
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,854
But you're getting something in return
for helping Hacchi, no?

486
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:00,021
Well, yes.

487
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,190
We're doing you a favor.
You have to do the same.

488
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:05,402
It doesn't make sense for me to do that.

489
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:08,613
No, see. You're the subcontractor,
and we're the sub-subcontractors.

490
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,784
That's it, I've had enough.
I'm calling it quits.

491
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,661
-I'm done.
-No, I'll be in a pinch.

492
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,371
Sorry.

493
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:18,790
I'll treat both of you another day,
so please.

494
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,336
What should we do? It's a request
from the prime contractor.

495
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,424
Well, it's coming from Hacchi.
I guess we go?

496
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,884
Yeah.

497
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:31,178
Let's put our shoulders
to the wheels for Hacchi.

498
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,513
-Thanks.
-No problem.

499
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,931
As if you guys are doing work.

500
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,397
<i>We're a show that explores the charms</i>
<i>of Yamanashi as best as we can.</i>

501
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,399
<i>Today, we're focusing on a budget-friendly</i>

502
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,319
<i>Ultimate Psychic Bento!</i>

503
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,487
We're running out of skin toner.

504
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:50,780
Oh, are we?

505
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,949
I'll get some more then.

506
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,534
Thank you.

507
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:56,912
When does club start tomorrow?

508
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,289
-We have tomorrow off.
-I see.

509
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:01,208
-Are you going out somewhere?
-No.

510
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,210
So, lunch at home?

511
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,463
-Yeah.
-Is it your off day tomorrow too, Mom?

512
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,465
Yeah.

513
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,511
You're going to bed?

514
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,305
Yeah.

515
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,059
I'm going to the convenience store,
want me to get anything?

516
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:20,852
At this hour?

517
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,395
Yeah.

518
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,982
I just noticed we ran out of toilet paper.

519
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,569
Get me a milk tea.

520
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:31,613
Okay.

521
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,031
Good night.

522
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:42,791
<i>On sale days, the price</i>
<i>is a whopping 36 yen tax inclusive!</i>

523
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,126
That's dirt cheap.

524
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:08,817
It's freezing!

525
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,735
So cold!

526
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:14,489
So sorry you had to come out
on such a cold night.

527
00:26:14,572 --> 00:26:16,324
It's fine.

528
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,629
Been a while
since we did something like this.

529
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,756
-Right?
-Oh, driving at night?

530
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,717
Didn't we go for a test of courage?

531
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,593
-Yeah.
-Right?

532
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,678
Ten years ago?

533
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,180
I think it was further back.

534
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,224
It was before I had Wakaba.

535
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,561
-What?
-That long ago?

536
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:46,896
What's this?

537
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,815
Oh, that?

538
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:52,068
I bought a bunch of stuff for us to eat
later while we wait in the car.

539
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,405
-You're the best!
-Right?

540
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,295
-Thanks for coming.
-Thanks for coming.

541
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:11,463
Don't mention it.

542
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,881
Sorry it had to be this late.

543
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:13,965
No worries.

544
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,722
This is my first time
seeing your apartment.

545
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,265
So, you don't live in a spaceship.

546
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,768
Of course not. I just rent an apartment.

547
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,025
Minapuu bought these for everyone.

548
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,109
Really?

549
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,903
-You can have some if you'd like.
-Thanks.

550
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,698
By the way, what kind of sweets
do you guys like?

551
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,742
-I love chocolate treats.
-I love snack foods.

552
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,285
Don't worry, it's all in there.

553
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,457
-Wait, so this is mine?
-Huh?

554
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,293
Like, there are unusually plain ones.

555
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,754
Oh, I bought those thinking
maybe someone would love it.

556
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,173
It's for me, isn't it? For instance, this.

557
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,300
It's totally meant for the old.

558
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,343
But you'll eat it, no?

559
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,845
I mean, since it's here.

560
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,349
I usually eat snack foods
and chocolate treats too, you know?

561
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,767
Oh, is that so?

562
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,814
It seems you think I'm much older
than you all,

563
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,857
but I'm only about 12 years older, okay?

564
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,819
-Wait, really?
-Yeah, I'm 54.

565
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,737
Oh, I just assumed you were around 60.

566
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,906
No, I'm not!
Don't make assumptions like that!

567
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,826
But a 12-year gap is still wide, isn't it?

568
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,412
It's not that big, is it?

569
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,080
What was your childhood game?

570
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,623
Childhood game?

571
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,501
I think it differs for men and women.

572
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,711
-Stilt walking?
-No.

573
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,463
I did that, but it wasn't my main thing.

574
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,965
Then what was?

575
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,636
In my generation, we mostly played with
radio-controlled cars or <i>gunpla.</i>

576
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,722
What is <i>gunpla</i> again?

577
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,140
<i>Gundam</i> plastic models.

578
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,643
-Oh, is it that robot?
-The mobile suit one.

579
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,896
By the way, what did girls play back then?

580
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,231
Girls?

581
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,109
What did they play again?

582
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,737
-Beanbag juggling?
-No.

583
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,613
They did that,
but it wasn't the main thing.

584
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:01,614
So what was?

585
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,742
Let me think…

586
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,618
-Drop the handkerchief?
-No.

587
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,247
Drop the handkerchief isn't really
the main game for any era, is it?

588
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,093
We'll be waiting for you here.
The rest is up to you.

589
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,636
Right, I'm on my own now.

590
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,221
Sorry we couldn't help.

591
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,181
It's fine.

592
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,724
We'll keep an eye on things here.

593
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,102
Do you want to take some sweets with you?

594
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:34,314
No. I'll eat them when I'm back.
Don't pass me the bitter ones.

595
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,066
I thought you could suck on one
while you're doing your stuff.

596
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,693
Fine, I'll have one.

597
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,948
-See you.
-See you.

598
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,530
Nurses have it rough too, huh.

599
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:09,200
I think our department
is easier to work in than most.

600
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,285
Oh, is it?

601
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,704
In urology, we see fewer emergency cases,

602
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,499
resulting in less frequent urgent requests
compared to other departments.

603
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,042
You're right.

604
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:20,336
Isn't performing a urine test unpleasant?

605
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,673
Well, I was a bit hesitant at first,
but now I'm used to it.

606
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,758
The same goes for all jobs.

607
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:27,343
Yeah.

608
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:31,139
There's a window in the bathroom.
When the patient puts the cup down

609
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,142
and leaves, I have to gauge the timing
for when to retrieve the cup.

610
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,353
If I'm too quick, I may have an accidental
face-to-face with the patient.

611
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:39,522
-Then it's a little awkward.
-Oh my god.

612
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:43,026
You haven't encountered them yet,
but it would be awkward if you did.

613
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,069
How do you gauge the timing?

614
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,821
Well, I've got my gut feelings.

615
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,364
Gut feelings?

616
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,950
I thought there was a sensor or something.

617
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,786
-They're not going to spend money on that.
-I see.

618
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:57,373
At my level, I can tell how long
they'll take by their age and ambience.

619
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:01,294
Like oh, this person seems quick,
or this person may need more time.

620
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,129
-You don't have awkward window timing?
-No.

621
00:32:03,212 --> 00:32:05,840
Maybe I had a few times when I was new,
but not now.

622
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,761
But couldn't you just delay your timing?

623
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,347
-Figured an amateur would say that.
-What's wrong?

624
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,142
At my level, the moment the patient places
the cup and closes the window, I open it.

625
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,310
That's impressive.

626
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,939
I do think I'd do quite well in some sort
of urine cup collection contest.

627
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,523
That'd be some twisted contest.

628
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,185
<i>Two more to go.</i>

629
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:03,690
Yeah, in elementary school,
the homeroom teacher teaches all subjects.

630
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,358
Yeah.

631
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,820
So once I leave the staff room
for my classes, I don't usually come back.

632
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:12,532
Now that I think about it, they stayed
in the classroom during breaks too.

633
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,492
Yeah, doing stuff at their desk.

634
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,660
What do they do?

635
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,913
Prepare for the next period,
mark papers, that kind of thing.

636
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,831
You don't rest?

637
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,958
Don't really have time for that.

638
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,752
-What about toilet breaks?
-I don't have time to go.

639
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,922
-What?
-That's why many of them have cystitis.

640
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,924
I didn't know that.

641
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:32,760
Thinking back, I have a few patients
that look like teachers.

642
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,095
Really?

643
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,304
Are you okay then, Hacchi?

644
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,889
Yeah, for the time being.

645
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:38,516
If you have cystitis, come to me.

646
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,728
-Definitely.
-I'll retrieve your cup perfectly.

647
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,162
<i>One more.</i>

648
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,914
How long has he lived there for?

649
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,584
About three months and counting.

650
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,627
I can't imagine how expensive it must be.

651
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,254
You need to have a lot of money
to afford it.

652
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,297
Right.

653
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,675
And he brought shelves, houseplants
and stuff.

654
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,677
-Really making it like his own room.
-Wow.

655
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,929
-The hotel is okay with that?
-If he returns it to normal when he goes.

656
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:18,931
I see.

657
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:22,476
Because he treats the hotel like his home,

658
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,645
he treats us like family too.

659
00:34:24,728 --> 00:34:26,813
-Family?
-Yeah, he'll go "I'm back!"

660
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,274
Really? What do you say to that?

661
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,777
-We'll be like, "Welcome back."
-Right.

662
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,570
But maybe he wants a warmer greeting,

663
00:34:32,652 --> 00:34:34,030
like "Welcome home."

664
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,822
You think so?

665
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,534
-But I don't live there.
-Yeah, you're only there for work.

666
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,286
-I feel a little sorry for him.
-Really?

667
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,331
-Maybe he could pay for optional extras.
-Optional extras?

668
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,208
Like for the staff to treat him
as family as well.

669
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,710
We'll all have different roles.

670
00:34:47,793 --> 00:34:48,960
"Welcome home, Dad!"

671
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,172
-And "My, you're late."
-Grandma?

672
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,007
That's the mom!

673
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,884
Come on, it's obvious that's the mom.

674
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:33,631
What do you do when there's a food
you don't like for school lunch?

675
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:36,467
You can't possibly not eat it
when you're in front of kids, right?

676
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:39,762
Now that I think about it, I've not seen
any teacher waste food.

677
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:43,558
These days, teachers don't tell the kids
not to waste their food like before,

678
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,518
but it still feels awkward to not finish.

679
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,562
Right? So do you force yourself to eat it?

680
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,564
No, I just leave it.

681
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,274
I can't eat cucumbers to save my life.

682
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,567
And that's okay?

683
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,193
What about your dignity as a teacher?

684
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,945
I just need to be sneaky enough.

685
00:35:56,028 --> 00:35:57,738
You don't get caught?

686
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:01,325
The tableware and trash can
are kept at the back of the classroom.

687
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,827
If you're smooth, you're good.

688
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:06,289
I wonder if our teachers did that too.

689
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,415
I think it's likely.

690
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,334
So we're just blind and didn't notice
they didn't finish their food?

691
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,627
Probably.

692
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:13,337
Hold on.

693
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,922
When I was in elementary school,

694
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,509
I wasn't allowed break until I finished
eating some kind of liver stew.

695
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,512
-I can't believe they made you stay back.
-I know, right?

696
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:25,725
And, behind our backs, they usually
don't finish what they dislike, right?

697
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:26,893
Yeah.

698
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,730
Those bastards!

699
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,460
Okay.

700
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,214
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

701
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,716
-This one is good.
-Really?

702
00:36:58,799 --> 00:36:59,634
Yeah.

703
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,970
Wait.

704
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:04,347
What's that?

705
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,976
-Is someone there?
-Seems like it.

706
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:13,022
-What is that person doing?
-He's not school staff, right?

707
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,816
-Normally there aren't staff at this hour.
-So who's that?

708
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,195
Oh, could it be that?

709
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:21,697
You know, geoglyphs.

710
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:22,782
Geoglyphs?

711
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,201
-Didn't you hear the news?
-What was it again?

712
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,662
-Oh, the one found in a school yard?
-Yeah.

713
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,747
-There sure was a news story like that.
-Yeah.

714
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,374
This is the one, look.

715
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,668
It's real.

716
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,337
-It has to be this, right?
-He's the culprit?

717
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,214
So he's just doing it for fun.

718
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,050
Weren't there some people
who said it was the work of aliens?

719
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,385
My junior was one of them.

720
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:45,179
-But there's just no way, right?
-Since we know an alien.

721
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,889
-And he's my colleague too.
-Right?

722
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,141
But seriously, that was a pain for us
to deal with.

723
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,227
Oh right, that was your workplace.

724
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:53,604
Yeah, it's the staff
who remove the geoglyphs.

725
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,939
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

726
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:59,068
A teacher I know had this done to them,
and I heard it was hard to clean up after.

727
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,822
Right. This kind of behavior
is just a nuisance.

728
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:06,701
Right? Like you'd still have to go
to school even if it's a weekend. Come on.

729
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,830
It's disgusting how people mistake
that kind of thing for amusement.

730
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:14,625
You can say that again.
It's real annoying.

731
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:17,628
Okay.

732
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:21,674
Looks great.

733
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,385
It's the best I've ever done, no?

734
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,469
I mean.

735
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,431
-We've gotten better at this, no?
-Yeah, it's of even higher quality.

736
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,057
What's this symbol?

737
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,226
Nothing in particular. I just drew it.

738
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,227
I see.

739
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,645
I tried to make it symbolic.

740
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,481
Yeah, this way it's easier for people
to speculate.

741
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,816
Wow.

742
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,694
In fact, there are those
who believe it's all the work of aliens.

743
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,487
Exactly what we want.

744
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,989
Shall we fix that bit?

745
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,116
-Okay.
-Let's do it.

746
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,787
Should we check things out?

747
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,247
-What do you mean?
-Tell them off.

748
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,583
Don't be silly. They're not the type
who would listen.

749
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:57,251
They might do nasty things to you.

750
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,836
Let's call the police.

751
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:01,714
By the time the police get here,
they'll be gone, won't they?

752
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:02,965
You've got a point.

753
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,467
Oh, let's take a video of them.

754
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,302
Right. That will be proof.

755
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,262
I don't think it'll work at this distance.

756
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:09,847
It might be difficult.

757
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,933
-Nah, it's tough.
-Right?

758
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,438
I think I might be able to get something
if I were a little closer.

759
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,773
I think I'll get out.

760
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,067
No! What if they see you
and they get agitated?

761
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,735
Yeah. We should just call the police.

762
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,445
Yeah.

763
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,156
This is so irritating.

764
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,241
This is my first time calling the police.

765
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,458
-There's someone there.
-What?

766
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,126
Are they watching us?

767
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,170
No, I can't tell.

768
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,339
Did they see us?

769
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,549
We should be fine.

770
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,301
Yeah.

771
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,178
Let's go before the police get here.

772
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,430
Yeah.

773
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:54,392
All that's left is to wait for everyone
to make a fuss over the news

774
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,684
while we enjoy a good drink--

775
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,104
-Hey.
-Huh?

776
00:39:58,187 --> 00:39:59,688
What happene--

777
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,181
What's going on? They collapsed?

778
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,391
Why?

779
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,227
What?

780
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:42,314
YAMANASHI PREFECTURAL POLICE

781
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,402
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

782
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:48,654
My jaw hurts.

783
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,495
Oh, that was you, Takahashi?

784
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,290
Yeah. I hate those people the most.

785
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,291
Is that so?

786
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:03,461
Well, they probably don't know,

787
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,630
but that symbol is super obscene
on our planet.

788
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,007
Really?

789
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,217
It's common as graffiti
in toilets and so on.

790
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,260
Oh my god.

791
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:13,012
When I was a little kid,

792
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:17,641
I once innocently drew something similar
on the ground with chalk.

793
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,769
-My dad was extremely mad with me.
-I see.

794
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:24,190
And they drew that
in an elementary school yard.

795
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,816
-Yeah.
-Oof.

796
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,152
And that school is my alma mater.

797
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,612
-What?
-Really?

798
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,905
I didn't know that.

799
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,742
Yeah, so it felt like both my planet
and alma mater were insulted.

800
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,953
Did you come
because it was your alma mater?

801
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:40,748
There's that,

802
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:44,418
but I also wanted
to see what it looks like now.

803
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,961
I see.

804
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,379
Will you be okay from the side effects?

805
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,881
Yeah.

806
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:52,885
Well, maybe fever, muscle
and joint aches tomorrow.

807
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:53,802
Oh, and stomatitis.

808
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,430
-Stomatitis?
-I shot the candy from my mouth.

809
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,640
I see how it is now.

810
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:00,142
You helped despite knowing
the side effects. Thank you.

811
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:04,271
It's fine. I'll recover to some extent
if I soak in the hotel's hot spring.

812
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,732
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

813
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,568
-Did I not mention it to you?
-No.

814
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,447
The minerals in our hotel's hot spring
are pretty unique.

815
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:17,493
They're really beneficial for the people
from our planet

816
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:19,328
and can help heal our bodies.

817
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,913
What?

818
00:42:20,996 --> 00:42:22,706
Is it like a hot spring treatment?

819
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,960
Well, I don't know how I should put it.

820
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:29,463
You know how in some games there are areas

821
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,966
where you can fully restore your health?

822
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,592
Like a health restoration point?

823
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:34,843
Yeah, something like that.

824
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,428
Isn't that cool?

825
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,349
Yeah, those minerals
help boost my abilities,

826
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,811
but conversely, if I don't soak regularly,
my immune system will be compromised.

827
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,646
I didn't know hot springs do that.

828
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,691
Is that why you often use the hot spring?

829
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:51,986
Yeah, I need to soak once every two days.

830
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,738
I see.

831
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,074
I thought you didn't have a bathroom
at home.

832
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,784
That's not it.

833
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,828
It's just that the hot spring quality
is unique.

834
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,165
Only the bitter ones are left.

835
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,626
Sorry. You're not going to eat then?

836
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:08,711
I'll eat them.

837
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,091
<i>Oh, by the way,</i>

838
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:19,054
<i>the fact that the one who initially</i>
<i>got the ball stuck to the ceiling…</i>

839
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,897
-It's stuck.
<i>-…was me.</i>

840
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,486
<i>It's a secret I'll carry to my grave.</i>

841
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:48,042
<i>Up next is an ancient debate</i>
<i>that revolves around Mount Fuji.</i>

842
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,544
<i>Shizuoka or Yamanashi.</i>

843
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,421
<i>Mediated by Chuusai Japan!</i>

844
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:54,798
Oh, they caught the culprit.

845
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,550
What is it?

846
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:00,638
There were people who drew strange symbols
in the school yard.

847
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,517
Oh, there was news about it.
They did it for fun, right?

848
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:06,769
Seems like it.

849
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,146
Ah, warmth is just what I need.

850
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:11,857
<i>When we ask the locals,</i>

851
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:13,192
<i>Mount Fuji.</i>

852
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:16,403
<i>Shizuoka or Yamanashi, who do you think</i>
<i>it belongs to?</i>

853
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,113
<i>Hmm…</i>

854
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:20,783
-That's Asada's Aeon.
<i>-If you're going to put it like that.</i>

855
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,618
-It really is.
<i>-Yamanashi?</i>

856
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,454
Oh, this was the interview
Minapuu said she was in.

857
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,789
-Really?
-Yeah.

858
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,332
And Yumi at work.

859
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,460
-So they'll show up?
-Probably.

860
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:37,216
<i>I occasionally get this question</i>
<i>from those outside of Yamanashi,</i>

861
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,884
<i>but honestly, I don't care either way.</i>

862
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,970
People don't usually think
about this anyway.

863
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:45,099
Yeah, it doesn't belong to either
of them to begin with.

864
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:49,144
<i>The Mount Fuji problem,</i>
<i>often regarded as an ancient debate…</i>

865
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,270
MOUNT FUJI ANCIENT DEBATE

866
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:54,858
<i>…did not seem too much of a deal to locals</i>
<i>prior to any mediation efforts.</i>

867
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,235
LOCALS NOT TOO CONCERNED

868
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,154
<i>Up next is the battle</i>
<i>for the third-largest population in Kanto…</i>

869
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:02,282
They weren't featured.

870
00:45:03,742 --> 00:45:05,494
Maybe they were cut.

871
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,829
Okay.

872
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:11,166
<i>Maybe the era of reading</i>
<i>the intention of the production is over.</i>

873
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,878
Wait, where's my milk tea?

874
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:17,464
Didn't you go shopping yesterday?

875
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:20,968
I forgot.

876
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:24,263
So, you only bought toilet paper?

877
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,891
I also forgot about that.

878
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,228
Then why did you even go there?

879
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,398
Oops.

880
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,692
I guess it slipped my mind.

881
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,157
<i>That's right. That's all there is to it.</i>

882
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,618
<i>Age has nothing to do with this.</i>

883
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,663
