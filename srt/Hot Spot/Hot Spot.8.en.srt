00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:08,842
<i>I'm actually from the future.</i>

2
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:11,553
‪Huh?‬

3
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:13,638
I'm from the future.

4
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,939
When you say you’re from the future,
you mean…

5
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:27,819
-You traveled here from the future?
-Yes, from 50 years into the future.

6
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,114
Fifty years?

7
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:37,037
I know it’s a lot to take in.

8
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,664
Oh, no, well…

9
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,127
I'm actually an alien.

10
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:49,632
<i>I must have gotten used to sci-fi stuff…</i>

11
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:50,759
I believe you.

12
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,596
-Really?
-Yes.

13
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,265
-Thank you.
<i>-Because I took it pretty well.</i>

14
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:05,190
Wait, does that mean that in 50 years,
time machines will exist?

15
00:01:05,272 --> 00:01:07,525
Not exactly.

16
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:13,364
You know the old tunnel
in that hill over there?

17
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:15,617
What tunnel?

18
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,660
When Asano Lake station closed,

19
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,997
-the railway line was abandoned, right?
-Oh, yeah.

20
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,627
‪YEAR 2074‬

21
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:31,925
<i>Well, further down,</i>
<i>there’s this old tunnel.</i>

22
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:35,220
<i>I was out for a walk around the area</i>
<i>and discovered it by accident.</i>

23
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:43,186
<i>I recalled going in with my friends</i>
<i>when I was a student.</i>

24
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,690
<i>I felt nostalgic, so I went in again.</i>

25
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,909
<i>I think I walked about 200 meters</i>

26
00:02:01,287 --> 00:02:05,208
<i>before coming out the other side…</i>

27
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,135
<i>Even though I should have been familiar</i>
<i>with the scenery,</i>

28
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,971
<i>something felt strangely off.</i>

29
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,517
<i>-Something felt off?</i>
<i>-You see.</i>

30
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,856
<i>Things that should’ve been gone</i>
<i>were still there,</i>

31
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,860
<i>and things that should’ve been built</i>
<i>were missing.</i>

32
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,823
<i>But the rest looked strangely familiar,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

33
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,414
<i>Just as I was wandering around,</i>
<i>wondering what was going on,</i>

34
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:50,295
<i>I saw a convenience store</i>
<i>that had been closed for years.</i>

35
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,050
<i>I went inside…</i>

36
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,346
<i>and checked a few magazines and so on…</i>

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,723
FEBRUARY 2024

38
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:07,520
<i>…and that’s when I realized</i>
<i>I was 50 years in the past.</i>

39
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,482
<i>I got frightened</i>

40
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,946
<i>and hurried back through the tunnel.</i>

41
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:24,162
I kept this to myself and went on
with my life as usual,

42
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,998
but I couldn’t stop thinking about it.

43
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:33,421
Are things completely different
50 years in the future?

44
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:38,218
Yes, especially around here.
The Lake Hotel will be gone too.

45
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,637
I see.

46
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,226
What gets built
after the hotel shuts down?

47
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,563
-Some city-run facility. I'm not sure.
-Is that so?

48
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:55,735
So before it’s all gone,
I decided to take photos of everything.

49
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,070
That's why I was taking shots.

50
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:01,407
I also had another reason.

51
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,576
-What's that?
-Well.

52
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:09,207
I wanted to see my younger self
and my family again.

53
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:12,460
Oh, I see! Were you able to do so?

54
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,213
Yeah. Actually,
you met them recently, too.

55
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,130
‪Huh?‬

56
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:19,091
Were they guests at our hotel?

57
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:22,804
Yes! Hirotaka Murakami
is actually not my real name.

58
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,098
-Really?
-I figured.

59
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,143
That if someone with my exact name
showed up, it would raise suspicion.

60
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:32,897
So I just flipped the syllables
of my first and last name around.

61
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:41,155
Okay, so Hirotaka Murakami
becomes Takahiro Kamimura?

62
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,494
Takahiro Uemura!

63
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,918
-Wait, so your younger self…
-He came to stay recently.

64
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,088
-Mr. Uemura, we've been expecting you.
-That’s what I wanted to see.

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,132
Congratulations

66
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,801
-on passing your exam.
<i>-It was an emotional sight.</i>

67
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,471
<i>Fifty years from now,</i>
<i>my parents will have passed away,</i>

68
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,974
<i>my younger sister will be an old lady…</i>

69
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,936
<i>I didn't know that was you!</i>

70
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:18,985
And, if my memory’s right, the hotel
shut down right after that family trip.

71
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:24,032
-Is that so?
-That's why I thought you already knew.

72
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,409
No, we had no idea.

73
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,161
Really?

74
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:33,833
Lately, you've all been kind to me,
giving me handwarmers and so on.

75
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:40,757
I thought you were doing that for regulars
because the hotel is shutting down soon.

76
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:47,638
Oh, that? No, we just felt like doing it.

77
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:53,269
<i>I can't possibly admit I was trying</i>
<i>to get my hands on his inheritance.</i>

78
00:05:56,397 --> 00:05:59,567
Oh no, look at the time.
Sorry, I kept talking forever.

79
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:03,279
Not at all. Thanks for sharing
your secret with me.

80
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:07,742
If there’s ever anything you need,
just let me know. I'd be glad to help.

81
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:08,910
Okay.

82
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,874
Actually… Mr. Mura, I mean, Mr. Uemura.
There is one thing I'd like to ask.

83
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:19,045
-What is it?
-If you don't mind.

84
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:24,133
Could I share this with my childhood
friends whom I really trust?

85
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,593
-Your childhood friends?
-Yes.

86
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,429
-Sure.
-Really?

87
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,266
I mean, if you trust them,
then I don't see an issue.

88
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,977
Thank you!

89
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:39,565
<i>People who come from the future</i>
<i>are way more generous than aliens.</i>

90
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:49,534
LAKE HOTEL

91
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,882
I'm back.

92
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,977
-When's your match?
-On the 30th.

93
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,565
-Where are you playing?
<i>-I can't talk about the hotel closing yet.</i>

94
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,649
Oh, yeah.

95
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,694
<i>If I just suddenly told her I met someone</i>
<i>who came from the future,</i>

96
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:30,408
<i>she'd be more freaked out about that</i>
<i>than the hotel closing.</i>

97
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,409
Oh, and…

98
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:36,998
<i>That's also why I haven’t</i>
<i>mentioned Takahashi to her either.</i>

99
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,499
Not really.

100
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,127
Who did you hear that from?

101
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:45,339
There's this guy who's been staying
at our hotel for about three months now.

102
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,633
His name is Murakami.

103
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,261
-Oh, I think you mentioned him before.
-Yeah.

104
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:54,599
It turns out he's actually…

105
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,977
from the future.

106
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:00,855
Come again?

107
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:02,732
From the future?

108
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,649
‪Yeah.‬

109
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:12,492
-By the way, how far into the future?
-Fifty years, he said.

110
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,869
That's quite the time leap.

111
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:19,332
<i>They both accepted the fact he came</i>
<i>from the future way more easily than me.</i>

112
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:26,047
<i>They've probably become more accepting</i>
<i>of sci-fi stuff since meeting Takahashi.</i>

113
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,924
Does Mr. Takahashi know about this?

114
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,926
No.

115
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:31,928
Why do you ask?

116
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,058
Wouldn’t the hotel shutting down
affect him the most?

117
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,226
Wait, you're right.

118
00:08:38,308 --> 00:08:40,602
If the hot spring goes,
that’s bad news for him.

119
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,063
What will he do?

120
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,985
I wonder what he's up to today?

121
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,238
Feels like it’s been a while.

122
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,281
I think it's been a month
since we last met like this.

123
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,533
Oh, is that right?

124
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:57,370
Sorry, I’ve been busy with work lately,
so I haven't been able to join you.

125
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:02,500
-Don't worry about it.
<i>-I'm not sure what he was apologizing for.</i>

126
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,963
<i>But anyway, it has been a while</i>
<i>since the four of us got together.</i>

127
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,548
Um…

128
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,385
There’s something I need to tell you.

129
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,888
-What, is it about my abilities again?
-Nope.

130
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,807
-Then what, my <i>gunpla?</i>
-That's not it either.

131
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,766
Then what is it?

132
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,684
‪Well…‬

133
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:25,523
-This is just between us for now.
-Okay.

134
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:29,235
But apparently our hotel is shutting down.

135
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,655
Huh? Why is that?

136
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,575
I don’t know the details yet

137
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:40,663
but there's this guest
called Mr. Murakami, right?

138
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:45,001
-Mr. Murakami? Oh, the long-term guest.
-Yeah.

139
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,628
I heard the news from him the other day.

140
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,756
-Why would Mr. Murakami know about this?
-Well…

141
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,969
He’s actually…

142
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,848
from the future.

143
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,061
I said he's from the future.

144
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:10,651
-From the future?
-That's how he knows it's shutting down.

145
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,322
-Are you serious about this?
-Yeah.

146
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,325
Has she been brainwashed or what?

147
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,910
-No, I don’t think so.
-She doesn't seem to be lying.

148
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:24,624
-Come on. That’s ridiculous.
-Why do you say so?

149
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,668
It's common sense! What do you mean
he came from the future?

150
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,672
This isn't a movie, you know?

151
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,508
I can't believe
I wasted my attention on this.

152
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,428
<i>At that moment,</i>
<i>the three of us were all probably</i>

153
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,014
<i>thinking the same thing.</i>

154
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,724
You watch too many movies.

155
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,059
<i>Look who's talking!</i>

156
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,602
-Thank you for waiting!
-Thank you.

157
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,436
Enjoy!

158
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:52,193
I get why it's hard to believe someone
claiming to be from the future.

159
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,072
-It is a bit far-fetched.
-Right? You shouldn't believe that stuff.

160
00:10:56,155 --> 00:11:00,409
But you're just as unbelievable as he is.

161
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:05,206
What? I'm not from the future,
I'm an alien. Don't lump us together.

162
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:10,378
Someone from the future and an alien
are equally unbelievable, aren't they?

163
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,839
No way! Aliens are much more realistic.

164
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,508
Is that so?

165
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,552
-I'd categorize them together.
-What do you mean?

166
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:21,305
-They're both part of the sci-fi genre.
-No, listen.

167
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,601
You can group things however you want,
but I don't consider myself sci-fi.

168
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,561
-You don't?
-Of course not.

169
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,147
Sci-fi is short for
science fiction, right?

170
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,902
-But I actually exist, so I'm not fiction.
-You've got a point, I guess.

171
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:38,823
In my eyes, someone from the future
is sci-fi, but an alien is non-fiction!

172
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,409
‪I see…‬

173
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:46,080
-But you like <i>E.T.,</i> right?
-Yeah.

174
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,165
Isn't <i>E.T.</i> a sci-fi movie?

175
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:51,460
As I said, that's how you see it.

176
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,672
-I don't treat it as a sci-fi movie.
-Then what do you see it as?

177
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,383
A human drama, I guess?

178
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,928
-<i>E.T.</i>, that is?
-In my eyes, yeah.

179
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,597
The abilities in it
are a little exaggerated…

180
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,516
But hey, aliens do exist.

181
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,518
Right.

182
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,398
There's no way he's from the future.
The hotel thing is just a false rumor.

183
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,401
Come on, now.

184
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:16,986
‪What?‬

185
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,863
I did what I could.

186
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,366
<i>-A few days later, the manager told us.</i>
-I'm really sorry about this.

187
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,535
<i>That the hotel was shutting down.</i>

188
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,038
-Was it really that bad?
<i>-What I heard was this.</i>

189
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:33,627
<i>The owner bought the hotel five years ago,</i>
<i>expecting a tourism boom.</i>

190
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,047
<i>But the numbers never took off</i>
<i>like she hoped,</i>

191
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,800
<i>so she'd been thinking</i>
<i>about selling it for a while now,</i>

192
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:43,679
<i>and recently,</i>
<i>it seems she'd found a buyer.</i>

193
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,558
‪MONT BLANC‬

194
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,976
So it was true after all.

195
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,646
Just what's with Mr. Murakami?

196
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,941
I told you, he's from the future.

197
00:12:56,025 --> 00:13:00,613
-You're still on about that?
-Well, everything happened like he said.

198
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,240
Yeah, but there's no way
he's really from the future.

199
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,951
Then how did he know
the hotel was shutting down?

200
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:10,164
Maybe he's a time leaper or something.

201
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,628
-A time leaper?
-Yeah.

202
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,464
That's someone who jumps back
to relive the same time period.

203
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,759
‪Huh?‬

204
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,929
If he was a time leaper,
you'd believe that?

205
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:29,350
More than him being from the future.
Though it's less realistic than aliens.

206
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,813
<i>At that moment, the three of us</i>
<i>were probably all thinking the same thing.</i>

207
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,441
<i>They're all the same!</i>

208
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,484
But there's no way.

209
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,700
LAKE HOTEL

210
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,541
-Good morning.
-Thank you for your work.

211
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,586
-Is the manager in?
-Oh, yes. He's in the back office.

212
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,755
Okay.

213
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:10,015
When the hotel shuts down, you'll be
the one who's most affected, right?

214
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,517
Yeah.

215
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,105
Before you worked there,
how did you get into the hot spring?

216
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:20,568
Oh, back then, before the hotel was built,
it was a public bath.

217
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:25,155
-I didn't know that.
-Dad and I always went when I was a kid.

218
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,366
I see.

219
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:31,287
Why did your dad come to Earth
to begin with?

220
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,707
About 100 years ago,

221
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:38,252
our home planet was in serious trouble.

222
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,004
What kind of trouble?

223
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,549
There's an element which is essential
for the health of people from our planet,

224
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:49,555
but it was gradually disappearing
because of overpopulation and pollution.

225
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,516
-That does sound like trouble.
-That's when

226
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,936
we began hatching plans
to relocate.

227
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,731
Oh, this sounds like a movie plot.

228
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:06,322
My grandfather, grandmother, and dad
left our planet together on a spaceship,

229
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:09,491
but they hit some space debris
along the way.

230
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:14,330
-What's space debris?
-Space junk. Like satellite remains.

231
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,917
Then they made an emergency landing
on Earth.

232
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:25,382
Rescue never came, so they gave up
and stayed, blending in with humans.

233
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,427
It's like they were castaways.

234
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:33,891
Yeah, and when they looked into whether
the element I mentioned was on Earth,

235
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:37,895
it turned out that there's a small amount
of it in the air near Mount Fuji's base.

236
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,897
-That's right where we are now.
-Exactly.

237
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,943
So they kept searching for places
that had a higher concentration,

238
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:49,448
and they found out that the hot spring
where the hotel is now was the hot spot.

239
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,909
Wow!

240
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,287
Apparently they snuck in late at night
when no one was around.

241
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,248
-They were trespassing?
-I guess so.

242
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,001
-That was your tactic at the gym.
-Don't call it that.

243
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,837
-I only did it because you asked me to.
-Well, yeah.

244
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:08,342
Anyway, they couldn’t live
like that forever, so my grandparents

245
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,136
started intercepting radio waves,

246
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,808
picked up the local language,
and used a translation device to learn it.

247
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,978
That sounds insanely challenging.

248
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:23,899
That's when they really
started blending in.

249
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,404
After that, my dad eventually

250
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:32,574
married my mom, whom he'd met at work,
and then I was born.

251
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:41,000
Did your mom know he wasn’t human?

252
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,586
No. Apparently, she found out
right before they got married.

253
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,922
-No way!
-That must have been quite a shock.

254
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,884
-At first, she didn’t believe him at all.
-That's natural.

255
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:55,180
Then, when did you find out
you weren’t human, Mr. Takahashi?

256
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,350
Well…

257
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,102
‪YEAR 1980‬

258
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,606
<i>That was about 40 years ago.</i>

259
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,608
‪Hey, if isn't shorty!‬

260
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,153
‪Oh yeah!‬
‪You haven't grown a bit, have you?‬

261
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,988
<i>It all started over something minor.</i>

262
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,531
<i>I was surrounded by older students.</i>

263
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:14,907
-Come on.
-What kind of thing?

264
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:19,454
-Show us!
-<i>I don’t remember much from back then…</i>

265
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,498
-Show us!
-<i>All I remember</i>

266
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:25,544
<i>is wanting to get away.</i>
<i>And the next thing I knew…</i>

267
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,462
Show us!

268
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,475
-Hey, are you okay?
-What happened?

269
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,146
-Hey, are you okay?
-Pull yourself together!

270
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,943
-Are you okay?
-Does it hurt?

271
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,821
Can someone get the school nurse?

272
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,740
‪Somebody get the first aid kit!‬

273
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,912
<i>They were on the ground, crying.</i>

274
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,580
<i>That scene is all I remember.</i>

275
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:09,129
<i>The next day, the school called home,</i>

276
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,508
<i>and my mom was asked to come in.</i>

277
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:15,219
See you, Takkun, Shunchan.

278
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,308
I'm really sorry for what my son did.

279
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:25,354
No, we should we be the ones apologizing.
Our sons messed with him first.

280
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,231
Say sorry.

281
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,483
Sorry.

282
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,529
-You too, Kousuke.
-Sorry.

283
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,415
Are you feeling down?

284
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,672
Well, they were the ones
who picked a fight, right?

285
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:56,844
-They hit me first.
-What?

286
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:01,682
Then, what you did was self-defense.

287
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,435
-What's that?
-If you act out of necessity

288
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,107
to protect yourself or your rights,
it's self-defense,

289
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,567
and you won't be punished.

290
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:17,406
-So I'm not in the wrong?
-Hmm, well…

291
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:21,535
You need to be careful
not to use excessive force.

292
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:26,957
-What's that?
-If you go too far, even in self-defense,

293
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,251
you can get punished.

294
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,463
-Was this excessive force?
-Hmm…

295
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,302
-You did send those kids flying, right?
-Yeah.

296
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,597
Well, others might see it
as excessive force.

297
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,018
But I know you’re a good kid,

298
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:51,148
and I'm on your side. So, let’s call it…

299
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,236
-Borderline acceptable.
-Really?

300
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,197
-Just this once, okay?
-Okay.

301
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,117
But the next time this happens…

302
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,870
just run!

303
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,837
-Okay?
-Okay.

304
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,255
Alright then.

305
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:19,343
-Let’s drop by Mont Blanc on the way home.
-Yeah!

306
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,512
-Don't tell Dad, okay?
-Okay!

307
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,432
-He really wanted to eat their parfait.
-Yeah.

308
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,811
-Let's run!
-Oh, you!

309
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:37,986
Oh, so this café has been around
since then?

310
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,240
Yeah, it had just opened back then.

311
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,368
Was the menu as big as it is now?

312
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,870
-I don’t recall.
-Did they have Hidden Surprise Parfait?

313
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,372
Not yet. Wait a minute.

314
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,375
You're focusing on that?

315
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:56,463
I just told a really sweet story about
my mom. Aren't you curious about her?

316
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,592
Your mom was really kind.

317
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,386
-Yeah, she's an amazing mom.
-Exactly.

318
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:06,807
If she weren’t, she wouldn’t have married
my dad.

319
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,601
-And I wouldn’t even have been born.
-You're right.

320
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:14,356
I heard you got into a fight
with some older students, Kousuke?

321
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:20,570
They surrounded him
and he sent them flying involuntarily.

322
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,490
Really? You got the moves, huh?

323
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,537
Well…

324
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:33,709
I guess you figured out today
that you're really powerful, right?

325
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,087
Do you know why you were able to do that?

326
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:39,840
No.

327
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,677
Because you're my son.

328
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,097
-Because I'm your son?
-That’s right.

329
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:52,352
Here, watch this.

330
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,649
Wow!

331
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,485
Try it yourself, Kousuke.

332
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,575
Focus your strength
on your fingers and squeeze.

333
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,791
-I did it!
-See?

334
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,588
Now as to why I'm able to do that,

335
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:23,133
it's because I'm not an Earthling.

336
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,678
Not an Earthling? Then you're an alien?

337
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:31,308
Well, that's what
people here would call me.

338
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,851
Then what am I?

339
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:38,106
You were born and raised here,
so you are an Earthling.

340
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,943
But since you’re my son,
that makes you half alien.

341
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,740
Do you have amazing abilities too, Mom?

342
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,452
Me? Well…

343
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:58,960
not at all.

344
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,464
-But she is kind, isn’t she?
-Yeah!

345
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:10,680
So, you were born from a super-strong dad
and a really kind mom.

346
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:15,227
-Meaning you've got strength and kindness.
-In short, the best of both worlds.

347
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,523
But Kousuke, you see,

348
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:23,193
I avoid using my abilities.

349
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,821
-Why?
-Because.

350
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:29,032
If I did, people would freak out.

351
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:34,746
And if they found out I was an alien,

352
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,250
I might be taken away
by government agents.

353
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,543
Really?

354
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,253
‪Haven't you seen?‬

355
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:44,631
Those pictures of aliens
that were captured in the US.

356
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,968
Are those real?

357
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:52,806
Who knows? But if I got caught,
I might end up just like them.

358
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,225
Okay.

359
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,106
So, from now on,
no more using your abilities.

360
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,400
I can't use them?

361
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,280
You don’t need them to get by.

362
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,161
And no telling anyone
about you being an alien, okay?

363
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:19,583
-Not even Takkun and Shunchan?
-Nope. Promise me, okay?

364
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:25,672
-Okay.
-Oh, but you can tell them how kind I am.

365
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,299
Yeah, that's fine.

366
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,262
Alright, that's enough of this topic.

367
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,647
By the way, I’ve been wondering.

368
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:46,568
-Did you two eat before this?
-Huh?

369
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:51,323
-Well, you’re not eating as much as usual.
-You think so?

370
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,913
Did you two go to Mont Blanc?

371
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,789
No, we didn't.

372
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,499
-Yeah.
-Kousuke,

373
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,627
Focus your nose and sniff.

374
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,133
Hey! We just talked
about not using abilities!

375
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,844
You smelled fresh cream, didn't you?

376
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:19,434
You two had parfait without me, right?

377
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:24,689
Hurry up and eat
so you can go take a bath.

378
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,278
That's not kind of you, is it?

379
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,078
OPEN-AIR BATH

380
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,540
Are you feeling better?

381
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,084
-Yes.
-That's great to hear.

382
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:52,509
There are things called side effects.
They happen after you use your abilities.

383
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:58,640
This time was minor, but if you’re
not careful, it could be life-threatening.

384
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,685
So no more using your abilities, okay?

385
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,692
<i>You have great parents.</i>

386
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,737
-Your dad must’ve been really dependable.
-Yeah.

387
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,533
-But sometimes he was careless.
-Really?

388
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,036
Well, I remember this one time
when he nearly exposed us to the world.

389
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,747
-How so?
-Back when I was little,

390
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:28,086
he was walking near a vineyard in Kofu and
called out to a kid who looked like me.

391
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:31,673
But it wasn’t me. Then that kid

392
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,801
freaked out and ran around screaming
that an alien touched his shoulder.

393
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:39,264
Oh, wow. But I thought
your dad looked human.

394
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,350
But the thing is,
it was freezing that day,

395
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,770
so he happened to be wearing this heavy
winter outfit he brought from our planet.

396
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,816
Not to mention, it was silver
and really looked like a space suit.

397
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:55,655
Come on, of course they'd get suspicious
if you wore something like that!

398
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,450
Sorry, I let my guard down.

399
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,369
‪ENCOUNTER WITH AN ALIEN‬

400
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,955
-I think I heard about that.
-Right?

401
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:10,545
We managed to stay under the radar,
but after that, we got even more cautious.

402
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,799
So, Takahashi, you never used
your abilities at all?

403
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:20,305
-Nope, and I never told anyone.
-Not a single person? That’s impressive.

404
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,434
-I’d totally spill to Kiichan and Hacchi.
-Same.

405
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:27,812
Trust me, I wanted
to tell my childhood friends too.

406
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:29,856
YEAR 1982

407
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,608
-Wait, seriously?
-No way!

408
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,318
So you can't tell anyone, okay?

409
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,528
You're the only ones who know about this.

410
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:36,571
‪Okay…‬

411
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:39,240
-Promise not to tell anyone?
-Yeah.

412
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:42,369
-Okay then, we should each share a secret.
-Yeah.

413
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,371
-Sure.
-Oh, I'm curious!

414
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,955
-I’ll go first.
-Okay.

415
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,707
I have a crush…

416
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,002
-On Kanemoto.
-What? No way!

417
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:53,963
I'm serious.
So you guys better not say a word.

418
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:57,759
-Okay.
-Next, Kousuke.

419
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,844
Well…

420
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,522
I watch <i>11 P.M.</i> every week.

421
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,316
Really? You perv!

422
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,404
-I’ve seen it before, but weekly? Damn!
-You guys better not tell anyone.

423
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:21,950
-Of course.
-Didn't know you were that kind of person!

424
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,827
From now on, you're Erosuke!

425
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,747
-See you, Kousuke!
-See you tomorrow!

426
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,877
Oh by the way, did you know that…

427
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:47,434
-I'm back.
-Oh, hey! Wash up and rinse your mouth.

428
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:59,112
YEAR 1989

429
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,866
-You have a telegram.
-Thank you.

430
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,620
<i>After graduating from high school…</i>

431
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,043
<i>I applied to Yamanashi University,</i>
<i>School of Medicine…</i>

432
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,796
-You did it! Congratulations!
<i>-And I managed to get in.</i>

433
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,049
-Congratulations!
-That's great!

434
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,386
-Congratulations.
-You worked hard.

435
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,140
Uh… Kousuke.

436
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:31,478
-Just to be sure…
-Yeah?

437
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,897
You didn’t use your abilities, right?

438
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,525
Huh? Nope.

439
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,820
What kind of question is that?
He got in fair and square! Right?

440
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,406
-Yeah.
-Okay. My bad.

441
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,993
I'm not doubting him,

442
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,246
but if he did use his abilities,
there’d be consequences.

443
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,332
-Like what?
-Well…

444
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,709
Boosting your knowledge
like that makes you go bald.

445
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,796
-What?
-That's the side effect?

446
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:02,759
And if you're in a school
where you can't keep up on your own,

447
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,385
you'd have to keep using abilities.

448
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:08,556
Then by graduation,
he'd be bald as an egg!

449
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,935
But hey, if Kousuke did it all on his own,
there’s nothing to worry about!

450
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,478
Yeah. Right?

451
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:19,025
<i>After that, I got really scared</i>

452
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,946
<i>so I decided to come clean</i>
<i>to my parents. I apologized,</i>

453
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:26,324
<i>and asked to drop out</i>
<i>of school right away.</i>

454
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,538
That’s when I really learned
I shouldn't mess with my abilities.

455
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,873
Wait, so the hot spring
doesn’t cure baldness?

456
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,544
Nope. That's why my hair
is a little thin now.

457
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:44,008
I'm not naturally bald; I'm like this
because of my abilities.

458
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,969
‪Yeah.‬

459
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:50,515
-Not naturally bald?
-I mean I don't lose hair naturally.

460
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,183
I'm not the balding type.

461
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:58,606
-I see.
-You keep emphasizing that.

462
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:03,403
But isn’t this worse
than going bald naturally?

463
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,029
What? Why is that?

464
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:10,118
Well, if you go bald because of genes
or age, that’s just life.

465
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,538
-Right.
-But you lost your hair

466
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:17,750
because you cheated to get into university
and that was the price you had to pay.

467
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,210
Yeah.

468
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,754
-You cheated to become bald.
-What?

469
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,549
It's not like I cheated during the exams.
It was perfectly fair.

470
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,551
But you didn't work for it,
so it's cheating.

471
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,262
-That's karma for you.
-What?

472
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,056
-This is like a folktale.
-Yeah. It has this air to it.

473
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,350
<i>How an Old Man Cheated and Lost his Hair.</i>

474
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,561
Don't compare me to a folktale!

475
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,106
We have so many regular guests

476
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:43,902
-who consistently return to our hotel.
-So I've heard.

477
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,782
Some staff might also find it tough
to get re-employed at their age.

478
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:54,704
-That's true.
-Is there any chance you could reconsider?

479
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:04,380
So after that, you didn't attend
university at all?

480
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:08,635
I did plan to take the exams for other
universities without using my abilities.

481
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,763
I took a gap year, working part-time
and studying every day.

482
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,598
That's commendable.

483
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:17,226
-Yeah, trying again but without abilities.
-You think so?

484
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:23,232
Honestly, when I got into Yamanashi
University School of Medicine,

485
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:27,654
I didn’t feel that much
of a sense of achievement.

486
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:31,157
It made me realize that I shouldn’t rely
on my abilities

487
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,077
-but instead focus on the knowledge--
-Sorry to interrupt.

488
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,788
That's not something
to be proud of anyway.

489
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:40,583
-What do you mean?
-That's how it should be to begin with.

490
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,169
You're right.

491
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,674
So, what university did you end up
applying to?

492
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,759
I wasn't able to apply, actually.

493
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,762
YEAR 1989

494
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:12,407
BATH CLOSURE NOTICE

495
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:30,008
What's the matter? That was quick.

496
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,926
-The bath closed down!
-What did you say?

497
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,642
<i>-It's like what we're facing now.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

498
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:43,646
-So that's when the Lake Hotel was built?
-Yeah.

499
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,316
I didn't know that.

500
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,153
And it took years to finish…

501
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,658
-Oh, that means you couldn't get in.
-Yeah.

502
00:33:55,742 --> 00:34:01,330
-How did you survive then?
-We sneaked into the building at night.

503
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:05,668
-That trick again.
-We had no choice. It was about survival.

504
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,254
Right.

505
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,300
But someone must have seen us.
The police were called.

506
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:14,177
What happened then?

507
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,473
-The security got way tighter.
-That sucks.

508
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:24,353
But I managed to sneak through and fill
some containers with hot spring water.

509
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:30,693
Naturally, it wasn't enough.
Since I'm half human and was still young,

510
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:35,031
I wasn't that affected,
but my grandparents and dad

511
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,699
started to feel the effects.

512
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,164
In the end, just before
the hotel was finished,

513
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,876
they all passed away.

514
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,505
That's so heartbreaking.

515
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,217
I didn't realize
there was that side to the story.

516
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:03,017
-Sorry for making you tell us all of this.
-Don't worry about it.

517
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:08,689
Looking back, just surviving on Earth
till then, ever since they crash-landed,

518
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,441
was already a miracle in itself.

519
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:16,155
How old were they when they passed?

520
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:20,618
I think my grandparents were about 130,

521
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,995
and my dad was 94.

522
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,213
I bet you're thinking
that's pretty long, right?

523
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,800
-No.
-I can tell from your faces.

524
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,136
You're overthinking it.

525
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:41,806
Yeah, I was just thinking
it must have been hard for you.

526
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:45,768
Really? But I'm sure you thought
they lived longer than expected, right?

527
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,314
Right?

528
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,737
Well… yeah.

529
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:02,827
-I guess.
-But our average lifespan is 200 years.

530
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,290
-That long?
-From that perspective, they died young.

531
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:09,709
When you put it that way, then yeah.

532
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:14,130
Then, how old were your parents
when they had you?

533
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,968
My mom was 30, and my dad was 73.

534
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:24,557
-That's a huge age gap.
-Yeah.

535
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,310
It's different from what I was imagining.

536
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:33,065
He looked young because of the long
lifespan, so he only seemed a bit older.

537
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,359
I see.

538
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:39,071
-Wait, how old are you again?
-Fifty-four.

539
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,742
-What would that be in human years?
-Still 54.

540
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,369
What am I, a dog?

541
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:50,750
-But aging is different for you, right?
-Yeah, but you don't have to say it.

542
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,212
I see. Then, how did you survive?

543
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:59,967
Right after my parents passed away,
the Lake Hotel was finished.

544
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:04,889
Initially, I stayed there for a few days
a week to soak in the hot springs,

545
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,099
but things got tough financially,

546
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,353
so I decided to work there.

547
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:13,814
Oh, then you could
enter the hot spring openly.

548
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,984
Wait,

549
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:23,282
so you've lived all this time without
telling anyone or using your abilities?

550
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,408
Yeah.

551
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:28,246
But you used your abilities
to save me, right?

552
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:33,668
-I did.
-And you helped with our trivial requests.

553
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,419
Why is that?

554
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,381
Well…

555
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:44,136
-How's the hotel?
<i>-It was about ten years ago.</i>

556
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,349
<i>I was on my way home with my mom after</i>
<i>a day out for the first time in ages.</i>

557
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:54,105
-Are you able to soak in the hot springs?
-Yeah, every two days, on the night shift.

558
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,356
That's good.

559
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,196
-Shall we go to Mont Blanc?
-Yeah, let's go.

560
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,573
I'll see if there's a spot for us.

561
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,749
MONT BLANC

562
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,716
-It's fine, there are seats.
-Really?

563
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,867
All this time,

564
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:53,164
I told myself I couldn't use my abilities
and I sealed them away…

565
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,542
so I just couldn't react.

566
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:04,008
That regret has always lingered
within me ever since…

567
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,595
TWO MONTHS AGO

568
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:40,753
Are you okay?

569
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:44,924
Yes.

570
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,311
I had no idea…

571
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:03,192
I'm sorry for all the trivial things
we've asked you to do.

572
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,860
Don't worry about it.

573
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,947
Thank you for everything you've done.

574
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,534
But, your mom in heaven

575
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,036
would be so proud of you now.

576
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,622
I’m sure of it.

577
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:22,420
Yeah, she was so kind-hearted.

578
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,090
Listen…

579
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:29,802
she's not dead.

580
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,475
My mom is still alive, okay?

581
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,021
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

582
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,484
From the way you were talking,
I thought she'd passed away.

583
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,946
Oh, no, she broke a bone,
but she’s still around.

584
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:51,866
Okay.

585
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:56,537
-I'm glad to hear that.
-She's still alive and kicking, okay?

586
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:05,087
-Have you thought about getting married?
-Honestly, no.

587
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,464
Why not?

588
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:10,509
Well, there's the fact I’m half alien,

589
00:41:10,593 --> 00:41:13,554
so I don't want to make things difficult
for my family.

590
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,475
So, you’ve never had a girlfriend either?

591
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:22,771
I decided to stay single for life,
so I really had no interest in that stuff.

592
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:29,528
Well, I knew I would be lonely,
but I figured it was for the best.

593
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,991
Are you still lonely now?

594
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,827
You have us!

595
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:40,623
-We have tea together all the time.
-And we know everything about you.

596
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,754
‪I see.‬

597
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:52,343
We can all come up with a plan together
about the hotel.

598
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:55,971
There's still time,
so we’ll figure something out.

599
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,891
Yeah, worst-case scenario,
we’ll all carry the hot spring.

600
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,018
Thank you.

601
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:05,731
-You're going to use that tactic again.
-Stop saying it like that!

602
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:13,197
<i>It's true that after I came clean to them,</i>

603
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,618
<i>I didn’t feel lonely anymore.</i>

604
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,538
<i>They’re shameless,</i>

605
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:24,625
<i>but they see me as a regular friend</i>
<i>and don't give me special treatment,</i>

606
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,086
<i>and even though I grumble,</i>

607
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,298
<i>-I’m happy to know I'm being need--</i>
-Erosuke?

608
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,762
-Are you off work today, Erosuke?
-Yeah.

609
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,430
My childhood friends.

610
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,517
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

611
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,688
What’s going on? This is awesome, Erosuke!

612
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:48,899
-You're surrounded by women.
-You've got the wrong idea.

613
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,568
They're a colleague and her friends.

614
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,320
Come on, we all know that it's impossible
for you to be popular.

615
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:56,991
-What do you mean by that?
-Did you get exposed for being pervy?

616
00:42:57,074 --> 00:42:58,784
Huh? There's nothing to be exposed.

617
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,536
You were persistent with one hostess.

618
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,705
-Shut up! That's enough!
-And you were kicked out.

619
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,583
-I guessed you learned after that day.
-Stop it!

620
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,959
-Okay, don't shove.
-Hurry up.

621
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,836
-Sorry for interrupting.
-Just go.

622
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,963
-I'll call you later.
-Okay, okay.

623
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,547
Didn't you say you don't have an interest
in that stuff?

624
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:59,345
Well, I had to act like a human, you know?

625
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,098
Shall we put the plan on hold for now?

626
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:05,643
Hey, wait, you just said
you were with me, remember?

627
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,479
-But Mr. Erosuke--
-Stop teasing me already!

628
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,315
-Let’s go somewhere else.
-Huh?

629
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,733
-Let’s go to uh…
-Why?

630
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,318
Let’s go to Jonathan's.

631
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,071
-We like it here.
-I’ll settle your bills here, okay?

632
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,782
-But, Mr. Erosuke--
-Don't call me that!

633
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,284
-Come on, hurry up. Let's go.
-Hey, Mr. Erohashi.

634
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,994
-What do you want?
-What name is that?

635
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:27,623
You're treating us here too, right?

636
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:30,709
Yeah, but only drinks, okay?

637
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,629
-What?
-I mean, are you still hungry?

638
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:36,757
Come on, it's awkward if four adults
are just having drinks.

639
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,133
That can't be true.

640
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:40,719
-At least order some fries.
-Yeah.

641
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,263
Fine, but that's it, okay?

642
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,973
-Just one serving?
-Of course.

643
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,561
-How is that enough for all of us?
-It's sufficient.

644
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:54,691
Four adults with only drinks and just
a plate of fries in the middle

645
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:55,776
is a bit… you know?

646
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,112
I know what you mean.
It doesn't look too good.

647
00:44:58,195 --> 00:45:00,322
And we come here often,
so that makes it worse.

648
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,074
Surely that's overthinking it?

649
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,784
Okay then, I'll pay for the fries.

650
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,869
-Oh, Kiyomi?
-No, look--

651
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:09,164
-Yumi!
-Oh, Takahashi is here too.

652
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,333
-Hello.
-This is my colleague, Yumi.

653
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,003
Were you okay the other day,
Mr. Takahashi?

654
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:15,921
Which day?

655
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:19,425
I saw you getting stopped
by a TV crew in front of the hotel.

656
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:24,054
-It's fine, I explained everything.
-Glad to hear it.

657
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:28,851
But they probably still have the footage,
so I’m a little worried about that.

658
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,855
Oh, then you don't have to worry.

659
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,399
-Why is that?
-I deleted it.

660
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,110
You deleted it? What do you mean?

661
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:40,320
Oh, didn’t I tell you?

662
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,949
-About what?
-That Mizupon has supernatural powers.

663
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,244
Huh?

664
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,917
