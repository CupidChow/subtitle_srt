1
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,415
-Are you better? -have

2
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:41,708
That's good

3
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,012
...Festival site

4
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,474
More than 70 stalls have been set up

5
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,143
Local specialties are also sold

6
00:01:01,352 --> 00:01:02,979
Fuji Asada Winter Festival

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,274
Booking for rehearsal this Sunday

8
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:12,322
Fuji Asada's new mayor announces the end of his term as former mayor

9
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,200
Currently and new...

10
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:18,495
-Is it too late? -Can

11
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:19,704
Are there any club activities today?

12
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:22,540
Yes, but it shouldn't end too late

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,834
- Remember to bring everything-Okay

14
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,544
alright

15
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,172
-I'm out-going - Go slow

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,108
I only have 20 minutes to ride a bicycle from my house.

17
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,902
I could drive before

18
00:01:50,985 --> 00:01:55,824
But around last fall, I started to ride a bicycle for my health.

19
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:59,244
I ride a bicycle for health reasons

20
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:03,957
But now this season is really good and riding a bicycle is simply harmful to health

21
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,098
This is where I work

22
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,601
- Arrived at 8:45 am - Good morning

23
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,894
Good morning

24
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,062
It's so cold today

25
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,480
yes

26
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,274
I really regret riding a bicycle to work

27
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,025
-Be careful not to catch a cold - OK

28
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,986
Hotel Manager Okuda

29
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:36,990
Not arrogant, quite friendly

30
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,244
We just need to wash our shirts at home

31
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:44,289
I wash my shirt once a week

32
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:49,210
Although it sounds incredible, it's still very common

33
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,129
Some people wash less

34
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,092
Sorry for a long time, this is your receipt

35
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,303
-Thank you -Thank you

36
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,139
-Please walk slowly - Good morning

37
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,557
-Good morning - Do you want to check out?

38
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,892
-Yes-Thank you

39
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,144
I want to confirm the information, please wait

40
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:10,899
Good morning

41
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,902
Payment is completed, I will provide you with the receipt

42
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,321
The first thing I have to do when I start my duty

43
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,864
Just confirm the handover with your colleagues

44
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:20,158
that is…

45
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:23,411
This guest moved from Room 302 to Room 305

46
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,079
-Okay-That's it

47
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,040
-I got it-I'm going to patrol the room

48
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,333
OK

49
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,502
- Sorry for keeping you waiting for a long time - Thank you

50
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,212
Thank you

51
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:37,300
Please go slowly

52
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,472
-Good morning -Good morning

53
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,182
I'll get off work first

54
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,100
Thanks for your hard work

55
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,062
There are usually two people responsible at the counter

56
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,690
Today I changed shifts with Takahashi after duty at Takahashi

57
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,361
So I was on duty with Yumi, who was on duty until 4 pm

58
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,820
After work

59
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,698
You have to keep check-out until 11:00 in the morning

60
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:01,824
Please wait

61
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,535
Please go slowly

62
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:15,630
By the way

63
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:19,007
There is a female guest who doesn't like to live in a corner room

64
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,385
Why?

65
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,220
Because of the hotel's corner room

66
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,430
-All will be haunted - Really?

67
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:26,182
I don't know, that's what the female guest said

68
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,934
This is the first time I've heard it

69
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,602
Then she clamored to change rooms

70
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,772
But there were no rooms available at that time

71
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,190
So she...

72
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,191
Good morning

73
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,068
Good morning

74
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,656
-Do you want to check out? -Please trouble you

75
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,159
Please go slowly

76
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,164
(counter)

77
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,499
What did she do?

78
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,836
Where did I talk about?

79
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,671
You said she couldn't change the room

80
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,673
right

81
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,509
Then she asked me to see if there were any ghosts together

82
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,178
It's so annoying, can you see the ghost?

83
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:08,141
I can't see it at all, I'm just pretending to be looking for a ghost

84
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:11,185
Just look at the back of the TV, under the bed, etc.

85
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,730
Is there really a ghost there?

86
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:15,690
Otherwise what else can I do?

87
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,650
Where were the guests at that time?

88
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,110
She was watching me at the door

89
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,070
-She is really scared - Yes

90
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,032
Then, she whispered...

91
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:24,949
Good morning

92
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,409
-Good morning -Good morning

93
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,287
-Do you want to check out? -right

94
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,374
I want to confirm the information, please wait

95
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,712
Please go slowly

96
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,221
This is the counter

97
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,851
Very sorry, we'll give it to you right away

98
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,605
-I'll get the remote control battery-Okay

99
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:59,692
We can't chat well during this time

100
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,028
-Good morning -Good morning

101
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,404
Need to check out?

102
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,742
-Thank you -Thank you

103
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,330
Please go slowly

104
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,132
Then what?

105
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,219
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,932
You just said that the guest was watching you at the door

107
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,892
Yes, that's right

108
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,520
She asked me in a low voice, "Did you see a ghost?"

109
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,230
I said no

110
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,607
-Because you can't see it - Yes

111
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,401
Later she felt more at ease and decided to stay

112
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,195
It's actually useful

113
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,155
So she can't see the ghost

114
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,406
yes

115
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,160
Qingmei, do you believe there are ghosts?

116
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,287
I can't see ghosts, so I don't know

117
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,123
What about the aliens?

118
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,457
alien?

119
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,546
-I don't know - I think there are aliens

120
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,923
They may be somewhere in the universe

121
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,258
What do you think of that news?

122
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:06,217
What news?

123
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,637
It seems that some schools have discovered the ground painting

124
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,389
I don't know if this is happening

125
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,932
Really?

126
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:17,103
A while ago, on the playgrounds of primary and secondary schools

127
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,897
Landscape paintings similar to Nasca have appeared one after another

128
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,984
This is the first time I heard it, who drew it?

129
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:25,194
Who knows?

130
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,449
-But some people say it was painted by aliens - Someone must have had a prank

131
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,659
-is that so? -yes

132
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,162
Didn't something similar happened before

133
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,621
What? I don't know this

134
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:38,374
I didn't hear it at that time

135
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,252
I saw it later on the special show

136
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:42,295
What's going on?

137
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,463
that is…

138
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:47,717
A long time ago I forgot whether it was in elementary school or in junior high school

139
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,261
But the playground is full of desks

140
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,847
If I remember correctly, they are arranged into a number

141
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,724
-What number? -have no idea

142
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,977
So everyone started to guess that it was a good thing for aliens to do

143
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,314
Or someone wants to send some message

144
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,357
In the end, the initiator was caught

145
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:05,067
Really?

146
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,152
-I'll leave first - Thank you for your hard work

147
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,904
Thanks for your hard work

148
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:18,664
Every time Takahashi is on duty, he stays behind for a long time, right?

149
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,374
I really don't know what he is doing

150
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,251
It was obvious that the duty was over, but he was still at the back

151
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,504
- Very annoying feeling-I understand

152
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,005
Not bad, but it's just...

153
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,423
Not wrong at all

154
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,967
Just like when I go back, I just see him there

155
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,844
- Will worry about him - That's right

156
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,890
By the way, Takahashi must have used a bathhouse at night

157
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,227
-Really? -Yes, he will go there when he is on duty and rest

158
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,562
That's it

159
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:46,317
There is nothing wrong with using it during duty breaks

160
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,402
- Also right - Actually

161
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,695
-But I didn't see anyone using it - When I was still a newcomer

162
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,821
Used twice

163
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,949
-It's for women after all - but I decided not to tell her

164
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,284
-Even in men's bathhouse - only two times

165
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,994
-He is the only one who uses it, right? -I'm not using it now

166
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,705
The manager occasionally uses it

167
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,710
We'll take turns having lunch

168
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,588
I'll make my own bento on weekdays

169
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,591
I'll make one for my daughter

170
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,305
Sawada, who is on duty at mid-time from 1:00 pm, will also come

171
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,975
There will be three people at the counter

172
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,685
Until Yumi gets off work at 4 pm

173
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,355
-Thank you - By the way, our hotel

174
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,440
There are many regular customers

175
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,192
Like this man

176
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,570
-Good morning - Welcome

177
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:32,655
I'm glad to serve you again, Mr. Maruyama

178
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,783
-Please trouble you - He often lives here when he is on a business trip

179
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:40,329
And always take away unused spare parts like shavers and combs

180
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,625
- Just use your name - I always treat regular customers

181
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,960
Express gratitude

182
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,546
But when you see such a guest, you have to be very careful

183
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,590
-Welcome-Welcome

184
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,718
-Do you want to check in? -Yes, I'm Miyamoto

185
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:55,386
Please wait

186
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,513
Just a male guest with a female companion

187
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,764
The reason is

188
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,768
They may not bring their female companions every time

189
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,769
Yes, that's right

190
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:06,606
If he brought a different female companion this time

191
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,609
But I expressed my gratitude to him

192
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,777
There will be conflict

193
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,903
So I always

194
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,906
Treat them like new guests

195
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,831
-Welcome back -Welcome back

196
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm back, this kind of weather is the best

197
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,877
Enjoy the beautiful scenery of Mount Fuji

198
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,630
This has been living here for about three months

199
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,131
-Mr. Murakami-Please remember to keep warm

200
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:35,301
Sometimes there are guests like him in the hotel

201
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:37,511
But of course I can't inquire about the privacy of the guests

202
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,347
So I have no idea where he comes from

203
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:42,433
But the only thing that can be confirmed is that he is a rich man

204
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,809
Wish you a happy stay

205
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,394
Wish you a happy stay

206
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:49,190
There are many staff who hate helping customers carry luggage

207
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,985
I do it as a rest so I don't feel annoying

208
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:56,238
I see cleaning staff very often

209
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,159
But I won't talk to them during non-working hours

210
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:04,664
But they secretly track their social media accounts

211
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:07,541
She feels like a person who loves traveling alone

212
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,086
(Preparation area)

213
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:12,797
There is a regular customer named Maruyama, right?

214
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,507
Is that the person who will take away the spare parts?

215
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,342
Yes, it's him, it's really getting more and more exaggerated

216
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:21,097
Just take away the shave and toothbrush, but recently, he even took a towel.

217
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,598
Really?

218
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,517
Although there are occasional guests

219
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,728
-But as a regular, he is too exaggerated - Really

220
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,355
Don't you tell him?

221
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,108
I really want to say it, but I noticed it after he left

222
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:35,569
-That's it, so there's no evidence - did you tell the manager?

223
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:36,779
To be on the safe side, I said

224
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,990
But he said that after all, he is a regular customer, so it is difficult to speak

225
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,784
Yes

226
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,578
It would be easier if he could catch him on the spot to get things

227
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,289
But it should be difficult to catch him right?

228
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,168
When he checked out, we could stay in the parking lot first

229
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,337
Wait until he's about to get on the bus

230
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,507
We said we wanted to check his bag

231
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,884
If he said, "Why?"

232
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:02,763
We can say, "You may have taken a towel into your bag by mistake."

233
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,391
So that's it, you're giving him a step

234
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,352
Yes, if that happens, he will be more cooperative

235
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:11,730
Speaking of this, I met Sawada in the supermarket before...

236
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:12,815
Yes, but...

237
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,986
...I saw her take a lot of free plastic bags

238
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,156
I really hope she took it by mistake

239
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,079
Our hotel has a product provisioning rule

240
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,749
It's a product that the customer has never used

241
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,836
Just put it in the office basket

242
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,714
Can be requested freely

243
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,301
This is actually taking care of the livelihood of employees

244
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,388
After get off work at 6 pm

245
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:49,226
I'll buy dinner ingredients in the supermarket

246
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,689
I'll prepare dinner when my daughter comes back around 8 pm

247
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:57,359
This is my daily life

248
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,046
How much money have we saved?

249
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,380
This weekend

250
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,966
My daughter is going to participate in the club training

251
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,969
So I took the opportunity to go with my old classmate Xiaomei

252
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,137
And the younger generation Xiao Ye recounts the old

253
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,431
-Ask them to have a meal-about 27,000 yen

254
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,183
We used to be together very often

255
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,268
But in recent years, we are busy with each other

256
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:34,813
Only meet a few times a year

257
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,066
Do you still participate in the Mom's Volleyball Team?

258
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:38,442
Yes, they all become captains

259
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,485
Really?

260
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:43,697
After all, there are not many experienced team members and they have a high opinion of me

261
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,242
If you join, you will definitely become a regular team member soon

262
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,327
I haven't touched volleyball for more than 20 years

263
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,705
- Just practice a little - Practice

264
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,501
Xiaomei, your school often practices football in our school, right?

265
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,086
Yes, we will go to Xu Primary School

266
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,796
Xiaoye, are you working at Xu Primary School?

267
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,047
It's been the fourth year

268
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,215
Really?

269
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:04,134
-What grade are you responsible for now? - Grade 6

270
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:05,386
Graduated this year

271
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,637
That's right

272
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,180
Will you miss them?

273
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,350
Yes, after all, there are many good students in my class

274
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:12,726
I see

275
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,770
Do you cry when you attend the graduation ceremony?

276
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:17,064
It's hard to say, maybe I'll shed a few tears

277
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:20,734
But I have more to consider at the graduation ceremony

278
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:22,152
for example?

279
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:25,865
Students take it for granted to be the protagonists of the graduation ceremony

280
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,908
But the class director was also the focus of the day

281
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:30,327
Just like the bride and father at the wedding

282
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,996
That's right

283
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,207
-So the situation will be a little complicated - What does it mean?

284
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,001
I have to pay attention to which teachers it is

285
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,211
Teach them from first grade to fifth grade

286
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:40,671
-Why? -Well

287
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,215
We only teach our children for one year

288
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,843
But only the sixth grade teachers showed off

289
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,262
I see

290
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,015
That's different from the bride's father

291
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,893
What you insist on is probably like the last kick of the relay race

292
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,688
I understand it's like only the last stick standing on the podium

293
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,274
Everyone knows that things will turn out like this

294
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:04,236
But if all the credit is taken away, the scene will become a bit ugly

295
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,322
Makes sense

296
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:10,409
I was their fourth-grade tutor when I graduated last year

297
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,579
As a result, their class director is that kind of person

298
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,414
They were super rebellious in the fourth grade

299
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,918
I suffered a lot, but he didn't say anything

300
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,629
Just say you're taking care of all the work

301
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:24,506
- It's clear that everyone is working together - That's right

302
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,800
That's why I have to be cautious and not become a person like him

303
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:31,138
-Don't rob the protagonist - Yes, so that you won't mess with others

304
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:33,933
-Thank you so hard - That's it

305
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:36,268
-Are you still working in a hotel? -right

306
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,438
Speaking of this, I'll tell you

307
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,067
An incredible thing happened when I came home the day before yesterday

308
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:43,984
What's up?

309
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,071
After get off work

310
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,740
Just ride a bicycle home

311
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,547
Are you okay?

312
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,469
I'm fine

313
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,263
Anyone were injured?

314
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,599
No

315
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:20,229
Are you okay?

316
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,648
I'm fine

317
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,860
Then I'll leave first, I'm very sorry just now

318
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:41,208
Takahashi?

319
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,424
that…

320
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,429
Can you please keep the matter secret just now?

321
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,599
good

322
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,312
Then I'll leave first

323
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,690
See you tomorrow

324
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,237
-Are you sure? -Really

325
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:15,451
-Isn't it very fierce? - It's really unimaginable

326
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,411
He must be able to do it with great strength

327
00:17:17,493 --> 00:17:19,038
How does he look?

328
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,373
He is my senior at work

329
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,334
-Are you colleagues? -Yes, his name is Takahashi

330
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,462
Maybe he used to be a sports person

331
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,628
I don't know this

332
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:31,425
-Is it a rugby? -If it's a rugby player, it makes sense

333
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:35,554
-I really want to see what he looks like - Yes, I want to feel his arm strength

334
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,930
I said

335
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:43,312
Do you think Takahashi is that handsome and macho man?

336
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,689
-Yes - OK

337
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,779
This is Takahashi

338
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,324
Slow down

339
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,911
-Isn't it him? -No, it's him

340
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,167
Are you serious?

341
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:09,379
It's true, this is the one who lifted me and my bike up

342
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,383
And I haven't finished speaking yet

343
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,012
The next day...is not right

344
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,139
It should be another day later

345
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,392
After all, I was in the same hotel, so I went to thank him

346
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,645
Thank you for saving me the day before yesterday

347
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,189
That's nothing

348
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:30,275
Keep it confidential, okay?

349
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,568
What?

350
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,905
Please don't say it out

351
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,116
knew

352
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,493
Is something happening?

353
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,579
No, not that

354
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,915
I just think it would be better not to let others know

355
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,419
Don't you want others to know where you are?

356
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,213
Not that true

357
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,256
Did you have an affair?

358
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,258
No

359
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:55,592
Could it be that you were involved in the crime?

360
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,594
No, you're too far

361
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:01,223
You made me curious, what was going on?

362
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,356
OK, I'll tell you

363
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:12,860
But don't say it out

364
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,278
I promise you

365
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,366
that is…

366
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,202
Actually I am...

367
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,540
alien

368
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,129
I mean I'm an alien

369
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,965
So I hope you can keep it confidential

370
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,724
I got it, I won't say it out.

371
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,102
-Wait a minute - Yes?

372
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,899
Did you think I was sick just now?

373
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,610
No

374
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,653
You seem to think I'm talking crazy so you want to interrupt me

375
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,696
There is no such thing

376
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:00,032
Wait a moment

377
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,325
I'll explain it to you clearly

378
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,035
No

379
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:06,580
This won't work, I want to explain clearly

380
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:12,794
Please sit down, please trouble you

381
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,012
That's... the day before yesterday

382
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,140
Didn’t I save you?

383
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,059
Just lifting you and your bike

384
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,061
right

385
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,730
The reason I can do it

386
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,942
It's because I'm an alien

387
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:44,117
Does what you mean by "alien"?

388
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,704
Not many people will say that excellent athletes are monsters or something?

389
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,582
I know what you said, but that's a metaphor

390
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,084
What I just said

391
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,254
It's not a metaphor, but telling you the facts

392
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,047
-fact? -right

393
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,799
I'm really an alien

394
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,303
That's it

395
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,722
Don't you believe me?

396
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,517
That's it...

397
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,562
That doesn't matter

398
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,524
As long as you don't tell others

399
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,485
That's it

400
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,905
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone

401
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,783
-You will definitely say it - No

402
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,160
You will definitely tell your friends

403
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,704
"I have a colleague who has an abnormal mind"

404
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,913
I won't say it

405
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,248
-Really? -Believe me

406
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,958
But you must think I am a lunatic, right?

407
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:35,794
-No - There is definitely

408
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,963
-I didn't - Then why did you pause just now?

409
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,881
Please come to the counter

410
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,174
I'll go there right away

411
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:44,845
I'll leave first

412
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,768
Good morning

413
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,813
I want to confirm the information, please wait

414
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,569
The bill has been settled and the payment procedures have been completed

415
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,031
Please go slowly

416
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,285
-Good morning, do you need to check out? -right

417
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,662
I want to confirm the information, please wait

418
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,499
Come on

419
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,336
Please come here

420
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,423
-What's up? -Sorry, I just want you to see

421
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,258
Sorry, but I still have to go to work

422
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,011
I know, it will be fine soon

423
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,805
You may believe me after you read it

424
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:31,391
-It's time to start-Okay

425
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,815
No, right?

426
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,026
Too irritating

427
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,069
Very awesome, right?

428
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,154
Slowly, you were

429
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,531
-Do you use your fingers to force it? -right

430
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:50,160
This kind of thing should not be possible for ordinary people, right?

431
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,872
-Yes-I can do it

432
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,541
It's because I'm an alien

433
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,461
Do you believe me now?

434
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:04,216
What...what should I say?

435
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,676
You just ask

436
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,137
Obviously you have strange power

437
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,640
But it's a bit ridiculous to treat you as an alien with this point

438
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,141
I understand what you mean

439
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,602
I'll explain

440
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,607
I know I've said it many times but I must keep it confidential

441
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,275
no problem

442
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,028
Then let's start with

443
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,532
I'm from the planet.

444
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,200
At first my parents...

445
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,786
- Please come to the counter - I'll go there right away

446
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,912
Feel sorry

447
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:40,210
I've been busy with work since then

448
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,129
Not able to finish listening

449
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,718
-What do you think? -What's the meaning?

450
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:51,138
Do you believe his words?

451
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,351
He's just a madman

452
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,936
Really? Not an alien?

453
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,187
It's the Earthling who has a problem with his head

454
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,398
That's it

455
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,650
But

456
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:06,236
I thought so at first

457
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,531
But he is really powerful

458
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,200
After all, you saw it with your own eyes

459
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,996
I began to think he was telling the truth

460
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,457
Show me his photos

461
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,131
-He doesn't look strange at all - strange?

462
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:28,383
He looks too ordinary

463
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:30,760
Yes, that's the kind of person you can see everywhere

464
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,513
There are about 5,000 people in Japan who look like this

465
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:35,348
That's right

466
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,184
Can we find time to meet him?

467
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,268
Takahashi?

468
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,061
We want to confirm his abilities first

469
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,106
Yes, if we have the ability to see him with our own eyes, we might believe him

470
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,736
What should I do?

471
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:48,862
What's wrong?

472
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:51,781
that is

473
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,701
I've promised him to keep it a secret

474
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,455
You can't ask him to show his abilities so that you can believe him

475
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,706
Yes

476
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,500
Otherwise this would be better

477
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,921
First ask him if he can tell his friends since childhood

478
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,255
If he agrees

479
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:11,593
You can say that they don't believe you and ask him to show his abilities

480
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:15,805
In this way, you won't be breaking your promise

481
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,642
Yes

482
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:19,976
Yes

483
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,645
That might work

484
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,898
Of course not

485
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:26,983
I think so

486
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,443
No

487
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:31,905
I didn't want you to know at first

488
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,657
But it's all because of that happening

489
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,619
Considering the situation, I can only tell you

490
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,329
But those two people

491
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,957
I was a friend when I was in the middle of the country

492
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,292
And I never tell the secret

493
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,752
You can rest assured of this

494
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,172
But that's all the secrets between friends, right?

495
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,175
I'm just an ordinary uncle and they will definitely tell you

496
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:55,095
No, they will never say it as long as I speak

497
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,931
Wait a moment

498
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,434
You might have told them already?

499
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:03,979
No, I didn't say it

500
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,064
-You must have said it - I don't

501
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,190
Then why did you pause suddenly?

502
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,400
Not that

503
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:09,693
That must be true

504
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,403
You've told your friends

505
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,363
Then they want to see it with their own eyes

506
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,532
But because you promised to keep it confidential

507
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,993
So I'll ask for my consent

508
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,704
I'll prove it to them later

509
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:23,623
Not that, I didn't tell anyone

510
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,166
-Really? -right

511
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,127
Then why did you come to me to talk about this?

512
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,675
They are my frequent friends

513
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,845
If it were hidden from them, such a shocking thing

514
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,223
I'll feel very stressed

515
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,185
-Really? -right

516
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,104
Keep going like this

517
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,775
We will meet less and less

518
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,903
They are

519
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,324
My only close friend here in my hometown

520
00:26:57,407 --> 00:27:00,452
If I don't meet them anymore

521
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,829
My life only revolves around work and family...

522
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,997
OK, I get it

523
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,210
-Is it really possible? -They are the only ones, right?

524
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,756
May I? thank you very much

525
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,007
Nothing below

526
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,175
Can you really believe them?

527
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,885
Absolutely no problem

528
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,511
Oh well

529
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,680
But relatively speaking, I won't meet them

530
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,183
Or show them abilities, do you understand?

531
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:27,312
That...can they see it?

532
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,898
-You definitely said that, right? -No

533
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,569
These two are my friends Xiaomei and Xiaoye who have been together since childhood

534
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,614
-Hello -Hello

535
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:42,786
Please rest assured, they are trustworthy people

536
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:43,787
I'll never say it

537
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,080
My mouth is very tight

538
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,917
Really no problem, right?

539
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:50,627
right

540
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,339
first

541
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,508
Can they see that?

542
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,468
Want to do it here?

543
00:27:58,551 --> 00:28:00,178
Is there any problem?

544
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,055
It's okay

545
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,725
Does anyone have ten yuan coins?

546
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,810
Of course there is

547
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,019
Really prepared

548
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,195
It's about to start

549
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,786
That's it

550
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:29,332
-So awesome-Yes

551
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,292
That's nothing, actually

552
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,423
That, Mr. Takahashi

553
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,717
I heard you are an alien

554
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,511
Is it true?

555
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,638
right

556
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,976
But you look like an ordinary human

557
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,437
Yes, it doesn't look like an alien at all

558
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:54,774
But my muscle structure is very different

559
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,485
How to say it?

560
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:03,241
Simply put, compared to humans

561
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:07,078
My back is round and my chest is slightly lower.

562
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,127
So you have a hunchback?

563
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:18,798
No, I know hunchback, but that's two different things

564
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,051
Otherwise, you will understand what I mean by touching my back

565
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,595
Touch it

566
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,389
That way you're more understanding

567
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,932
All right

568
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,393
Unruly

569
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:40,320
I think it's just a hunch

570
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,449
How could humans have such a round back?

571
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,618
No, someone's back is rounder than you

572
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,621
Really?

573
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,999
By the way, what else are there for you to be different from ordinary people?

574
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,128
I'll think about any other things that are easy to understand

575
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,382
My teeth will be sensitive when I eat iced

576
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,679
So you have any perceptual allergies?

577
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,599
No, I know allergies

578
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,810
But it's so different from mine

579
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,061
I have experience, too

580
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,357
-Your teeth will also be sensitive? -Yes

581
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,235
Really?

582
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,696
It seems that we are in the same way

583
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,073
yes

584
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:29,410
No matter what, you really have different abilities than ordinary people

585
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:33,414
Yes, I'm really different from others in this regard

586
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:38,670
Do people on that planet have the same abilities?

587
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:42,423
After all, I am a child born in Asada

588
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,884
Actually, I don't know much about my planet

589
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,220
But that should be true

590
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,597
So you haven't been to your planet?

591
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,224
No

592
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,727
My father is from that planet

593
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,189
My mother is a Earthling, I am a mixed-race alien

594
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:02,235
My appearance should be inherited from my mother

595
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:06,406
Did you get injured when you just put pressure?

596
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:10,076
No, it'll just be itchy

597
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,494
itch?

598
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,496
-Is it a side effect - Side effect?

599
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,915
My hands itch when I use this ability

600
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,544
Does this happen very often?

601
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,839
It depends on the situation

602
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,009
But something like this is a little bit of a slight itchy

603
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:30,471
Sorry, if we knew, we wouldn't have asked you to do it

604
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,600
It doesn't matter, that's nothing

605
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,645
If so, can we see other abilities?

606
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:39,856
-Other abilities? -No?

607
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,483
It's the ability to not have serious side effects

608
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,611
Yes, I want to see it again

609
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,029
May I?

610
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,657
Oh well

611
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,451
Very good

612
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,911
But relatively

613
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,662
You must keep it confidential

614
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,289
No problem, we're very nervous

615
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:58,249
-Don't forget the agreement - OK

616
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,628
If the world knew about this

617
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:05,423
I will be surrounded by the media, and it will be very troublesome at that time

618
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,507
That's it

619
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,843
If not handled properly, it will be the same as "ET Alien"

620
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,386
Very likely

621
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,181
I'll be hunted by government agencies

622
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,810
- "ET Alien"? - "ET Alien"?

623
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,479
Don’t you know?

624
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:20,563
have no idea

625
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,273
That's the blockbuster movie

626
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:24,776
oh

627
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:29,489
The story is about an alien being left on Earth

628
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,408
Finally hunted down by government agents

629
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:36,496
-Oh-I just don't want that to happen

630
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:40,124
We will keep it confidential

631
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,210
Can you show us your abilities?

632
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,882
I'll go there for a moment

633
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:48,841
You just chat casually

634
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,176
Chatting nonsense?

635
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,597
I'll go there and listen to what you're talking about

636
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,392
What? Can you hear it?

637
00:32:57,475 --> 00:32:58,810
Probably

638
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,186
Very awesome

639
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,980
- Then start - OK

640
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,856
-Okay - Please trouble you

641
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,340
What should I talk about?

642
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,383
Xiaoye, how about it?

643
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:34,053
-I? I don't know - I can talk about anything

644
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:36,639
What about you?

645
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,767
-It's okay to talk about anything--this is it

646
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,898
Talk about something casually

647
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,735
Xiaomei, what do you want to talk about?

648
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,986
Anything you can talk about

649
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,364
We really don't know what to talk about

650
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:57,243
All is OK, why are you restless like this?

651
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:01,581
But you know we have nothing to talk about

652
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,999
That's right

653
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,168
-So amazing - Do you believe it now?

654
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,961
-Yes-that's good

655
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,213
He's really amazing

656
00:34:12,132 --> 00:34:14,260
-How are you? -Wait me a moment

657
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,054
Do you have ear pain?

658
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,848
There's a little

659
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:20,475
But it feels stuffy, like flying

660
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,559
Ear pressure

661
00:34:21,641 --> 00:34:24,853
Yes, but it will be fine soon

662
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:29,400
Wait, then when you saved me the day before yesterday

663
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,985
Are there any side effects?

664
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,280
I had a fever that night

665
00:34:34,362 --> 00:34:35,614
About 38 degrees

666
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:38,159
I don't know about this

667
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:41,204
I'm sorry

668
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:42,663
It doesn't matter

669
00:34:42,746 --> 00:34:44,373
After all, life is at stake

670
00:34:44,456 --> 00:34:46,501
-You are so nice-yes, so kind

671
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,002
What?

672
00:34:48,085 --> 00:34:50,713
You think too much of me

673
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,257
But it's just a little bit of a fever

674
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:57,011
Thank you for saving my life

675
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:03,518
When I was young, I acted impulsively because I was indifferent to the consequences.

676
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:06,771
I regretted it later

677
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:12,610
Can you show us other abilities?

678
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:15,530
Aren't you curious?

679
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:19,575
I said I acted impulsively

680
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:22,829
Shouldn't you just ask me what I did?

681
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:28,042
I slowly began to feel that you were just curious about my abilities

682
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,212
- Not that - We want to hear your story

683
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:32,547
What did you do?

684
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,550
-You really want to hear it? -think

685
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,801
Really?

686
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:41,973
When I was in my 20s, I was walking on the road once

687
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,392
Get trouble by a group of gangsters

688
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,396
At that time, there were about five or six of them.

689
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,649
I don't like being treated as a coward and I fight them

690
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,817
Are you dealing with them alone?

691
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,318
right

692
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:57,405
There's a guy inside that seems to know some boxing

693
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:00,199
But after all, I have extraordinary abilities

694
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,076
So they were knocked down

695
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,163
It's boring to hear an uncle boast

696
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,498
-But since Takahashi is my savior - I have a fever of 40 degrees

697
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,083
-I have done so many things for us - I have diarrhea

698
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,420
-I had to concentrate on listening - I suffered more than they

699
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,130
That's it

700
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,424
-Please walk slowly -Please walk slowly

701
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:23,055
I kept my promise and didn't tell his secret...

702
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,142
- Thank you for your hard work -...Interact with him as usual

703
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,270
I really don't know how long he will stay today

704
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,564
yes

705
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,316
But he is not bad either

706
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:37,278
But he always makes us feel stressed

707
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,030
That should be considered a bad guy, right?

708
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,241
But he has no malice either

709
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,453
I'll start to say something nice to Takahashi a little

710
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,538
Endo, speak with one step

711
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,332
good

712
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,501
What's wrong?

713
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:55,630
Today I went to clean room 405

714
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:58,049
-Seeing the TV is missing - TV?

715
00:36:58,841 --> 00:36:59,884
It's Mr. Maruyama's room

716
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,302
What?

717
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:05,306
Before, he took away the spare parts and towels

718
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,767
But taking the TV is too exaggerating

719
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,101
That's it

720
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:14,273
What bag did he get today?

721
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:20,029
-It seems that I can install the TV-Yes

722
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,617
Otherwise, call him and ask him to come here

723
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,828
-Call to Mr. Maruyama? -Yes, use other excuses

724
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,414
We check his car when he distracts...

725
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:33,042
No, even if he returns to the hotel

726
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,419
It should have left the TV somewhere else

727
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:37,129
Yes

728
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:41,759
If he pretends to be innocent, then he will be helpless. After all, we have no evidence.

729
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,970
Yes, after all, we are not

730
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,096
-Seeing him taking it with your own eyes-Yes

731
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:53,437
Then I have to call the police

732
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:59,902
The manager probably won't want to pull the police in

733
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,822
That's right

734
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,490
Then I'll leave first

735
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,450
Thanks for your hard work

736
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,627
-Takahashi-Is that?

737
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,506
-Can you please help me? -What's up?

738
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,010
You can use your abilities

739
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:27,471
Have you found evidence that Mr. Maruyama stole the TV home?

740
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,723
evidence?

741
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:29,932
for example

742
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:34,020
You can peek at his room and use the picture in your mind

743
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:37,440
Have you taken a photo of him stealing the TV?

744
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,524
Can't do it

745
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,775
Can't do it?

746
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,986
-That's considered a superpower-this is

747
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:45,740
I can only enhance my existing capabilities

748
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,158
Apart from that, I can do nothing

749
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,410
I see

750
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,123
I see

751
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,208
What?

752
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,919
Existing capabilities, right?

753
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:07,261
Can you know just by the smell of the TV?

754
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,889
There is also the smell of the base here

755
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:13,809
A little bit of dust mixed

756
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,478
It should be no problem

757
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,898
How about it?

758
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:23,194
After all, he didn't drag the TV to the ground, so it was quite difficult

759
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,196
But there is still a faint smell

760
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:26,697
Really?

761
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:29,450
But it almost disbanded

762
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:32,536
Do you want to strengthen your sense of smell a little more?

763
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,539
That's OK, but...

764
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,146
Why do you want to look back?

765
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,816
I'm curious about how you look at me now

766
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:06,153
- Of course, it's a curious expression - that's fine

767
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,742
-Here? -right

768
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,202
Really?

769
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,705
This is a place that the monitor can't capture

770
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:17,873
(Hushui Hotel)

771
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:21,794
He passed by here and put the TV on the car

772
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,337
That should be true

773
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,048
So

774
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:28,467
As long as the smell disappears

775
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,763
It means that Mr. Maruyama parked the car there, which proved that he had stolen it.

776
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,640
How do you prove this?

777
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:35,933
What's the meaning?

778
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:39,478
-You can't tell him my abilities - Yes

779
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,232
It's this car

780
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:45,317
No, right?

781
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,862
His car is still there?

782
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,489
In other words, he is still nearby

783
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:56,245
Isn't that a TV?

784
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,664
That's right

785
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:01,500
This is the ironclad evidence

786
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:06,338
But this is not Mr. Maruyama's car

787
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,050
Whose car is that?

788
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,386
It's Miss Nakamoto's car

789
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,348
What?

790
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:19,185
That TV is mine

791
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,855
-Really? -I bought it myself

792
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:28,319
But there is no packaging

793
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,404
Wrapped in a restaurant towel

794
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,990
Sorry, I borrowed a towel

795
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:36,744
But the TV is mine and it is second-hand, so there is no packaging

796
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,039
That's it

797
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,541
Since that's the case

798
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:46,545
To be on the safe side, I'd better call the police and ask the police to investigate.

799
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,380
-If that happens, Miss Nakamoto... - Sorry

800
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:50,799
I stole it

801
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:57,223
I was impulsive, I'm really sorry

802
00:41:57,306 --> 00:42:01,810
Really, what are you thinking?

803
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:05,689
Sorry, I'll put it back immediately

804
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:08,025
Can you please don’t call the police?

805
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,156
-Okay-Thank you

806
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,784
But I have to tell the manager about this

807
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,704
I would be grateful if you don't tell the manager.

808
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:24,500
-But I won't tell him... -Please please

809
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,045
I'm a single mother

810
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,593
Without this job, I would have a hard time living

811
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,022
I see

812
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:52,736
Anyway, put the TV back before the manager notices

813
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,781
Thank you very much, I will put it back immediately

814
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:03,205
It's so bitter, right?

815
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,046
-Thank you -Thank you

816
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,089
Thanks for your hard work

817
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,549
manager

818
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:17,177
Today, the cleaning staff Ms. Nakamoto stole the TV from the hotel.

819
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,055
What? What's going on?

820
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:23,809
She said the TV in Room 405 was gone

821
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:27,479
But after we searched, we found that the TV was in her car

822
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,065
Really?

823
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,860
She admitted it herself, so it's absolutely right

824
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,362
That's it

825
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,864
Where is Miss Nakamoto now?

826
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,449
She went to put the TV back

827
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,284
That's it

828
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:43,579
-I'll check the situation-Okay

829
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,252
Didn’t you promise she won’t tell the manager?

830
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,506
Of course, this is a crime

831
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,175
So

832
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,593
But you've promised her

833
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,303
It doesn't matter

834
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,890
And she is not a single mother

835
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:03,891
Really?

836
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,476
yes

837
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,729
I have a social media account tracking her

838
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:12,024
She's enjoying a single life, you see

839
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,401
(Long-lost trip to Korea)

840
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:15,569
(Two days and one night trip)

841
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,112
Really

842
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,788
-It's just that kind of thing - but you show her on the spot

843
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,998
It's really like your style

844
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,584
Not all because she lies

845
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:32,503
Say I am a single mother, obviously not

846
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,798
-It's so insulting - It's really a big deal

847
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,883
Has she been arrested?

848
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,176
No

849
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:42,096
The manager doesn't want to make a big deal

850
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,058
I didn't call the police, I fired her directly

851
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,476
That's it

852
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:51,105
She should be thankful for not handing her over to the police

853
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,147
That's it

854
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,941
But Mr. Takahashi's performance is really amazing

855
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,818
yes

856
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:58,529
But because he can't tell his abilities

857
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:03,909
Later I became the hero of finding the TV

858
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,244
What? Have you taken away the credit?

859
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,665
The manager kept praising me in front of everyone

860
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,167
Is this OK? Are you proud?

861
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,129
There seems to be a little

862
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:19,049
No, you will mess with others

863
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,970
-So I invited him to have a meal - Then why didn't he come?

864
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:28,392
He seemed to have side effects in order to find a TV and had rhinitis

865
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,644
Now eating has no taste

866
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:32,563
So pitiful

867
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,917
