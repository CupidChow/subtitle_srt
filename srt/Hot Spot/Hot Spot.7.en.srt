‪PREVIOUSLY…‬

2
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,506
<i>At the base of Mount Fuji,</i>

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:09,676
<i>in Fuji-Asada, Kiyomi Endou works</i>
<i>at a business hotel.</i>

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,760
Oh, thank you.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:14,639
<i>She gets her alien colleague,</i>
<i>Takahashi, to use his abilities</i>

6
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:17,308
<i>to solve trivial day-to-day problems.</i>

7
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,812
<i>That secret is only known to</i>
<i>her childhood friends Hacchi and Minapuu.</i>

8
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,189
<i>Along with her manager, Okuda,</i>

9
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:26,484
<i>her colleague, Yumi,</i>
<i>and Yumi's childhood friend,</i>

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,111
<i>Mizuki.</i>

11
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:31,531
-I'm from Nippon Television.
<i>-Meanwhile.</i>

12
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:35,994
<i>this man returns to this town once more.</i>

13
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,973
NIPPON TELEVISION

14
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,815
I don't think we can air this…

15
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,571
Yeah…

16
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,949
It’s interesting…

17
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:20,455
but with just the supermarket and urine
sample cup stories, it feels a bit weak.

18
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:29,214
Actually, I had another interview
that I planned to focus on…

19
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,341
-Really?
-Yes.

20
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,219
During our street interviews,
several people in the area

21
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,388
mentioned seeing a man
with glasses moving at high speed.

22
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,557
-Moving at high speed?
-Yes.

23
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,686
I still have the footage,
so let me bring it up.

24
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>How fast were they?</i>

25
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,820
<i>-Like a car.</i>
<i>-A car? That's really fast!</i>

26
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,530
<i>What kind of person was he?</i>

27
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,533
<i>I think he was wearing glasses.</i>

28
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,617
<i>Glasses?</i>

29
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,121
<i>The common thing about those testimonies</i>
<i>is they all said he was wearing glasses.</i>

30
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>That's Onodera!</i>

31
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:03,581
<i>-He wears glasses?</i>
<i>-Absolutely.</i>

32
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:06,751
<i>-What?</i>
<i>-I'm serious. Want to see how he looks?</i>

33
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,586
<i>This is him.</i>

34
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,257
<i>-He sure has glasses on.</i>
<i>-Right?</i>

35
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:16,261
Interesting.

36
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,514
-I'm curious about this Onodera person.
-Right?

37
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,724
This looks entertaining,
so why didn't you use it?

38
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,352
After filming,
we were contacted by the hotel

39
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:27,105
asking us not to use it.

40
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,815
I see.

41
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,859
The manager was okay with it,

42
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,194
but the owner wasn't.

43
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,655
Ah, that's a shame.

44
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,323
Yeah.

45
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:41,578
If that's the case, there's no issue
if you film outside, right?

46
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,037
You mean, outside the hotel?

47
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,124
The staff were okay with it, right?

48
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,667
Yeah, I guess.

49
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,086
Then, if you keep watch near the hotel

50
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:51,921
and interview them outside,

51
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,048
it won't cause the hotel any trouble.

52
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,342
Huh?

53
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,386
We should go get more footage?

54
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:01,264
Yeah, this seems entertaining.
See if you can go a little further.

55
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,060
Okay.

56
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,647
Hopefully Mr. Onodera is around today.

57
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,444
It'd make things easier, yeah.

58
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,281
Is today Mount Fuji Day?

59
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,912
Yeah, it's February 23.

60
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,594
This happened last time too.

61
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,723
-Yeah, you noticed?
-Yeah.

62
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,643
We're unlucky.

63
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:01,532
<i>Here in Fuji-Asada today, February 23,</i>

64
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,035
<i>-is Mount Fuji Day,</i>
-I think it's done.

65
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,080
<i>so an event showcasing local specialties</i>
<i>around Mount Fuji</i>

66
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,916
<i>will be held at Fuji-Asada Citizen Hall.</i>

67
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,334
Food's ready!

68
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,295
<i>Fuji-Asada has been cherished up until now</i>

69
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,172
<i>for its quaint and historical air.</i>

70
00:04:16,255 --> 00:04:18,882
-Where are you going today?
<i>-But as stated in our manifesto…</i>

71
00:04:18,966 --> 00:04:21,594
First, I'll grab some lunch,

72
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,680
then go look at some clothes.

73
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,932
-Dad's going to buy some for you?
-Yeah.

74
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,018
Oh, aren't you lucky?
Where will you be having lunch?

75
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:32,480
-Most likely Jona.
-I see.

76
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,523
What about dinner?

77
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:37,026
<i>I call it Jona-sama.</i>
<i>My daughter just calls it Jona.</i>

78
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,320
-You might as well eat out.
-Yeah.

79
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,239
What about you, Mom?

80
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,993
If you're eating out…

81
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,621
-I'll call up Minapuu and Hacchi.
-Sure, why not?

82
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,539
<i>By the way.</i>

83
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>I actually</i>

84
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,585
<i>taught her to lock the door quietly,</i>

85
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,130
-Don't come home too late.
-Okay.

86
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,214
See you.

87
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,300
<i>-I wonder Will she remember?</i>
-I'm leaving now.

88
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:08,141
<i>I expect nothing less from my daughter.</i>

89
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,061
<i>Wait, I don't hear her locking the door.</i>

90
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,817
<i>Oh, she did lock it already.</i>

91
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,821
<i>If it's too quiet, that in itself</i>

92
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,282
<i>can be unsettling</i>

93
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:28,328
<i>so it's better to make at least</i>
<i>a little noise.</i>

94
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,330
<i>I've just learned that at my age.</i>

95
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:36,044
<i>I decided to go to work by bike</i>
<i>since it seems relatively warm today.</i>

96
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,882
<i>But, actually, it's not warm at all.</i>

97
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,426
<i>I should've taken the car.</i>

98
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,642
You guys are a TV crew, right?

99
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,563
Oh, you're the driver from before.

100
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,440
-It's been a while.
-Yes.

101
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,318
-Are you here for interviews again?
-That's right.

102
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,820
It's about the man with glasses
from the other day.

103
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,657
You said you were unlucky, but I'd say
you're lucky that we met again.

104
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:09,077
-What do you mean?
-I saw him again after that.

105
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:12,205
-The man with glasses?
-Yeah.

106
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,874
He seems a little weird after all.

107
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:18,127
-Did something happen?
-Just the other day…

108
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,880
Sorry, can we get the cameras rolling?

109
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,426
A snack bar?

110
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,596
Yeah, I had to drive a customer
who was passed out drunk,

111
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,015
but the guy was huge,
probably over 100 kilos.

112
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,267
It wasn't easy getting him into the car.

113
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,186
A hundred kilos is pretty big.

114
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,772
Not to mention, there were only women
at the bar,

115
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:41,275
and it took about five of them to get him
into the car and take him to the hotel.

116
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,319
When we arrived,

117
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,780
the hotel staff came out to help

118
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,699
and that’s when I saw the guy
with glasses from earlier.

119
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:49,867
Was it the Lake Hotel?

120
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,786
Oh, yes! And guess what?

121
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:55,039
He carried the man all by himself,
in no time at all.

122
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,125
-All by himself?
-Yes.

123
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,045
I just happened to be receiving payment
from the other staff member.

124
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:04,298
-So I didn't witness the moment myself.
-I see.

125
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:07,844
But this time, I still have the footage
on my dashcam.

126
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,846
What? Really?

127
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,223
-Yeah.
<i>-3,200 yen, please.</i>

128
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,642
<i>Okay, here's 5,000 yen.</i>

129
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,979
<i>Here's your change…</i>

130
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:20,606
Wait, this guy is…

131
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,067
Sorry, may I watch it again?

132
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,407
It's the <i>gunpla</i> person.

133
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,663
Is the guy with glasses that you
mentioned earlier the same person?

134
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:38,749
Yes. I'm sure of it.

135
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,382
Do you think most of the people staying
at our hotel

136
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,594
stay here because they couldn’t
book anywhere else?

137
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,264
-That can't be the case.
-Really?

138
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:57,059
Putting aside the fact that I work here,

139
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,436
I actually like this hotel.

140
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,147
Me too, but the charm of this hotel

141
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,025
is more of an unexpected realization
after you've stayed here.

142
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,612
-Really?
-I mean, our hotel isn't especially cheap.

143
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,282
And normally, wouldn't people
prefer a more exciting hotel?

144
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,243
Well, this place has unique charms
you can’t find anywhere else.

145
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,411
Like what?

146
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:17,580
-Like…
-Yeah?

147
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,458
For example…

148
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,879
it has… a certain air to it, you know?

149
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:28,549
I get what you mean,
but as a unique selling point,

150
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,801
if that's the first thing,
isn’t that kinda weak?

151
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,678
Not at all!

152
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:33,638
What else?

153
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:35,515
What else?

154
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:42,772
For instance, you know
how big chain hotels

155
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,690
have those thick, fluffy bath mats?

156
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,151
Exactly! They’re super absorbent,

157
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:49,111
practically as soft as a bath towel.

158
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,863
Right?

159
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,616
So don’t you sometimes mistake them
for a bath towel?

160
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:55,284
-Oh, I do that all the time.
-Right?

161
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:58,704
On the other hand, our bath mats
are thin and stiff, right?

162
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,249
-They don’t absorb water that well either.
-Yeah.

163
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,751
So there’s no way you’d ever mistake them
for a bath towel.

164
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,419
Right.

165
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,506
That's the second point.

166
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,383
No, that's…

167
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,260
If our second unique selling point

168
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,637
is that, haven’t we already lost?

169
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,223
No, that's not true.

170
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,309
Welcome.

171
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,397
Um, thank you for accepting
the interview the other day.

172
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,065
It's my pleasure.

173
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:28,693
Is your manager around today?

174
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:33,281
Yes. Please wait a moment.

175
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,582
-Thank you for the other day.
-Don't mention it.

176
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,460
How can I help you today?

177
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,879
Aren't those two TV crew?

178
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,300
Yes. They're from the <i>Monday Late Show.</i>

179
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,553
I knew it. They interviewed me
the other day at Aeon.

180
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,013
Oh, they did?

181
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,765
They were asking for personal news

182
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:02,977
so I talked about the cashier
at Ichiyama who's really fast.

183
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,187
-I know her. It's the older lady, right?
-Yes!

184
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,733
And he was pretty hooked.

185
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,778
Do you think they're back for more?

186
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,282
I'm not sure.

187
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,992
<i>Most likely not.</i>

188
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,872
-Thank you so much.
-Don't mention it.

189
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

190
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:31,547
What was that about?

191
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,175
It was about conducting interviews.

192
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,428
But we turned them down last time.

193
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:41,140
They wanted to check if it would be okay
for them to conduct interviews

194
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,975
in front of the hotel.

195
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,685
What did you say?

196
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,439
I initially said filming
within the premises would be tricky,

197
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:54,028
but then they asked
if it would be okay outside the premises.

198
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,738
They're persistent.

199
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,574
Well, I couldn't possibly stop them
from doing that,

200
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,827
so I said if the interviewee
is okay with it, it's fine.

201
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,580
They're probably talking about me, right?

202
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:09,502
So the other day, I just happened
to get interviewed in front of Aeon.

203
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:11,212
Really?

204
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,506
I mentioned something
about a cashier at Ichiyama,

205
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,132
and they got really hooked.

206
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,551
-Ichiyama?
-Yes.

207
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,929
There's an older woman cashier
who's really quick.

208
00:11:20,721 --> 00:11:21,847
Is that so?

209
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:24,850
So maybe they came back to me
to know more about that.

210
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,478
<i>-Definitely not.</i>
-Oh.

211
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,480
But this actually works out well.

212
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,606
Why is that?

213
00:11:30,689 --> 00:11:33,609
Well, last time,
my makeup was pretty light,

214
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,362
but today I can actually put
on proper TV-ready makeup.

215
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,907
<i>There's really no need for that.</i>

216
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,034
Sorry for getting so hyped up.

217
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,577
Oh, not at all.

218
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,418
We've got quite a while until 4 p.m.

219
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,339
Let’s kill some time by interviewing
near Aeon for now.

220
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,382
Yeah.

221
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,640
I wonder if they're coming for Onodera?

222
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:09,019
No, they said they wanted
to hear from Takahashi.

223
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,604
Takahashi?

224
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,818
-No one said a thing about Takahashi, yes?
-Yeah, we didn't say anything.

225
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,196
Yumi only talked about Onodera.

226
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,407
Right?

227
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,536
Why Takahashi?

228
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,371
Maybe it's about <i>gunpla?</i>

229
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,376
I don't know.

230
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,044
I hope it's that.

231
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,840
Kiyomi, you can go for your break.

232
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,430
-Okay.
<i>-There's really no need for that makeup.</i>

233
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,640
Thanks for your work.

234
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,105
Well, Mom is quite busy with work.

235
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,610
But lately she's been going out for meals
with her friends a lot on weekends.

236
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,861
-I see.
-Yeah.

237
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,697
I feel more at ease that way too.

238
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,242
Just going back and forth between home
and work all the time.

239
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,120
-That would feel suffocating, right?
-Yeah.

240
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:12,374
But ever since she started meeting up
with her friends again,

241
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:16,170
I feel like her mood has brightened.
Not that it wasn't good to begin with.

242
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,590
I see. That's great to hear.

243
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:25,054
-Did Mom say anything else?
-Like what?

244
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,097
About meeting me.

245
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,808
Nothing in particular.
She said to have a good time.

246
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,311
I see.

247
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:35,606
She’s probably going out to eat
with her friends after work today too.

248
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,858
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

249
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,070
Then let's eat dinner before going back.

250
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,155
Yeah.

251
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,243
-Strange events?
-Yes.

252
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,620
Like seeing something strange happen,

253
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:53,290
or knowing someone around you
with an unusual ability…

254
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,376
Even the smallest thing is fine.

255
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,587
Okay, um,

256
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,882
I work at an elementary school.

257
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,260
-Oh, you're a teacher?
-Yes.

258
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,304
I can grab exactly the number
of worksheets

259
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,100
I need for my class just by feeling them.

260
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,685
Just by feeling them?

261
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,061
Yes,

262
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,188
I need 32 sheets,

263
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,483
and without counting, I can take exactly
that many almost every time.

264
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,694
-Almost every time?
-Yes.

265
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,322
If I do it ten times, I get it right
about seven or eight times.

266
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:28,784
-Wow, that’s impressive.
-Not at all.

267
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,289
The other day, there was an incident

268
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,291
where someone drew strange symbols

269
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,626
in an elementary school yard.

270
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,503
-Symbols?
-Yes.

271
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,798
I live near that school,

272
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,717
and on the night the graffiti was done,

273
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,345
I saw a figure on the roof
of the elementary school's gymnasium.

274
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,598
On top of the roof?

275
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,558
Yes. Up on the roof,

276
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,643
there seemed to be a man standing.

277
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,562
He threw a ball-like thing
towards the yard.

278
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,650
By the way, was that man wearing glasses?

279
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,238
-I'm not too sure about that.
-I see.

280
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:11,201
Here you go.

281
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,956
Is it even possible to get on top
of the gymnasium that easily?

282
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,667
-Normally, no.
-Right?

283
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,086
Do you think it's true?

284
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,674
In the past, I wouldn’t have believed it.

285
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,969
But after seeing
that dashcam footage earlier…

286
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,306
-I’m starting to think it's possible.
-I agree.

287
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,142
What about the elementary
school teacher’s story?

288
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,228
-We can drop that.
-Right?

289
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:44,818
Oh!

290
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,405
Mr. Uemura, we've been expecting you.

291
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:52,910
-Congratulations on passing your exam.
-Congratulations.

292
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,620
Thank you.

293
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,372
Thank you so much for the other day.

294
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,498
Don't mention it.

295
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,793
We should be thanking you for choosing
to stay with us again.

296
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,837
Are you here on a family trip?

297
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,547
Yes.

298
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,134
My son is moving out and renting
a place here starting this spring,

299
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,387
so we thought we’d take
a family trip before that.

300
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,975
Wow, choosing our hotel
for such an important trip…

301
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,643
We're really grateful.

302
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,355
-Are you sure our place was good enough?
-Eri.

303
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,525
Of course. More than anything, my son

304
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,026
really want to come back here.

305
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,237
Really?

306
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,321
That warms my heart!

307
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,865
-We truly appreciate it.
-Thank you.

308
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:34,702
Let's proceed with check-in.

309
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,954
This way, please. Welcome.

310
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,627
-This is your key card.
-Thank you.

311
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,629
-Enjoy your stay.
-Enjoy your stay.

312
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,755
That way?

313
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,132
-Which floor?
-Second.

314
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,049
-Second.
-Okay.

315
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,348
Didn't I tell you
our hotel has a certain charm?

316
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,850
Yeah.

317
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,061
You know, moments like this

318
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,564
make me feel like this job is worth it.

319
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,441
You're right.

320
00:17:05,523 --> 00:17:09,194
-Not that I ever feel that way otherwise.
-Yeah.

321
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,696
Wait, not even once?

322
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,907
-What, you do?
-Of course.

323
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,117
When?

324
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,372
Well, it’s hard to specify when,

325
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,082
but like…

326
00:17:22,165 --> 00:17:25,711
when a guest thanks us on their way out

327
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:27,963
or comes back for another stay,
that makes me happy.

328
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,883
Yeah, okay.

329
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,468
But, you know…

330
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,012
we sometimes get unreasonable complaints
from guests.

331
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:36,680
From time to time, yeah.

332
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:40,142
This is a crude, but there are times
when you think a guest is crap, right?

333
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,936
-That is crude.
-But let's be honest, you do, right?

334
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,732
I wouldn't go that far.

335
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,151
Really? Not even once?

336
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,195
Huh?

337
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,324
What gives you the right?

338
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,369
-There was that one time.
-See?

339
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,330
But that was it.

340
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,582
Really only that time?

341
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,709
In all the years you’ve worked here,
only then?

342
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,213
When I thought someone was crap?

343
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,341
I'm a single mom…

344
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,969
-Okay, maybe there was another time.
-See?

345
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,640
But I can't be blamed for feeling
that way once a year, right?

346
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:21,642
Really only once a year?

347
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:25,771
Maybe once every three months.

348
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,856
See?

349
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:30,192
What about you, Eri?
How often do you feel that way?

350
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,112
Once a year, maybe.

351
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,822
<i>I got played.</i>

352
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,782
-Hey.
-Yes?

353
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,826
That boy from earlier
stayed here before, right?

354
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,369
Yes, he did.

355
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,997
He stayed here for about a week
while studying for his entrance exam.

356
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,707
He passed the exam.

357
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,959
-That's great!
-Yes.

358
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,212
Mr. Murakami, may I ask you
a weird question?

359
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,131
-What is it?
-Mr. Murakami.

360
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,968
What is it about this hotel
that makes you want to keep staying here?

361
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,594
Oh, me?

362
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:01,223
I was wondering if maybe you actually
wanted to stay somewhere else,

363
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,183
but they didn't have rooms available.

364
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:06,270
Oh, no. I'm staying here
because I like it.

365
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,147
Right?

366
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,232
-See?
-Of course, why wouldn't you?

367
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,526
Actually, a long time ago,

368
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,111
I came and stayed here before.

369
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,238
-Really?
-Yeah.

370
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,739
So I have good memories here.

371
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,784
I didn't know that!

372
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,119
That's nice to hear.

373
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,247
Was it the unforgettable firmness
of the bath mat?

374
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,833
What do you mean?

375
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,961
Aw, it's already 3 p.m.

376
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,214
-When do you need to leave?
-Around 3:50.

377
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,342
I see.
Not really enough time for tea, huh?

378
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,469
Yeah.

379
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,013
When does your shift start today?

380
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,724
-It's my day off. I can drive you to work.
-Really?

381
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,059
-You're such a big help.
-Excuse me.

382
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,687
We're with <i>Monday Late Show</i>
from Nippon Television.

383
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,689
Do you have a moment to spare?

384
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:52,024
-Oh…
-Wait.

385
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:54,443
You're Ms. Isomura, right?

386
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,195
-From the Lake Hotel.
-Yes.

387
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,489
-They interviewed me previously.
-Oh, really?

388
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,491
Perfect timing!
I was hoping to see you again.

389
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,743
What's the matter?

390
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:06,288
I wanted to follow up
on what we talked about last time.

391
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,456
What we talked about?

392
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,082
Is it okay if we start filming?

393
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,336
-Is that alright with you?
-Is that okay?

394
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,712
-Yes, that's fine.
-Let's get started.

395
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:19,092
It's about someone who was able
to bend a 10 yen coin.

396
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:24,014
-Oh, Onodera?
-Yes! The thing is, after that,

397
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:26,808
we spoke to a few more people,

398
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,895
and now we’re wondering
if maybe it wasn't Mr. Onodera

399
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,981
but someone else…

400
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,234
Someone else? Like who?

401
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,445
Someone by the name of Mr. Takahashi.

402
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,495
Oh, you got it wrong.

403
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:48,205
-What do you mean?
-You see.

404
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,166
The 10 yen coin thing turned out
to be just a magic trick.

405
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,252
-Really?
-Yes.

406
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,171
So neither Onodera nor Takahashi

407
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,715
actually has any special abilities
or anything like that.

408
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,551
-I see.
-Yeah.

409
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,846
Well, the thing is,

410
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,016
we've got something we'd like you to see…

411
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,436
By the way,

412
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,523
I met Nakamoto the other day.

413
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,108
Nakamoto?

414
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,527
Oh, the TV thief?

415
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,238
You don't have to put it
like that, but yeah.

416
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,699
-Where?
-At a snack bar my friend runs.

417
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,326
She finished serving her sentence?

418
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,413
She was never arrested.

419
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,665
-So she's currently on the run?
-No, I mean.

420
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,209
We never filed a report.

421
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:35,460
Oh, really?

422
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,796
What was she doing there?

423
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,757
Just drinking and singing
like a normal patron would.

424
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,009
I see.

425
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,221
By the way, can you guess
what song she sang?

426
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,601
"Tsugunai" by Masashi Sada.

427
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,647
-Nope.
-"Tsugunai" by Teresa Teng.

428
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,232
Then…

429
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,568
-"Regret" by Miyuki Nakajima.
-Nope.

430
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,738
-"Sunao ni I'm Sorry" by The Checkers.
-Nope!

431
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,533
What's the name of that song again?

432
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,911
Oh, the opening of "Sailor Moon"?

433
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,538
-Yeah.
-Nope.

434
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,125
Hiding her feelings doesn't even begin
to justify it.

435
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,710
You've got a point.

436
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,047
This is you, right?

437
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,215
-Yes.
-I knew it.

438
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,135
This is what I want you to see.

439
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,431
This is Mr. Takahashi, right?

440
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,641
-Oh, yes.
-I knew it.

441
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,352
Sorry.

442
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,689
-Keep the camera rolling.
-Okay.

443
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,816
I got it.

444
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,571
Just looking at the footage,
he seems to have inhuman strength.

445
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,282
Um…

446
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:50,869
Actually, the guest
was conscious at that point.

447
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,497
-Really?
-Yes.

448
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,749
He was trying to get up on his own,

449
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,834
so maybe that’s why it seems that way.

450
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,461
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

451
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,171
Um…

452
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:04,007
I actually work at the snack bar
where he was drinking.

453
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,175
-Really?
-Yes.

454
00:23:05,258 --> 00:23:08,720
I helped him get in the taxi that night.
He was totally conscious.

455
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,889
-Right?
-What?

456
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,726
-Okay.
-Yeah.

457
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,853
"Runaway."

458
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,439
By Rats &amp; Star? Nope.

459
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,610
-"Jitensha Dorobou" by UNICORN?
-Nope.

460
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,947
I'm out of ideas.

461
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,657
Are you giving up?

462
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,451
Yeah. What did she sing?

463
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,079
Anri's…

464
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,456
"Cat's Eye."

465
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,333
What?

466
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,836
She's still going for it!

467
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,171
Right? I was shocked.

468
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,800
Okay, but how good
was my improvising back there?

469
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:47,801
"It was just a magic trick"?

470
00:23:47,884 --> 00:23:51,054
-Yeah. And the "he was conscious" part.
-Oh, yeah.

471
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:53,014
I wasn't bad either.
I backed you up instantly.

472
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,683
That was a nice move.

473
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,393
-We totally fooled them.
-Yeah.

474
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:58,937
They believed us.

475
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:01,314
They're definitely hiding something.

476
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,442
Right? There's no way
that guy was actually conscious.

477
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,950
Maybe this scoop isn't appropriate
for our show.

478
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:13,493
What do you mean?

479
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,371
That dashcam footage…

480
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,249
and how weirdly defensive
everyone is being…

481
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,795
Doesn’t it feel like something
is going on behind the scenes?

482
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,425
Yeah, if that footage is real,
you might be onto something.

483
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:34,472
This could easily be
an entire special episode on its own.

484
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,062
Thank you.

485
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,650
Okay, now we wait.

486
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,818
Yes.

487
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:51,156
Uh… Which way will he be coming from?

488
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:53,783
Oh, I see what you mean.

489
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,037
I’ll cover this side,

490
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,831
and if he comes from that way,
just stop him and contact me.

491
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,292
Okay. I'll let you know.

492
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,378
-Ugh, this is the worst.
-What's wrong?

493
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,298
I did that interview with my hair looking
like a mess.

494
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:11,176
Oh yeah, it was super windy out there.

495
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:14,179
The thought of that airing nationwide
is embarrassing.

496
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,389
-For me too.
-Really?

497
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,308
I'm basically wearing loungewear.

498
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,896
-I really hope they cut that part out.
-I know, right?

499
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,316
-Or at least blur us a bit.
-Where, though?

500
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,943
My hair and your outfit.

501
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,820
-We'd look even more suspicious.
-You think so?

502
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,367
Oh, it's Takahashi.

503
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,829
-Yeah. His helmet gives off alien vibes.
-Right?

504
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,165
It's this late already?

505
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:44,542
-Should we head over?
-Yeah.

506
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,809
Excuse me.

507
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,561
You're Mr. Takahashi, right?

508
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,022
The <i>Monday Late Show…</i>

509
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,275
Yes. Thank you for your time
the other day.

510
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,901
It's my pleasure.

511
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,904
-How can I help you today?
-Just a short interview, if it's okay.

512
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:14,614
-An interview?
-Yes.

513
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:21,579
They caught Takahashi.

514
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:24,416
They're really persistent.

515
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,836
Hey, should we go over there
and ask him to cut our part?

516
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,965
-That's embarrassing as it is.
-How so?

517
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,301
Wouldn’t that just make us look
super self-conscious?

518
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,553
I see what you mean.

519
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,183
Okay, if you were

520
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,020
in Nakamoto’s shoes,
what song would you sing?

521
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,062
What?

522
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,523
-Like, if I had stolen a TV?
-Yeah.

523
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,358
You were at a bar with your ex-colleague,

524
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,112
and the other patrons kept asking
you to sing.

525
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,198
Let me think…

526
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,869
<i>"Oozora to Daichi no Naka de"</i>
by Chiharu Matsuyama.

527
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,203
Why is that?

528
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,164
You know, it’s got this grand feel to it.

529
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:07,208
Makes stealing a TV seem
like such a minor thing.

530
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:09,753
-I see where you're coming from.
-What about you, Kiyomi?

531
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,175
I'd go with any English song.

532
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,343
-Really?
-Yeah.

533
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,637
People wouldn’t really focus
on the lyrics then.

534
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,640
It would be like you're escaping overseas.

535
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,351
That's a smart move too.

536
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:28,271
-Hello.
-Hello.

537
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,240
I just ran into him…

538
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,285
I've talked to him…

539
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,581
Just call a taxi for now.

540
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,045
How’d it go?

541
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,635
There's just way too much going on.

542
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,054
It's that serious?

543
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,268
Depending on how things go,
it could make the news.

544
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,566
You were stopped by a TV crew
from Nippon Television earlier, right?

545
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,027
-You saw that?
-Yeah.

546
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,654
What was it about?

547
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,031
They showed me some dashcam footage.

548
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,075
Oh, from the taxi?

549
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,410
They showed it to me too.

550
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:24,577
-Really?
-Yeah.

551
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,205
They stopped me at Aeon today

552
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,624
and started asking a bunch
of things about you.

553
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,960
Like what?

554
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,295
They said that maybe the one
with mysterious abilities

555
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:37,590
wasn't Onodera, but you.

556
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,762
-And what did you say?
-Want to make a guess?

557
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,016
Did I tell the Nippon Television crew

558
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:51,146
about your secret,
or did I keep my promise?

559
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:53,898
Are you seriously making this a quiz?

560
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,191
What's your guess?

561
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:59,529
I hope you didn't sell me out…

562
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,073
I mean, obviously you wouldn't, right?

563
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,324
Interesting.

564
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,327
The correct answer…

565
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,123
-Welcome!
-Welcome.

566
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:13,209
-Are you checking in?
-Yes, I'm Miyamoto.

567
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,420
Mr. Miyamoto…
Please give me a few moments.

568
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,217
This is your key card.

569
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:23,136
Please enjoy your stay.

570
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:33,438
Mr. Miyamoto came
with a different woman again.

571
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,648
-Huh?
-She's the fourth one I’ve seen.

572
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,692
-Isn't he something else?
-Is that so?

573
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,986
I thought the last woman
he was with was the one.

574
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:44,324
-When he was with her, he seemed differe--
-Okay, sorry.

575
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,075
But that's not important right now.

576
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,829
-The answer from earlier.
-Huh?

577
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,290
Whether you spilled the beans or not.

578
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:54,250
-Oh, you're talking about that.
-Of course.

579
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:55,585
Of course I kept my promise.

580
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:58,463
-Are you sure?
-I've got you covered.

581
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,672
-I see.
-Yeah.

582
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,382
-Thanks.
-Don't mention it.

583
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,845
So, what do you think?

584
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,597
About the TV crew?

585
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,516
-No, Mr. Miyamoto's girlfriend.
-Oh, that?

586
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,977
-What? They came again?
-Yeah.

587
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,356
And apparently, they wanted to talk
to Takahashi.

588
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,482
Why is that?

589
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,859
No idea.

590
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,530
By the way, they interviewed me today too.

591
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:24,656
Really?

592
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,907
For the <i>Monday Late Show?</i>

593
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,369
Yeah. They were asking about strange stuff
that’s happened around me.

594
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,995
What did you say?

595
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,206
I told them about my special ability.

596
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,958
What's that?

597
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,877
I can grab the exact number of handouts
for my class

598
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,255
just by feel.

599
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,345
-Without counting?
-Yeah. Isn't that impressive?

600
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,806
I think it's kinda lame.

601
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:52,976
It’s no worse
than your urine sample cup story.

602
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,812
Nah, mine takes skill.

603
00:30:55,895 --> 00:30:57,564
But the fact that they came back

604
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,941
could mean your urine sample cup story
got cut.

605
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,735
-You've got a point.
-No way they'd cut it after all that.

606
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,239
What would you do if yours got cut
and mine got chosen?

607
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,408
I'd shower them with urine samples.

608
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,245
That's one way to get on TV.

609
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,580
Yeah, on the evening news.

610
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,001
But I'm more curious
about Takahashi's interview.

611
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,961
Yeah, me too.

612
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:22,171
No one revealed his secret, right?

613
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,548
Nope.

614
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,466
Then maybe it's about something else.

615
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,094
Didn't you say he was geeking out
about <i>gunpla?</i>

616
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,847
Yeah, he showed them pictures
and talked passionately about it.

617
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,432
Maybe it's about that then.

618
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,309
I hope so.

619
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,644
If they're featuring <i>gunpla,</i>
might as well air my part.

620
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,897
Nah, <i>gunpla</i> hands down. Or even my story.

621
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,318
So, how did you manage to fool him?

622
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,527
-Oh, the TV crewman?
-Yeah.

623
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,822
Well, I tried to ignore him
and just walk away,

624
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,657
but he was really persistent.

625
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,662
<i>Here's your change and receipt.</i>

626
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,833
This is you, right?

627
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,085
Uh, sorry, I really have to go.

628
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,048
The one who was really fast and thwarted
the convenience store robbery was you, no?

629
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,508
-I’m already late for work.
-Then, tomorrow morning.

630
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,011
-Can we talk after your shift?
-Listen.

631
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,056
I’d appreciate it if you stopped
following me. You're being a nuisance.

632
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,433
I promise I won’t use this against you,
Mr. Takahashi!

633
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,738
Are you okay?

634
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,536
Yes.

635
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,455
Sorry about that.

636
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,315
You've seen it for yourself.

637
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,068
Are you satisfied now?

638
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,240
Without my abilities…

639
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,035
you’d be dead right now, am I right?

640
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,624
I just saved your life…

641
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,129
so the least you can do
is stay out of my business.

642
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,811
And by the way, the extent
of my abilities goes way beyond this.

643
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:47,859
I can move objects without touching them.

644
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,863
I can even control the forces of nature.

645
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,199
I'm sure you know what I'm getting at.

646
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,371
If you want to live a long life,

647
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,291
you’d better stop digging around.

648
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,960
And never tell anyone about this.

649
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,795
Otherwise…

650
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:12,007
something unfortunate might happen to you.

651
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,385
What kind of thing?

652
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,973
An accident, or a natural disaster.
Who knows?

653
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,186
In any case, really unfortunate things

654
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,188
are going to start happening around you.

655
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,485
Forget today ever happened.

656
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,196
It’s better for both of us.

657
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,581
<i>So, you saved his life, huh?</i>

658
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,753
But honestly, I hesitated a little there.

659
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:50,254
-You did?
-Yeah.

660
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,801
I mean, he was trying to mess up my life.

661
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:55,967
Right.

662
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,596
But still, I couldn't just let him die.

663
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,139
Yeah.

664
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:04,435
But after a threat like that,
I doubt he’ll bother you again.

665
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,187
I hope so.

666
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,565
But the last part was a bluff, right?

667
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,150
Which part?

668
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,570
The bit about being able
to move objects and control nature.

669
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,447
You made that up, right?

670
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,952
I may have exaggerated a little,

671
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,454
but I wouldn’t call it a total lie.

672
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,082
Really? Then prove it.

673
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,208
-I lied.
-Make it snow.

674
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,126
-Sorry.
-Please?

675
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,377
Then what can you do?

676
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,003
-Nothing.
-What about rain?

677
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,508
Are you sure?

678
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,803
It was exactly like what
that truck driver described before.

679
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:40,596
He actually moved at high speed?

680
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,600
I think that's an understatement.

681
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,395
If anything, it felt like teleportation.

682
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,313
There's no way that's true.

683
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:52,859
I'm serious. Look, my hand
is still shaking.

684
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,321
So, people like that do actually exist…

685
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:02,160
But that whole thing about moving objects
and controlling nature is likely a bluff.

686
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,996
-You think so?
-It kinda felt like it.

687
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:09,709
He just made that part up
on the spot, so it seemed fake.

688
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:12,795
But it's a fact that he
moved me out of the way at high speed.

689
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:16,465
Right. So, what do we do now?

690
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,053
Well…

691
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,515
Let's discuss this with Mr. Niiza for now

692
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,559
and see what he thinks.

693
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,980
What do you mean?

694
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,523
That scoop

695
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,525
turned out to be way bigger
than we thought.

696
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,236
That urban legend guy or whatever?

697
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,405
Yes.

698
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:42,450
I'm not even sure how to handle it.

699
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,535
-What happened?
-First.

700
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:48,372
Let me show you some incredible footage
from a taxi dashcam.

701
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,166
-What is it?
-Hold on.

702
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,667
In the worst-case scenario,

703
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,503
it might be big enough
for its own special feature.

704
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,255
-Really?
-Maybe even breaking news…

705
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,716
Hm?

706
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,259
What's wrong?

707
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,803
-What?
-Please give us a moment.

708
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,680
Let me plug it in again.

709
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,435
THIS FOLDER IS EMPTY.

710
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,394
Huh?

711
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,312
Does it not show up?

712
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,981
Why is it not working? The hard drive…

713
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,692
-It should be in here.
-Is it gone?

714
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,569
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

715
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,572
-I'll plug it in again.
-We really did get the footage!

716
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,449
Yes, without a doubt.

717
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:27,078
Well, tough luck.

718
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:31,415
Mysteriously vanishing data
may just be another one of his skills.

719
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,423
-What are you guys doing?
-Man.

720
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,968
What now? Where is the second segment
taking place again?

721
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,180
-Okay.
-I'm counting on you.

722
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,141
-Okay.
-Do you just think I'm unlucky?

723
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,938
Yes… Extremely.

724
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:04,907
<i>An accident, or a natural disaster.</i>
<i>Who knows?</i>

725
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:07,576
In any case, really unfortunate things

726
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,496
are going to start happening around you.

727
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,003
What do we do? Should we go back for more?

728
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,131
-Nah.
-Huh?

729
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,508
I think we've had enough.

730
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:35,104
LAKE HOTEL

731
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,196
Good morning.

732
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,324
Good morning, Ms. Endou.
Morning shift today?

733
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,701
Yes. Are you taking a picture
of the hotel?

734
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,331
-I wanted to capture the nearby scenery.
-Oh.

735
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,790
That's nice.

736
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:58,627
With all the redevelopment happening,
this place is going to change a lot.

737
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:04,342
Well, this part of town
seems pretty untouched, though.

738
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,427
I hope so…

739
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,599
Oh, by the way,
I’ll be leaving the hotel soon.

740
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,602
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

741
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,063
I have to return soon.

742
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:21,400
That's a little sad to hear.

743
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,569
Well, yeah.

744
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,947
Just like how this hotel
is shutting down soon.

745
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:29,742
Huh?

746
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:35,831
Oh, you haven't heard?

747
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,460
No.

748
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:43,839
Sorry, it was a joke. Forget about it.

749
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:48,094
What do you mean by that?

750
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,804
I'm so sorry.

751
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,181
Could you pretend you didn't hear it?

752
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,224
Hmm…

753
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,311
Okay.

754
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,524
But in exchange,

755
00:40:01,607 --> 00:40:03,818
could you

756
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:05,319
tell me the whole story?

757
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,862
But…

758
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:12,660
you have to go now, don't you?

759
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,289
What should I do?

760
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:21,794
Okay, I've got it.
When is your lunch break?

761
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,296
Midday.

762
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,508
Alright. Around that time,

763
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:30,052
I’ll be outside that convenience store.
We can talk there.

764
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:33,848
I understand.

765
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,353
Thank you.

766
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,439
FRONT DESK

767
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,023
We hope you stay with us again.

768
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,322
Getting up early is tough,

769
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,617
but there’s something nice
about starting work in the morning.

770
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,911
-Yeah, I guess.
-And night shift…

771
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,538
<i>Now that Takahashi is allowed</i>

772
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,999
<i>to use the hotel’s baths</i>
<i>even on his days off,</i>

773
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:04,628
<i>he has started taking shifts</i>
<i>outside of his usual night ones.</i>

774
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:08,966
<i>But none of that matters right now.</i>

775
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:13,137
<i>The thought that this hotel</i>
<i>might be shutting down</i>

776
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,723
<i>was all I could think about.</i>

777
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,684
Humans are meant to live by this rhythm,

778
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,686
and I'm once again reminded of that.

779
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,521
I guess.

780
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:28,068
Were you thinking why would an alien
like me care about sleep schedules?

781
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,654
-No.
-Really?

782
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,658
You don't seem too lively today.

783
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,995
This is my usual self, though.

784
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,455
Really?

785
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,582
I guess everyone is the same
in the morning.

786
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:44,627
Maybe I’m just on a morning high
since this is new for me.

787
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,170
I think that's it.

788
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,839
But even I do get sleepy.

789
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,633
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

790
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:54,845
I was up all night working on my <i>gunpla,</i>
and I still wasn't able to finish it.

791
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:56,972
I told myself I’d stop
at a convenient point.

792
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,850
-But I just couldn’t find one…
-Right.

793
00:42:01,101 --> 00:42:02,019
Here,

794
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,481
look at this.
This is what I was working on…

795
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,943
This is a mobile suit gundam
called Galbaldy…

796
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,487
<i>Currently, Wakaba</i>
<i>is in her second year of middle school.</i>

797
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:16,825
<i>She still has high school</i>
<i>and university ahead of her.</i>

798
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,248
<i>My ex-husband sends child support</i>
<i>every month,</i>

799
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:25,000
<i>but that doesn’t mean we’re well off.</i>

800
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:30,548
<i>And finding a new job at my age</i>

801
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,132
<i>is not easy.</i>

802
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:39,557
<i>For the time being, I need to find</i>
<i>out fast from Mr. Murakami what he meant.</i>

803
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:41,892
LAKE HOTEL

804
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:45,271
<i>And then… came the promised lunch break.</i>

805
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,315
<i>What I'm really curious about…</i>

806
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,777
<i>is how Mr. Murakami even knows about this.</i>

807
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,739
<i>I work here, and I didn’t hear a thing.</i>

808
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,452
<i>Could Mr. Murakami be…</i>

809
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:03,581
<i>some big-shot</i>
<i>within the management of this hotel?</i>

810
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,044
<i>Maybe he’s pretending to be a guest</i>
<i>so he can secretly check on things.</i>

811
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,840
<i>I feel like I've seen this before</i>
<i>in a drama…</i>

812
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,259
<i>It's in GTO!</i>

813
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,928
<i>The chairwoman in GTO disguised herself</i>

814
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,140
<i>as a kiosk staff member just for fun.</i>

815
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,603
<i>If that’s the case,</i>

816
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,106
<i>as someone who's been nice to him,</i>

817
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:33,777
<i>he might help me out in some way.</i>

818
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,583
Sorry to keep you waiting!

819
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,294
No worries. I just got here too.

820
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:52,212
Let's talk over there.

821
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,172
Okay.

822
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,969
-Have a drink.
-Thank you.

823
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,017
Um… Mr. Murakami, are you by any chance

824
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,978
someone of high status
within the management of this hotel?

825
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,105
-Huh?
-Well.

826
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,816
I mean, you know something

827
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,320
even the staff don’t.

828
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,656
So that's why I thought
that could be the case.

829
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:22,618
Fair enough.

830
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,538
Sorry to disappoint, but that's not it.

831
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,790
I see.

832
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,834
Then how do you know about this?

833
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,716
Well…

834
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,845
since you’ve always treated me well,

835
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,181
I’ll start from the beginning.

836
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,850
Thank you.

837
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,399
Um…

838
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:58,028
What I'm about to tell you
might sound unbelievable,

839
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,490
but I hope you'll listen
until the end, okay?

840
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:03,951
Okay.

841
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,704
What do you mean, unbelievable?

842
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:09,248
Well,

843
00:45:10,707 --> 00:45:12,709
you may think I'm lying,

844
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,130
but it's really the truth.

845
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,006
Okay.

846
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:26,056
<i>This feels like déjà vu.</i>

847
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,600
<i>Could it be…</i>

848
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,477
Um…

849
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:32,980
The reason why

850
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,358
I know that the hotel is shutting down…

851
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,902
is because I'm actually…

852
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,117
from the future.

853
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:48,871
Huh?

854
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,876
