1
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:30,697
Oh, right.

2
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:51,342
Okay.

3
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,013
Hello?

4
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,141
It's my pleasure.

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,018
Yes…

6
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:04,813
Hmm…

7
00:01:05,355 --> 00:01:07,609
On the 16th…

8
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,235
Please give me a moment.

9
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,239
At night, right?

10
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,243
If so, that should be fine.

11
00:01:18,578 --> 00:01:20,872
Alright, I'll be there at that time.

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,042
Goodbye.

13
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,866
-Have you contacted headquarters?
-Yes, I just did.

14
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,869
Once the report is sorted,
we're done for today.

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,371
Okay.

16
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,061
Okay.

17
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,229
See you.

18
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,692
If we stick around,
they might get suspicious. Let’s move.

19
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,651
Okay.

20
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:41,286
Once power is restored, the security
signals will also come back on,

21
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,495
so please don't worry.

22
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,581
This is our incident report.

23
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,082
Thank you.

24
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,340
-Another car just pulled up.
-What?

25
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,844
I wonder if it's the power company?

26
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,263
Maybe they’re here to fix the power?

27
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,180
Wait,

28
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,057
won't the security cameras come back on?

29
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,685
-You're right.
-That's not good.

30
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,151
PEOPLE FROM THE POWER COMPANY CAME

31
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,986
THE POWER IS COMING BACK ON

32
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,988
THE SECURITY CAMERAS TOO

33
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:37,634
-The power should be restored shortly.
-Noted.

34
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,740
Oh?

35
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,036
-Mr. Takahashi!
-Mr. Takahashi.

36
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,830
Over here!

37
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:51,249
<i>I could have gotten it</i>
<i>if I broke the lock,</i>

38
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,667
but you know,

39
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,044
leaving evidence would’ve been risky.

40
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,171
It's okay, it's not your fault.

41
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,008
At least you didn't get caught.

42
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,009
Yeah.

43
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,054
Well… we’ll just have to come up
with a new plan later.

44
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:06,639
For now…

45
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,932
shall we call it a night?

46
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,727
-Yeah, it's getting late.
-Let's go home.

47
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:11,811
Yeah.

48
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,438
See you.

49
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:14,939
Thank you for your work.

50
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,982
Be careful.

51
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,526
-Be careful.
-Take care, Mr. Takahashi.

52
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:20,153
Take care.

53
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,071
-I'm feeling hungry.
-Um…

54
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,406
Could you take me to the hotel?

55
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,824
-Oh, for the hot spring?
-Yeah.

56
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:26,117
-Okay.
-Oh.

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,827
Then I'll let the manager know.

58
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,829
-Sorry about this.
-Thank you.

59
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:32,457
By the way, which university
did you graduate from, Onodera?

60
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,042
Kaibun University.

61
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,169
Oh, so did Kiyomi.

62
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:37,920
-Really?
-Yeah.

63
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,339
-Which school were you in?
-The School of Economics.

64
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,633
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

65
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,428
LAKE HOTEL

66
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,722
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it. See you.

67
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,348
-I'll be in touch.
-Okay.

68
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,060
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you for your work.

69
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,484
Takahashi!

70
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,402
Thank you, manager.

71
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,779
No one's at the front desk now.

72
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,490
-So you can just head in.
-Sorry about this.

73
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,950
You’re on the morning shift tomorrow, yes?

74
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,368
That's right.

75
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,996
If you'd like, you can just crash
in one of the empty rooms.

76
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,831
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

77
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,416
Thank you so much!

78
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,459
I appreciate it.

79
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,294
Sorry about this.

80
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,379
MEN'S BATH
CLOSED FOR THE DAY

81
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,969
I left the key for room 301
next to the basket.

82
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,764
Thank you. Seriously, I owe you.

83
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,183
-For everything.
-Don't mention it.

84
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,143
You’re helping to save this hotel.

85
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,355
-It’s the least I can do.
-Thank you.

86
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,400
You know, if you’d just told me
about the whole alien thing earlier,

87
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,736
you could have
used the hot spring any time.

88
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,906
Yeah, I know.

89
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,659
<i>-Why didn’t I tell him?</i>
-Well, initially.

90
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:54,038
<i>-A kind and trustworthy person, sooner?</i>
-When I heard it, I was a bit surprised.

91
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,999
-That day, my mind was all on Onodera.
<i>-By the way.</i>

92
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,419
<i>-That foam on his neck is bugging me.</i>
-Even now, thinking back.

93
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,172
-The side-to-side jumps were amazing.
<i>-If I tell him now,</i>

94
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:07,051
<i>-it’ll ruin the flow.</i>
-It was my first time meeting an alien,

95
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,179
<i>-But it's really bugging me.</i>
-and I realized how different they were.

96
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,890
Well,

97
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,976
when you think about it, in a way,

98
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,811
we’re all aliens.

99
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,316
Right.

100
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,821
<i>I should've told him earlier.</i>

101
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,358
<i>The plan to steal the agreement failed,</i>

102
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,277
<i>but it’s too soon to give up.</i>

103
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:10,406
<i>Right now, I've got many strong allies</i>
<i>by my side.</i>

104
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,243
<i>At first, their shamelessness</i>

105
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:16,704
<i>and loose lips baffled me,</i>

106
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:20,124
<i>but in a way, that’s exactly what sav--</i>

107
00:08:32,886 --> 00:08:33,721
<i>No,</i>

108
00:08:35,347 --> 00:08:37,225
<i>this is not the time for that.</i>

109
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:41,687
<i>I don’t have time to be afraid.</i>

110
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:08,965
Can you cut it out already?

111
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,342
I’m exhausted and I've got
an early shift tomorrow!

112
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,803
Maybe you don’t have to work,

113
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,596
but I've got to pay the bills!

114
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,139
And just so you know, I'm an alien!

115
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,568
<i>We don't even belong to the same category.</i>

116
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,281
I really appreciate your support

117
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,284
during the election.

118
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,496
Yes, of course,
regarding the multipurpose center,

119
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,457
we’re thinking of proceeding
with Asano Construction.

120
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,168
Yes.

121
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,547
I look forward to doing business
with you again in the future.

122
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,008
Of course. It would be my pleasure.

123
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,760
Alright, take care.

124
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,397
Oh, hey, about the suggestion letters,

125
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,566
could you take a look at them?

126
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,069
Yeah, just draft some kind of response

127
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,863
and send it out under my name.

128
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,450
Alright, thanks.

129
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:24,165
<i>What other proof could we get?</i>

130
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:26,167
<i>I think all you can do now</i>

131
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,377
<i>is photograph the moment</i>
<i>the bribe is handed over.</i>

132
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,631
-You're right.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

133
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,383
<i>But that alone</i>
<i>might not be incriminating enough.</i>

134
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,218
-Really?
<i>-Yeah.</i>

135
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,595
<i>So, at that time,</i>

136
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:39,639
<i>if you could get testimony</i>
<i>from those involved</i>

137
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,891
<i>that the mayor's committing fraud,</i>
<i>that would help.</i>

138
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:45,269
Okay… Testimony.

139
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,147
-Let's leave that part to my husband.
-Right.

140
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,690
Thank you.

141
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,318
-Then all that’s left is the photo.
-Yeah.

142
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,988
-Thanks, Minoken.
<i>-Call me if anything else comes up.</i>

143
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,615
Will do. See you!

144
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,326
-Thank you. Bye!
-Bye!

145
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:01,327
Okay.

146
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,038
Photos, huh?

147
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,790
That's the trickiest part.

148
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,042
We don’t even know where
or when it's happening.

149
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,585
Yeah.

150
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,420
Don’t those deals go down at <i>ryotei?</i>

151
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,423
-Right, that's my impression.
-Places like Komachi?

152
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,509
Didn't they go to one of them
the other day?

153
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,469
Komachi, for sure.

154
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,430
So all we need is the date and time.

155
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,724
Then we can go in at the right time

156
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,769
and sneak a photo
through the sliding doors…

157
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,522
-I guess.
-Yeah.

158
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,315
But that place is expensive, right?

159
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,150
-Yeah.
-Komachi is expensive.

160
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,735
-I figured.
-The drinks too.

161
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,863
If you order a full meal,
it costs at least 10,000 yen per person.

162
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,782
-That's expensive!
-But the food is great.

163
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,991
Is that so?

164
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,160
Hey, at a restaurant like that,

165
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,912
can't we just order soft drinks?

166
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:48,499
-That would be really awkward.
-What about if just one of us--

167
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,668
What's wrong?

168
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,962
I just remembered. Back when

169
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,547
I was hiding in the owner’s office,

170
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,924
she was on the phone,

171
00:11:57,007 --> 00:12:00,469
and now that I think about it, she might
have been talking to Ms. Umemoto.

172
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,846
-What?
-You think so?

173
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,890
In order to track the security guards,

174
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,436
I had enhanced my hearing, so I picked up
on the conversation too.

175
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,021
If I recall correctly, it was a woman.

176
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,356
What were they talking about?

177
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,985
My focus was on the security guards,

178
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,487
so I didn’t catch the details.

179
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,032
Can’t you just use your abilities?

180
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,325
Huh?

181
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,327
I mean, the information is probably

182
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:29,373
in your brain somewhere,
but you just can’t recall it.

183
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,750
-Yeah.
-If that's the case.

184
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:33,836
Don't you just need to boost your memory?

185
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,922
-What?
-You heard the conversation, right?

186
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,467
-Well, yeah.
-He can do that too?

187
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:42,636
Yeah, that’s how he got
into Yamanashi University.

188
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
-The School of Medicine.
-Oh, wow.

189
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,890
You're capable of anything!

190
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,350
-It's nothing impressive.
-You're being humble.

191
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:52,021
Well then, we're counting on you
to recall that.

192
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,315
Well…

193
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,775
What's wrong?

194
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,654
-I've got to enhance my brain, right?
-Yeah.

195
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:05,242
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

196
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,619
-What's wrong?
-You'll go bald.

197
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,703
Ah.

198
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:10,122
If possible, I'd like to avoid that route.

199
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,040
What does he mean?

200
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,418
If he enhances his brain,
the side effect is hair loss.

201
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,963
I didn't know that.

202
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,382
But surely it's unavoidable.

203
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,550
If the hotel shuts down,

204
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,761
you might actually die.

205
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,304
Yeah, but…

206
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:27,598
If you had to pick, wouldn't you
rather lose some hair than die?

207
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,183
Yes, I know.

208
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,851
But…

209
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:37,358
could you give me just a bit more time
to remember on my own?

210
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:40,069
Well, if you can do it,
that would be the best option.

211
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,780
I'd appreciate it if you'd
give me some time.

212
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:44,114
Okay.

213
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,417
We're in the middle of packing right now.

214
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,127
-We'll be moving next week.
-Is that so?

215
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,129
-I can help if you need.
-Wait, really?

216
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,382
-That would be a lifesaver!
-Then I'll come too.

217
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,925
-Let's go.
-Really?

218
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,635
-Cheers!
-Wait.

219
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,345
There’s a sports festival afterparty?

220
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,265
Yeah, there'll be karaoke afterwards too.

221
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,976
All on the same day, right?
That’s intense.

222
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,771
The kids will be singing
and dancing along to a nursery rhyme,

223
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,940
and we teachers have to dance
in front of everyone!

224
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,359
No way! You're dancing too, Hacchi?

225
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,569
-Yeah.
-Wow.

226
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,154
If anything, I go harder at the afterparty
than the festival.

227
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,656
That sounds exhausting.

228
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:32,538
-Um, Takahashi.
-What is it?

229
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:35,416
Just to let you know,
it’s been 30 minutes. Any luck?

230
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,085
I still can’t quite remember it.

231
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,380
What's your plan? Are you going
to keep trying on your own?

232
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,300
No, it's fine.

233
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:48,095
-Okay, then please use your abilities.
-Sorry about this.

234
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,607
<i>I contacted headquarters just now.</i>

235
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,692
<i>-Once the report is…</i>
<i>-The security signals will…</i>

236
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:04,194
<i>…so please don't worry.</i>

237
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,988
<i>Hello?</i>

238
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,741
<i>This is Umemoto speaking.</i>
<i>I appreciate your time.</i>

239
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,118
<i>Regarding the hand-over…</i>

240
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:13,537
-Yes…
<i>-Would the 16th work for you?</i>

241
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,664
<i>As for the time, how does 9 p.m. sound?</i>

242
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,791
<i>Alright, I'll be there at that time.</i>

243
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:20,753
<i>Okay, let's meet at Fuji-Asada's</i>
<i>self-service gas station.</i>

244
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:23,297
I remember now!

245
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,299
What did you hear?

246
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:28,510
First, the voice
was definitely Mayor Umemoto.

247
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,929
Right.

248
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,222
Besides, she clearly mentioned
the hand-over.

249
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,391
-Oh!
-When will it happen?

250
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,268
At 9 p.m. on March 16,

251
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,937
at Fuji-Asada's self-service gas station.

252
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,857
The self-service gas station?

253
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,318
Is that the place I'm thinking of?

254
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,236
MINOKEN

255
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,323
<i>There have certainly been cases</i>
<i>of hand-overs being made at gas stations.</i>

256
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,158
Oh, really?

257
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:54,203
<i>Self-service stations</i>
<i>barely have any staff,</i>

258
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:56,121
<i>and if you're inside a car,</i>
<i>it’s more private</i>

259
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:59,208
<i>-than any restaurant.</i>
-You've got a point.

260
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,794
But if we know the time and place,

261
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,796
can’t we just call the police to nab them?

262
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,881
Right, rather than us having
to make a move,

263
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,424
it's much faster for them to go.

264
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,550
<i>No…</i>

265
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,096
<i>a tip-off alone might not be</i>
<i>reliable enough to get them to act.</i>

266
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,139
Is that so?

267
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,767
Thanks, Minoken!

268
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:18,352
<i>-Don't mention it.</i>
-Thank you.

269
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,479
-Wait, is that Minoken?
-Yep.

270
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,064
Minoken!

271
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,108
<i>Who are you?</i>

272
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,193
Naomi Takeda! Does that ring any bells?

273
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,989
<i>-Takeda? It's been a while!</i>
-Yeah.

274
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,617
-Hey, let’s grab a drink soon!
<i>-I'm down!</i>

275
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:34,994
Okay, see you!

276
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,621
-Bye!
-We'll be in touch again. Thank you!

277
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,542
-Your treat, okay?
-Bye!

278
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,962
I guess we've just got to
capture that moment ourselves.

279
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,880
Yeah.

280
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,966
Um, Mr. Takahashi.

281
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,927
By any chance, do you shoot webs
from your wrists or things like that?

282
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,804
-Webs?
-You mean, like Spider-Man?

283
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,640
Yeah! Yesterday, I was watching

284
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,808
<i>Spider-Man</i> at home,

285
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,268
and Ritsu said, "It's Mr. Takahashi!"

286
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,478
Aw, how cute is that?

287
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,689
Well, Spider-Man does
zip around super-fast too.

288
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,733
Right? So I was thinking,

289
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,193
maybe he could do something like that.

290
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,155
Then, you know, during the hand-over,
he could just web them both up!

291
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,031
-Ah.
-I see what you're getting at.

292
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,616
-Can you?
-Of course not!

293
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,535
-I figured.
-I see…

294
00:17:16,617 --> 00:17:19,288
Alright, I need to leave for work soon.
See you.

295
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,789
-Bye!
-See you!

296
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:24,042
-See you!
-Be careful on your way there.

297
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,795
Bye!

298
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,214
Yeah…

299
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,841
Uh…

300
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,259
-Can I ask something?
-Sure.

301
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,055
Who was that?

302
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,473
Huh?

303
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,392
-Naomi.
-She's our classmate.

304
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,227
-Well, I can tell that much.
-Wait.

305
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:44,980
-We didn't introduce her to you?
-No.

306
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,398
Really?

307
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,401
-I just assumed someone did.
-Me too.

308
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,987
She was there the day I snuck
into the owner's office too.

309
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,031
-You're right.
-Hold on.

310
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,408
Why was she there?

311
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:59,912
I was having lunch with her
earlier that day, and when I said

312
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:02,831
we were all meeting up later,
she wanted to come, so I brought her.

313
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,791
Oh, right.

314
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:06,376
I thought it would be okay since she'd be
in a separate car from Takahashi.

315
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,961
Wait, did you tell her about me?

316
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,214
Yeah, but nothing
about you being an alien.

317
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,966
-Is that so?
-Yeah, I'm tight-lipped.

318
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:13,884
What did you say?

319
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,053
Just that you’re Kiichan’s senior
from her workplace.

320
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,348
-That's it?
-Yeah.

321
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,266
What about me sneaking
into the owner's office?

322
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,851
Oh, I did tell her that.

323
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,812
I said she and the mayor are in cahoots

324
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,815
on some shady deals,
and we’re trying to expose them.

325
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,400
And what did she say?

326
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,570
Nothing in particular.
She was like, "Oh, that's tough."

327
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,531
I see.

328
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,616
Sorry, I’ll properly introduce her
to you next time.

329
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,700
Sorry.

330
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,244
I won’t tell her you’re an alien.

331
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,829
No, please do.

332
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:44,665
-For my peace of mind.
-Are you sure it's okay?

333
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,668
I'd be more worried if all of you
kept quiet and acted normal.

334
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,878
Got it.

335
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,093
-Have things escalated that much?
-Yeah.

336
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,263
That’s why we’re trying
to expose the corruption

337
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,723
and stop the sale.

338
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,100
-I see.
-Yeah.

339
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,309
You see,

340
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,478
I never mentioned this before,

341
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:11,066
but in 50 years,

342
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,318
Asada is a total disaster.

343
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,529
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

344
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,283
The environment is ruined,

345
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:22,703
the town is in shambles…
And because of all that,

346
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,123
is it in 2040? I can't remember,

347
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,709
but Mount Fuji

348
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,420
gets taken off the list
of World Heritage Sites.

349
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,756
-Really?
-Yeah.

350
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:39,261
I think after Masako Umemoto
got elected mayor,

351
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,930
everything started going downhill.

352
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,142
If that's the case,

353
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:48,145
that’s even more reason for us
to expose her.

354
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,815
I hope you succeed

355
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,775
and change the future.

356
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,907
We'll do our best.

357
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,835
<i>And then came…</i>

358
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,046
MARCH 16

359
00:20:14,129 --> 00:20:17,841
<i>the day of the confrontation.</i>

360
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,902
8:40 p.m.

361
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,362
We’ve still got time.

362
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,821
Twenty more minutes, huh?

363
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,365
It sure is freezing.

364
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:43,784
Yeah. I'm glad I layered up.

365
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,160
Uh…

366
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:48,247
have this if you'd like.

367
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,373
What?

368
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,375
This is rare. What happened?

369
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,669
You're doing all this for me.

370
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,380
-Oh.
-This is the least I can do.

371
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,340
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

372
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,175
-So warm!
-Thank you, really.

373
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,969
Don't mention it.

374
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,347
Actually, at this point, it’s not just
about you anymore.

375
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,015
What do you mean?

376
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:10,018
Mr. Murakami told me this the other day.

377
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,728
In 50 years,

378
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,106
Asada is going to be a wreck, apparently.

379
00:21:14,189 --> 00:21:15,565
-Really?
-Yeah.

380
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,986
Mount Fuji gets taken
off the World Heritage Sites list too.

381
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,487
-What?
-Really?

382
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,905
-Yep.
-That's terrible.

383
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,532
Right?

384
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,701
And apparently it all started

385
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,454
when Ms. Umemoto became mayor, after all.

386
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,414
I see.

387
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:33,166
What is that damned mayor thinking?

388
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,794
-We absolutely need to force her out.
-I know, right?

389
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,422
So, now that we know
how it's going to play out,

390
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,340
this isn't just about you anymore,

391
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,342
it’s our problem now.

392
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,720
So really, don’t feel
like you owe us anything.

393
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,722
Okay.

394
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,142
-Fine.
-No joke, we have to get those photos.

395
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,185
And hand that sleazy mayor
over to the police.

396
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,770
-Let's do it.
-Yeah.

397
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,564
Oh, uh…

398
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,816
one thing.

399
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,529
Can I get 130 yen
from each of you for the coffee?

400
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,658
You know, this was supposed

401
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,453
to be my thank-you gift,

402
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,080
but since this isn’t just
about me anymore…

403
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:18,545
I swear I'm not just being stingy!

404
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,006
You said I don't have to feel
like I owe you anything,

405
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,467
so I figured, let’s keep it fair.

406
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,554
That way, nobody feels
like they owe anyone, right?

407
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:29,306
<i>As of this moment,</i>

408
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,641
<i>we are officially only doing this</i>

409
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,686
<i>for our town.</i>

410
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,814
Let's keep things fair.

411
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,486
Oh yeah, Mr. Takahashi.
Were the side effects okay the other day?

412
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,322
-What do you mean?
-The ones after you boosted your memory.

413
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:49,034
Oh, that? Weirdly enough,
I was totally fine.

414
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,494
-Oh?
-Really?

415
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,454
My forehead hasn't got any wider, right?

416
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,248
-No.
-You're right.

417
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah.

418
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:57,918
So it got me wonde--

419
00:22:58,001 --> 00:22:59,211
Hm? Wait.

420
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,046
-They're here.
-Huh? They're early.

421
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:02,714
Quick, get ready to take a photo!

422
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,841
Let me remove my gloves.

423
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,218
Okay, I'm ready.

424
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,427
Hm?

425
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,845
Isn't that Mizuki?

426
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,097
You're right.

427
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,058
Mizuki!

428
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:14,643
-Mizuki!
-Mizuki!

429
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,186
Oh, it's Kiyomi.

430
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,021
-Mizuki!
-Hey.

431
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,148
-Kiyomi and the others are here.
-No way! Where?

432
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,608
-Over there.
-It's Yumi.

433
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,777
-Yumi!
-Yumi, over here!

434
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,529
-Over here!
-Yumi!

435
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:27,489
Quick, get over here!

436
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,950
Hurry up!

437
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,244
What's going on?

438
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:33,703
Lower your voice!

439
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,957
Quick. We need to hide.

440
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,083
What are you all doing?

441
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,378
We're about to catch the mayor
receiving a bribe from the owner.

442
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,546
Wait, here?

443
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,048
That's why we’re waiting here
to get some photos as proof.

444
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,591
I see!

445
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:48,135
Can we join in?

446
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:50,512
Sure. That's okay, right?

447
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,347
-I’ll just move the car and be back.
-Okay.

448
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,141
-Be careful.
-I will.

449
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,603
I'm back.

450
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:01,064
-Welcome back.
-Yeah.

451
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,774
What time are they supposed to show up?

452
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,984
At 9 p.m. if they're on time.

453
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,068
-9 p.m.?
-That’s soon.

454
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,612
-You're right.
-Let’s get our phones ready.

455
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,327
Did your hair become thinner, Takahashi?

456
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:16,371
Surprisingly, I'm good this time.

457
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:17,414
Are you sure?

458
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,713
Is that Naomi?

459
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,339
Oh!

460
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,717
-Naomi!
-What are you all doing out here?

461
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,094
The mayor and the hotel owner are about

462
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,888
to engage in bribery,

463
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,598
so we’re waiting here
to capture that moment on film.

464
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,768
-Ah, the plan you mentioned the other day?
-What are you doing here?

465
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:41,313
I’m packing for my move,

466
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,231
so I went to the store to get some stuff.

467
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,775
Oh yeah, I heard!
You built a new house, right?

468
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,735
Yeah.

469
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,820
-You all have to come after I settle in.
-Okay.

470
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,239
You already know Mr. Takahashi, right?

471
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,658
Yeah, we've met a few times, right?

472
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,203
-Right.
-He's an alien, just so you know.

473
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,664
-What?
-You really had to bring that up now?

474
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,958
-Oh, was that bad timing?
-Maybe save it for a less chaotic moment?

475
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:02,876
Got it.

476
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:04,586
Sorry, please ignore that for now.

477
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:06,338
I think they're here.

478
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,381
-Really?
-That's them, right?

479
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,468
They're here! Get ready to take a photo!

480
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,261
Ms. Umemoto is in the car, yeah.

481
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,971
Oh no, I'm getting nervous.

482
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,223
Wait.

483
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,600
-Isn't that the owner's car?
-What?

484
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,477
Oh,

485
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,895
you're right.

486
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,608
Wait, Ms. Umemoto got out.

487
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:28,735
She's off.

488
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,363
Hold on, she's getting into the car
next to hers…

489
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,741
Oh, she got in!

490
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,786
-Good evening!
-Good evening!

491
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,455
-Isn't it chilly tonight?
-Yeah.

492
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:43,250
-I'll move to the back.
-Okay.

493
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,086
Hm? The owner got out.

494
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,088
Yeah, but why?

495
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,174
Huh?

496
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,384
She went to the back.

497
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,469
We can't see them.

498
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,012
Then let's move too.

499
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:58,515
-Do we move?
-Okay, let's move.

500
00:25:58,598 --> 00:25:59,432
Let's get closer.

501
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,726
Go, go!

502
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:04,062
Keep your heads down!

503
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:05,855
Ready your phones!

504
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,483
Okay, we made it.

505
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,323
-No, we still can't see them.
-The windows are tinted.

506
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,367
Is this even going to show up in photos?

507
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,119
No, it won't.

508
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,288
Could you weaken the tint
with your abilities?

509
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,206
-That's not how my abilities work.
-Aw!

510
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,710
This is the reward, as agreed.

511
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,963
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

512
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:31,298
Please, go ahead and check.

513
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,675
Alright, don't mind if I do.

514
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:37,679
At this rate, we’ll have to take photos
from the front.

515
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,639
Let's do that then.

516
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,851
Not like it matters if they see our faces.
They’re getting arrested anyway.

517
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,313
But if we're spotted,
won't they just drive off?

518
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:47,897
You've got a point.

519
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,316
What should we do, then?

520
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,777
Could you hold the car down and stop it
from moving, Mr. Takahashi?

521
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,779
Maybe for a bit?

522
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,073
I'm not sure how long I could do it for,

523
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,199
but I'm willing to give it a shot.

524
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,744
-Hm?
-Mizuki!

525
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
Mizuki!

526
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:04,664
-Hey, Mizuki!
-Mizuki!

527
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,672
NO OPEN FLAMES
TURN OFF ENGINE WHILE REFUELING

528
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,678
No way.

529
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:22,057
I just cut the power.
They’re not going anywhere.

530
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:24,684
Then we can just go right up
and take photos!

531
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:27,062
And since it’s an automatic sliding door,

532
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,521
they can’t open it either, right?

533
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,522
You're right.

534
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,525
Does that mean we’ve essentially
already caught them?

535
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,278
So we can just call the police

536
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,696
and hand them over?

537
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,365
And we have irrefutable proof too.

538
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,451
That was nicely done, Mizuki!

539
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,163
-Yay!
-Woo-hoo!

540
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,750
They're all there. They already started.

541
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:50,460
Do we get out?

542
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:54,047
Hmm… we might screw things up
if we show up now. Let’s watch from here.

543
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,220
Yes, that's the right amount.

544
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,639
Then let’s proceed as planned.

545
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,932
Yes, let's.

546
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,017
We’ll celebrate
with a nice dinner sometime.

547
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,435
-I look forward to it.
-Okay.

548
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,729
-I'll take my leave now.
-Be careful on your way back.

549
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:13,983
Huh?

550
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,154
Will it not open?

551
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,073
It should open if I push here, right?

552
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,283
Yeah. Huh?

553
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,328
-That's weird.
-It won't open.

554
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,622
-Hmm…
-What about the other side?

555
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,583
-Will it not open?
-No.

556
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,546
Oh, but the front doors
can be opened manually.

557
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:35,630
-What?
-Really?

558
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:40,260
-So, they can still escape from the front.
-Yeah.

559
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,054
Well, what now? Should we just go
and take photos of them?

560
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,723
That seems to be the only choice.

561
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:46,558
Hold on.

562
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:48,935
I'll go.

563
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,772
-Let me borrow this for a while.
-Okay.

564
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,953
Please excuse me.

565
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,920
Is everything okay?

566
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,630
Sorry, it looks like

567
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,382
the power has gone off for some reason.

568
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,194
No way…

569
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,236
What am I seeing?

570
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,988
Whoa…

571
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,574
Spider-Man!

572
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,160
Huh?

573
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,495
This won't open, either.

574
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,748
What? But that door is manual.

575
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,834
What's going on?

576
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,883
This is the police. We'd like to speak
to you, so come out.

577
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,971
What's this?

578
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,639
-Is this gum tape?
<i>-And just like that.</i>

579
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,058
-Open up!
<i>-Both the owner and the mayor</i>

580
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,686
<i>-were taken in for questioning.</i>
-Remove this!

581
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,230
It's money I lent her personally.

582
00:30:57,313 --> 00:31:01,025
-That's hard to believe. Please elaborate.
<i>-At first, they both denied everything,</i>

583
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,486
<i>but between the testimony of the staff,</i>

584
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,030
<i>-the 20 million yen in cash,</i>
-I've told you multiple times.

585
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,616
<i>-…and…</i>
-This is your signature.

586
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,953
<i>-…the agreement found in the office.</i>
-Isn't it, Mayor Uemoto?

587
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,539
<i>They had no choice but to confess.</i>

588
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,665
Yes.

589
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,709
That is correct.

590
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,128
HARAGUCHI
UMEMOTO

591
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,088
<i>As a result.</i>

592
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,006
In light of this.

593
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:26,050
<i>-The sale of the hotel was voided.</i>
-I'd like to express my apologies

594
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,552
for causing distress to you all.

595
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,304
<i>-However.</i>
-First and foremost…

596
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,598
<i>The hotel owner still holds the rights</i>
<i>to the property,</i>

597
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,517
<i>-so the future is uncertain.</i>
-For now, the hotel is safe.

598
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:37,103
-So. Please don't worry.
<i>-But according to the manager.</i>

599
00:31:37,186 --> 00:31:38,938
<i>At least the hotel</i>

600
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,107
<i>-isn’t going anywhere.</i>
-Thank you for your work.

601
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,775
FRONT DESK

602
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,570
<i>For the time being,</i>

603
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:49,449
<i>Takahashi can keep enjoying</i>
<i>his hot spring baths…</i>

604
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:54,037
LAKE HOTEL

605
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,431
<i>…and</i>

606
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,809
<i>I'm sure we managed to save this town.</i>

607
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,489
Hi.

608
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:31,699
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

609
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,410
<i>Today,</i>

610
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,872
<i>we went to the mall</i>
<i>to pick up Wakaba's new sneakers.</i>

611
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,791
<i>After that, we grabbed dinner</i>
<i>at Jonathan's.</i>

612
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,417
And that's how…

613
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,336
<i>With everything that has happened</i>

614
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:45,713
<i>these past few months,</i>

615
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,925
<i>I got permission from Takahashi</i>

616
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,887
<i>to tell Wakaba the whole truth.</i>

617
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,808
So basically, it’s just like Grandpa
in Shizuoka.

618
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:00,895
What do you mean?

619
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,147
He's an alien too.

620
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,568
-Didn't you know?
<i>-Grandpa from Shizuoka</i>

621
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,612
<i>-is my ex-husband's dad.</i>
-No.

622
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:10,738
-I didn't know that.
-What?

623
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,283
-How can you not know, Mom?
<i>-That means my ex-husband and Wakaba</i>

624
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,537
<i>-have alien blood in them.</i>
-Well,

625
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,205
since I’m only a quarter alien,

626
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,416
I’m pretty much the same as everyone else.

627
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,002
Really?

628
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,047
But you bring home that toner
all the time.

629
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:31,134
-How is that related to aliens?
-It has hot spring minerals in it.

630
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,885
That's why I thought you knew already.

631
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:36,723
No, I only take that home

632
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:39,350
because it’s free.

633
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,435
-Is that so?
-Yeah.

634
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,857
Wait, will your immunity system weaken
without that?

635
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,900
It’s not that serious,

636
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,362
but it tends to keep me
from catching colds.

637
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:54,157
Okay.

638
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,162
-Hold on, what about Dad?
-Oh.

639
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,622
He needs to soak in hot springs.

640
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,958
-I see.
-Yeah.

641
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,418
Wait, at the Lake Hotel?

642
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:08,463
No, there’s a really good one
in Shizuoka apparently,

643
00:34:08,545 --> 00:34:11,257
so he goes there about once a month.

644
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,927
<i>Okay, where are we now?</i>

645
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,596
Yeah.

646
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,806
I just heard all this from Wakaba,
and I was really surprised.

647
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:21,516
I did inform you.

648
00:34:23,518 --> 00:34:24,853
Yeah.

649
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,899
Pretty sure it was when we were talking
about how athletic I am.

650
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,069
And when I revealed casually
that I’ve got alien blood…

651
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,072
you just laughed and moved on.

652
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:41,204
Is that what happened?
You even said it yourself, huh?

653
00:34:41,286 --> 00:34:44,916
<i>I was surprised, but I’m so used</i>
<i>to this already,</i>

654
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:47,460
<i>-I just rolled with it.</i>
-Okay.

655
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,087
Wakaba.

656
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,630
-Do you have anything you want to say?
-Nope.

657
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:56,469
That's it for now. Yeah, bye.

658
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,313
On our school trip, we visited…

659
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,399
Shingen-Mochi Factory!

660
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:14,529
We got to wrap our own mochi and taste it!

661
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,156
And there was that time our teacher…

662
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,409
got volleyballs stuck!

663
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,747
Before we knew it, they were gone.

664
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,378
Over these six years,
we’ve learned so much…

665
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,298
and made so many amazing memories.

666
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,884
Now,

667
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,846
we're

668
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:43,266
ready to graduate!

669
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,936
It's all about getting used to it.

670
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,187
-Really?
-Yes.

671
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,772
But couldn't you just

672
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,150
delay your timing?

673
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,443
Well, that's what amateurs would do.

674
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,446
-Oh, you're saying you're different?
-Yes. From their age and aura,

675
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:01,200
I can tell, "Oh, this person seems quick,"
or, "This person may need more time."

676
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,619
Wow, that's impressive!

677
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:04,745
Yes, isn't it?!

678
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,664
If a urine sample cup collection contest

679
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,125
or something of that sort existed,
I'd do quite well.

680
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,294
You'd better feature me in this.

681
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,013
Let's go, another rebound!

682
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,806
Isn’t Wakaba just way ahead?

683
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,517
She’s already getting scholarship offers
from multiple schools.

684
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:28,811
-That's for sure.
-Rebound!

685
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,605
-Oh!
-Nice defense!

686
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,315
Her jumps are insane.

687
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,859
With the genes of the volleyball ace,
I'm not surprised…

688
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:39,530
<i>No, I think it's her alien genes.</i>

689
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,742
SIX MONTHS LATER

690
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,203
<i>Six months after that incident…</i>

691
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:48,247
<i>a new owner stepped in.</i>

692
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,667
As of today, I've been appointed
Lake Hotel Asanoko's

693
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,004
owner. I am truly honored
to take on this role.

694
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,422
My name is Mitsuru Onodera.

695
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,135
<i>-As to how this happened…</i>
-I may not have much experience…

696
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:06,891
<i>After the mayor</i>
<i>and the owner were arrested,</i>

697
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,186
<i>Mr. Murakami found that Asada</i>
<i>50 years later</i>

00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,979
<i>had become a nature-rich town again,</i>

699
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:16,817
<i>and Mount Fuji remained</i>
<i>as a World Heritage Site.</i>

700
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,113
<i>Wanting to repay us, Mr. Murakami</i>

701
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:25,159
<i>took some of the wealth he had accumulated</i>
<i>in the future, converted it into gold,</i>

702
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,453
<i>and brought it back here.</i>

703
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,038
I can't be the owner, so…

704
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,666
<i>And since the person</i>
<i>who helped him the most</i>

705
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,793
<i>was Onodera, he gifted it to him.</i>

706
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,836
<i>Onodera then sold the gold</i>

707
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,422
<i>-and used the money to buy the hotel.</i>
-…but I ask for your guidance and support…

708
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,674
<i>-Or so I heard.</i>
-…in years to come.

709
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,051
We're counting on you.

710
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:46,597
Honestly, I’m just relieved
the hotel didn’t go under.

711
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:49,308
-He’s our savior!
-Yeah.

712
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,144
<i>I may have lost the inheritance race,</i>

713
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,605
<i>but I think this turned out for the best.</i>

714
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:56,274
MONT BLANC

715
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,776
Is Onodera that young guy
you mentioned before?

716
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,487
Yeah. I heard

717
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,365
his dream was always to run a hotel,

718
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:07,201
so he started working there
to learn the ropes.

719
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,578
Then, he got to live his dream, huh?

720
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,455
-Yeah.
-So, you didn’t just save the town.

721
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,791
You also made
a young man’s dream come true.

722
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:17,128
No, I was doing it for my own survival.

723
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,254
I know.

724
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,172
-You're only saying that in hindsight.
-What?

725
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,301
Come on,

726
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,554
can't you let me be humble for once?

727
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,682
-Huh?
-You didn't even give me a chance.

728
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,393
I mean, it's a fact, right?

729
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,853
Well, yeah.

730
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:37,273
-But you could at least humor me a little.
-How?

731
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,652
Like, "But deep down, weren’t you actually
doing it for everyone’s sake?"

732
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,196
-You weren't, right?
-Yeah.

733
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,532
But you could have let me
deny it a couple of times.

734
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,160
In the end, things did work out
because of me, right?

735
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,496
Sure, it was a team effort.

736
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,499
-But wasn't I the MVP?
<i>-Not only do the baths not cure balding.</i>

737
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:58,753
<i>Apparently they also can't cure</i>
<i>narrow-mindedness.</i>

738
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,254
Sorry to interrupt.

739
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,591
Both of you work at Lake Hotel,
am I right?

740
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,968
Yes.

741
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:08,387
It's a pleasure to meet you.

742
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:11,474
My name is Furuta,

743
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,808
and frankly speaking,

744
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,187
-I'd like to ask a favor from you both.
-What is it?

745
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,898
I'd like the both of you

746
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,609
to prevent the sale of the hotel
from occurring.

747
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:27,073
That entire area is about
to be sold to the city,

748
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,284
and they’ll start building
unnecessary structures,

749
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,705
causing nature to be destroyed.

750
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:37,208
The town will be in shambles,
and as a result,

751
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,709
by 2040…

752
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,544
Mount Fuji

753
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,589
will be taken off
the World Heritage Sites list.

754
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,926
-Uh…
-As to why.

755
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:50,221
How I'm so sure of this…

756
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,057
is because I'm…

757
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,726
a time leaper.

758
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,105
I beg your pardon?

759
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,732
I know this is hard to believe,
but it’s true.

760
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,111
If we don’t act now, Asada…

761
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,072
will become a dystopia.

762
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,782
The only ones who can turn this around

763
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:13,577
-are both of you, the hotel sta--
-Sorry to cut you off.

764
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:14,995
What's wrong?

765
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,665
That has already been taken care of.

766
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:21,460
Huh?

767
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,963
A while back,

768
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,757
the mayor and the hotel owner
were arrested,

769
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,301
so the hotel is safe.

770
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:32,221
Haven’t you seen the news?

771
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,601
I haven't had the chance

772
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,396
to do that.

773
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,774
What do you mean, arrested?

774
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,610
A simple search on the Internet
should give you plenty of details.

775
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,115
I see.

776
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:57,204
Is there anything I can do to help?

777
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,878
Nothing in particular.

778
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,466
Very well.

779
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:12,344
Well then,

780
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,682
sorry for you taking up your time.

781
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,019
Not at all.

782
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:25,941
<i>Even when I'm faced</i>
<i>with sudden sci-fi events like this,</i>

783
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,110
<i>I'm not fazed anymore.</i>

784
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,279
-I'd like to settle the bill, please.
-Sure!

785
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:34,867
-Before we forget…
-Oh, yes!

786
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,328
Happy Birthday, Takahashi!

787
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:40,372
Happy Birthday!

788
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,167
-Thanks.
-Take a guess at what's in it.

789
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,543
-Take a guess.
-How would I know?

790
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,378
What is it?

791
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:48,297
I wonder.

792
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,592
<i>Gunpla.</i>

793
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:55,513
We chose the one that looks the coolest.

794
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,849
-Thank you.
-Are you happy?

795
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,100
I guess.

796
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,063
<i>-Fifty-five years old!</i>
<i>-And…</i>

797
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:07,691
<i>-Fifty-five years old!</i>
-Keep it down. You're being a nuisance.

798
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:10,653
30 YEARS LATER

799
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,155

801
00:42:20,913 --> 00:42:23,415
-Thanks for the ride, Wakaba.
-Don't mention it.

802
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,085
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

803
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,548
-See you.
-See you.

804
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,216
See you.

805
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,220
It's been so long since we've been here.

806
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,429
I know, right?

807
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,056
Hello!

808
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,224
You finally came.

809
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,434
-It's been a while.
-Yeah.

810
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,311
I brought some snacks.

811
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,896
Thank you.

812
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,858
Let me introduce you. This is Mrs. Endou,
Ms. Hibino, and Ms. Nakamura.

813
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,443
Well then,

814
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,487
please tap here to check in.

815
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:56,865
Thank you.

816
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:58,117
Hold up,

817
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,036
you haven't changed in the slightest,
Mr. Takahashi.

818
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,830
-How old are you, again?
-Eighty-four.

819
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,873
-No way!
-What would that be in human years?

820
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,250
Still 84.

821
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,335
And you haven't lost too much hair.

822
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,671
Didn't I say I'm not naturally bald?

823
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,882
-I always thought otherwise.
-Come on.

824
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,259
You cheated and went bald!

825
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,719
Stop phrasing it like that!

826
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:19,805
Sorry for the wait.

827
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,224
-Your biometric data has been registered.
-Thank you.

828
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,643
Your rooms will be from 501 to 503.

829
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,228
Thank you.

830
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:27,980
Is it that funny?

831
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,024
-Please enjoy your stay.
-We will.

FRONT DESK

833
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:35,738
They really bought a lot of stuff, huh?

834
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,324
-Yeah.
-They're going to end up with leftovers.

835
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:41,327
No, those three will finish all of it.

836
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,620
Is that so?

837
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,749
-I'm heading to the back. Cover for me.
-Okay.

838
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,473
-Takahashi.
-What is it?

839
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,392
About the fact that you're an alien,

840
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:07,144
can I tell my boyfriend?

841
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:08,520
Hmm…

842
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,774
Do you guys have plans to marry?

843
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,401
Yes, and in case you're wondering,
our wedding is next month.

844
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,363
It's an exception.

845
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,907
-Thank you.
-But in exchange.

846
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,576
I won't be meeting him
or proving myself to him, okay?

847
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,246
Um…

848
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:28,248
if possible, could you do
the ten yen coin trick at the weddi--

849
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,208
-You already told him!
-No, I haven't.

850
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,959
-Yes, you did.
-No, I didn't.

851
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:33,337
Why do I have to do that?

852
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,464
Hello, front desk speaking.

853
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,468
Where did you lose it?

854
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,054
Where did you last see it?

855
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,223
Then, the convenience store it is.

856
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,143
Only this time, okay?

857
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,815
I have to head out for a bit.

858
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:56,235
-It'd only be a short performance--
-Ugh, it's an exception.
