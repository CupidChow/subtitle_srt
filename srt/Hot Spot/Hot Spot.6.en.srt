00:00:04,963 --> 00:00:08,758
<i>At the base of Mount Fuji, in Fuji-Asada,</i>
<i>lives Kiyomi Endou.</i>

3
00:00:08,842 --> 00:00:12,637
<i>Her colleague, Takahashi, who is an alien,</i>
<i>saves Kiyomi's life.</i>

4
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:14,264
Takahashi?

5
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:17,767
<i>That secret is only known to</i>
<i>her childhood friends Hacchi and Minapuu.</i>

6
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:21,438
<i>-Along with…</i>
-I'm actually an alien.

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,567
<i>…her manager and another colleague, Yumi.</i>

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:28,403
She refuses to believe I'm an alien.

9
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,821
He's amazing, isn't he?

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,490
<i>Takahashi is caught up in a series</i>

11
00:00:32,573 --> 00:00:35,493
<i>of trivial incidents</i>
<i>that occur in this town.</i>

12
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:36,995
I went to Nonchan's bar.

13
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,371
-Really?
-<i>Their daily lives.</i>

14
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,956
<i>These have begun to change,</i>

15
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,375
<i>and are set in motion again today.</i>

16
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>After the former mayor's term ended,</i>

17
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,842
<i>the voting and ballot counting for</i>
<i>the Fuji-Asada mayoral election was held.</i>

18
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:54,929
<i>Newcomer and former deputy mayor,</i>
<i>Masako Umemoto.</i>

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,973
<i>-He won for the first time.</i>
<i>-We did it!</i>

20
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,600
<i>Thank you.</i>

21
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,770
<i>Thank you very much, everybody.</i>

22
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:05,022
<i>Thank you for all your support…</i>

23
00:01:05,105 --> 00:01:08,693
-When is your bus coming?
-9:20 a.m.

24
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:09,986
<i>I…</i>

25
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,654
-Then you still can take it easy.
-Yep.

26
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,699
Thanks for the food.

27
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:21,998
<i>Today, I have a shift</i>
<i>and Wakaba is staying over</i>

28
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:23,708
<i>with her younger cousin Nacchan</i>

29
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,960
<i>at her grandparents' house.</i>

30
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,133
Oh.

31
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,719
This is a gift,
so make sure to give it to Granny.

32
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,888
-Okay.
-Don't forget it, okay?

33
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:40,934
-Alright, I'll leave you to lock up.
-Yeah, see you.

34
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,268
I'm leaving now.

35
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,063
Ugh, it's freezing!

36
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:54,489
<i>I know I asked her to lock up,</i>

37
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,659
<i>but when she locks the door</i>
<i>the moment I leave,</i>

38
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,870
<i>it sort of feels</i>
<i>like I'm being kicked out.</i>

39
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>By the way, I always wait a bit</i>

40
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:08,502
<i>before quietly locking the door,</i>

41
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:12,841
<i>so I think I'll teach her</i>
<i>to do the same someday.</i>

LAKE HOTEL

43
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,401
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

44
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,195
-I'd like to pay in full, please.
-I understand.

45
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:38,199
<i>I may look like I’m calmly handling</i>
<i>the checkout process,</i>

46
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,451
<i>but in reality, this time of day</i>
<i>during this season</i>

47
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,203
<i>is pretty tough.</i>

48
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,663
Thank you.

49
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>The reason…</i>

50
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,749
We hope you stay with us again.

51
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>…is because every time a guest leaves,</i>

52
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,423
<i>a blast of cold air rushes in.</i>

53
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,012
We hope you stay with us again.

54
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,436
Thank you.

55
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,522
<i>Of course, the heater is on,</i>

56
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,567
<i>but with the automatic doors</i>
<i>opening this often,</i>

57
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:16,070
<i>the lobby is never actually warm.</i>

58
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:23,244
<i>At this point, it’s basically the outdoors</i>
<i>disguised as a lobby.</i>

59
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,830
It's so cold.

60
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:32,170
I wish we could wear bench coats as part
of our uniform just for this time of year.

61
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:36,007
The kind of coat karaoke staff wear
when handing out flyers.

62
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,092
Yeah, same with <i>izakaya</i> staff.

63
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,636
So, a flyer coat?

64
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,845
I guess.

65
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,098
They should definitely supply us
with one of those.

66
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,017
<i>A bench coat</i>

67
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,771
<i>is a type of cold-weather gear worn</i>
<i>by soccer players</i>

68
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,606
<i>and it’s sometimes called a sub coat.</i>

69
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,275
<i>Flyer coat isn’t an actual term.</i>

70
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,486
By the way, I heard the hotel owner
is coming today.

71
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,197
Really? That sucks.

72
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,616
Right? Just having him around
makes me feel drained.

73
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:02,825
I agree.

74
00:04:03,368 --> 00:04:06,537
I’m not really a fan of the current owner.

75
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,665
Me neither. The previous owner was better.

76
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,874
Yeah,

77
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,003
the current owner
is extremely overbearing and I hate it.

78
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,589
-I know what you mean.
<i>-It's not that he did anything specific.</i>

79
00:04:17,673 --> 00:04:20,551
<i>So our complaints are pretty vague,</i>

80
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:22,512
<i>but in any case,</i>

81
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,431
<i>we just don't get on with</i>
<i>the current hotel owner.</i>

82
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,725
Not knowing when he'll show up
is the worst.

83
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,060
Right?

84
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,813
Imagine if he came
while we were taking a break in the back.

85
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,817
Yeah, I wouldn’t even be able
to eat my lunch.

86
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,318
Yeah.

87
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,279
Maybe I'll have lunch outside.

88
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:42,073
Maybe I'll do that too.

89
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,036
I'll be taking my break now.

90
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,913
See you.

91
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,794
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

92
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,796
-Are you heading out?
-Yes, for a short walk.

93
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:01,718
Oh, right. It's cold today,
so please use these if you'd like.

94
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,678
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

95
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,595
Thank you.

96
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:05,722
Take care.

97
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,473

00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,699
I wonder what I should eat for lunch?

101
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,993
When is the owner coming, by the way?

102
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,495
We weren't told.

103
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:33,124
They should at least give us a two-hour
window for his estimated arrival time.

104
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:36,753
Oh, like a courier service. You know,

105
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,048
wouldn’t it be nice
if we could track his location with GPS?

106
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,382
-Oh, like Uber Eats?
-Yeah.

107
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,759
Owner Eats?

108
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,345
It's not exactly that
since he's not going to bring food.

109
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,389
-I hope he brings some.
-What do you want?

110
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,351
-Welcome back.
-Welcome back.

111
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,812

Nope.

00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,274
Where did you eat?

114
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,610
-Seiryu Hanten.
-That's a nice place.

115
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,862
-Kiyomi, you can go for your break.
-Okay.

<i>Without deciding where or what to eat,</i>

<i>I just left.</i>

121
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,598
<i>For the time being,</i>
<i>I parked my car and had a think.</i>

122
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,854
<i>I have three places in mind right now.</i>

123
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:41,109
<i>First, the Chinese restaurant</i>
<i>that Eri mentioned, Seiryu Hanten</i>.

124
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,110
Thank you for waiting.

125
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,946
<i>I do like that nostalgic,</i>
<i>old-school flavor,</i>

126
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,573
<i>but honestly, I’m just not in the mood</i>
<i>for ramen right now.</i>

127
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,829
<i>Second is M-2, a Western-style restaurant</i>
<i>at the entrance of the shopping street.</i>

128
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,541
<i>Their curry is authentic and delicious,</i>

129
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,167
<i>but it's a little pricey.</i>

130
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:03,214
<i>The third place is Nikon An,</i>
<i>a soba restaurant on Higashi-Honchou Dori.</i>

131
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,425
<i>It’s tasty and reasonably priced too,</i>

132
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:11,055
<i>but it's a little far, and at this hour,</i>
<i>I might have to wait in line.</i>

133
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:17,687
<i>I'm in a dilemma. What should I eat now?</i>

134
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,566
<i>Okay, I've decided.</i>

135
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,614
<i>When in doubt, this is the way to go.</i>

136
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:32,160
<i>This is cheap, and I get to eat alone.</i>

<i>Strolling along this street</i>

138
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,548
<i>brings back faint memories</i>
<i>from my childhood.</i>

139
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,176
<i>It was a holiday.</i>

140
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:52,263
<i>I recall that through the passenger-side</i>
<i>window of my father’s car,</i>

141
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:53,347
<i>I saw Mount Fuji.</i>

142
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:58,686
<i>In the back seat,</i>
<i>my mother held my little sister--</i>

143

Mr. Murakami.

Would you like a ride?

147
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,739
I'll walk about for a while longer
before heading back.

148
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,867
Okay. Take care.

149
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,285

-Good afternoon.
-Hello.

You have one parcel today.

166
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,188
-Can I place it here?
-Yes.

167
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,192
Okay, may I have your signature here?

00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,545
<i>The exchange went on for a while…</i>

175
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,462
-I'll bring some tomorrow.
-Okay.

176
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,256
<i>-…and after about a minute.</i>
-Oh, and this.

177
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,551
<i>-Yumi gave up and came back.</i>
-It's a notice for your manager.

178
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,136
-Should I pass this on to him?
-Yes.

179
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:59,557
-I'll be going now.
-Thank you for your work.

180
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:03,311
I'll do the admin.

181
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,396
Okay.

182
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:09,191
EMERGENCY EXIT

183
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,985
Welcome back.

184
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,533
He bought quite a lot of stuff.

185
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,202
-He's going to end up with leftovers.
-Yeah.

186
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,371
I get why he'd go overboard, though.

187
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,666
It's like the euphoria
of having a sleepover.

188
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,752
We could warn them in advance.

189
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,172
What? Like,
"You're going to end up with food left"?

190
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,298
‪Yeah.‬

191
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,216
I still feel it would fall on deaf ears.

192
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,218
-But at the very least…
-Yeah?

193
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,762
I feel we should tell them that.

194
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,597
-Tell them what?
-So.

195
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,932
Some people buy 2-liter bottles
of water or tea, right?

196
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,351
-Yeah.
-But, you know.

197
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,979
Those bottles won't fit in our fridges.

198
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,565
Right. I feel kinda bad for them.

199
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,609
Yeah.

200
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,739
Welcome back.

201
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,913
<i>That "Welcome back" just now</i>

202
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,832
<i>was apologizing for how our fridge</i>
<i>is so small.</i>

203
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,377
<i>That was the underlying tone</i>
<i>behind our greeting.</i>

204
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,257
<i>The administrative tasks at this hour</i>

205
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,302
<i>mainly involve responding</i>
<i>to customer reviews and emails.</i>

206
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,932
<i>However, since most of it has already been</i>
<i>taken care of by others during the day,</i>

207
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,311
<i>I’m now focusing on simply looking</i>
<i>like I’m working.</i>

208
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:30,022
Oh, Takahashi.

209
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,733
-Yes?
-I heard from Endou.

210
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,485
About what?

211
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,989
That if you don’t go soak
in the hot springs, your immune system,

212
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,118
or was it your strength, will be weakened.

213
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,202
Yeah.

214
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,955
That must be hard.

215
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:51,252
If you want, you can come in for a soak
even on your days off.

216
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,796
-Are you sure it's okay?
-Of course.

217
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,464
Thank you.

218
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:01,804
Come to think of it,
when Nakamoto stole the TV…

219
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,849
Was it you that found it?

220
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,350
Nakamoto?

221
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:10,688
Oh, yes. She'd stashed it away
in her car, right?

222
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:12,565
I knew it.

223
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,693
How did you find it?

224
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:19,613
Well, um… My sense of smell.

225
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,159
I'm able to temporarily heighten it.

226
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,869
-Your sense of smell?
-Yes.

227
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,121
So, from where the TV used to be,

228
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,665
I followed its scent. Something like that.

229
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,626
You can do things like that?

230
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:36,547
Could it be that you're also the one
who fixed the water heater?

231
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,217
No, that… Well, yes.

232
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:43,888
Of course, who else could it be?

233
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,558
What ability did you use for that?

234
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,894
That time, I, well…

235
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,147
I temporarily boosted my knowledge.

236
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,982
You can do that too?

237
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:57,276
It's only temporary, though.

238
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:01,113
That really saved us. I mean it.

239
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,407
I'm glad I could be of assistance.

240
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:08,621
<i>Well, it’s something I could have done</i>
<i>if I really tried,</i>

241
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,373
<i>so it’s not entirely a lie.</i>

242
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,212
-Thank you for your work.
-You too.

243
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,838
Oh.

244
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,381
-Is your shift over?
-Yes.

245
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,260
I learned a lot from Takahashi just now.

246
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,178
About what?

247
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,388
That he's actually been

248
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,517
a great help behind the scenes.
Like when Nakamoto stole the TV.

249
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,602
Oh, yes.

250
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:34,271
Takahashi traced the scent.

251
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,732
He's amazing, isn't he?

252
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:38,108
Oh, as well as the water--

253
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,444
Um, about that…

254
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,531
It was Endou who suggested it,
so she played a huge part.

255
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,282
It was pretty much thanks to her.

256
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,408
Not at all.

257
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,119
-Oh, you helped as well, didn't you?
-Don't mention it.

258
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,121
I'll be going now.

259
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,795
<i>That was close.</i>
<i>My lie was about to be exposed.</i>

260
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,675
Thank you for waiting.
Here's your mixed pizza.

261
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,802
<i>Since Wakaba is not at home today,</i>

262
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:07,012
<i>I'm having dinner with Minapuu and Hacchi.</i>

263
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,891
-Right, you only have one automatic door.
-Yeah.

264
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,769
And our counter is near the door,
so winter is really hell for us.

265
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,854
I see.

266
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,314
Are schools chilly?

267
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,067
These days, pretty much
all elementary schools have AC.

268
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,903
-Ah, they're using the AC in heating mode.
-Yeah.

269
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,114
In our day, they used a stove, right?

270
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,824
Yeah, an oil stove.

271
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:28,659
Kids used to melt their shoe soles, right?

272
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,785
-Yep.
-I knew it.

273
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,370
Some even burned their boogers.

274
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,497
-No way!
-Who did that?

275
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,456
Minoken.

276
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,251
Minoken again? Yeah, sounds
like something he'd do.

277
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,421
And there was someone who toasted
their school lunch bread unknowingly.

278
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,132
-Oops!
-Hold on, that was me.

279
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:45,551
-Oof.
-We've got the victim right here.

280
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,845
This is the worst. What's your problem?

281
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,597
-Would've been better not knowing.
-Yeah.

282
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,266
Incidents like that won't happen now
thanks to AC.

283
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,934
Right.

284
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,854
Remember the kid who always
wore shorts and T-shirts even in winter?

285
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:57,855
Yeah.

286
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,440
That was Minoken too, you know?

287
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,400
Right? Didn't he
even get an award for that?

288
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,068
Yeah, during school assembly.

289
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,029
But what was he praised for?

290
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,073
I can't remember… Endurance?

291
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,618
He just did it on his own.

292
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,328
No one benefited from that.

293
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,537
He's just a booger burner.

294
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,956
For real. They should just take
his award away.

295
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,083
Is "Minoken" Minota?

296
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,376
Do you know Kenji Minota?

297
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,211
His brother was in the same class as me.

298
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,672
-Really?
-Yeah, Shinji Minota.

299
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,382
Oh, then he's Minoshin.

300
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,593
No, we called him Jack.

301
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,470
I don't see a link.

302
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,805
-Right?
-You should match their last names.

303
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,058
-Who cares.
-Did he burn boogers?

304
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,684
-Nope.
-What?

305
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,686
-That's disappointing.
-I don't care.

306
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:40,648
What else can you do?

307
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,484
What else? You mean other than
bending a 10 yen coin?

308
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:44,401
Yes.

309
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,739
I can jump very high and run very fast.

310
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,699
How fast, exactly?

311
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,910
I've never really measured
so I can't say for sure,

312
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,662
but I'd say around 80 km per hour.

313
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,497
80 km?

314
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,040
Isn't that exaggerating a little?

315
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,458
I'm serious.

316
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:01,251
Then, show me.

317
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:03,170
Show you? Uh, now?

318
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,339
-Just a bit is fine.
-How do I show you that?

319
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,925
I don’t know, just zip by
over there real quick.

320
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,385
That's asking a bit too much.

321
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:10,928
-Please!
-It's still working hours.

322
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:11,845
-Please!
-No.

323
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,347
I'll do all the admin.

324
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,684
-Are you sure?
-Yes, you can take a break.

325
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,938
-Only once, okay?
-Thank you.

326
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,524
-Wait here, okay?
-Okay.

327
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,363
I'll just run around there.

328
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:30,280
Okay.

329
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,001
Hello, front desk speaking.

330
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:43,544
Yes.

331
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,631
The large public bath
is open until midnight.

332
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,884
Yes, it’s available again
from 5 a.m. in the morning.

333
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,429
Thank you.

334
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:01,729
Did you see?

335
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,190
I just got an inquiry
about our large public bath…

336
00:17:05,273 --> 00:17:07,192
What? So you didn't see?

337
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:10,487
-Sorry.
-You've got to be joking…

338
00:17:10,570 --> 00:17:11,446
I'm really sorry.

339
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,450
-Oh, come on!
-Could you do it again?

340
00:17:14,532 --> 00:17:16,827
-I can't do it twice!
-Please!

341
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,204
-It's too tough.
-I'll do the administrative tasks.

342
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,584
-You better watch properly.
-I will, I will.

343
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:24,877
-I'm counting on you, okay?
-Yes.

344
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,060
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

345
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,730
Um, are there any bars or places
to drink around here?

346
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:46,648
Yes.

347
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,736
Um…

348
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,740
There's a place called Fuji-Asada
Kanpai Yokocho.

349
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:58,494
It's about ten minutes from here by taxi.
Would you like me to call one for you?

350
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,204
Um… Yes, please.

351
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,705
Please wait there for a moment.

352
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,499
-You can have this if you'd like.
-Thanks.

353
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:11,965
You didn't see, did you?

354
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:13,675
Sorry.

355
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,136
Are we done here?

356
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,597
I'll have you do it again another time.

357
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:25,062
Well, the urology department
has fewer emergency patients,

358
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,272
so I think it’s much easier
than other departments.

359
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,690
I see.

360
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,861
Most people have worked in other
departments prior to coming to urology,

361
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,989
but if you started out in urology,
I don't think you'd want to transfer.

362
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,408
Because you'd get used
to the urology work environment?

363
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,536
Yeah, once that becomes the standard…

364
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,745
It's like how,

365
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,373
if you go to Hawaii
on your first overseas trip,

366
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,667
everything else feels worse,
so you stick with Hawaii.

367
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,377
Something like that, yeah.

368
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,965
-Urology is healthcare industry's Hawaii.
-Yeah, the hospital of everlasting summer.

369
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:54,383
That doesn't sound right.

370
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,635
-Yeah, something feels off.
-Even you think so?

371
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,554
Aya-nyan is calling.

372
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:00,597
-Really?
-What's up?

373
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,099
Hello?

374
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:06,562
Yeah, I'm just having dinner
with Minapuu and Hacchi at Mont Blanc.

375
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,647
Oh, is that so?

376
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,608
Okay, let me ask them.

377
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,653
She's asking if we want
to visit Nonchan's bar now.

378
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,364
-Sounds great.
-I'm up for it.

379
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,492
Hello? Yeah, we're coming.

380
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,451
"We're coming"?

381
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,662
FRONT DESK

382
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,207
By the way, who else knows about this?

383
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,711
Well, there's Endou,

384
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,380
her two childhood friends,

385
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,425
the manager, and you. That's about it.

386
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,177
Oh, so not many people know.

387
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,930
Yeah, if it got out that I’m an alien,
that'd be a problem.

388
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,224
Oh, I see.

389
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,604
Oh yeah, you still don't believe
I'm an alien, right?

390
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,814
It's not that I don't believe you.

391
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,109
-But you're not an alien, are you?
-I am!

392
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,904
Didn't you say before that aliens exist?

393
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,822
Yes, I think they do.

394
00:19:58,906 --> 00:19:59,990
But you're not an alien.

395
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,158
What makes you think so?

396
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:04,494
I mean, you don't look alien at all.

397
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,872
Okay then, let me ask you.

398
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,082
What does an alien look like?

399
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,335
Aliens…

400
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,838
-They don't look like humans.
-Huh?

401
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,424
So you're saying I'm too human-like?

402
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,759
I guess.

403
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,889
Well, you know, my mom is a human,

404
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,599
and I was born and raised on Earth,

405
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,310
so that might be part of it?

406
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,021
Okay.

407
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,191
You think I'm some kind
of crazy person, don't you?

408
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:38,820
-Not at all.
-Stop it, okay?

409
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,572
I understand, I'll stop.

410
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,909
-So you're admitting to it.
-No, I didn't think of you that way.

411
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,577
And it'll stay this way in the future.

412
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,455
That means you might think
of it if you let your guard down, right?

413
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,414
No, really.

414
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:55,045
Kiichan, there's a paper bag there, right?

415
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,214
Oh, this?

416
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,549
Yeah, there's some dorayaki inside.

417
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,176
Could you give them to Mr. Takahashi?

418
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,094
Takahashi?

419
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,347
Yeah, he's been a great help
with the bike and all.

420
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,266
Okay.

421
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,142
I'll give them to him tomorrow.

422
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,645
-Sorry for adding to your load.
-It's fine.

423
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:15,190
-You're really admirable, Aya-nyan.
-Yeah, you're really thoughtful.

424
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,777
I mean, I had my bike repainted.

425
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,488
We should give something in return too.

426
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:23,156
But we did treat him a few times.

427
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,367
No, he saved your life

428
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,911
so you should give something
a bit more substantial in return.

429
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,913
-He saved your life, Kiichan?
-Yeah.

430
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:31,873
How did that happen?

431
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,793
She was about to get hit by a car,
and he just swooped in!

432
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:36,920
-Right?
-Yeah, in the blink of an eye.

433
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,298
What? No way.

434
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,383
Yeah, it's not possible for a human.

435
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,968
Only an alien can do that.

436
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,970
-Alien?
-Yeah, he's an alien.

437
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:48,098
-Didn't we tell you?
-No.

438
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,352
<i>Oh crap.</i>

439
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,522
<i>We haven't told Aya-nyan.</i>

440
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,859
Huh? What are you girls talking about?

441
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,862
Oh, sorry. I made a mistake.
It was a joke.

442
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,363
What do you mean by that?

443
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,656
What's this about aliens?

444
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,700
It's nothing. For the time being.

445
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,244
-Let's head to Nonchan's bar.
-Yeah, let's go.

446
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,621
Oh, no, no, no. Let me stop the car
real quick.

447
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,876
Something is going on.
You girls are hiding something from me.

448
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:16,877
HAPPY DRINK SHOP

449
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,421
We resigned ourselves…

450
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,799
and told Aya-nyan everything
that had happened up to this point.

451
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,093
That's the gist.

452
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:29,181
I see how it is.

453
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,682
That's why he could do those things.

454
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,602
Yeah.

455
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,645
Lifting cars…

456
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,147
and catching up to taxis.

457
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,274
All that is due to his abilities.

458
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,652
I see. The dots finally connect.

459
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,695
What do you mean?

460
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,699
Well, Ritsu was saying she saw someone
running really fast the other day,

461
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,660
and I thought she was talking
about something from an anime,

462
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,037
but that was Mr. Takahashi.

463
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,331
Yeah.

464
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,291
Right?

465
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,504
So could you at least
not tell anyone about this?

466
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,672
Of course.

467
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:08,303
Okay then, shall we go
to Nonchan's bar now?

468
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:13,266
What's the matter?

469
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:17,521
Uh… you accepted that
pretty quickly, right?

470
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,563
Really?

471
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,400
People usually take a little longer
to digest this.

472
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,903
There are even some
who refuse to believe it.

473
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,782
But… you're telling the truth, right?

474
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,700
Yeah.

475
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,619
Then he has to be the real deal.

476
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:36,581
I'm having mixed feelings about this.

477
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,668
It's great that you believe us,

478
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,505
but we're talking about aliens, you know?
Doesn't it shock you?

479
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:48,718
Well, I'm sure there are others
like that out there.

480
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,388
Besides, recently

481
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:54,015
there has been a rise
in immigrants from overseas,

482
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,434
and he's half human, right?

483
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,395
Yeah.

484
00:23:58,478 --> 00:24:01,648
My mom’s from here,

485
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,192
but my dad’s originally from Kyushu.

486
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:07,237
Essentially, aliens are just
a more distant version of that.

487
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,574
You've got a point.

488
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,076
Distant as in light years apart, yeah.

489
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,038
Now that I think about it, is it okay
if I only give him dorayaki?

490
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,290
-Huh?
-What?

491
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,670
Oh, I think it's fine. He should like it.

492
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,674
That's a relief to hear. They're nothing
fancy, but they do taste good.

493
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,968
Then let's hit the road.

494
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,479
<i>We took in Aya-nyan's reaction,</i>

495
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:46,318
<i>and thought to ourselves, "That's what</i>
<i>it means to embrace diversity."</i>

496
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,865
Oh, it looks cute!

497
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,660
-It's been a while since I saw her.
-How long has it been?

498
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,162
Hm…

499
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,665
-Maybe about five years.
-I'm about the same too.

500
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,543
<i>Nonchan was our middle-school classmate</i>

501
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:06,338
<i>and started a snack bar</i>
<i>about five years ago.</i>

502
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,423
-So how long exactly?
-A few decades.

503
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:10,800
-What?
-Yeah.

504
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,762
We really haven't seen each other
for a while.

505
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,014
Yeah.

506
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,435
Thank you.

507
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:22,479
Isn't that the mayor?

508
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:23,521
Right?

509
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,941
She looks younger than I thought.

510
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,567
But she's still older than us, right?

511
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,694
Isn't she five years older than Kiichan?

512
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,696
-Really?
-But her skin is so good.

513
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,989
I know, right?

514
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,283
I want to know what toner she uses
at the very least.

515
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,995
-I don't think that alone does it for you.
-Well, yeah.

516
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,497
Hold on, did you just insult me?

517
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,499
-No.
-You definitely did.

518
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:43,500
-No!
-We've arrived.

519
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:46,002
-We're here.
-We made it.

520
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,172
-We're here!
-Yay!

521
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,510
Welcome. Oh, hey!

522
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,887
Hi!

523
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,973
You all finally came!

524
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:59,391
They're friends from middle school.

525
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:01,726
-Really?
-Have a seat over there.

526
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,688
-Micchan, guide them to their seats.
-Okay.

527
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:07,774
This way, please.

528
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,324
-Good evening. I'm Mizuki.
-Good evening.

529
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,577
Ms. Mizuki, it's a pleasure to meet you.

530
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,997
I'm driving, so I'll have oolong tea.

531
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,999
-Okay.
-Thank you.

532
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,334
Are you all from Minami Middle School?

533
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,003
Yeah, these two were my classmates.

534
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,546
I'm two years younger.

535
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,172
I see.

536
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,924
How about you, Ms. Mizuki?

537
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,593
-I went to Chuo Middle School.
-Oh, Chuo?

538
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,762
My colleague also went to Chuo.

539
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:40,974
-Really?
-Yeah, her name is Yumi Isomura.

540
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,851
-We were in the same grade.
-No way!

541
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,102
We were in the same class too!

542
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,770
Oh, wow.

543
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,938
We live in a small world.

544
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,774
-More like Asada is small.
-Yeah.

545
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,443
Were you and Yumi close?

546
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:53,361
Yes, we still go out for meals sometimes.

547
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,280
Really?

548
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,574
I worked with her today.

549
00:26:57,657 --> 00:27:01,661
Oh? Could it be you're Ms. Kiyomi?

550
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:05,081
Well, yes. Have you heard about me?

551
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,251
Yes, I heard there's a senior
who's always venting about work with her.

552
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:11,629
Ah, she's not wrong about that.

553
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:16,718
Oh, and also, there's this older guy?
Apparently, he's kinda… unusual?

554
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,470
-What?
-Here you go.

555
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:20,347
-Thank you.
-Oh…

556
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,432
The guy that doesn't leave
when his shift ends?

557
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:26,269
No, she said he has inhuman strength
or something.

558
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,271
Inhuman strength?

559
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,482
What is she talking about?

560
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,235
I heard he can bend a 10 yen coin
with just his fingers?

561
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,155
-Really?
-Ah…

562
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,867
Well… Yeah, I guess we do have someone
with a strong grip…

563
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,661
Oh, so she's telling the truth.

564
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:46,581
I didn't really buy it
since she tends to exaggerate a lot.

565
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,625
Well, she does have that habit.

566
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,836
Right? So I told her
to let me meet him first.

567
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,049
Oh… I see.

568
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:56,966
No!

569
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,843
She's really trustworthy.

570
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,179
Why would you tell her, anyway?

571
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:03,681
We tell each other everything,

572
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,433
so I don’t want to keep secrets from her.

573
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,436
Listen, this is my secret

574
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,064
and not yours,
so there's really no need to tell her.

575
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,691
Okay, how about this?
I'll tell you her secret in exchange.

576
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,735
You're not listening.
You don't have to do that.

577
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,780
So, she actually used to have monolids,

578
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,116
but in high school,
she kept using eyelid glue so much

579
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,159
that she naturally
developed double eyelids.

580
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,204
Really? I couldn't care less.

581
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,665
Only about three people,
including me, know this.

582
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,834
-So you really can’t tell anyone, okay?
-I won't.

583
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:33,545
-Okay, so now we're even, right?
-No.

584
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,588
Fine.

585
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,882
I really shouldn't be saying this, but--

586
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,467
You don't have to tell me.

587
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,886
-She actually--
-Okay, fine.

588
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,433
Whatever. Only her, okay?

589
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,893
-Really?
-It's an exception.

590
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,312
Thank you so much.

591
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,941
But in exchange, I won't be meeting her
or proving myself to her, okay?

592
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,069
-Can't you do that?
-You already told her!

593
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,823
Yeah, I kept using eyelid glue for so long
that I naturally developed double eyelids.

594
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,366
See?

595
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,951
-Right?
-That can happen?

596
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,745
I was surprised too.

597
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,705
Speaking of Tamagotchis,

598
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,582
do you all remember?

599
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,086
Nonchan was the first to buy one.

600
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,337
Is that so?

601
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,007
At the very least, she was the first
in our class.

602
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,551
Wait, are you about
to tell that story, Kiichan?

603
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,052
You still remember?

604
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,180
Of course, stop it!

605
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,850
-You really like to talk about this.
-What is it?

606
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,935
One fine day, Nonchan

607
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:33,396
came to school
with a Tamagotchi attached to her bag.

608
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,317
-Ah, I remember now!
-Just when

609
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,695
we were admiring it, during lunch break,

610
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:44,407
Minapuu secretly told us.

611
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,618
-That it was a fake.
-Yeah.

612
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,538
And when we casually went to take a look,

613
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,917
it turned out it wasn't a Tamagotchi
but a New Tamago Watch.

614
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,711
A counterfeit product.

615
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,671
Just when

616
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,381
we were wondering if we should tell,

617
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,675
Aya-nyan came by.

618
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:06,304
-So we decided to ask her for advice.
-Did that happen?

619
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,306
And you said we should definitely tell.

620
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:12,519
-That's Aya-nyan, all right.
-But we were hesitant.

621
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,438
Then Aya-nyan said that talking secretly
like that is even worse,

622
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,982
and she went ahead and told her.

623
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,192
-Wow.
-Really?

624
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,819
‪You're really cool.‬

625
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,487
‪No, she's not.‬

626
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,533
She just walked right up to Nonchan,
and in the most casual tone ever, she said

627
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,701
"Nonchan, that's a fake."

628
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,996
There's no way I said it like that.

629
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,959
It's as if you were telling her
there was a lint on her shoulder.

630
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:37,710
I was really stunned when I heard that.

631
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,129
I couldn't even react.

632
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,340
And you refused to believe her, right?

633
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,508
-Yeah.
-Of course.

634
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,718
"It's not fake, it's the newest version."

635
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,971
-She insisted.
-I mean, "New" was in the name too.

636
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,931
This is so embarrassing.

637
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,933
We didn't push further,

638
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:53,852
but guess what?

639
00:30:53,935 --> 00:30:55,895
From the next day on,
she stopped bringing it.

640
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,064
Right.

641
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:01,734
Then when someone asked,
"Aren't you going to bring it anymore?"

642
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,528
she told them the pet died.

643
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,488
Well, yeah, it dies… so?

644
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,200
-Let's not talk about this anymore!
-The thing is.

645
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,870
You can restart even if it dies, and yet

646
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,330
she goes "The pet died,
so I stashed it away."

647
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,165
How cool was that?

648
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:18,167
Is that even the right word?

649
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,838
I'm going to the restroom.

650
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,019
<i>Ms. Nakamoto?</i>

651
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,611
<i>I haven't seen her since that incident.</i>

652
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,155
<i>I wonder if she knows</i>

653
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,699
<i>I was the one who reported her…</i>

654
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:55,622
<i>If she does, that’s super-awkward.</i>
<i>Well, it's awkward either way.</i>

655
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:02,837
<i>How long has she been here?</i>

656
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,467
<i>Has she noticed me?</i>

657
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,596
<i>Nope, doesn’t seem like it.</i>

658
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:16,601
<i>No matter how mentally strong someone is,</i>

659
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:21,022
<i>if you got fired for stealing</i>
<i>and your former colleague is present,</i>

660
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:24,233
there's no way you could sing
<i>"Cat's Eye"</i> passionately.

661
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,156
<i>I mean, it's from an anime about thieves.</i>

662
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,292
-Takahashi.
-Yes?

663
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,504
I've got a small favor to ask.

664
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,340
-What is it?
-Well.

665
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:49,592
I feel bad asking
since it's a personal matter,

666
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,261
but I went to the dentist last week

667
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,680
to get a cavity treated.

668
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:54,847
Okay.

669
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,101
I was supposed to go again yesterday,

670
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:01,479
but I had something to do in the morning
and couldn't make it.

671
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:02,981
Right.

672
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:05,692
So, I rescheduled

673
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,986
for tomorrow morning,

674
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:12,031
but they only gave me enough painkillers
to last until this morning…

675
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,326
and now, it's actually pretty painful.

676
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:17,370
I see.

677
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:21,290
Um… just until tomorrow morning is fine,

678
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:26,421
but could you do something
to ease this pain?

679
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:29,507
-I know it's a totally personal--
-Um, manager.

680
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,803
-Yes?
-I really want to help.

681
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:37,181
But that is in the realm
of supernatural powers,

682
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:39,517
so I can't do that with my abilities.

683
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:44,147
I see.

684
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,314
Yes.

685
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,444
-Sorry about that.
-No, I should be the one saying that.

686
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:56,075
If you'd like, I've got
some over-the-counter painkillers.

687
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:58,536
Are you sure?

688
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,204
Of course.

689
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,750
-Have one.
-Thank you.

690
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,418
They're pretty effective.

691
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,378
Thank you.

692
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,257
Hold on. Could it be…

693
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:16,012
that you prepared this
by looking into the future?

694
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:17,889
No, this is just a coincidence.

695
00:34:20,766 --> 00:34:23,226
-See you, Nonchan. Thanks for today.
-Thanks for coming.

696
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,353
Need me to call a taxi?

697
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,731
I didn't drink today,
so I'll drive her home.

698
00:34:26,813 --> 00:34:28,608
-Okay.
-Thanks.

699
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,525
Hang in there.

700
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:32,904
Come back soon!

701
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,531
-I'll come again.
-See you!

702
00:34:35,614 --> 00:34:37,241
Thanks.

703
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:39,911
ERIMO MISAKI

704
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,418
Oh yeah,

705
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,170
we saw Mayor Umemoto over there.

706
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,465
-Yeah.
-The new mayor? Where did you see her?

707
00:34:52,547 --> 00:34:54,300
She was just at the place next door.

708
00:34:54,382 --> 00:34:57,094
Oh, she went to <i>Komatsu.</i>

709
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,931
Yeah, she looked surprisingly young
and beautiful.

710
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,683
-Yeah.
-You know.

711
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,352
She has this clean and elegant air.

712
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,604
-Yeah.
-Compared to the previous mayor.

713
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,772
Definitely.

714
00:35:07,855 --> 00:35:11,484
Mr. Furuya, right?
That guy made so many gaffes.

715
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,694
He was always getting criticized
for something.

716
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:15,363
And he was apparently overbearing too,

717
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,949
saying some pretty unreasonable things
to his subordinates.

718
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:21,494
He also had this old-school air.

719
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,288
Well, in that sense, Ms. Umemoto

720
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,166
is clean and seems to consider things
from a woman's--

721
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,751
Oh, shut up.

722
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:32,171
-Sorry about that.
-It's okay.

723
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,799
<i>I'd say starting</i>
<i>your own karaoke snack bar</i>

724
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,260
<i>and getting irked by singers</i>

725
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,971
<i>is the most unreasonable thing.</i>

726
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:40,930
Endou.

727
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,643
-Ms. Nakamoto!
-It's been a while since we last met.

728
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,811
Yes.

729
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,021
<i>-What? This is so awkward!</i>
-Do you two know each other?

730
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,566
Yes. I used to work with her.

731
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:54,235
Oh, really?

732
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,654
-What about the both of you?
-We're childhood friends.

733
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,197
Really?

734
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,701
-I didn't know that.
-Do you come here often, Ms. Nakamoto?

735
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,036
No, I only started coming recently.

736
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,122
It's been two or three months now.

737
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,875
To tell you the truth,
when you entered earlier, I saw.

738
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:11,294
-I noticed you pretty quickly.
-What?

739
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,753
Really?

740
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,173
But you were talking with your friends,

741
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,674
so I couldn't just barge in.

742
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,051
I see.

743
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,554
Nice to meet you.

744
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:24,682
<i>Wait, then that means back then,</i>

745
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,934
<i>she knew I was present,</i>

746
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,313
<i>and she sang "Cat's Eye" knowingly.</i>

747
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,689
You sang "Cat's Eye" earlier.

748
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,983
-Yeah.
-You were pretty good.

749
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,194
<i>Unbelievable nerves</i>

750
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,778
<i>of steel.</i>

751
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,780
The acoustics are amazing here.

752
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,786
-I'll be going now.
-Thank you for your work.

753
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,499
Do you have a cold?

754
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:54,670
Oh, I just ran a few rounds outside
to show Isomura my abilities,

755
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:59,008
so I've got a slight fever
as a side effect from that.

756
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:01,844
Will you be okay?

757
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,848
I should recover
if I soak in the bath later.

758
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:09,685
If that's the case,
you can go now, if you'd like.

759
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,687
But it's still open to the guests.

760
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,107
There's not many people using it today,
so it should be fine.

761
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,526
-Are you sure it's okay?
-Yes, go ahead.

762
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,445
Thank you so much.

763
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,617
Then, Takahashi…

764
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,703
-Yes?
-Um…

765
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,831
When you’re feeling up to it, no rush…

766
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,833
What is it?

767
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,419
Ever since I started nearing 50 years old,

768
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,339
I’ve noticed a spot forming here.

769
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,091
Right.

770
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,510
I was wondering
if maybe you could use your abili--

771
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,929
-Manager.
-Yes?

772
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,723
That's not something
my abilities can do either.

773
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,851
I see.

774
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,271
Sorry I keep turning you down.

775
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:55,982
Oh, no, I’m the one
making unreasonable requests. I'm sorry.

776
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,108
Not at all.

777
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,653
Um, one of my classmates
is a dermatologist.

778
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,613
If you’d like, I can introduce him to you.

779
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,991
-Really?
-Yes.

780
00:38:06,492 --> 00:38:09,662
-Hold on. Could this be--
-It's just a coincidence.

781
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:15,334
Sir, you're going to catch a cold
if you sleep here.

782
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:18,879
I wonder if he's here on a business trip?

783
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:21,257
He probably let loose too much.

784
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,341
-I'm off now.
-See you.

785
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:24,635
-Take care.
-Take care.

786
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,638
I'll keep an eye on him for a bit longer.

787
00:38:37,815 --> 00:38:39,191
Thanks for coming.

788
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,901
Isn't this too cheap? Are you sure?

789
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:43,070
Yeah, but in exchange,
you better come again soon.

790
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,113
Okay.

791
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,990
Are you sure?

792
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,701
-Let's meet for a meal someday.
-I'd love to.

793
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,703
-Thanks, it was fun.
-Thanks.

794
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,997
-Take care.
-Thanks for the drinks.

795
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,291
Hey, is this guy okay?

796
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,376
He's wasted.

797
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,003
It happens a lot.

798
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:01,255
-Did he come alone?
-Yeah.

799
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,257
Then there's no one to pick him up.

800
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,720
Yeah, and with that build of his,

801
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,431
there's nothing I can do.

802
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,516
Sir.

803
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,894
Sir!

804
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:17,021
‪Oh, dear!‬

805
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:21,525
Wait, he's one of our guests.

806
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,736
What? He's staying at Lake Hotel?

807
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,114
If I recall correctly, he's Mr. Morimoto,

808
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,991
and he checked in alone today.

809
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,369
Is that so?

810
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:35,373
Since we know where he's staying, let's
get him into a taxi and send him back?

811
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:36,582
-Yeah.
-Right?

812
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,668
-Heave-ho!
-Will this work?

813
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:43,005
Heave-ho!

814
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:47,051
Ready, set, go!

815
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,887
-He's too heavy!
-Yeah.

816
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,639
Oh, dear.

817
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,307
I'll help.

818
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,226
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

819
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,686
-I'll do it in one go. Make him stand.
-Huh?

820
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,981
-What?
-Ready, set, go! Make him stand!

821
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:04,110
-Endou, get his leg.
-Okay.

822
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,611
His head.

823
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,279
Lower his head.

824
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:08,531
Push him in.

825
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,826
Amazing!

826
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,413
-Take care.
-I'm glad that's over.

827
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,706
Sorry about that.

828
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,875
-Are your hips okay?
-Yeah.

829
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,168
‪You're amazing, Ms. Nakamoto.‬

830
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,713
-Yeah.
-Not at all.

831
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,632
Let's go get our belongings.

832
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,136
Now that I think about it,
will things be okay at the hotel?

833
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:31,262
‪What do you mean?‬

834
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,098
There aren't many staff
at this hour, right?

835
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,851
Well, yeah, but they should be fine.

836
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,645
Really? I don't think two people
can carry that guy.

837
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,773
I think they'll manage somehow,

838
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,817
but just in case,
I'll give them a heads up.

839
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,446
-I'm back.
-Welcome back.

840
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,739
-How are you feeling?
-I feel much better now.

841
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,283
That's great to hear.

842
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,410
I'll get it.

843
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,291
Thank you for calling Lake Hotel.

844
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:05,588
Oh, hello. What's up?

845
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:09,425
The taxi just left,
so it should arrive pretty soon.

846
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:15,306
Yes. Only you can handle this, Takahashi.
I'm counting on you.

847
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,640
What do you mean?

848
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,981
I understand. Okay, thank you.

849
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:28,777
-Takahashi, one moment please.
-They arrived, huh.

850
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,071
LAKE HOTEL

851
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,324
-Sorry to trouble you.
-No problem.

852
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:42,541
I see how it is.

853
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,170
Isomura.

854
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:51,675
I'm going to use my abilities, so could
you stop the driver from looking this way?

855
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,094
Okay, I understand.

856
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,598
For the time being,
I'll settle the fare for him.

857
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,599
Okay.

858
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,524
3,200 yen, please.

859
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,652
Okay, here's 5,000 yen.

860
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,736
Okay.

861
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,657
Here's your change and receipt.

862
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,325
Thank you so much.

863
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,954
-It's cold today, isn't it?
-Yeah. Hm?

864
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,080
PAYMENT

865
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,039
Where did they go?

866
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,876
Oh, the guest woke up
and my colleague accompanied him in.

867
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,003
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

868
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:32,216
Are you the type
who's fine travelling overseas alone?

869
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,261
Yep. I find things to be easier on my own.

870
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:37,555
You're cool.

871
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:41,183
<i>She got fired for stealing,</i>
<i>and not only was she able</i>

872
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,852
<i>to sing "Cat's Eye"</i>
<i>in front of her former colleague,</i>

873
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,273
<i>but she's walking home together</i>
<i>with that colleague and her junior…</i>

874
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,275
<i>Her mental fortitude</i>
<i>is practically indestructible.</i>

875
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,654
Hey, since we're here,
why don't we take a group photo?

876
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,741
-Should we?
-Might as well.

877
00:42:57,825 --> 00:42:58,867
Why not?

878
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:00,661
Okay, here we go.

879
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:02,871
Smile!

880
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:05,749
<i>The fact she's able</i>
<i>to casually take photos…</i>

881
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:06,875
<i>She's really something else.</i>

882
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:07,876
It's done.

883
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,087
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

884
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,632
I’ll send it to you.
Mind if I get your contact details, Endou?

885
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:17,886
Huh? Uh… sure.

886
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:22,016
‪Let me set it up real quick.‬

887
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:27,730
All done. I'll send it you.

888
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:28,939
Thank you.

889
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:31,483
-Hazuki, may I have your details too?
-Oh, sure.

890
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:35,404
<i>For some reason, she's also exchanging</i>
<i>details with my junior.</i>

891
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,448
<i>Her mental fortitude</i>
<i>is tougher than a diamond.</i>

892
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,450
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

893
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,795
-I'm back.
-Thank you for your work.

894
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,758
Sorry, but can I go take a bath again?

895
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,968
-Of course.
-Sorry.

896
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,220
Oh, before I forget.
Takahashi, this is for you.

897
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,138
What?

898
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:04,767
The driver told me to give this to you.

899
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,310
-For me?
-Yes.

900
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,771
It's from a person
called Ms. Okada, apparently.

901
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,733
Ms. Okada? Who's that?

902
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,193
Is it not someone you know?

903
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,236
Ms. Okada…

904
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,407
Endou's last name is… oh, right, Endou.

905
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,660
Ms. Okada?

906
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,288
Nothing comes to mind.

907
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:30,834
<i>And so, Mr. Morimoto</i>
<i>was safely brought back,</i>

908
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,796
<i>and I was able to deliver the dorayaki</i>
<i>before the day was over.</i>

909
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,547
Ms. Okada, was it?

910
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,592
<i>Three days after that,</i>

911
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:44,682
<i>I ended up meeting</i>
<i>Isomura's friend after all.</i>

912
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,558
This is my childhood friend, Mizupon.

913
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,644
Nice to meet you, I'm Mizuki Manabe.

914
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:50,312
Nice to meet you, I'm Takahashi.

915
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,481
<i>This feels like déjà vu.</i>

916
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,775
She's really trustworthy.

917
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,568
I definitely won't tell.

918
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,488
<i>This conversation feels like déjà vu too.</i>

919
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:03,700
Let's get started right away.
Please show us.

920
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,416
This 10 yen coin right here… Don't blink.

921
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,503
I just bent it. You may check.

922
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:16,922
-Isn't he amazing?
-Yeah.

923
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:21,009
<i>I realized I was getting used</i>
<i>to showing people that. However…</i>

924
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,721
As to why I'm able to do this…

925
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,765
it's because I'm an alien.

926
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,642
Pardon?

927
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:31,520
Apparently, yes.

928
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:35,107
Well, just make sure to keep this
a secret for now.

929
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:39,486
Well, yeah. Of course.
I definitely won't tell anyone.

930
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,657
-Isn't this amazing?
-Yeah.

931
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:46,452
<i>These girls don't believe me at all.</i>

932
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:47,828
His grip strength?

933
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:50,914
