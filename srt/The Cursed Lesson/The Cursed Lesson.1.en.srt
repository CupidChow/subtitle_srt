1
00:00:59,237 --> 00:01:00,487
We're here.

2
00:01:07,278 --> 00:01:08,778
Is anyone in there?

3
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,153
Why is it so quiet?

4
00:01:12,237 --> 00:01:15,237
Is this the right place that was reported?

5
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,737
They surely heard a scream.

6
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,695
-Who?
-From downstairs.

7
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:20,778
Yeah?

8
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,237
Wait, Miss!

9
00:01:37,945 --> 00:01:39,070
Put that knife down.

10
00:01:39,612 --> 00:01:41,820
I don't know what's going on,

11
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:43,612
but put it down first.

12
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:45,778
We can help you, okay?

13
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,403
I know you're all in it together.

14
00:02:12,862 --> 00:02:14,070
You thought I wouldn't know.

15
00:02:16,195 --> 00:02:17,445
Die!

16
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:26,028
Kundalini…

17
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:45,487
Look towards the left.

18
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,112
Good.

19
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,403
Don't you think this model looks too old?

20
00:02:54,403 --> 00:02:56,737
Well, she looks fine to me.

21
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,070
No!

22
00:02:58,153 --> 00:03:00,612
Even her skin looks too dull.

23
00:03:00,695 --> 00:03:03,987
Our main target is 20-something,
but this seems for 40s or 50s.

24
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,070
What about changing her dress?

25
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:08,737
Changing out her outfit
won't change anything.

26
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,820
Hyo-jeong,
what's with that look on your face?

27
00:03:12,528 --> 00:03:14,528
-Smile for me.
-I'm sorry.

28
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:20,445
This model doesn't look fresh at all.

29
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:23,028
You shouldn't do this now.

30
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:25,987
Well, she's not a rookie model
or something and now--

31
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,945
I'd rather use a rookie.

32
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,820
Would you take responsibility
if our market share drops?

33
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:35,987
Give us a moment, please.

34
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,028
-Okay.
-Okay.

35
00:03:47,612 --> 00:03:51,403
What a nut. What does he even
know about a commercial?

36
00:03:53,278 --> 00:03:56,653
Hyo-jeong, I'm really sorry, but…

37
00:03:56,737 --> 00:04:00,237
This client keeps complaining
about using you.

38
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:04,195
You know how it works around here.

39
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:08,278
I'll call you again
with another job, okay?

40
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,237
Hello? Where are you now?

41
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,487
Are you available now?

42
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:19,945
I was not there at that time!

43
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:23,487
Chief is calling you.

44
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:26,195
Not again! Why? I'm goddamn busy now.

45
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:27,570
I have no idea.

46
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:33,320
Goddamnit. Am I his punching bag or what?

47
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,403
I want you to take that case.

48
00:04:41,778 --> 00:04:43,487
It's a homicide

49
00:04:43,987 --> 00:04:47,612
where she killed an old couple
next door and attempted suicide.

50
00:04:48,237 --> 00:04:50,028
It's your expertise, isn't it?

51
00:04:50,112 --> 00:04:52,653
Come on, what expertise?

52
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:55,862
They might think I'm Lieutenant Horatio
from <i>CSI</i> or something.

53
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:57,445
Dammit.

54
00:04:58,653 --> 00:04:59,487
Hey.

55
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:02,528
You've got nothing to do
at home these days, huh?

56
00:05:02,612 --> 00:05:06,070
It must be nerve-wracking
to be alone after divorce.

57
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:08,112
Take a close look at it.

58
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,778
Go solve it.

59
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:15,153
First, as she's unconscious now,

60
00:05:15,237 --> 00:05:17,237
try investigating the people around her.

61
00:05:17,987 --> 00:05:20,153
When she comes around,
the hospital will call you.

62
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:28,862
Good, this is the right image
we've been looking for.

63
00:05:28,945 --> 00:05:31,195
Chic and urban.

64
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,695
We wouldn't have wasted time
if it was her from the beginning.

65
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:39,070
You have such an excellent eye for it.

66
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,362
Yeah, it's the exact image
that our company wanted.

67
00:05:44,903 --> 00:05:46,487
I knew you'd like her.

68
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:50,112
Well then, let's get ready to shoot.

69
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,945
Didn't you say you had an ad shooting?

70
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:47,195
You have time for things like this?

71
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:51,695
Well…

72
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:56,362
The client wanted to work with me,

73
00:06:57,153 --> 00:06:59,820
but I didn't like their products,
so I turned it down.

74
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:02,153
You shouldn't have!

75
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:07,195
At our age, we should just work
without thinking twice.

76
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:10,737
Isn't it scary to see
young girls catching up to us?

77
00:07:14,445 --> 00:07:16,278
You look a little tired.

78
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,903
Did you go on
another harsh diet for the shooting?

79
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:22,820
Geez.

80
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:27,320
Do I look like that?

81
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:35,862
It's not the shooting.

82
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:42,153
I can't sleep well these days
because of paralyzing nightmares.

83
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,862
I saw a doctor but there's no change.

84
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:48,195
What? Nightmares?

85
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,737
I used to often have them
when I was young.

86
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,487
Grandma told me to put a knife
under my pillow and I did so,

87
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,445
and I've never had them ever since.

88
00:07:58,987 --> 00:08:00,278
Isn't it amazing?

89
00:08:00,945 --> 00:08:03,820
You should try. It doesn't hurt to try.
It's from my experience.

90
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:08,487
What are you staring at?

91
00:08:09,195 --> 00:08:10,028
What?

92
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:13,153
No, it's nothing.

93
00:08:18,903 --> 00:08:21,570
Bend your legs to the right.

94
00:08:21,653 --> 00:08:25,237
Then, inhale deeply
with your hands to the ceiling,

95
00:08:25,862 --> 00:08:27,945
exhale and right hand on the floor.

96
00:08:28,028 --> 00:08:30,820
Stretch your left hand.

97
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,987
And inhale,

98
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:38,237
exhale with your left hand
under the right armpit.

99
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,278
Roll up your spine. Two, one.

100
00:09:24,195 --> 00:09:25,570
Excuse me.

101
00:09:28,195 --> 00:09:29,028
Yes?

102
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,570
We met a few days ago, didn't we?

103
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:37,528
I don't know.

104
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:42,237
Are you sure?

105
00:09:44,237 --> 00:09:45,070
Yes.

106
00:09:46,445 --> 00:09:49,237
You're Lee Hyo-jeong
from Dong-soong Girl's High School, right?

107
00:10:05,653 --> 00:10:10,195
By the way, you've changed a lot.

108
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:16,487
Oh, I hear that from time to time.

109
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,737
I should accompany you
to your beauty treatment.

110
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,653
Treatment?

111
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:27,612
Yeah, whatever it is,
plastic surgery or skin care.

112
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:33,570
So you also think I've gotten
a huge makeover from plastic surgery?

113
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:38,487
What's wrong with that?
Everyone's doing it.

114
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:51,778
What is it?

115
00:10:52,945 --> 00:10:53,903
Yoga studio?

116
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,153
It's not the kind of yoga studio
that you're thinking of.

117
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,445
The classes are really tough,
and it costs an arm and a leg.

118
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:07,195
But once the course is over,
you'll feel a definite change.

119
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:09,903
You're trying to fool someone
you haven't seen in ages?

120
00:11:10,612 --> 00:11:12,445
What? Yoga?

121
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:17,195
If you don't wanna tell me,
then just say it.

122
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:21,195
You looked quite desperate that day.

123
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:27,570
Come on, give it another thought.

124
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:32,570
And I don't tell lies,

125
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,195
unlike you-know-who.

126
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,903
I think I need to have
that treatment again.

127
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,695
I told you that you can't.

128
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:26,570
Just let me have it, please.

129
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:30,695
Gosh, I said no.
There's a huge side effect.

130
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:33,903
And a risk of skin damage, too.

131
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:42,487
Then, is there anything
I can have right now?

132
00:12:47,862 --> 00:12:48,903
Brightening.

133
00:12:49,778 --> 00:12:51,737
I need a brightening treatment.

134
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,112
Let me at least get that.

135
00:12:53,695 --> 00:12:58,195
For now, there's no procedure
that can be done on your face.

136
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,987
Just get a skin massage for today.

137
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,528
It's complimentary.

138
00:14:15,903 --> 00:14:17,237
What happened?

139
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:20,862
Someone's dead again, I think.

140
00:14:27,237 --> 00:14:30,028
People swimming here die
due to the deep waters

141
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,695
and some people even kill themselves here.

142
00:15:10,445 --> 00:15:12,445
The last guest is on her way now.

143
00:15:49,737 --> 00:15:50,570
Welcome.

144
00:15:50,653 --> 00:15:52,070
We were expecting you.

145
00:16:39,403 --> 00:16:40,778
You're all here.

146
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,695
Thank you for coming a long way.

147
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:49,820
I'm Yu-jin, who will lead you
to the world of Kundalini from today.

148
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:08,528
AGREEMENT

149
00:17:08,612 --> 00:17:12,862
You'll see some rules to follow in here.

150
00:17:13,653 --> 00:17:16,028
Drinking and smoking
are strictly prohibited.

151
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:17,820
And drugs, of course.

152
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:20,903
Not even coffee?

153
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:22,320
No.

154
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:26,778
You are allowed to eat and drink
that we serve here.

155
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:33,653
Cell phones aren't allowed either,
as they hugely affect our training.

156
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:37,653
Then how do we make
contact with the outside?

157
00:17:37,737 --> 00:17:40,987
Only during designated times
until the training's over.

158
00:17:43,737 --> 00:17:44,903
That's too intense.

159
00:17:46,737 --> 00:17:51,278
If you don't like our rules,
you're free to leave now.

160
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:01,237
Then we'll begin training at five.
I'll see you then.

161
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:21,070
This place doesn't look like
a woman lived alone.

162
00:18:21,153 --> 00:18:23,445
-She worked at a hostess bar?
-Yes.

163
00:18:23,945 --> 00:18:27,945
I asked her neighbors and she had
no interaction with the dead couple.

164
00:18:28,445 --> 00:18:29,820
Nothing significant.

165
00:18:37,153 --> 00:18:38,862
He seems to be her boyfriend.

166
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,778
This is nonsense.

167
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:52,153
How can we not lose weight
when we eat like a bird?

168
00:18:53,695 --> 00:18:56,987
It's just a plain program
that starves you and makes you slim.

169
00:18:59,112 --> 00:18:59,945
Isn't it?

170
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,987
-Right.
-I'm Kang Mi-yeon.

171
00:19:09,278 --> 00:19:12,737
Oh, I'm Lee Hyo-jeong.

172
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,570
Hi, I'm Kim Ji-won.

173
00:19:16,695 --> 00:19:19,112
How did you all find out about this place?

174
00:19:19,195 --> 00:19:23,653
I'm an MMA fighter,
and I came here to lose weight.

175
00:19:24,403 --> 00:19:27,112
We fighters also gotta be pretty
these days.

176
00:19:27,195 --> 00:19:30,528
Wow, that's cool.
A female martial arts fighter.

177
00:19:31,403 --> 00:19:34,195
You look too young to be here.

178
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:37,987
-What's your reason?
-Well, I just…

179
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,112
Are you here for retreat or something?

180
00:19:42,528 --> 00:19:45,195
We all came here
to get prettier, isn't it?

181
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:48,403
So just give
those ice-breaking lines a rest.

182
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:56,112
Aren't you Jeong Ye-na the actress?

183
00:19:57,945 --> 00:19:59,570
I'm a big fan of yours.

184
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:05,903
By the way, do you think
we can all get prettier?

185
00:20:06,612 --> 00:20:10,195
I just wanted to take a chance,
but I'm not sure.

186
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:15,112
Her talk about some Kundalini
kind of sounded like a scam.

187
00:20:15,195 --> 00:20:18,903
In fact, I thought my friend
was dragging me into a pyramid scheme.

188
00:20:18,987 --> 00:20:23,903
But she came to see me looking
pretty and slim, so I was surprised.

189
00:20:23,987 --> 00:20:26,403
Even plastic surgery
wouldn't do any good for her face.

190
00:20:31,903 --> 00:20:35,403
We're always going to
have this tea before class.

191
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:39,737
Drink. It'll ease your mind.

192
00:20:55,778 --> 00:20:59,612
Now, we'll begin our training.

193
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,153
Only for Kundalini.

194
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:03,778
Excuse me.

195
00:21:04,278 --> 00:21:07,653
You keep saying "Kundalini,"
but what is that?

196
00:21:07,737 --> 00:21:11,403
All humans possess
the energy of the universe.

197
00:21:11,487 --> 00:21:13,070
They're simply unaware of it.

198
00:21:13,987 --> 00:21:16,778
In here, as if in a mother's womb,

199
00:21:16,862 --> 00:21:19,112
you'll open the third eye.

200
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:24,153
And witness its power
that completes your beauty.

201
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,653
I will make it possible.

202
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,070
Excuse me. Is it scientifically possible?

203
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:40,237
The soul and the universe,
and their communion…

204
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:44,445
It's a power that science can never reach.

205
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:48,362
Don't doubt it.

206
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:52,320
Get rid of even the slightest doubt.

207
00:21:54,195 --> 00:21:55,070
If not,

208
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:59,987
you'll never reach the level of Kundalini.

209
00:22:02,028 --> 00:22:02,862
Never.

210
00:22:06,653 --> 00:22:11,862
Close your eyes
and let's start with breathing.

211
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,445
Excuse me.

212
00:23:54,278 --> 00:23:55,320
Yes, go ahead.

213
00:23:57,362 --> 00:24:03,237
I think I heard some strange noise
in my sleep at night.

214
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,070
I think you heard that wrong.

215
00:24:09,153 --> 00:24:11,903
So I opened my door just to be sure,

216
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,695
and saw something
that looked like a snake.

217
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,278
Well, again,

218
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:20,570
I think you saw that wrong,

219
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,112
but we'll go check anyway.

220
00:24:32,903 --> 00:24:36,612
Do you have anything else to say?

221
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:40,612
No.

222
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,112
Hello, sweety. Come on.
So when do I get my car?

223
00:24:57,987 --> 00:24:59,570
You're sure this time?

224
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:02,445
Where?

225
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:07,153
Oh, that motel we went last week?

226
00:25:08,612 --> 00:25:10,320
Yeah, that place was fine.

227
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,570
Damn, this bitch tries
to suck me up with that BMW.

228
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:21,487
-Mr. Min Cheol-su?
-Yes?

229
00:25:24,153 --> 00:25:25,320
Do you know this woman?

230
00:25:25,945 --> 00:25:27,570
Oh, she's Bora.

231
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:29,570
Did she cause trouble?

232
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,278
Are you two together?

233
00:25:32,653 --> 00:25:34,987
Not really,
it's just a business relationship.

234
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:39,278
Anyway, she's a total nutcase,
seriously bipolar and so.

235
00:25:39,362 --> 00:25:43,112
We know that she is, too.
Just tell me more about her.

236
00:25:44,153 --> 00:25:47,487
She used to be such a popular bar girl
at the hostess bar.

237
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,237
She said she once made
tens of thousands of won…

238
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:54,320
-Get to the point.
-Okay.

239
00:25:55,112 --> 00:25:58,237
But she was getting old
and then the younger girls rolled in,

240
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,987
so she got severely depressed.

241
00:26:01,112 --> 00:26:05,320
Then one day,
she went somewhere for some yoga.

242
00:26:06,528 --> 00:26:10,237
And, oh my gosh, came back
with her whole body transformed.

243
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,528
She lost so much weight
and her wrinkles were gone.

244
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,820
She came back looking pretty?

245
00:26:14,903 --> 00:26:15,778
Yeah.

246
00:26:17,362 --> 00:26:21,320
But the problem was
that she started seeing ghosts.

247
00:26:21,403 --> 00:26:23,445
Talking about snakes
and chakra and all that.

248
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:27,070
I got scared and stopped talking to her.

249
00:26:29,112 --> 00:26:31,320
Sir, they said
Jeong Bo-ra just came around.

250
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:38,070
Next position.

251
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,528
Next position.

252
00:26:48,653 --> 00:26:49,903
Now bend over.

253
00:26:52,237 --> 00:26:53,403
Slowly.

254
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:58,737
Excuse me. I can't focus.

255
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:00,570
We gotta be at similar levels.

256
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,987
Our gap is way too big, isn't it?

257
00:27:04,653 --> 00:27:06,320
Move on to the next position.

258
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,987
Your body's too stiff.

259
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:15,070
Relax.

260
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:19,403
Come to the training room
at midnight, alone.

261
00:27:25,862 --> 00:27:27,528
Move on to the next position.

262
00:27:40,528 --> 00:27:44,695
So, you mean you killed them
because of yoga?

263
00:27:45,653 --> 00:27:46,987
I did see it.

264
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:48,570
Saw what?

265
00:27:49,653 --> 00:27:51,528
I've almost reached Kundalini,

266
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,945
but they were seeking my soul.

267
00:27:56,737 --> 00:28:02,320
I mean, what could they possibly seek?
Those oldies were incapacitated.

268
00:28:02,945 --> 00:28:06,695
Are you saying that old man
sexually harassed you or what?

269
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:10,445
The realm of Kundalini is far
from the secular world

270
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:12,528
you are thinking of.

271
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:15,237
Well, we have no choice.

272
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:19,070
As there's no further statement,

273
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:22,903
let's just wrap up our report here.

274
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
I saw it!

275
00:28:29,153 --> 00:28:30,487
I saw it for sure.

276
00:28:43,403 --> 00:28:45,112
There are many snakes.

277
00:28:46,945 --> 00:28:47,987
Are they gross?

278
00:28:48,487 --> 00:28:52,112
What? Well, a little.

279
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:02,237
Snakes once symbolized
wisdom and medicine,

280
00:29:03,695 --> 00:29:06,903
but prejudice grew over time.

281
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:09,195
And lots of distortion.

282
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,195
I see.

283
00:29:12,695 --> 00:29:13,820
It's tough, isn't it?

284
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,903
I just feel bad
for being a burden to others.

285
00:29:23,403 --> 00:29:25,153
Here, try this tea.

286
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,653
It's called karma,
and it'll help you relax.

287
00:29:28,737 --> 00:29:30,112
Both physically and mentally.

288
00:29:30,612 --> 00:29:34,278
It'll even help you open your eyes.

289
00:29:51,778 --> 00:29:52,778
How do you like it?

290
00:29:53,653 --> 00:29:55,903
It's a bit bitter, but…

291
00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:00,278
It's making me relaxed, I guess.

292
00:30:15,112 --> 00:30:21,487
At first, I also thought
I was seeing things from extreme dieting.

293
00:30:24,695 --> 00:30:26,445
Okay. What the heck.

294
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,945
Let me just hear your story in detail.

295
00:30:30,778 --> 00:30:31,737
What did you see?

296
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:34,820
A ghost.

297
00:30:36,987 --> 00:30:38,070
A ghost.

298
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,153
I know you don't buy it,
but I really saw it.

299
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,695
It kept following me
and whispering in my ears.

300
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,528
That whispering was seriously killing me.

301
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:55,903
The whispering never stopped.
And those creepy sounds…

302
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:02,778
You'd never know the fear and the pain.

303
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,612
I got courageous during my meditation.

304
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,987
Let's not run away anymore,
Kundalini is around the corner.

305
00:31:20,862 --> 00:31:24,320
This ghost haunting you
turned out to be your neighbors.

306
00:31:24,403 --> 00:31:27,320
So you went there right away
and killed them with a knife.

307
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:28,903
During a meditation.

308
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,903
Where an earth can I learn
that Kundalini thing?

309
00:31:38,487 --> 00:31:40,278
Let me just learn it, too.

310
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:17,195
Next position.

311
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,403
Next position.

312
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,570
What?

313
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:35,570
Stay focused!

314
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:37,112
Next position.

315
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:54,528
Look straight ahead,

316
00:36:56,778 --> 00:36:57,987
and breathe.

317
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:03,778
You seem to have gotten
much better in a day. What happened?

318
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:06,737
I'm not sure if you'd buy it.

319
00:37:07,903 --> 00:37:11,445
I was meditating by myself
in the training room last night.

320
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:14,653
Then suddenly, I got aroused.

321
00:37:14,737 --> 00:37:16,987
And it got maximized.

322
00:37:17,487 --> 00:37:21,153
And it kind of made me
feel like overcoming my limit,

323
00:37:21,237 --> 00:37:23,278
which I've never felt before.

324
00:37:24,362 --> 00:37:27,278
Are you sure you weren't already good,
and you've been hiding it until now?

325
00:37:27,862 --> 00:37:28,862
Level with me.

326
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:34,653
This Kundalini comes from the purest mind.

327
00:37:34,737 --> 00:37:36,653
That's what the master said.

328
00:37:39,528 --> 00:37:42,903
I guess you'll never be able to feel it.

329
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:50,487
"Master"?
What master are you talking about?

330
00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:31,445
What are you doing here?

331
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,487
I…

332
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,737
This area is restricted to outsiders.

333
00:39:43,112 --> 00:39:43,945
Leave.

334
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,570
What are you doing here at this hour?

335
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:36,737
-Oh--
-You can't be out like this after bedtime.

336
00:41:39,403 --> 00:41:40,570
I'm sorry.

337
00:42:35,862 --> 00:42:37,778
What is it? Get out!

338
00:42:53,528 --> 00:42:56,612
It's okay. You can just enjoy it.

339
00:43:19,945 --> 00:43:24,362
Focus on all of your inner energy.

340
00:43:28,903 --> 00:43:33,945
You might feel the heat
coming from the bottom.

341
00:43:36,737 --> 00:43:41,778
Feel the heat, focusing on the bell sound.

342
00:43:47,612 --> 00:43:49,445
Slowly.

343
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,737
Good.

344
00:44:00,403 --> 00:44:03,820
This is it for today. Well done.

345
00:44:08,195 --> 00:44:09,320
Ji-won, just a moment.

346
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,903
It's quite serious.

347
00:44:12,987 --> 00:44:15,028
You should see a doctor right away.

348
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,695
Why should I see a doctor?

349
00:44:21,237 --> 00:44:22,945
Do you want me out of this place?

350
00:44:23,528 --> 00:44:26,487
You're afraid I'd get prettier
than you, aren't you?

351
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:29,653
-No, I'm really worried.
-Mind your own business.

352
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:36,987
You morons have no idea what Kundalini is.

353
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:48,237
What's wrong with her? Isn't she nuts?

354
00:44:49,278 --> 00:44:52,820
-Are you okay?
-It was really out of concern.

355
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,195
What's the world coming to?

356
00:44:59,278 --> 00:45:02,153
This senior colleague
has to get coffee for his junior.

357
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:04,612
Then you can do all the research here.

358
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:05,528
Hey.

359
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,570
Are you patronizing me
for being a computer illiterate?

360
00:45:08,653 --> 00:45:11,903
Nah, how dare could I do that.

361
00:45:11,987 --> 00:45:14,153
-Look at you.
-Sir.

362
00:45:14,237 --> 00:45:17,070
The more I learn about Kundalini,
the weirder it gets.

363
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:18,903
What's weird?

364
00:45:18,987 --> 00:45:22,237
Listen, a snake that passes
Chakra five near Adam's apple

365
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,487
will become a dragon,

366
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,820
and if it passes
Chakra six between forehead,

367
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:30,862
it gets a dragon ball,
and when it passes Chakra seven,

368
00:45:30,945 --> 00:45:33,987
a trainee finally reaches
the level of Saint.

369
00:45:34,612 --> 00:45:36,445
-What's that mean?
-Huh?

370
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:41,320
It means, Kundalini
is the latent energy in human body,

371
00:45:41,403 --> 00:45:45,320
which can be maximized
through yoga and meditation.

372
00:45:46,028 --> 00:45:47,320
Why does it have to be a snake?

373
00:45:47,403 --> 00:45:50,612
That must be
some sort of a symbolic meaning.

374
00:45:51,403 --> 00:45:55,112
Sir, I feel like this case has
something to do with a cult.

375
00:45:55,612 --> 00:45:58,487
I was thinking that, too.

376
00:45:59,112 --> 00:46:02,320
Starting tomorrow, go find out
if there's anyone related to it,

377
00:46:02,403 --> 00:46:04,612
focusing on people around the suspect.

378
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:06,278
Okay.

379
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:06,945
What a creep. He sure knows who's pretty.

380
00:47:30,112 --> 00:47:32,153
I think I need to get out of here.

381
00:47:33,528 --> 00:47:34,612
What's going on?

382
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,028
My dead friend…

383
00:47:40,445 --> 00:47:41,528
shows up every night.

384
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:47,695
Would you believe it
if it's a natural phenomenon?

385
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,778
What do you mean, a natural phenomenon?

386
00:47:51,862 --> 00:47:56,278
It means your spiritual eye
to reach Kundalini is opening.

387
00:47:57,112 --> 00:48:01,028
Then what?
You'd see another world, wouldn't you?

388
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:10,403
Well, you can leave anytime.
It's not like this place is a prison.

389
00:48:12,528 --> 00:48:13,487
But…

390
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:15,320
It's a big shame.

391
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:20,445
Such a spiritual event
could have made you reach it for sure.

392
00:48:32,903 --> 00:48:34,153
It's ready.

393
00:48:36,820 --> 00:48:37,695
Okay.

394
00:49:32,862 --> 00:49:34,570
I'm sorry I'm late.

395
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:42,570
Let's begin.

396
00:49:45,737 --> 00:49:48,737
Push your hip forward

397
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,237
and lean backward.

398
00:50:05,653 --> 00:50:07,695
Now, the arrow position.

399
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:12,403
As if your toes and head meet,

400
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:14,278
stretch as much as possible.

401
00:50:49,195 --> 00:50:50,737
Such a weakling.

402
00:50:52,403 --> 00:50:53,237
Now what?

403
00:50:56,403 --> 00:50:59,862
-Ma'am.
-Yeah, Ji-won.

404
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:03,070
I'm here.

405
00:51:06,153 --> 00:51:07,862
Why? What is it?

406
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:10,112
I'm so cold.

407
00:51:10,195 --> 00:51:11,237
You're cold?

408
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:14,153
Freezing cold?

409
00:51:16,487 --> 00:51:17,320
Hang in there.

410
00:51:18,945 --> 00:51:22,903
If you do, you'll get really pretty.

411
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,570
Did you see Hyo-jeong's skin?

412
00:51:45,737 --> 00:51:48,195
Did she get some hydro injection
from somewhere or what?

413
00:51:49,070 --> 00:51:50,195
Her face was glowing.

414
00:51:50,278 --> 00:51:53,320
How can you say that now
when somebody's hurt?

415
00:51:54,362 --> 00:51:56,445
That's just that.

416
00:51:58,028 --> 00:52:00,320
I'm sure she did something.

417
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:04,070
Didn't you know?

418
00:52:05,237 --> 00:52:07,862
Actually, she's getting
some private treatment.

419
00:52:08,695 --> 00:52:10,737
Skin repair for VVIPs.

420
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:13,778
She was late today
because of that, she said.

421
00:52:13,862 --> 00:52:15,903
You really didn't know?

422
00:52:17,153 --> 00:52:21,653
Don't you think
we should go check on Ji-won?

423
00:52:21,737 --> 00:52:24,695
Why were you late today?

424
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:30,945
Well…

425
00:52:32,195 --> 00:52:34,445
I had some issues.

426
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:39,320
Didn't the director give you
some special treatment?

427
00:52:39,987 --> 00:52:40,903
Pardon?

428
00:52:40,987 --> 00:52:42,903
I mean, look.

429
00:52:42,987 --> 00:52:46,778
If you spend time with her,
a newb becomes a yoga master,

430
00:52:46,862 --> 00:52:49,903
or your skin turns super fair
in just one day.

431
00:52:57,487 --> 00:52:58,987
Gosh, were you surprised?

432
00:52:59,945 --> 00:53:03,487
I haven't told you anything so far
since this was too personal.

433
00:53:04,987 --> 00:53:09,278
Ji-won is suffering
from dystonia on her muscle.

434
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:13,653
We've just found a painkiller
with drug substance from her bag.

435
00:53:13,737 --> 00:53:18,278
Then, how is Ji-won's condition now?

436
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:21,528
It's not really a cause for concern.

437
00:53:22,528 --> 00:53:25,570
But let's wrap up today's lesson for now.

438
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:41,778
In 1962, it was designated
as National Monument No. 98,

439
00:53:41,862 --> 00:53:44,903
and its name Sagul means a snake cave.

440
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:47,487
They used to sacrifice virgins

441
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,320
to the giant snake
in Gimnyeong-Sagul Cave.

442
00:53:53,445 --> 00:53:56,528
A yoga studio next to the snake cave.

443
00:54:02,528 --> 00:54:05,028
I think her condition's getting worse.

444
00:54:07,403 --> 00:54:09,820
And she seems to be losing her mind.

445
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:15,320
Should I give her a stronger drug, huh?

446
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:20,945
I've put her apart
from the other trainees,

447
00:54:23,112 --> 00:54:24,862
but I don't think she'll last long.

448
00:54:40,195 --> 00:54:42,528
Let her live a few days with a strong one.

449
00:54:45,112 --> 00:54:49,653
She must naturally die somewhere else.

450
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:53,112
There are seas everywhere.

451
00:55:18,195 --> 00:55:22,237
I said, it won't take long.

452
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,862
She's meditating now.
I'll tell her later on.

453
00:55:25,945 --> 00:55:27,612
I'm Jeong Ye-na.

454
00:55:28,237 --> 00:55:30,070
-I wanna see her--
-Please calm down first.

455
00:55:31,487 --> 00:55:35,028
Hey, how dare you put your hand on me!

456
00:55:35,112 --> 00:55:36,112
What's going on?

457
00:55:45,195 --> 00:55:51,528
I wanna talk to you but he says I can't.

458
00:55:52,903 --> 00:55:54,862
Don't you know she's our VVIP?

459
00:55:58,278 --> 00:56:00,028
-I apologize.
-Leave us.

460
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:01,695
Yes.

461
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:09,987
What brings you here?

462
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,528
It's about Hyo-jeong.

463
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,695
I saw you two yesterday.

464
00:56:14,778 --> 00:56:19,778
Suddenly, her skin got so much fairer.

465
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:23,862
You know what I'm talking about.

466
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:29,903
Of course, I do.
You're our precious guest.

467
00:56:30,445 --> 00:56:32,153
We've already prepared it for you.

468
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,028
Come to the training room at midnight.

469
00:56:35,612 --> 00:56:38,403
A special treatment
will be waiting for you.

470
00:56:39,820 --> 00:56:41,153
There's such a thing?

471
00:56:44,112 --> 00:56:48,737
But it has to be our own little secret.

472
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:24,070
Ye-na!

473
00:59:26,278 --> 00:59:28,570
Ye-na!

474
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:31,570
Are you okay? Ye-na!

475
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:43,112
-I'll bring some help.
-No!

476
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:39,028
You don't need to wake them up.

477
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:41,987
I don't wanna make a fuss.

478
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:45,653
I just fell asleep while meditating.

479
01:00:46,153 --> 01:00:47,237
But, still…

480
01:00:53,362 --> 01:00:56,903
I'll be fine
if I drink water and get some rest.

481
01:01:03,445 --> 01:01:09,403
Please, don't tell anyone
what you saw today.

482
01:03:19,445 --> 01:03:24,612
When Joseon Dynasty was under Jeongjong,
a new judge named Seo-ryun

483
01:03:24,695 --> 01:03:27,278
was known to have killed a huge snake
at Gimnyeong-Sagul Cave.

484
01:03:28,195 --> 01:03:32,945
Then, a shaman told him
not to look back and run into the castle,

485
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,695
but suddenly, blood rain began to pour.

486
01:03:36,570 --> 01:03:38,528
So he carelessly looked back…

487
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:40,445
And turned into a salt pillar?

488
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:43,195
That one is from the Bible.

489
01:03:44,653 --> 01:03:48,445
Anyway, that snake's blood
soared up high and fell everywhere.

490
01:03:48,945 --> 01:03:52,070
So, what happened to that judge?

491
01:03:52,153 --> 01:03:53,028
He died.

492
01:03:58,070 --> 01:04:00,403
THE MONUMENT TO THE MARTYR XU GONG

493
01:04:01,862 --> 01:04:05,070
I've got something to say.

494
01:04:06,487 --> 01:04:10,195
I've been thinking, but on that day…

495
01:04:13,945 --> 01:04:17,195
Sorry to bother you,
but I need your approval for this.

496
01:04:52,153 --> 01:04:53,445
On that day,

497
01:04:54,737 --> 01:04:55,570
what?

498
01:04:55,653 --> 01:04:57,362
No, nothing.

499
01:04:57,445 --> 01:04:59,987
I was just too sensitive. I'm sorry.

500
01:05:08,737 --> 01:05:11,903
Something's not right here.

501
01:05:14,612 --> 01:05:18,695
I'm sure this place's cursed.

502
01:05:23,278 --> 01:05:24,987
What do you mean by that?

503
01:05:25,653 --> 01:05:30,278
Ever since that day, I see a snake.

504
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:32,403
A snake?

505
01:05:32,987 --> 01:05:35,528
A big snake. I know it's unbelievable.

506
01:05:36,778 --> 01:05:39,237
But I'm not lying.

507
01:05:40,278 --> 01:05:41,695
We gotta get out of here.

508
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,987
Maybe Ji-won hasn't been around
because she's dead.

509
01:05:46,028 --> 01:05:48,487
Ye-na, calm down first.

510
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:50,778
I saw it! I did see it!

511
01:05:50,862 --> 01:05:55,070
You trust me, don't you?
You have to trust me.

512
01:05:55,153 --> 01:05:56,737
I'm not lying.

513
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:59,403
I don't tell lies.

514
01:06:04,278 --> 01:06:07,820
I don't tell lies, unlike you-know-who.

515
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:31,487
You thief!

516
01:06:35,278 --> 01:06:38,195
It's mine. I bought it with my own money.

517
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:42,487
Choi Ga-yeong, you filthy bitch.

518
01:06:44,237 --> 01:06:48,945
My dad bought me this
for my birthday from a luxury store.

519
01:06:50,028 --> 01:06:52,820
Don't you try to bullshit me,
you little thief.

520
01:06:53,695 --> 01:06:55,028
It's true.

521
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,695
Believe me, please?

522
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:01,737
Stop it, bitch. You wanna die?

523
01:07:02,445 --> 01:07:06,028
Give it back. And I don't tell lies.

524
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:10,153
This goddamn bitch is pissing me off.

525
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:21,695
No!

526
01:07:22,403 --> 01:07:24,070
Bullshit, you nuts.

527
01:08:33,195 --> 01:08:34,570
It's all because of you.

528
01:09:42,695 --> 01:09:43,612
Who is it?

529
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,237
Mi-yeon, I'm Ji-won.

530
01:09:56,987 --> 01:10:00,528
Ji-won, are you okay? Come on in.

531
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:08,445
What's wrong?

532
01:10:10,237 --> 01:10:13,278
Gosh, you're burning up.
Let's go see a doctor now.

533
01:10:13,362 --> 01:10:16,987
No! Let's just stay here.

534
01:10:18,153 --> 01:10:21,945
I'm scared. That snake will come again.

535
01:10:22,612 --> 01:10:23,445
Snake?

536
01:10:24,862 --> 01:10:27,112
There's no snake in here.

537
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:29,528
You should lie down first.

538
01:10:36,862 --> 01:10:39,237
I'm so cold.

539
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:41,903
Okay, hold on.

540
01:11:14,362 --> 01:11:16,695
No, I don't wanna do this yoga anymore.

541
01:15:19,737 --> 01:15:21,862
What took you so long? We were waiting.

542
01:15:42,278 --> 01:15:45,987
Where are the others?

543
01:15:46,612 --> 01:15:50,528
Their bodies have
already reached Kundalini.

544
01:15:58,903 --> 01:15:59,903
Hyo-jeong,

545
01:16:02,487 --> 01:16:05,653
now you can get
everything that you want.

546
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:09,820
What was it that I really wanted?

547
01:16:11,403 --> 01:16:12,778
The ultimate beauty.

548
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,112
That's what you wanted.

549
01:16:16,612 --> 01:16:20,653
Why would I have wanted that?

550
01:16:21,362 --> 01:16:23,153
You don't need to worry at all.

551
01:16:25,445 --> 01:16:28,112
Kundalini will give you
answers to all your questions,

552
01:16:28,778 --> 01:16:30,987
and true beauty.

553
01:16:41,987 --> 01:16:44,737
I know you killed her, Ga-yeong.

554
01:18:26,403 --> 01:18:27,820
How are you today?

555
01:18:36,403 --> 01:18:37,320
Detective.

556
01:18:42,153 --> 01:18:43,487
Did you capture

557
01:18:46,362 --> 01:18:48,362
the yoga trainer that I told you about?

558
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:55,570
Well, I'd rather say
we found her than captured.

559
01:18:55,653 --> 01:19:01,070
And Secretary Choi
who was killed with a knife on your bed.

560
01:19:01,862 --> 01:19:06,320
And that female staff
who was stabbed to death in the kitchen.

561
01:19:07,570 --> 01:19:10,737
How many times have I told you
I didn't kill them?

562
01:19:14,528 --> 01:19:15,403
This is all

563
01:19:17,487 --> 01:19:20,570
that woman and Ga-yeong's doing.

564
01:19:27,403 --> 01:19:30,195
You said she was Choi Ga-yeong, right?

565
01:19:31,862 --> 01:19:32,820
Right.

566
01:19:36,528 --> 01:19:37,945
Once you capture her,

567
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:41,945
the truth will come out.

568
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:47,695
According to our investigation,
her name is Park Seo-hui, aged 27.

569
01:19:47,778 --> 01:19:51,487
Nothing but her job, a model,
matches your description.

570
01:19:54,112 --> 01:19:55,362
I said no.

571
01:19:57,612 --> 01:20:01,445
This one is Ga-yeong,
from Dong-soong Girl's High School!

572
01:20:02,153 --> 01:20:06,737
Isn't this woman Choi Ga-yeong
from Dong-soong High School?

573
01:20:19,403 --> 01:20:20,237
No.

574
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:26,278
I've never seen her before.

575
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,612
She's the real Choi Ga-yeong.

576
01:20:43,862 --> 01:20:44,987
No way!

577
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:48,570
She's not Choi Ga-yeong!

578
01:20:49,737 --> 01:20:54,070
This real Ga-yeong has never
met you after graduation.

579
01:20:54,153 --> 01:20:58,320
Model Park Seo-hui said
she saw you at the photo studio.

580
01:20:58,403 --> 01:20:59,903
She took your commercial.

581
01:21:02,487 --> 01:21:09,237
It was her
who told me about that yoga studio.

582
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:12,403
That's Jeong Bo-ra from your high school!

583
01:21:13,528 --> 01:21:17,195
She's in the same situation as you.

584
01:21:17,778 --> 01:21:20,695
There was a record of her meeting you,

585
01:21:20,778 --> 01:21:22,820
right before her arrest
for murdering neighbors.

586
01:21:23,445 --> 01:21:28,445
She said she told you
about that yoga studio at that time.

587
01:21:34,362 --> 01:21:35,903
It can't be.

588
01:21:38,778 --> 01:21:42,570
It's your skin clinic
treatment record, right?

589
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:47,278
You've been getting
the illegal procedures with amphetamine.

590
01:21:47,362 --> 01:21:49,528
<i>And sleeping pills, consistently.</i>

591
01:21:50,320 --> 01:21:53,362
The expert said
if these two substances mix up,

592
01:21:53,445 --> 01:21:57,445
it's highly likely to see or hear things.

593
01:21:57,528 --> 01:22:00,987
<i>Your brain, all messed up with drug,</i>

594
01:22:01,070 --> 01:22:06,987
has turned this Model Seo-hui
into a virtual girl Ga-yeong.

595
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:16,778
Then what about Kali, that yoga studio?

596
01:22:17,653 --> 01:22:22,237
Kali began to get famous
for making girls pretty and slimmer,

597
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:27,362
and people like you paid
an arm and a leg for their lessons.

598
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,487
You've lost weight so fast,

599
01:22:31,570 --> 01:22:33,487
<i>but that was because</i>
<i>you've been constantly</i>

600
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:35,820
<i>having tea containing drug substances.</i>

601
01:22:36,403 --> 01:22:39,903
<i>So, the trainees got to see</i>
<i>and hear things.</i>

602
01:22:39,987 --> 01:22:43,820
<i>And they've been covering it up,</i>
<i>calling it Kundalini.</i>

603
01:22:44,403 --> 01:22:47,237
<i>They brewed tea from monkshood flower root</i>

604
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:49,278
<i>to prevent such side effects.</i>

605
01:22:49,862 --> 01:22:54,445
There's a saying
that the root eases brain diseases,

606
01:22:54,528 --> 01:22:57,362
but its poison is so deadly

607
01:22:57,445 --> 01:23:00,945
that it was used during the Joseon Dynasty
as poison for killing in the court.

608
01:23:01,695 --> 01:23:05,195
<i>Kim Ji-won has been killed</i>
<i>by that very poison.</i>

609
01:23:14,528 --> 01:23:19,362
So you mean, my own hallucination…

610
01:23:21,487 --> 01:23:23,362
has created delusions?

611
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:27,528
You know there was a male staff,
Secretary Choi.

612
01:23:28,153 --> 01:23:31,778
<i>This man you killed was</i>
<i>the yoga trainer's lover,</i>

613
01:23:31,862 --> 01:23:34,320
<i>and the other one was her husband.</i>

614
01:23:34,945 --> 01:23:39,278
<i>The husband arrested there</i>
<i>confessed it all.</i>

615
01:23:40,612 --> 01:23:43,237
Do you expect me to believe all of this?

616
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,612
Can you believe it if it was you?

617
01:24:20,112 --> 01:24:21,737
It can't be true.

618
01:24:28,862 --> 01:24:31,903
There was someone trying to kill me.

619
01:24:33,820 --> 01:24:36,737
It's true, it was self-defense.

620
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:40,362
There really was someone.

621
01:24:40,445 --> 01:24:44,570
That someone was trying to kill me.

622
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:52,945
How is she?

623
01:24:54,695 --> 01:24:57,403
She can't remember what she did at all.

624
01:24:59,070 --> 01:25:00,945
I don't think she's acting.

625
01:27:14,278 --> 01:27:16,362
Miss Lee Hyo-jeong! Calm down!

626
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:20,403
Calm down! Nurse!

627
01:27:21,362 --> 01:27:24,070
-What's happening?
-She suddenly had a convulsion.

628
01:27:24,153 --> 01:27:26,153
My wrist hurts!

629
01:27:26,237 --> 01:27:29,320
-It's urgent.
-Please take it off!

630
01:27:29,403 --> 01:27:31,695
My wrist hurts so much, please.

631
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:34,403
My wrist hurts so much.

632
01:27:46,945 --> 01:27:48,278
What's going on?

633
01:27:49,695 --> 01:27:50,903
Give me some gauze.

634
01:28:21,653 --> 01:28:23,570
How's the office these days?

635
01:28:24,237 --> 01:28:26,903
Well, it's all the same.

636
01:28:28,112 --> 01:28:30,403
Chief's worried sick about you.

637
01:28:31,570 --> 01:28:35,737
How can he not even call me once
if he's so worried about me?

638
01:28:38,653 --> 01:28:41,695
It's because we're all busy
looking for that last trainee

639
01:28:41,778 --> 01:28:43,862
of the yoga studio, okay?

640
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:47,737
By the way, when does your suspension end?

641
01:28:48,903 --> 01:28:53,362
Don't ask, you bastard.
I still gotta wait so damn long.

642
01:28:55,487 --> 01:28:58,570
Anyway, where do you think
the last trainee might be?

643
01:28:59,528 --> 01:29:03,653
How would I even know? I'm not a psychic.

644
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:21,237
What?

645
01:29:22,487 --> 01:29:24,278
You can just enjoy it, too.

646
01:30:03,403 --> 01:30:07,320
Kundallini.
