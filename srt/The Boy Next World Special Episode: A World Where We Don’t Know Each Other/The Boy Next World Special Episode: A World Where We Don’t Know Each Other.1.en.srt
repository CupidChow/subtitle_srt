1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,480
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,240
I’ve finally found you, Phu.

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,040
If he doesn’t know me
in this world, I’ll start over.

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,840
I love you, Phu.

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,520
From now on, I’ll be the one
to play the flute for you.

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,680
Are we officially a couple now?

7
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,720
If this doesn’t make us
official, I’ll be mad.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,200
Who are you?

9
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,040
The one who’s been with you for four years

10
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,640
the one you said you wanted
to protect, isn’t this Phukan.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,480
Please tell the person I love that
'I love you, P' Cir.'

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,000
I really love you.

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,520
Another fucking dream?

14
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,840
I keep having nonsense dreams these days.

15
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,000
Get well soon :)

16
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Don’t!

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,920
Is he a cat or something?
What’s he hiding for?

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,320
Are you gonna come out?

19
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,880
Then I'll throw these away.

20
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,240
If you wanna see me,
come out and talk properly.

21
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,320
What a fucking annoying brat.

22
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,600
P’ Cir took the snacks today.

23
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,440
I’m so happy.

24
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,280
That alone makes my day.

25
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,960
Once we notice something…

26
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,520
I've reviewed the project you sent me.
Revise it based on my comments.

27
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,240
I think it's fine as it is, professor.

28
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,080
You haven't changed since your first year.

29
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,640
Listen to others for once, Rames.

30
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,840
Just revise it.

31
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,480
Ai Phu, you off in la-la land?

32
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,920
Achi, he’s noticed me.
And I got to talk to him too.

33
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:51,600
Phu, just because you hide in the corner
doesn't mean you talk to him.

34
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:54,920
And just because you walk him
to his car, his faculty, or his room

35
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,120
doesn't mean he knows you.

36
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,120
Yeah, just because he walks past you
doesn't mean he likes you.

37
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,120
But I really talked to him,
and he remembers my name too.

38
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,000
Man, this is bad.
Should we take him to the doctor?

39
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
Will the university infirmary treat him?

40
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,720
Phu, I know you've had
a secret crush on P' Cir for years.

41
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,320
You’ve like him since high school,
and you even followed him here.

42
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,320
But we've known you
for almost two years now.

43
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,560
You’re too shy to talk to him, make
eye contact, or even look at his face.

44
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,440
So when could you have talked to him?

45
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,360
In your dreams?

46
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
I'm not lying.

47
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:41,080
Sure, you're not lying at all.
I believe you. Really.

48
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,600
You don’t sound like you believe me.

49
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,440
I would've believed you

50
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,200
if it weren’t for that one brave
thing you did that we all saw.

51
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,320
Damn, I still remember it.

52
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,520
“The Legend of the Great Thief, Sisira.”

53
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,880
Whoo!

54
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,560
I’m not a thief.

55
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,600
But you stole something,
and it was university property.

56
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,600
COME JOIN US AT THE STUDENT UNION

57
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,440
Damn, that was fucking hilarious.

58
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,360
He ran like a dog.

59
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,280
I didn’t mean to steal.

60
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,240
Then return it.

61
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,240
How’s he gonna return it?

62
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,720
He’s probably kept it as
his family heirloom by now.

63
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,600
Hey, Ai Phu.
How could you like P' Cir?

64
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,720
I admit he’s handsome,
but he’s foul-mouthed as hell.

65
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,600
Everyone says he's handsome,
but only when he shuts up.

66
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,960
How could you like such a foul-mouthed guy?

67
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,160
So here’s the thing…

68
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Back in high school, I dropped a paper cup,
and it fell to P' Cir’s classroom below.

69
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,280
So I went to retrieve it and overheard
him talking on the phone with his dad.

70
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,920
P' Cir wasn't foul-mouthed at all.

71
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,240
He was very serious and
gentle when he told his dad

72
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,240
he’d take care of both
his little brother and him.

73
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,680
His parents got divorced.

74
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,960
P' Cir lives with his mom,
and his brother with his dad.

75
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,800
Not only did he tell his dad
he’d take care of his brother and him

76
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,080
but he also said...

77
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,960
‘Dad, it's me, Cirrus.’

78
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,760
‘I can take care of myself, and
I’ll take care of you and Ozone too.’

79
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,040
‘Wait for me, Dad.’

80
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,560
He was so cool!

81
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,640
Like… super cool!

82
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,920
And when his friend, P' Wim, had a cast on

83
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,520
even though P’ Cir called him a burden,
he still helped him carry his stuff.

84
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,080
Seriously, how can he be so cute?

85
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,760
His voice is attractive too. I like it!

86
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Oh guys! I gotta go.

87
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,720
P' Cir’s probably done with class.

88
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,160
I’ll go check if he’s really sick.

89
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
Later!

90
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,120
Bye-bye.

91
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,640
Phukan’s usually timid.

92
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,320
But why is he so talkative
when it comes to P’ Cir?

93
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,280
He’s gonna end up in the loony bin
with how head-over-heels he is.

94
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,080
Being head-over-heels is one thing.

95
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,720
But I doubt P' Cir has really noticed him.

96
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,640
The prof. let us out so late.

97
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,960
- True, I’m fucking starving.
- Yeah. He said he’d let us out on time.

98
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,880
Why save a spot when
there are tons of tables?

99
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,280
This is my favorite table.

100
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,680
Great spot, good lighting.

101
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,800
And most importantly, this is
where I look the most handsome.

102
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,280
- Handsome?
- Yeah.

103
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,600
Who says you’re handsome?
Fuck, you look like a foot with a face.

104
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,880
- Is being handsome gonna feed you?
- Well, no…

105
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,840
...no one asked for your opinion.

106
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,520
Just save your mouth for eating.
C’mon, I’m starving.

107
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,680
- What should we eat today?
- Let’s go to Auntie Daeng's place.

108
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,360
You’re Auntie Daeng's son or what?

109
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
From your fan again?

110
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,760
I really gotta hand it to them.

111
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
How do they put up with
your sharp-ass tongue?

112
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,920
Damn, they left a note this time.

113
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,400
“Enjoy the drink!”

114
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,720
Tell your fan to not
forget about your friend.

115
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,360
Gimme, I’ll drink it. I know you
don’t touch stuff people give—

116
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,320
Who the hell are you?!
You’re not my friend!

117
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,840
My friend doesn’t touch stuff
people give him. Who are you?

118
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,120
Today I feel like… having it.

119
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,520
You’re acting weird.

120
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,080
Or should I throw it away?

121
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Or should I keep it?

122
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,640
Here, I’ll let you have it.

123
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,040
- Or not.
- You asshole!

124
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,800
Why are you so
indecisive over just a drink?

125
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:32,600
If my fish were here,
you know what it would say?

126
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
What?

127
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,080
Glub-glub, why the fluff
aren’t you drinking it?

128
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,480
Gimme if you’re not drinking it.

129
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,480
Fuck you, it’s mine.
I’m drinking it.

130
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Bastard.

131
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,800
It’s for me, so I’m drinking it.

132
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,400
Hey, hey, hey, that’s mine.

133
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,000
Ai Jin, over here!

134
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,320
How’s P' Cir doing?
Is he fully recovered?

135
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,400
Why don't you ask him yourself?
I think he wanted to talk to you today.

136
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,120
No way. No.

137
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Can’t do that.

138
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,560
Why?

139
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,680
Well... I’m too shy.

140
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,760
Are you gonna keep being like this, Ai Phu?

141
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,880
What do you mean by ‘keep being like this’?

142
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,520
You asked me to join the student
union to keep track of P’ Cir.

143
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,720
And now P’ Wim knows you like him.

144
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,720
When P' Wim offered
to help, you refused him.

145
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,840
You keep insisting that watching P' Cir
from a distance is enough for you.

146
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
Is it really enough, Phu?

147
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,040
I still remember when you
found out that P' Cir was sick.

148
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,440
You were losing it, like you were
about to get sick instead of him.

149
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,560
You know, if you wanna know
about him, just get close to him.

150
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,880
I... don’t have the guts.

151
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:50,560
I’m fine with just watching
him from a distance.

152
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,920
P’ Wim’s here.

153
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
Phu, I’ve got good news for you.

154
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,880
Good news… What good news?

155
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,280
Ai Cir asked me if I knew
someone named Phukan.

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,320
Huh? Me?!

157
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,880
Your years of effort are paying off now.

158
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,120
P’ Wim, what should I do?

159
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,720
Happy, aren’t you?

160
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:28,320
P’ Wim, this means I can’t
follow P’ Cir around anymore.

161
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,840
He must think I’m a stalker who
follows him like a creepy weirdo.

162
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,760
But I never took his
used coffee cups or straws—

163
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,200
Wait, wait, wait. Calm down.

164
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,480
What do I do?

165
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,160
What do I do? What do I do? What do I do?

166
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,720
Don’t you have something to tell him?

167
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,720
That’s right! Phu.

168
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Yes?

169
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,320
You know our student union goes on
a volunteer camp this time of year, right?

170
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,360
I’ve heard about it.

171
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,840
Ai Cir has agreed to go this year.
You’re going too, right?

172
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,080
This is your chance, Ai Phu.

173
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,000
I’m going on a camp with P' Cir.

174
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,120
COME JOIN US AT THE STUDENT UNION

175
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,520
If I’d been bold enough
to talk to you that day

176
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,760
how would things be now?

177
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,400
You’d probably still not know me.

178
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,520
What if I told you…
that I liked you since high school?

179
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,280
Would you believe me?

180
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,000
I like you, P’ Cir.

181
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
I like you so much.

182
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,280
I like you so, so, so, so, so much.

183
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,160
Hey, don’t make that face.
I’ve never forced you to do anything.

184
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,440
Remember that goddamn poster?

185
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,920
C’mon, it’s just two favors.

186
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,600
What’s going on?

187
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,960
Asshole, am I that gross to you?

188
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,480
Were you talking about the poster?

189
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,440
Man, it’s still funny
when I think about it.

190
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,080
What were you thinking
putting a dog on a poster?

191
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,520
Was it worth getting
chewed out by him for two days?

192
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,440
Fuck, being a dog is better than
being a foot with a face like you.

193
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
- I’m a foot with a face?
- Yeah!

194
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,040
So tell me, where's the big toe at?

195
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,600
- Here.
- This is the big toe?

196
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,800
- That’s cubicle.
- Fuck you.

197
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,520
It’s called cuticle, idiot.

198
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,640
The fuck are you doing?
Did you just fart?

199
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,560
I didn’t fart, jackass.
Get on the bus now.

200
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,600
I’m a jackass?

201
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,040
If I’m a jackass, then
I guess you’re Moo Deng?

202
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,680
- Moo Deng my ass!
- Don’t touch me!

203
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,720
Don’t touch me!

204
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,400
Out of the way, out of the way.

205
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,600
- Dude, hold on! Let’s have a chat.
- You shitting me? Everyone’s on the bus.

206
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,640
Er… well…

207
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
You sit here, Phu.

208
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,920
You know, if you get on last,
you’ll stand out more.

209
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,040
Stand out my ass!
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

210
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,000
Hey, aren’t you sitting with me?

211
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,800
I’ll sit with P' Wim. I’ve got
something to discuss with him.

212
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,720
Then who am I gonna sit with?

213
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,000
You’ll have company soon enough.

214
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,360
The fuck’s wrong with you?
Quit jerking. You’ve got a seizure or what?

215
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Can we get on now?

216
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,400
- Still at it?
- Okay, fine! Let’s get on.

217
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
It’s the only seat left.

218
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,800
Are you nuts?

219
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,560
I like sitting like this.

220
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Please ignore me.

221
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,560
Besides, it’s cold.

222
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,600
It’s hot as hell. How can you be cold?

223
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,280
It’s cold. Please don’t mind me.

224
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,680
What if I do?

225
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,520
Why did you run away from me that day?

226
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,320
I didn’t run away.

227
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,760
But you ran like you’d seen a ghost.

228
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:35,520
If you wanna know if I’m better yet,
just ask. That’s what mouths are for.

229
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,960
I don’t like talking by myself.

230
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
You’re gonna die sitting like that.

231
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,360
Just ignore me. I’m a turtle.

232
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,680
Come out now. I’m gonna sleep.

233
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,320
"Baan Rai Por Piang Camping"

234
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,760
Alright, everyone!

235
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,600
Welcome to the Watershed Forest
Development Volunteer Camp of 2025!

236
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,160
I bet you’re all excited.

237
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,760
Hey! What are you waiting for? Applause.

238
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
That’s enough.

239
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,320
And Today, I’ve got good news for you.

240
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Here we go again.

241
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,160
It’s always a disaster
when he announces good news.

242
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,560
Bastard, don’t interrupt. Listen first.

243
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
Alright, everyone.

244
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,960
You won’t have a place
to sleep tonight! Applause!

245
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,560
But hold on!

246
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:53,120
Since we’re at a volunteer camp,
we might as well get adventurous, right?

247
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:02,040
So, everyone here gets to take in
the fresh scent of dirt and grass by…

248
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
sleeping in a tent!

249
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,640
P’ Wim, P’ Wim, can I say something?

250
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,200
What’s the meaning of this?
This isn’t what we agreed on.

251
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,560
Well, it wouldn’t be
a surprise if I told you.

252
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,840
Ah!

253
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,480
Don’t you worry because every tent
comes with a full set of bedding.

254
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,400
What kind of tents are we getting?

255
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,880
Ah! I was just about to get to that.

256
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,680
We’ll be pairing up
to play a Route Check game.

257
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,720
The first pair to find all three numbers
will win a big prize, which is…

258
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,720
The. Biggest. Tent.

259
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,280
So you can sleep comfortably without
having to squeeze in with anyone.

260
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,280
However, those who finish last
will get just tiny sleeping bags.

261
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,360
- P’ Wim. P' Wim.
- I thought this was a fun trip.

262
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,840
P’ Wim, how are we going to pair up?

263
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,920
Ah! I was just about to tell you
that I’ve already taken care of it.

264
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,400
How so?

265
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,800
Whoever you sat with
on the bus this morning…

266
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,360
that's your partner.

267
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:09,760
What?!

268
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,640
Ai Wim. Ai… Ai Wim. Ai Wim.

269
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
I sat alone.

270
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,480
You're such a hassle.

271
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,040
You sat alone,
so you’re sleeping alone.

272
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,640
Stop making a big deal.

273
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:27,040
Jeez, asshole. Easy for you
to say, you've got a partner.

274
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,800
But I like your idea. Works for me.

275
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,000
Well? What are you waiting for?
Get up and pair up!

276
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,840
P’ Wim.

277
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:53,640
It’s settled then.

278
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,760
Let’s draw the first clue now.

279
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,640
And most importantly, don’t forget
that the first place gets the biggest tent.

280
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:06,880
Those in last place
will only get sleeping bags.

281
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,720
And don’t come complaining to me, alright?

282
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:14,040
Because our pavilion is ready
to welcome everyone to sleep in.

283
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,160
P’ Wim.

284
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,680
Please change the rules.
Pretty please.

285
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
No.

286
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,640
P’ Wim.

287
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,560
Don’t ‘P’ Wim’ me.

288
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,520
Why are you still here?

289
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,040
If you lose, you'll be sleeping
all cramped up in the pavilion.

290
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,880
You want Ai Cir to have a hard time?

291
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
That won’t do.

292
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,360
I know, right? Therefore...

293
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,280
focus on the game.

294
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,960
This is your chance, Ai Phu.

295
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,320
What do you mean?

296
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,880
It’s your chance to show him
that you can be reliable too.

297
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,280
Who knows, you might go from being
a stranger to becoming his close junior.

298
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,160
Just like me and P' Wim.

299
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,160
Really? Will he really see me that way?

300
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,200
Yeah, trust me.

301
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,640
So this is where you’ve been hiding.
What’s taking you so long?

302
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:57,400
Let’s get moving.
Let’s finish these assholes’ bullshit game.

303
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,720
Hey! I’m not an asshole.

304
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,480
It wasn’t me.

305
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,720
Wait till I’m done with this game.
Brace yourself, you son of a bitch.

306
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Come.

307
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,840
Do I have to play the game too?

308
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,440
Why don’t you just read my mind?

309
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,520
I want to hear it from your mouth.

310
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,560
Though I can read just your mind,
I still want to hear it directly from you.

311
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,360
Then why would you play the game?
You'll be sleeping with me.

312
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Will people think I’m using connections?

313
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,520
Well, as the SU president’s boyfriend,
you’re entitled to some privileges.

314
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,480
I’m sleeping in the cabin…
and you’ll be sleeping with me.

315
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,640
Why sleep uncomfortably in a tent, right?

316
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,520
“Find the guardian angel under the
big tree. Head toward 3:32 o'clock.”
What kind of fucking clue is this?

317
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:13,280
When the game’s over,
you're dead meat, Ai Wim.

318
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,680
Burden.

319
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,080
I’m sorry.

320
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,240
You’d better keep up.

321
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Alright, Ai Phu.

322
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,440
Don’t be a burden.

323
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
You've got this!

324
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,200
P’ Cir, the guardian angel.

325
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:59,400
Oh, so dumb! The sleeping
bag’s gonna be yours.

326
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,000
P’ Cir, I’ll go check it.

327
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,880
Found it.

328
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:27,360
Damn! You kicked like a bull!

329
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,080
Hey, I found it!

330
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,640
Hey! What the fuck?
You want a piece of me!?

331
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,040
I mean, you can have that piece of paper.

332
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,120
Thanks for finding it.

333
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,960
Just one more left,
and this damn game’s finally over.

334
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:55,560
It’s your chance to show him
that you can be reliable too.

335
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,800
Who knows, you might go from being
a stranger to becoming his close junior.

336
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,680
You've found two numbers,
I'll take care of the last one.

337
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,120
You should take a break.
I'll… I’ll be back soon.

338
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:24,360
“In the deep forest, the little bird
has stolen something precious.”

339
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,400
“Look lower than before,
for the little bird waits not far away.”

340
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,480
It’s gotta be around here.
‘The forest’ means it’s in the forest.

341
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,080
And I’ve followed the bird sounds.

342
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,640
It’s gotta be one of these branches.

343
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,040
I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to trespass!

344
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,440
I’ll make an offering for you.
Please don’t haunt me.

345
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,920
What offering? I’m not dead yet.

346
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
P’ Cir.

347
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,160
I knew it, I can't count on you.

348
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,800
So... what are you doing here?

349
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,200
I’ve been following you all along.

350
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:41,920
Then you suddenly
started running, so I ran too.

351
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
I thought you were a…

352
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,360
- a...
- Ghost?

353
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:53,840
You’re not supposed to call out
to the tiger in the forest.

354
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,880
I didn’t call the tiger. I called…

355
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,520
P’ Cir, no. Don’t say it.

356
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Don’t say it.

357
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,080
I said…

358
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,480
Hey!

359
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
I found it!

360
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,720
I’m not a burden to you anymore.

361
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,840
You won’t have to sleep in the pavilion.

362
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,160
This is it! The last number!

363
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,960
I got up too quickly.

364
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,360
Ouch!

365
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,040
What a burden.

366
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,440
Get on.

367
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,240
No way, I can’t do that.

368
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,000
Are you getting on,
or should I make you?

369
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,040
No, I can’t do that.

370
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,640
You’re just gonna stay here
and let the ghost drag you away?

371
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
C’ mon.

372
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,760
I’m sorry.

373
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,920
So you know you're wrong?

374
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,840
Yes, well…

375
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,560
I’m… a burden.

376
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,360
I couldn’t help you at all.

377
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,600
And now you’re stuck carrying me.

378
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,480
I’m sorry.

379
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:55,160
That’s true.

380
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,400
But I think I said one thing wrong.

381
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,240
I’m useless, right?

382
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,720
I know.

383
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,920
You’re not a burden like I thought.

384
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,040
Well done for finding it.

385
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,680
How did you end up like this?

386
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
I fell.

387
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,400
No. I mean, how did you
make Ai Cir carry you back?

388
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,360
Well… I fell, and P' Cir was
nice enough to carry me back.

389
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,000
That's exactly what I wanna know.

390
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,760
Someone like Ai Cir actually went that far?

391
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,040
But when your leg was broken,
he still helped carry your stuff.

392
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,960
That was ages ago.

393
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,080
It doesn’t matter. P' Cir has
always been a good person.

394
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,440
You’re probably the only one
who sees him that way.

395
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,480
When you’re done being nosy,
come help me so you can finally shut up.

396
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,960
What the hell? It’s not my job.

397
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,240
I’m the vice president.
This isn’t my job either.

398
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:53,600
Jeez, you’re just
the vice president in name.

399
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:57,320
Now that I think
about it, I’m still pissed.

400
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,520
I only asked you to model for
the poster, but you gave me an earful.

401
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,240
What do you even do anyway?
You’re too lazy to even move your ass.

402
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,120
All you ever do is make that Jin kid
do everything for you, dumbass.

403
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,720
If you won’t help, I’m leaving.

404
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,880
C’mon, you’re just gonna leave?

405
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,920
Well, here’s a wake-up call.
I’ve got all the car keys.

406
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,680
I just need to call for a ride and
wait for two hours, then I can leave.

407
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,280
Fucking bastard.

408
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,680
Damn it.
How could he like this jerk?

409
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,080
- How do I do this?
- Let me do it.

410
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Help me hammer this in.

411
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Quit moping.

412
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,800
I just feel bad.

413
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,800
I couldn’t help with anything at all.

414
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,600
I didn’t do anything either.
Ai Wim and your friend did all of it.

415
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,080
I just want to be of some help.

416
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,200
You did help.

417
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,920
How?

418
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,560
You brought me the medicine.

419
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
Thanks.

420
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:54,600
Can you see my face clearly now?

421
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
Phukan.

422
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,680
What’s up?

423
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,680
Hmm.

424
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,080
What kind of response is that?

425
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,480
Ai Jin, what should I do?

426
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,080
I wanna hear your thoughts.

427
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,040
P’ Cir is so mean.

428
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,960
Didn’t you say he was nice?

429
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,360
He makes my heart flutter.

430
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,360
Weren’t you already feeling that way?

431
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,240
Now it’s even worse.

432
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,200
He was so mean to call me that.

433
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,760
Not only are you a thief,
but you’re a liar too?

434
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,920
You’re actually happy.

435
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,360
See?

436
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,920
Just seeing him already
makes you happy, Ai Phu.

437
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,160
We wanna hear you sing, P’ Cir.

438
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,880
That’s right, can you sing us a song?

439
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,400
Hey, this is your moment.

440
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,240
They’re practically begging.
You can’t let them down, you know.

441
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,760
Sing us a song, P’ Cir. Pretty please.

442
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,400
Hey, just one song. C’mon.

443
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:58,960
Sing it! Sing it! Sing it!

444
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,080
Will you guys shut up if I sing?

445
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,920
He’s handsome if he…

446
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,200
If he shuts up.

447
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,760
Fuck, he’s handsome when he shuts up.

448
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,000
The moment he talks,
it’s like a bunch of barking dogs.

449
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:16,960
Hey, hear that?

450
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,960
You’re handsome,
but your mouth’s full of dogs.

451
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,480
Should I take them out?

452
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,120
What song do you wanna hear?

453
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Me?

454
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,080
Tell me what song you wanna hear.

455
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,720
“You know who.”

456
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:02,960
That’s all.

457
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,520
If you wake up in the morning

458
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,560
And find a big bouquet of flowers

459
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,320
You have no idea who it belongs to

460
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,440
Don’t be surprised

461
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,760
Because it belongs to you

462
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,760
At night before bed

463
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,080
A number you don’t recognize

464
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,040
Sends you an 'I miss you' message

465
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,400
Written with such gentle words
(Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin)

466
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,280
Wishing you sweet dreams and an early night

467
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,760
No need to wonder if it was sent by mistake

468
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:13,320
Stop guessing and just accept it

469
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:18,040
Please don’t doubt
the sincerity behind this gesture

470
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,640
It’s from the same person,
you know who it is

471
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,480
The one who’s always
watched over you from afar

472
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,120
Do you remember?
That person still cares about you

473
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,680
You know who it is

474
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,600
What to do, Ai Phu?

475
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
What to do?

476
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,520
Ugh, what should I do?

477
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,040
What should I do?

478
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,400
You’ve been ignoring me today.

479
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,280
C’mon, don’t sulk.

480
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,000
But it’s true.

481
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,680
So...

482
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,480
What do you want me to do?

483
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,920
Don’t you know those two are together?

484
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,360
They’ve been together for a year now.

485
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,760
I had no idea.

486
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:56,680
You know now, so let’s go.

487
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,600
Why are you so shocked?

488
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,840
I didn’t think those two were...

489
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,160
Are you shocked because you
just found out they’re together, or…

490
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,320
because you saw them make out?

491
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,160
Er…

492
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,880
I’ve got something to ask you.

493
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:44,640
What is it?

494
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,280
If you wanna talk to me, look at me.

495
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,520
I... I can… I can talk to you like this.

496
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:57,960
Look up and face me.

497
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:06,880
Do you like me?

498
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,800
Don’t look away.

499
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:11,560
Look me in the eye.

500
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,520
Well?

501
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,320
Do you like me?

502
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,200
Yes.

503
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,240
What?

504
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
I didn’t catch that.

505
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,280
I like you.

506
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,760
I like you a lot, and…
and I’ve liked you for many years.

507
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,800

I don’t feel shy.

516
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,040
That’s right, we’ve been
together for months now.

517
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,680
How could I feel shy by your kiss
that I’d nearly have a heart attack?

518
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,960
Hold on, Phu.
What’s really going on with you?

519
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,720
P’ Cir, I think I dreamed
of myself in a parallel world.

520
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:51,000
P’ Cir, I dreamed of myself
and you in another world.

521
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,960
In the dream, you were harsh
with your words, but super kind.

522
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,560
Just like the one who took
over your body that time.

523
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,600
And I was super timid.

524
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:04,400
Oh, and they went to
a volunteer camp together.

525
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,120
It looked like the place we visited around
here because the view seemed familiar.

526
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:16,320
Perhaps it’s like you said,
that every world has similarities.

527
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:22,920
Perhaps, in another world,
we’re setting up a tent around here.

528
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,400
I’m not sure either.

529
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,280
Since I got hit by the car that day,
I haven't dreamed of the white room again.

530
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,760
So why did I have that dream?

531
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,160
Mabye I have powers to
travel between worlds like you?

532
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,120
I won't let you go.

533
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,240
So did he do anything to you?

534
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,600
What do you mean?

535
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:59,640
Did he touch you or…
do something more than that?

536
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,360
Are you jealous?

537
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,920
You’re jealous of someone
from another world?

538
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:10,800
What if I say I am?

539
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,880
Jeez, Mr. Jealous.

540
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,280
So are you going to tell me or not?

541
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,640
I’m telling you right now.

542
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:25,560
No, I mean, in that dream,
when you dreamed.

543
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:31,280
Did you dream as if you were there
and saw those two, or...

544
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:35,240
did you experience the dream
as if you were that Phukan?

545
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:47,040
What if I told you I actually
became that Phukan?

546
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,400
And what if I told you
the other P' Cir kissed me so rough?

547
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:59,080
And what if I told you my heart was
racing like crazy when he sang to me?

548
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,440
What would you say to that?

549
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,280
You’re angry?

550
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,040
Let’s make up.

551
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,800
Let’s make up.

552
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,680
Okay? Okay? Okay?

553
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,520
Please?

554
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,400
Can we make up?

555
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,120
Let’s make up, P’ Cir.

556
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,040
Punish me until you’re satisfied.

557
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,680
I don’t want to punish you.

558
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:10,080
I’d love to know, between Cirrus from
this world and the one from that world...

559
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,320
who’s rougher?

560
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,560
No more, P’ Cir.

561
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,200
My lips are all sore now.

562
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,040
You said you kissed someone else.

563
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:19,600
It was the other Phukan.
And that someone else was you.

564
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:22,440
But there’s only one of me in this world.

565
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,520
There’s only one Phukan in this world too.

566
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,360
That Phukan has that P' Cir.

567
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,560
And this Phukan has this P' Cir.

568
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,200
You said his kiss was rough.

569
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,160
I can be rough for you.

570
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:46,640
I want to go for a walk in the morning.
We're here on a trip after all.

571
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:48,640
And I’m already tired.

572
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:51,280
Please.

573
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,200
Fine, I’ll tell you.

574
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,680
I didn’t feel like I was being kissed.

575
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,320
It felt more like I was just
standing there watching them.

576
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,320
That Phukan seemed
really excited about P' Cir.

577
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,120
And he was kinda cute too.

578
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:19,080
I bet he freaked out
after they were done kissing.

579
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,720
- Are you sure?
- Yes, believe me.

580
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,040
C’mon.

581
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,400
Let’s turn in. I’m sleepy.

582
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,280
P’ Cir.

583
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:42,040
What do you think both of us
would be like in other worlds?

584
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:49,960
They’d probably be
as happy as I am right now.

585
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,760
Morning krub, Phu.

586
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:42,760
My guess was correct, right?

587
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:45,600
That’s my line.

588
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,360
I knew you were going
to say that, so I said it first.

589
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,760
Morning krub.

590
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,840
Morning krub, Phu.

591
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,560
Let’s get up.

592
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,880
Can I have two more minutes?

593
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,840
Please?

594
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:28,920
Can I?

595
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,720
I’ll give you five.

596
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:33,440
I want to go for a swim.

597
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,920
Didn’t you want to go for a walk?

598
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,320
I do, but I also want to swim.

599
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,880
What’s wrong?

600
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,160
I was just thinking about
the first day I met you.

601
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:58,240
I mean the first day we actually met.

602
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:04,560
I remember you being all wet,
standing in front of my door

603
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,520
saying you were my lover
from a parallel world.

604
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,040
Now that I think about it,
no normal person would buy that, right?

605
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:22,440
That’s because you’re someone special.

606
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,760
Heh, so you’re saying
you sounded convincing, huh?

607
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,520
That's not what I mean.

608
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,480
But I’m glad that I believed you.

609
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,440
Because it’s brought me...

610
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:45,960
to where I am now.

611
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,880
And I want Phukan from
every world to believe like I did.

612
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:07,080
Someone told me that Phukan
will be my light in every world.

613
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:12,200
But... I believe that
no matter which Phukan it is

614
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,080
he’d never leave P' Cirrus.

615
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:23,880
Then I’ll make a wish
for the world I just dreamed of.

616
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,800
I wish for Phukan in that
world to become braver.

617
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:34,720
Seriously, if I got kissed like that,
I would've gone all the way.

618
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,600
But I guess all he can do is freak out.

619
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:53,480
Are you happy, P’ Cir?

620
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,040
Am I not making it clear?

621
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,520
I want to hear you say it.

622
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:07,360
Of course.

623
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,320
I’m the happiest I’ve ever been.

624
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:17,280
As long as I have you by my side.

625
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,880
Then I’ll stick by your side forever.

626
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:28,440
I’ll look forward to it.

I love you.

659
01:04:31,720 --> 01:04:35,200

660
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:38,360
I love you too.
