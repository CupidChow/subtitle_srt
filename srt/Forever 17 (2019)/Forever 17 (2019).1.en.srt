1
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,720
I have something to tell you

2
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,720
I have something to say

3
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,440
I have fallen in love with a boy

4
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,680
If you ask me
whether I regretted coming out,

5
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,640
I would answer, “Not at all.”

6
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,960
However, I often wonder,
instead of telling my parents directly,

7
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,320
If there was a better way to let them know

8
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,000
I am “different” from other kids

9
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,880
If I had not told them,

10
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,560
would things have gone on differently?

11
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,000
How was it?

12
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,800
Did you tell them?

13
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,800
Would the relationships between me,
father, mother and Roger,

14
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,000
have been different?

15
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,720
How did they react?

16
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,640
Someone once told me,
if you close your eyes

17
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,680
Imagine when you are in your 70s or 80s

18
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,600
Sitting on a wheel chair,
needing help to go to the toilet

19
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,480
and you can imagine
the one pushing your wheel chair

20
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,840
is the one next to you

21
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,240
He’s the one worth
spending your whole life with

22
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,680
There was no love at first sight,
nor was there fairytale-love between me and Roger

23
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:06,360
There were only stories of daily life,
one after another.

24
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,280
What we remember

25
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:13,320
is perhaps like the photos stored on your phone

26
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,120
I remember, that year at the LGBT parade

27
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,040
was the first time
we held hands out in the open

28
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,080
and kissed in public.

29
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,800
It was then that I knew

30
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,400
How to ignore other people’s peculiar looks
and be honest with myself

31
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,440
They're here

32
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,880
Roger - Hello, Uncle and Auntie,
Happy New Year!

33
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,200
Here’s a little present for you.
- You shouldn’t have

34
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,920
Do you live in Tin Shui Wai? So far away…

35
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,720
Have a seat

36
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,040
Let me get the steamed fish,
and dinner will be ready.

37
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,520
Have a seat - Sure, thank you.

38
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,240
Would you like to have some melon seeds?
- We are having dinner now!

39
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,320
Are you studying or working?

40
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,840
I major in physics,
I work part-time as a cook

41
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,000
You can excel in every field.
I didn’t even graduate from primary school

42
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,960
and I living in public housing,

43
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,080
Uncle, have some chicken, here
- Oh, that’s ok, I can help myself

44
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,200
Auntie, have some too

45
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,440
Let me give you an red envolope

46
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,080
Thank you Auntie
- May all your wishes come true!

47
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
Thank you Auntie.

48
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,800
Why am I with this person?

49
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,160
For a while,
I asked myself this question everyday

50
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,840
To what extent do we have to understand
a person in order to be with him?

51
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,160
How much of that person do
we possess when we say we are in a relationship?

52
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,440
At the beginning, I felt anxious

53
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,440
This feeling came from
occupying the same space

54
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,760
yet not knowing what he was thinking about

55
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,720
I am going to the toilet

56
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,320
That made me uneasy

57
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,480
I asked myself every day,
what kept us together?

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,680
Some people call this sense of unease
an insight into the future,

59
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,840
But even though everyone has
this kind of insight

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,480
I chose to deal with it only
when I am forced to do so

61
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,960
You wanna go for dinner?

62
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,120
Ricky！Ricky！

63
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,960
Hey!

64
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,280
Hey!

65
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Listen!

66
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Listen!

67
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,760
Why am I still with you?

68
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,520
It was Sept, 2014

69
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,760
Ever since Sept, 2014,
whenever I heard the sound of fireworks,

70
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,240
I felt suffocated

71
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,160
Unknowingly,
whenever I heard the sound of fireworks,

72
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,800
My eyes would fill with tears

73
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
I recalled the moment
when the police fired tear gas

74
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,280
Today, the Hong Kong government re-opened
the Civic Square to the public.

75
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,360
Last month, the Legislative Council passed
the Marriage Ordinance amendment

76
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,960
Same-sex marriage became legal in Hong Kong

77
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,240
That same week, the 8400th tear gas
was fired just outside the Legislative Council

78
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:33,400
The first same-sex marriage ceremony in Hong Kong was held

79
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,040
at a time of social and political conflict and anti-government sentiment

80
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,200
Why am I still with you?

81
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,040
After holding hands for the first time in public during the LGBT parade

82
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,480
I held Roger’s hand for the second time during the Umbrella Movement

83
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,960
When the police fired tear gas and charged towards us

84
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,760
We ran hand in hand from Harcourt Road to the Academy for Performing Arts

85
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,920
and onwards to the Chinese Methodist Church in Wan Chai

86
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,680
Today, you come in the front of God

87
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,720
Your families, your friends

88
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,960
to bear witness to your love for one another

89
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,040
Do you promise, in the presence of God and everyone present

90
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,040
to take each other for your lawful wedded husband

91
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,040
Roger Fung

92
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,960
I do

93
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,360
Ricky Tsang

94
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I do

95
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Mandy Man

96
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,680
I do

97
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Cecilia Ho

98
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,240
I do

99
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,120
Now I pronounce you lawfully wedded husbands and wives

100
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,280
I have never thought it could happen,
that we can get married

101
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,960
Because… -You can say it

102
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,720
She was hospitalised

103
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,680
and almost didn’t make it…

104
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,680
I am still here

105
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,160
The doctor asked me…

106
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:04,000
He asked me what was our relationship

107
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,480
I did not know how to answer

108
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,800
I couldn’t take care of her in these critical times

109
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,440
Then I said as I was lying on the bed

110
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,480
Life Partner

111
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,640
I used to believe that only straight people have the right to marry

112
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,800
But today I know we also have that right

113
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,840
We can love each other like normal people

114
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,240
I hope they can have the freedom to choose…

115
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,320
I hope more people can have this kind of social recognition

116
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,080
It’s been 18 years already

117
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,920
We have been living together for a very long time

118
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,400
We think our relationship will enter another stage after marriage

119
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,240
I hope we won’t fight or break up over trivial things

120
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,880
I hope he won’t hit me anymore

121
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,720
My family know, they are all here

122
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,040
Please have tea, Dad

123
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,720
Family is very important to me and Roger

124
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,840
When I came out,
I only wanted to be with Roger

125
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:24,320
As time passed, there had been blessings
from friends and family on both sides…

126
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,000
which helped maintain our relationship

127
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,520
Best wishes to your new family

128
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,640
Thank you Mother

129
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:36,320
After the Umbrella Movement,
I didn’t ask anymore why we stayed together

130
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,960
Instead, I asked myself
what I should do to keep being with you

131
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,920
Would you like to take a look at our show flat?

132
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,760
Would you like to take a look at our show flat?

133
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,120
The bread is ready

134
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,920
So? Not coming home for dinner again?

135
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,840
Let’s eat first

136
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,160
Your HIV rapid test is positive.

137
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,960
How are you feeling?

138
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,040
I, Roger Tsang,

139
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,040
take thee, Ricky Fung

140
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,440
to be my lawful husband

141
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,640
To have and to hold from this day forward,

142
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,760
for better, for worse,

143
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,040
for richer for poorer,

144
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,200
in sickness and in health,

145
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,680
according to Gods holy ordinance

146
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
to love

147
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
and cherish thee...

148
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,640
till death do us part

149
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:50,040
The love between us is not only recorded in photos on our phones

150
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,160
It also contains numerous frustrations that reinforce the bond between us

151
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:58,200
Whenever we faced challenges in our relationship, or if one person broke down,

152
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,880
the other would be by his side

153
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:05,760
I mentioned my illness to many of my friends,

154
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,440
Every time it was like another coming-out. Sometimes I felt,

155
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,480
life is all about pushing door open, one after another,

156
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,880
coming out of closet after another

157
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,640
Thanks in advance, I will make an appointment to
sign the contract at your lawyer’s office

158
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,320
OK - Let me walk you out

159
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,080
I will send the cheque to you shortly,
You’ll get it by next week

160
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,480
Ok, thanks

161
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
Hello

162
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,760
Your mom wanted me to hand you these

163
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:56,880
We hope you can be like me and your mom,
cherish and take care of each other

164
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,520
Mom and Dad, today is our 20-year-wedding anniversary

165
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,920
We come here to visit you.

166
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,840
Be careful - OK

167
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,040
We have been walking this path for decades

168
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,000
It seems to get longer and longer

169
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,800
Have some water -Sure

170
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,440
Ok, almost there - OK

171
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:15,960
2 years

172
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,960
5 years

173
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,960
8 years

174
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:18,960
15 years

175
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,960
20 years

176
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,960
30 years

177
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,680
I stopped counting how long we have been together

178
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,560
Before I came out,
I felt I might be alone for the rest of my life,

179
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,560
After being with you,
I had constant doubts,

180
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,400
I asked myself why we should stay together,

181
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
And why you?

182
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,400
I thought about how we could build a life together,

183
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,800
Now I wonder how to treasure our remaining days together

184
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,320
Maybe because I caught the disease early,

185
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,520
I got all the attention,
and you were overlooked

186
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,400
By the time we found out you were sick,
it was too late

187
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:11,120
Don’t be scared, I can still stand and walk,
I would always be here for you

188
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,000
Let me handle it

189
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,360
persistence,

190
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,600
It’s a kind of insistence,

191
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,760
a commitment to the other person
that kept us together

192
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,080
This persistence can be blind,
even unrealistic,

193
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,680
But allowed us to keep the relationship alive until now

194
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,800
The vegetable, is even tougher than you

195
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:43,400
Well, try the tomatoes

196
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,560
I will have this

197
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,520
Hey, it's done.

198
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,240
We have already put him on ventilator

199
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,360
It’s at the highest level,
if he doesn’t take it

200
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
perhaps he would not last the night

201
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:22,560
Goodbye Honey, meet again in the next life
