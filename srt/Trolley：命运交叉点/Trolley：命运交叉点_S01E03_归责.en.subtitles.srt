JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

2
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,305
Today, we'll be learning about
the Trolley Dilemma.

3
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,558
Who knows what a "trolley" is?

4
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,061
-What is that?
-Trolley?

5
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,395
-Beats me.
-What is it?

6
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,692
It's a streetcar. Do you recognize it now?

7
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,195
-I've seen that on TV.
-I see.

8
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,488
I saw it in a movie.

9
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:14,949
This trolley's brakes are broken,

10
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:18,661
and there are five workers
working on the track.

11
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:22,415
If you do nothing about it,
all five of them will die.

12
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,335
But if you pull a lever,

13
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,922
you can change the trolley's course

14
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,548
to a different track.

15
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,175
However,

16
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:36,346
there's another worker working
on that track as well.

17
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,224
Let's think about this.

18
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,850
If you don't do anything,

19
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,770
the trolley will kill five people.

20
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,816
If you pull the lever
to change its direction,

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,068
the five workers will survive

22
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,403
but that one worker will die.

23
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,492
What will be your decision?

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,703
I'll definitely pull the lever.

25
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,205
I'm not sure.

26
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:03,123
Yes?

27
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:06,668
I would definitely switch the tracks.
It's five to one.

28
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,130
But those five were fated to die.

29
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,216
If I pull the lever, that one worker

30
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,301
would suddenly meet their death.

31
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,220
That would haunt me forever.

32
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,681
This is giving me a headache.

33
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,391
Do we have to decide?

34
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,351
Then who will?

35
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,769
Not me.

36
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,980
Hey, you can decide.

37
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:29,440
No. Why should I?

38
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:31,734
There's no right answer to this dilemma.

39
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,695
We each have an opinion.

40
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,824
All right. Write a paper
about what you would do and why.

41
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,493
Then submit it in two weeks.

42
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,040
Seung-kyu.

43
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:46,958
Seung…

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,922
-Seung…
-Seung-kyu.

45
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,424
-Seung-kyu.
-Seung-kyu.

46
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,676
Seung-kyu!

47
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,428
-Seung-kyu!
-Seung-kyu.

48
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,307
Please come this way. It's all right.

49
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,600
Help!

50
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,184
Please help.

51
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,061
-Help!
-It's all right.

52
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:18,031
MURDERER
NAM JOONG-DO

53
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,408
THE BLAME

54
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,243
Good work.

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,870
-Good work.
-Good work.

56
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,172
This is Nam Joong-do.

57
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,259
Of course, I remember you.

58
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,471
Ms. Na Mun-suk, the head
of Taeyang Apartment's resident committee.

59
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,140
Didn't we meet
at the district office last time?

60
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,893
Yes, it really is my personal number.

61
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,483
NEW MESSAGE FROM
SENIOR SECRETARY LEE SANG-HUN

62
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,704
Ji, a medical student and the assailant
of a case in Sinyang-gu

63
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,458
that led to the suicide
of Namgoong, the victim,

64
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,169
committed suicide by jumping
out of his apartment today

65
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,963
after his arrest warrant was issued.

66
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,714
-Goodness.
-Assemblyman Nam Joong-do

67
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,883
-of the Daehan Party…
-No way.

68
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:21,010
-…had mentioned him to the media recently.
-No way.

69
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:22,971
As a result, he was put in the spotlight

70
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,431
-as the assailant of a sexual abuse case.
-Shit.

71
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,475
The police, as they deemed the assailant…

72
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,810
I see.

73
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,523
But like I told you before,

74
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,942
I have no say in that.

75
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,572
Yes, that would be an issue
with the procedure.

76
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,034
Is that so?

77
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:46,911
What is it?

78
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,539
All right.

79
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,584
I will relay your message
to our district office

80
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,795
and get back to you.

81
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:56,796
Goodbye.

82
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,968
What's the matter?

83
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,762
Sir.

84
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,435
What is she doing?

85
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:13,563
I don't know. She's in her room.

86
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,732
What could she be doing in there all day?

87
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,275
She even lost her phone.

88
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,402
Just let her be. Yes.

89
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:21,738
Call me if anything happens, okay?

90
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,657
All right. See you tonight. Bye.

91
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,552
It's illegal to have a paternity test
for an unborn baby, sir.

92
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,389
It's not impossible,

93
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:51,309
but it's too big of a risk
with the general election coming up.

94
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,314
Let her stay here.

95
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,691
That lowers the risk,

96
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,194
and she may be helpful to us.

97
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,530
Not only did you lose Ji-hoon,

98
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,492
but you took in his pregnant girlfriend
who had nowhere to stay.

99
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,369
They'll feel your sincerity.

100
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,873
Woo-jae, that wasn't what I meant.

101
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,916
I know, ma'am.

102
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,085
I understand.

103
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,756
What I'm saying is that the girl
may seem like a ticking bomb,

104
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:26,469
but she could actually be
a double-edged sword for us.

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,472
It was only a couple of days ago

106
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,974
that the Nation and People's Party
were on our case

107
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:34,852
about Ji-hoon's meth possession
and the favor from the police.

108
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,271
The election is in seven months.

109
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,484
If you kick her out now,
things could get out of control.

110
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,362
You should be glad that she came to you.

111
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,490
Imagine if she had gone
to the opposing party instead.

112
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,576
We don't know
her true intentions just yet,

113
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,580
but you should keep her here

114
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,834
and humor her for the time being.

115
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:02,338
Sir.

116
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,174
You have to focus on the general election.

117
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:33,703
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

118
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,847
Who was it that you had to
take the call outside?

119
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,141
-Was it a guy?
-Don't be ridiculous.

120
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,601
You still have a lot to do.

121
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,103
Are you dizzy again?

122
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,148
Sit down. Goodness.

123
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,030
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

124
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,700
You were doing better
after taking herbal medicine.

125
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,745
I'll finish up making the dumplings.
Just go home and rest.

126
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,208
I've already been clocking out early
despite being the owner.

127
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,585
-Now you want me to leave earlier?
-Yes.

128
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:26,380
-Gosh.
-Do you want some water?

129
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,271
Come in.

130
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,318
What were you up to?

131
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:49,904
Nothing.

132
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,950
I need to go to work. This is your lunch.

133
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,409
Okay. Goodbye.

134
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:59,580
Also, I thought you'd be bored
since you lost your phone.

135
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,625
Yoon-seo and I enjoyed reading them,
but I'm not sure if you'll like them.

136
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,086
Okay. I'll give them a try.

137
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,547
Okay. I'll be back.

138
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,090
Okay.

139
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:13,052
Take that girl to a hospital
and get her tested for drugs.

140
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,432
Tomorrow, are you--

141
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,477
Right. I'm going to the hospital later.

142
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,772
I'm going to get that drug test.

143
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,483
I gave it some thought.

144
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,069
I think it makes sense
that you and your husband

145
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,904
have trouble trusting me.

146
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,032
After all, Ji-hoon had bought drugs.

147
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,410
Although he didn't use them.

148
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,788
I swear that I'm clean as well.

149
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,456
I'll prove it to you.

150
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,295
Okay. Thanks.

151
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,379
Don't mention it.

152
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,757
Then I'll be out later today.

153
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,094
I'll go to work then.
I'll be back before dinnertime.

154
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,429
Okay. Goodbye.

155
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,892
You know, that lid…

156
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,819
BOOK CONSERVATION

157
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,991
Come in.

158
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,674
Everything looks so interesting here.

159
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,594
I heard you fix books.

160
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,224
Ji-hoon told me.

161
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,729
-He told you that?
-Yes.

162
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,106
How do you fix books?

163
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,983
Well…

164
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,278
I tend to say "conserve"
rather than "fix."

165
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,448
What's the difference?

166
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,788
Take a seat and have a look.

167
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,002
ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE

168
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,796
I'm sorry. Just a second.

169
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,427
I reported it to him.

170
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:20,513
Let's get to work.

171
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:22,306
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

172
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,147
Hello, this is Ko Min-seok.

173
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,775
We'll contact you right away
once we're ready.

174
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,237
If it isn't Mr. Park Yeong-su.

175
00:11:37,655 --> 00:11:39,865
When are we going out for drinks?

176
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,701
Are we strangers
just because I quit eight years ago?

177
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:48,999
I know, why did he have to fall
in front of the kindergarten bus

178
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,334
and traumatize the kids?

179
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,129
Assemblyman Nam's statement?

180
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,756
We're still working on it.

181
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,508
Yes.

182
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,428
I'll send it over as soon as we're done.

183
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,222
Okay.

184
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,558
Goodbye.

185
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,271
We'll need a draft of his statement.

186
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,564
Sure.

187
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,611
I'll be back in a bit.

188
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,654
-Okay.
-Okay.

189
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,950
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party

190
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,119
had mentioned him to the media recently.

191
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,621
As a result, he was put in the spotlight

192
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,623
as the assailant of a sexual abuse case.

193
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,007
Hello, ma'am.

194
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,302
Thank you so much for your time.

195
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,095
Don't mention it.

196
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,348
I should be the one
thanking you for inviting me.

197
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,270
She's put so much effort
into preparing for your visit

198
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:53,939
over the past three months.

199
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,775
And I've been losing sleep
for the past three months

200
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,278
because I was so eager
to participate in this seminar.

201
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,907
-Shall we go inside?
-Sure.

202
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:03,866
This way.

203
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:11,582
What's the matter?

204
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:15,002
Ji Seung-kyu jumped off a building.

205
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,131
He jumped off a building?

206
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,842
Ma'am, are you serious?

207
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:26,597
That medical student committed suicide
by jumping off a building?

208
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,391
Yes, the articles
are being posted as we speak.

209
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:34,063
Come to think of it,
Assemblyman Nam was often referred to

210
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,482
as Daehan Party's sharpshooter.

211
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,527
But publicly attacking a mere civilian

212
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,531
and driving him to suicide?

213
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,950
I'd say this is a terrible case of…

214
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,745
improper handling of a firearm.

215
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:51,747
You're absolutely right.

216
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:53,999
Goodness.

217
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,585
JI SEUNG-KYU'S SUICIDE
SHARPSHOOTER NAM'S IMPROPER HANDLING

218
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,840
Mr. Shin.

219
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,592
Yes, sir.

220
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,305
Although there's nothing
we could possibly do to comfort

221
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,766
the parents who lost
their child so tragically,

222
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,852
find out where his wake is being held

223
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,356
and send them some flowers under my name.

224
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,024
Yes, sir.

225
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,487
Goodness.

226
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,282
I can't fathom
how Assemblyman Nam must feel.

227
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:29,410
Anyway, we'll get going.

228
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:31,537
-Please call me if anything happens.
-I will.

229
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,621
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

230
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,540
Let's go.

231
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,011
FUNERAL HALL

232
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,024
No way.

233
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,693
How is this possible?

234
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,697
This is so fascinating.

235
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,035
It's a totally different book.

236
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,456
Do you think

237
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,750
this could be done with people too?

238
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:19,668
What?

239
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,841
I was just asking.

240
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:29,303
So…

241
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,097
why did you bring me here?

242
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:35,017
Right. Can you give me
that thing from earlier?

243
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,227
Right.

244
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,752
There.

245
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,089
No way.

246
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:06,757
Here you go.

247
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,759
This must be a new lipstick.

248
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,054
Someone gave it to me.

249
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,140
And it's a lip balm, not lipstick.

250
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:17,935
It's for moisturizing your lips.

251
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,312
I see.

252
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,564
They make such great products these days.

253
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,566
It's a pretty color too. It suits you.

254
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,952
By the way, what's that?

255
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,080
It's a dehumidifier.

256
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,875
Since I work with paper,

257
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,586
maintaining the right amount
of humidity is crucial.

258
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,922
It can't be too humid or dry here.

259
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,343
What if the weather
was fine during the day,

260
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,762
but it starts to rain at night
when you're home?

261
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:55,848
In that case…

262
00:16:57,683 --> 00:17:01,353
I can control it remotely
through the app on my phone.

263
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:03,814
That's cool.

264
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:08,777
But if it suddenly
starts pouring at night,

265
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,155
I come by to check at times.

266
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:14,241
Why? I thought you could do it
on your phone.

267
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:19,246
Because I'd rather check in person.

268
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,791
Come take a look.

269
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,260
These are all my clients' books.

270
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,805
I can't have these books
getting more damaged.

271
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:42,019
After all, they entrusted me
with their precious books

272
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,647
that they've cherished for years.

273
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,734
So when there's heavy rain,

274
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:51,278
I can't just rely on my phone.

275
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,907
I have to come and see for myself
that these books are safe.

276
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,744
Seeing them for myself
is much more reassuring.

277
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:02,414
Yes. I guess you're right.

278
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,630
Where did you learn to do this?

279
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,438
BOOK REPAIR

280
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,195
I used to go to the library often

281
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:35,781
when I worked at the welfare center.

282
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:36,865
Then one day,

283
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,830
I saw that the library

284
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:46,166
was looking for volunteers
in the book repair department.

285
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,459
You're here again.

286
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,544
Hello.

287
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,173
Excuse me.

288
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,762
Thank you.

289
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,604
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes?

290
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,898
Do you want to give this a try?

291
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,402
I do.

292
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:16,280
All right.

293
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,990
Make sure to remove all the adhesives.

294
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,242
That's it. You're doing great.

295
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,858
The more I conserved damaged books,

296
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:54,234
the more fascinating it got.

297
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,863
It became fun and I wanted to know more.

298
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:06,496
Then I taught myself
through books and online research,

299
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,915
and I opened up this studio

300
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,125
after quitting my job there.

301
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,671
Hello, I'm afraid Assemblyman Nam
can't do any interviews for now.

302
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,966
-Yes. We're still looking into it.
-I see.

303
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:01,468
-I'll call after we release a statement.
-A statement?

304
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,720
-He's…
-Thank you.

305
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,974
We're still working on it.

306
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,934
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,853
We'll email it to you
as soon as it's ready.

308
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,605
Thank you.

309
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,026
All the reporters are waiting
for his statement, aren't they?

310
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:18,944
Yes.

311
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,533
This is Assemblyman Nam's office.

312
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:26,034
This is Assemblyman Nam's office.

313
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,579
-We're still looking into it.
-Hello. Yes.

314
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,497
Right.

315
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,873
We're sorry.

316
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,004
Please be patient,
and we'll send out his statement soon.

317
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,134
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

318
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,387
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

319
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,557
WANNA PHONE
THIS MONTH'S CELL PHONE

320
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,018
Right. Thank you.

321
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:51,935
I appreciate it.

322
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,562
No problem.

323
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,648
Did you cancel your old phone?

324
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:59,151
You don't want a stranger using it.

325
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,028
I did.

326
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,530
There's nothing important in there anyway.

327
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,410
Are we going home now?

328
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,539
SONMAT NOODLES

329
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,375
Can we have lunch elsewhere?

330
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,336
Like I said before,

331
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,130
this is Yeo-jin's restaurant
and I'm a regular here.

332
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,926
If you want to live with us,
you should get to know the staff here.

333
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:28,180
Who will you tell them I am?

334
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,398
Just tell them I'm some kid you know.

335
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,569
Okay. I'll say that.

336
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,071
Let's go inside.

337
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,450
-Did you enjoy your meal?
-Yes.

338
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,870
-Please throw away the receipt.
-Sure.

339
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,080
-Have a good day.
-You too.

340
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,122
Have a good one.

341
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,799
She sure has a great appetite.

342
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:08,136
You were so skinny when you were pregnant
because you couldn't eat anything.

343
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,514
It's different for everyone.

344
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,933
And I had it rough back then.

345
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,977
I was pregnant with Yoon-seo not long
after my mother-in-law passed away,

346
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:18,146
and Ji-hoon was starting school soon.

347
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,274
And my husband was too busy with his work.

348
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,152
I felt so helpless.

349
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,738
When you moved in with us,

350
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,949
you didn't just move in.

351
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,826
You practically saved my life.

352
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,245
That's why you're my savior.

353
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,789
One who came to ruin your life?

354
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,915
Yes.

355
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,251
That's why you should always
be there for me.

356
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,377
Yes, ma'am.

357
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,295
Can I have some more kimchi?

358
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:44,631
Yes, ma'am.

A new form of fraud targeting young adults

363
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,240
is becoming more and more elaborate.

364
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,783
Many fell victim to the allure…

365
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,493
-Ma'am.
-…of a high-paying part-time job

366
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,830
only to enter into the world
of voice phishing…

It's barley tea.

368
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,420
You could get sick from overeating.

369
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,715
It's the most I can do for you.

370
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,552
Drink it slowly
and let the food be digested.

371
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,096
By the way,

372
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

373
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,477
What's your relationship
with Ji-hoon's family?

374
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,022
You're not family.

375
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,153
What do you think a family is?

376
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:55,452
I consider myself a part of their family.

377
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,873
I can do anything for them.

378
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,043
That's what a family is.

379
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,172
That bastard.

380
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,715
Served him right!

00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:27,025
I've never seen
such a competent assemblyman before.

387
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:31,238
…caused a nationwide uproar,
triggering a hashtag movement and more.

388
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,033
Meanwhile, the residents
who witnessed his death

389
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,160
-were severely traumatized
-Thank you.

390
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,288
-and are receiving treatment.
-Thank you.

391
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,709
They said he would have
gotten out in no time

392
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,878
even if he was sent to prison.

393
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:51,508
But it's not like I could have gone
and killed him myself.

394
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,343
I was worried

395
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:57,430
that I couldn't look my granddaughter
in the eye after I died.

396
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,183
But look at that.

397
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:03,061
Now that he's dead and gone,

398
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:07,315
I have nothing more to wish for.

399
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,778
Thank you, God. Thank you, Buddha.

400
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,782
Thank you, Assemblyman Nam.

401
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,536
I am truly thankful.

402
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,040
Thank you so much.

403
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,753
I was already grateful

404
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,840
that both of you came
to my granddaughter's wake.

405
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:37,846
How could I ever repay you?

406
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:40,098
Thank you so much.

407
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,392
Hold on.

408
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,187
Wait here for a second.

409
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:49,482
Ma'am, take these.

410
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:53,361
Here are your two bottles of perilla oil,

411
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,198
and try some of the sesame oil as well.

412
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:01,619
No, that's okay.

413
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,496
-Gosh.
-No, really.

414
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:06,666
I used domestic sesame seeds.

415
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,126
It's really good.

416
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,211
Take them.

417
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:12,881
-No, it's okay.
-Just take them.

418
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,341
Youngsan.

419
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:17,177
-You know where that is, right?
-How dare you come here?

420
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,762
-In North Chungcheong-do.
-Get out!

421
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:22,140
Their sesame seeds are the best.

422
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,060
Just take them.

423
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,520
I don't have much to give you

424
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,648
on such a happy day.

425
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,567
Take them. Please?

426
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:35,570
Okay?

427
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:40,575
Okay. Thank you.

People are calling Mr. Nam
a hero of justice.

00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,588
It must be so nice

433
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:38,425
to have such a righteous family.

434
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,634
Right?

435
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,546
It looks good,

436
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:20,008
but instead of
"flustered by the shocking news,"

437
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:23,303
could we use "heartbroken"?

438
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,847
"Heartbroken by the shocking news."

439
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,809
That's better.
You haven't lost your touch.

440
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:34,022
Assemblyman Nam replied to my email.

441
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,191

How meticulous.

446
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,415
I'll be off to a debate now.

447
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,334
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

448
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,920
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

449
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,507
Send it to his phone when you're done.

Okay.

451
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,432
Okay.

452
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,433
Release it as it is.

453
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,601
Yes, sir.

454
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,899
Confirmed.

455
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:31,538
The online opinion
seems to be mostly in your favor.

456
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,082
There won't be any more articles either.

-Hello.
-Hello.

463
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,283

ASSEMBLYMEN DROP-OFF AND PICK-UP AREA

465

Hello, Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong.

00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:32,515
Goodness. Hello, Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok.

467
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:35,852
Please.

468
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,743
By the way, Chairwoman Woo.

469
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,832
All the controversies surrounding
Assemblyman Nam these days

470
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:59,626
must be causing you some headaches.

471
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,212
Controversies are made
day and night here in Yeouido.

472
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:06,341
I doubt there's a single politician
who hasn't had one.

473
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:12,597
Even still, there should be a limit
to such controversies.

474
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:16,976
He called him out publicly
and he committed suicide?

475
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,815
I'm truly concerned about whether or not

476
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,943
Assemblyman Nam can overcome this.

477
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,655
This is a surprise.

478
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:33,534
Your in-laws' real estate speculation
which Assemblyman Nam mentioned

479
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:37,455
seemed to be getting swept
under the rug due to this current matter.

480
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,166
So I thought you'd be glad.

481
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,878
I was actually worried
about whether or not

482
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,172
you'd be able to overcome it.

483
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,926
What are you…

484
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,260
Goodbye, then.

485
00:32:58,851 --> 00:32:59,727
Why that…

486
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,023
I see.

487
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,858
Thank you.

488
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:09,153
Goodbye.

489
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,657
Was it another call
complimenting Assemblyman Nam?

490
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,658
Yes.

491
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,494
They thanked him
for taking out the garbage

492
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:17,954
and said they'll keep rooting for him.

493
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:23,710
Right. It was the caller who used
the word "garbage," not me.

494
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,171
You know, it would be more helpful

495
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,090
if they thanked us by making a donation.

496
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,842
Exactly.

497
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:34,554
I was worried sick earlier.
I'm just glad things are working out.

498
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,930
Agreed.

499
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:39,017
I'm exhausted right now
from being so tense all day.

500
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,270
All right. Who's down for a drink
after work today?

501
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,272
-I am.
-Should I book a place?

502
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,231
Sure.

503
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,691
Why? I thought it was good.

504
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,193
You liked the eggplants?

505
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:50,945
Yes. It wasn't bad.

506
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,158
Yoon-seo, did you watch the news?

507
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,201
I can't believe it.

508
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,411
What do you mean?

509
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,328
You haven't heard?

510
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:02,623
You know that medical student
your dad called out on the news?

511
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,875
He committed suicide today.

512
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,672
Your dad is so amazing.
Justice was served.

513
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,674
Seriously. He's the best.

514
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,801
I can't believe it either.

515
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,055
Seriously. It'd be a waste of tax money
to send him to prison.

516
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:20,266
I wish all murderers and robbers
would commit suicide too.

517
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,227
-That's intense.
-I wish…

518
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,396
adulterers would also die.

519
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,900
This is the key point
of the real estate speculation

520
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,861
surrounding Assembly Kang
of the Nation and People's Party.

521
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,780
Lee, his sister-in-law, had purchased

522
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,241
a 10,000 square meter farmland
in Youngsan,

523
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,784
North Chungcheong-do a year ago.

524
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,745
Recently, that land was chosen
to be redeveloped by the MOLIT.

525
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,413
Suspicions of insider--

526
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,347
Hello, ma'am.

527
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,558
Where are you headed?

528
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,477
-To Youngsan.
-Sure thing.

529
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,064
Wait. Youngsan?

530
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,567
As in South Chungcheong-do?

531
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:54,569
It's North.

532
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,904
I see.

533
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,158
That's really out of the way for me.

534
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,202
I'll pay you for the round trip.

535
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,746
Yes, ma'am. Hop in.

536
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,165
Seung-hee.

537
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,503
Hey, Ki-young.

538
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,682
I didn't think you'd come.

539
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:32,732
Is Mom home?

540
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,319
Your mother? Yes, she's there.

541
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,363
I guess she's not out
shopping for land today.

542
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,201
Of course not.
She's waiting for you at home.

543
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:48,748
You don't need to lie.

544
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:53,252
Why would she wait for me
when I ran off for three years

545
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,796
saying that I couldn't stand her?

546
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,189
MED STUDENT COMMITS SUICIDE

547
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,527
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM'S PLEA
FOR A REINVESTIGATION DROVE HIM TO SUICIDE

548
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,708
LEE SEUL-GI MEDICAL CLINIC

549
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,844
LEE SEUL-GI MEDICAL CLINIC

550
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,103
-I'd like to take a drug test.
-Pardon?

551
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,148
A drug test.

552
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,401
The medical student's wake?

553
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,194
Why would you go there?

554
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,989
It's bothering me too much.

555
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:06,784
Hye-joo, I understand
that this was unexpected

556
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,494
and that you're feeling troubled.

557
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:11,038
But no one is criticizing
Joong-do right now.

558
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,624
I'm not saying they're right,

559
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,502
but people are saying
that the kid deserved it.

560
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:19,046
I doubt Joong-do will go there.

561
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,133
If he does, it may seem like
he's taking responsibility

562
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,093
for that kid's death.

563
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,595
But that's not the case.

564
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:30,224
So you shouldn't go there either. Okay?

565
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,602
Think of what the bereaved family
might say to you.

566
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:34,729
Okay.

567
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,315
I'll see you later.

568
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:38,941
Okay.

569
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,444
Bye.

570
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,618
Get out!

571
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,204
How dare you come here?

572
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,539
Get out!

573
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,917
How dare you set foot in here?

574
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,212
How brazen could you be?

575
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:13,768
YOUNGSAN SESAME OIL

576
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,810
Youngsan.

577
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,312
You know where that is, right?

578
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,606
In North Chungcheong-do.

579
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,358
Take them.

580
00:39:20,441 --> 00:39:22,985
-No, it's okay.
-Just take them.

581
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,029
Take this. Okay?

582
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,470
We've arrived, sir.

583
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,680
Thank you.

584
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,099
Let's go.

585
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,395
-Hello.
-Hello.

586
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,981
Nam Joong-do, you bastard!

587
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,109
You killed my child
and won't even come to his wake.

588
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,027
How can you call yourself human?

589
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,530
-Nam Joong-do! Do you know who I am?
-Stop him.

590
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,200
I'm Ji Seung-kyu's father!
The father of the boy you killed!

591
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:12,576
-Stop it!
-Get inside, sir!

592
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,121
-Let me go!
-You murderer!

593
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,458
You killed our son!

594
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,878
Nam Joong-do, you murderer!

595
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,387
Murderer!

596
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,514
Where are you going, you bastard?

597
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,142
Are you okay?

598
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,643
I can't believe this.

599
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,186
Use this.

600
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,346
I'd like to thank you
for your interest in paternity leave

601
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:19,435
and for attending this debate
held in support of this policy.

602
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,855
Paternity leave is a right

603
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,149
for all infants and their parents.

604
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,985
Frankly, I never took paternity leave.

605
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,988
If my wife finds out
that I'm giving a speech here,

606
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,823
she'll give me an earful.

607
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,703
So please keep this a secret from her.

608
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,246
Okay.

609
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,498
PML is an abbreviation

610
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:43,417
for "pregnancy and maternity leave."

611
00:41:54,136 --> 00:41:55,387
Hey.

612
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,765
-Hey.
-Sorry for being late.

613
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,475
That's okay. Did you eat?

614
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,768
Of course not.

615
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,947
MS. KIM

616
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,424
Ms. Kim.

617
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,513
It's me, Soo-bin.

618
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,530
Why didn't you go home?

619
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,199
I was bored.

620
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:02,496
Can I come in and watch you work?

621
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:11,380
Thank you, sir.

622
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:12,548
My pleasure.

623
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,924
I loved your speech.

624
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,217
Thank you.

625
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,969
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

626
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,763
-Good work.
-Thank you.

627
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,536
-Thanks for the jacket.
-Don't mention it.

628
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,873
The rest of your schedule
is at the National Assembly.

629
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,625
You can wear the spare suit in your--

630
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,959
Wait.

631
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,464
I'm sorry, but could you cancel
my schedule for the day?

632
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,302
Mr. Park, you can go home
after dropping me off here.

633
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,721
Yes, sir.

634
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,815
Are you going somewhere?
We can drive you there.

635
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,027
That's okay. Could you take
my suit to a dry cleaner?

636
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,197
I'm sorry. See you tomorrow.

637
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,643
By the way,

638
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,398
do you have to graduate from university
to become a book conservator?

639
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,025
I didn't go to university.

640
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,071
-Really?
-Yes.

641
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,155
I see.

642
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,156
Right.

643
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,534
I think Ji-hoon mentioned that.

644
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:10,582
He told you that?

645
00:45:11,166 --> 00:45:12,126
Yes.

646
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,090
I don't have any parents. Just like you.

647
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,344
Ji-hoon told me.

648
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,058
Did he tell you anything else?

649
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:32,229
Did Ji-hoon tell you
anything else about me?

650
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:41,989
He did.

651
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:49,788
That you're not his birth mother.

652
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,003
Anything else?

653
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,131
No.

654
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:00,924
That's all.

655
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:13,979
I'm sorry, Soo-bin,

656
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,565
but could you go
and buy me a bottle of water?

657
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:18,775
Water?

658
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,029
Do you remember seeing
a convenience store nearby?

659
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,489
Can you get me one from there?

660
00:46:24,072 --> 00:46:25,991
I forgot to buy it.

661
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:28,994
Sure.

662
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:32,247
My purse is in my handbag. Take it.

663
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:33,874
I have enough money for water.

664
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,126
I'll be back.

665
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,188
That you're not his birth mother.

666
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,565
That's all.

667
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:08,492
What did you expect?

668
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,298
Mom, I'm home.

669
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,801
You came together.

670
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:30,055
Yes, I picked her up from the airport.

671
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,766
Why didn't you just leave
while you were at the airport?

672
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:34,101
Why did you come back?

673
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,688
Come on, Mom.

674
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:40,274
Don't be like that.

675
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,317
Didn't you miss me? It's been three years.

676
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,821
Why would I miss the daughter
who abandoned me?

677
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:21,898
Honey.

678
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:26,445
Hye-joo.

679
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:40,250
This is just too hard.

680
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,053
Someone died…

681
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,642
because of me.

682
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:06,360
No.

683
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:08,904
It wasn't your fault.

684
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:12,366
You didn't do anything wrong.
You're not to blame, honey.

685
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,786
You didn't know this would happen.

686
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,455
But…

687
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,378
But they lost their son

688
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:26,838
because of me.

689
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,472
Ever since I fell in love with him,

690
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,100
I…

691
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,269
I know exactly how that feels.

692
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:46,441
…have never once doubted…

693
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:47,526
It's all my fault.

694
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:49,569
…the kind heart he has…

695
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,947
They lost their son.

696
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,534
…toward this world

697
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:58,328
-that we lived in.
-I'm here.

698
00:49:58,412 --> 00:49:59,830
-Have some of this.
-Not once.

699
00:50:00,997 --> 00:50:02,124
Hey.

700
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,041
Come sit.

701
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,418
Come on.

702
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,676
Stay a bit longer.

703
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,304
-We can eat together.
-That's okay.

704
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,849
You should save it for tomorrow.

705
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,517
Don't worry about tomorrow.

706
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:22,018
I'll be back.

707
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:24,563
Enjoy your meal. Goodbye.

708
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,022
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

709
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,274
-Come by again.
-I will.

710
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,489
-Goodbye.
-Go home safely.

711
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:35,532
-Okay.
-Go on.

712
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,662
Goodbye. Go home safely.

713
00:50:40,746 --> 00:50:41,997
-Okay.
-Bye.

714
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,834
HAJEONG-DONG, SINYANG-GU

715
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,921
She must work at the community center.

716
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,047
No.

717
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,009
I asked her and she said she didn't.

718
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,471
Then where?

719
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,015
I'm not sure. I don't even know her name.

720
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,892
She won't tell me.

721
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,228
But you haven't told me
where you're from either, young man.

722
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,815
I'm not that young.

723
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,817
Goodness. Are you married?

724
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:13,111
You look so young.

725
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:14,237
I have a child.

726
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,908
-A child?
-Ma'am, the stew is getting cold.

727
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,493
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

728
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,565
It's been three years now.

729
00:51:51,107 --> 00:51:52,734
Who could it be?

730
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,861
They sent us a hefty sum.

731
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:55,821
Exactly.

732
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:59,533
-And it's anonymous, so they'll be taxed.
-Did the Anonymous Angel come by again?

733
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:03,370
Yes. Along with a million won,
just like the other times.

734
00:52:03,453 --> 00:52:04,913
Let me help.

735
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:06,456
-Let's put it on the cart.
-Okay.

736
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,083
-One, two…
-One, two…

737
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,592
I fixed it,
so it should last you a bit longer.

738
00:52:17,676 --> 00:52:20,887
Goodness, thank you.
You're better than my own kids.

739
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:31,356
-I'll get going.
-Hold on.

740
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,276
Here.

741
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,194
-Thank you.
-Go on.

742
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,362
Goodbye.

743
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,745
Goodness. You're here.

744
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,455
Hello. Have you been well?

745
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,291
Have some apples.

746
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:50,625
Okay.

747
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:39,633
SINYANG-GU SENIOR WELFARE CENTER

748
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:02,155
Ma'am.

749
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,782
Ma'am, the meat--

750
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,249
You're here.

751
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,460
-Hello.
-Goodness.

752
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,390
-Eat up.
-Okay.

753
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,226
Thank you.

754
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,813
I'll get you some rice tea.

755
00:54:34,896 --> 00:54:35,814
Let me.

756
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:39,484
It's okay. You two stay and eat.
I'll go get it.

757
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,735
Sit down.

758
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:41,695
Come on.

759
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,926
About that rice…

760
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:09,723
I didn't tell anyone, so don't worry.

761
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,392
Thank you.

762
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,783
My name is Nam Joong-do.

763
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:29,826
What's your name?

764
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,119
I'm Hye-joo.

765
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,496
Kim Hye-joo.

766
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,666
Ms. Kim Hye-joo.

767
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:38,960
How pretty.

768
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:45,050
I meant your name. You have a pretty name.

769
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,296
My child died

770
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,341
because of you.

771
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,221
Get out!

772
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,348
How dare you come here?

773
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,266
Get out of here this instant!

774
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:36,267
Get out!

775
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,771
How dare you set foot in here?

776
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,363
Mom, I'm hungry. Let's eat.

777
00:56:48,446 --> 00:56:51,116
-I don't want to.
-We haven't eaten together in a while.

778
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,952
Why are you being so friendly? Let me go.

779
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:56,871
-Mom.
-Did you forget that you left me?

780
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,479
Will you have the baby?

781
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:27,360
I'm not sure. Would you prefer that?

782
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,782
I guess that depends on who the father is.

783
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,245
Ji-hoon might not be the father.

784
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:43,960
You're right.

785
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,629
He might not be.

786
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:11,070
I LOVE YOU, MOM AND DAD.
SINCERELY, NAM JI-HOON

787
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,844
TROLLEY

788
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:38,723
You know that I gave you up
to share with the world, right?

789
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,266
I just want to be here with you.

790
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,144
I came by to see you,
so I'll just be doing that.

791
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,771
Are you going to stay in that house?

792
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,397
Then lay low, as if you're dead.

793
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,899
Don't get too attached to her.

794
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,442
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

795
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:50,568
I got tested for drugs.

796
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,655
I don't know what to feel
whenever I see her.

797
00:58:53,738 --> 00:58:56,533
Frankly, I'm very disappointed
in your wife.

798
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,284
Youngsan? Why all of a sudden?

799
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:00,954
It's your hometown,
so I was wondering if you knew anyone.

800
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:02,872
If you had to choose

801
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:05,959
between the world you dream of
and your wife,

802
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,794
which one would you choose?

803
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:13,299
