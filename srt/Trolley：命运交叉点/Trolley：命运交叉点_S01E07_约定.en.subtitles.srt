1
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,182
Be here by 3:30 p.m. today.

2
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,529
Okay. I'll be there by 3:30 p.m.

3
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,378
Why isn't she picking up?

4
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,341
Mom, you'll be home around 4 p.m., right?

5
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,803
MOM

6
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,181
-Mom.
-Why do you keep calling me when I'm busy?

7
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,769
You weren't replying to my texts
or picking up your phone.

8
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,230
You'll be home at 4 p.m., right?

9
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,315
Yes. I will.

10
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,858
Why do you keep pestering me?

11
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,026
What is this about?

12
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,904
Well…

13
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,157
-The thing is--
-Hold on.

14
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,993
Ki-young!

15
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,705
Ma'am, you can discuss the rest with him.

16
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,124
-Okay.
-All right.

17
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,875
Seung-hee, what were you saying?

18
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,877
Why is Ki-young there?

19
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,295
He went to work this morning.

20
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,714
I told him to come
for the provisional contract.

21
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,924
Why do you need me at home?

22
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,346
If the real estate agent drove you there,

23
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,348
will you ride back with Ki-young?

24
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,058
Yes. Why?

25
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,145
Can't I have your husband do anything?

26
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,938
What's up with you?

27
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,232
Are you really sure

28
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,986
that Jae-eun framed Seung-ho?

29
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:41,786
Mom, tell him to drop you off
and go straight to work.

30
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,497
Don't let him come home with you.

31
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:46,583
Come by yourself, okay?

32
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,085
All right. I got it.

33
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,295
My goodness.

34
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,463
Why won't she get off my back?

35
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:54,382
Ki-young!

36
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:55,800
Coming.

37
00:03:04,809 --> 00:03:06,477
Eat with us before you go.

38
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:07,562
Yes, I will.

39
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,670
Ms. Kim heard about
Namgoong Sol's video leak

40
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,172
and called me.

41
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:35,924
She seemed very frightened,

42
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,926
but I explained so that she'd understand.

43
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,928
And I'm done here in Youngsan.

44
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,809
Hey, did you look into it?

45
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:47,936
Yes, sir.

46
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,314
What was it?

47
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:55,902
What?

48
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,530
But when Lee Yoo-sin's son died,

49
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,909
the case was closed
with no one left to indict,

50
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,496
so even the director
doesn't know the truth.

51
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:11,834
Sir?

52
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,920
Good work, Mr. Jang.

53
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:17,298
I need some time to think.

54
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:19,884
Yes, I'll call you back.

55
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,150
Your husband is an assemblyman, no less,

56
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,735
and the elections are coming up.

57
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,738
Should we see what happens?

58
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:46,077
All right, Ms. Lee.

59
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,162
Get home safe.

60
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:49,747
Thank you for today.

61
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,417
No, I should be thanking you.
Get home safe.

62
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:58,172
Wait, can you charge my phone?

63
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,215
Sure.

64
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,301
What time is it?

65
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,553
I told Seung-hee I'd be home by 4 p.m.

66
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,512
It's 3:10 p.m.

67
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,014
I won't be late then.

68
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,518
And Seung-hee told me to come home alone.

69
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,270
-Just you?
-Yes.

70
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,856
She kept pestering me
to come home by 4 p.m.

71
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,984
When she found out you were here,
she told me not to bring you home.

72
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,862
Why does she want me to come alone?

73
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,405
Ki-young.

74
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,324
Things will…

75
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,118
get better soon.

76
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,997
So I told Jae-eun

77
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,583
to come and apologize to Mom.

78
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,960
Don't tell her anything yet.

79
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:39,339
Are you guys scheming
at something behind my back?

80
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,757
Ms. Lee,

81
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,800
I need to make a quick phone call.

82
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,803
I just told you I had to hurry.

83
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,858
KI-YOUNG

84
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,449
The person you are trying to reach is…

85
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,701
SEUNG-HEE

86
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:09,702
RECENT CALLS
SEUNG-HEE

87
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,751
KIM HYE-J…

88
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:30,264
CHOI KI-YOUNG (YOUNGSAN)

89
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,310
Hello, Nam Joong-do speaking.

90
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:38,940
Pardon?

91
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,985
THE PROMISE

92
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,830
HUSBAND

93
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,884
HYE-JOO

94
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,494
If Hye-joo does come,
it'll be around 4 p.m.

95
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,969
TOWARD YOUNGSAN INTERSECTION

96
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,426
My mom will be here soon.

97
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,722
Your phone was off.

98
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,475
I called in case you changed your mind.

99
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,061
But you found your way here.

100
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,899
I used to come here often.

101
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,281
The house hasn't changed at all, has it?

102
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,701
It's the same

103
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,495
as it was 20 years ago.

104
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,560
Go wash your face.

105
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,147
And wipe your tears off.

106
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:10,776
Don't you dare try to make
my mom feel sorry for you.

107
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,778
You got that?

108
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:40,848
Hye-joo.

109
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,182
Ms. Jin.

110
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,521
Ms. Jin!

111
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,220
Seung-hee, what's wrong?

112
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:24,577
Honey.

113
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,120
Hye-joo.

114
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,914
Ms. Jin,

115
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,000
open the door right now.

116
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:33,335
Now!

117
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,096
Hye-joo.

118
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,940
Why are you here?

119
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,816
Come on, let's go.

120
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,569
You can just go.

121
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,905
I need to handle this myself, so just go.

122
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:45,741
There's nothing for you to handle.

123
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,702
You shouldn't be here in the first place.

124
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:50,913
What do you mean?

125
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,958
Why shouldn't she be here?

126
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,626
Ms. Jin, I'm warning you.

127
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,336
-If you ever--
-Honey, please.

128
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:01,840
I'm here to apologize.

129
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,177
-So please just go.
-Why would you apologize?

130
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,305
You did nothing wrong.

131
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,685
I'm sure you can empathize with her.

132
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:19,024
I heard someone died
because of you as well.

133
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,652
That medical student.

134
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:23,320
Seung-hee, that's…

135
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,783
That's a different matter.
Let's just talk about us.

136
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,244
It was an unfortunate accident.

137
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:32,621
Just like what happened to her.

138
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,960
An accident?

139
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,713
Fine.

140
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:45,009
Let's say it was an accident
since she didn't stab him or anything.

141
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:50,014
But that kid wouldn't have died
if you hadn't talked about him on TV.

142
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,268
That means you killed that med student.

143
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,437
Seung-hee, please.

144
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,439
Seung-hee.

145
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:05,154
I had no idea Seung-ho
would do such a thing.

146
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,741
That was an accident no one wished for.

147
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,035
But…

148
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,537
I guess we won't need
to investigate any further.

149
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,497
Why not?

150
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:16,498
Why?

151
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,917
Because that's the law.

152
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,585
When the assailant dies,

153
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:20,753
there's no one to indict.

154
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,588
So there's no longer an investigation.

155
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,716
We're done here. You may go.

156
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,676
That's it?

157
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,680
Then what about me?

158
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,765
What do you mean?

159
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,100
If it ends here,

160
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,310
am I just supposed to…

161
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,396
live the rest of my life as a liar?

162
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,650
Look, kid.

163
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,734
He died.

164
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,695
Didn't you see his mom faint from shock?

165
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,530
So what more do you want?

166
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,825
Do you want to destroy
a family that just lost a son?

167
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,961
I'm also a victim
of that unfortunate accident.

168
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,131
A victim?

169
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,467
Are you here to spew that nonsense?

170
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:11,762
I lost my opportunity to reveal the truth
because Seung-ho died,

171
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,264
and I couldn't plead for help either.

172
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,642
So I'm also a victim.

173
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,686
-Kim Jae-eun.
-But…

174
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:22,481
regardless of my intentions,
bad things happened.

175
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,526
And as a result,
I caused your family great pain.

176
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,112
So once your mother arrives,

177
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:30,572
I'll get on my knees and beg for mercy.

178
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,157
I'll do anything you ask.

179
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,077
If that will make her feel better.

180
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,287
You should let the world know as well.

181
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,665
That you're a murderer

182
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,835
and that you ruined my entire family.

183
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,462
-Don't be ridiculous!
-I can't do that.

184
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,092
I can't do that, Seung-hee.

185
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,594
You can't?

186
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,304
Why not?

187
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,390
You said you'd apologize to my mom.

188
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,600
Why can't you tell everyone else about it?

189
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,145
Because…

190
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,648
I didn't lie.

191
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:10,362
Seung-ho was a beloved son
and a model student.

192
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,699
I don't deny that fact because it's true.

193
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,870
But that same model student of a son…

194
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,291
He molested me. That's also true.

195
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,298
I didn't…

196
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,593
lie about anything.

197
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,150
Just don't apologize then.

198
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,236
If that's what you're really thinking,

199
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,363
I don't need your apology.

200
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,742
I'm so glad my mom
wasn't here to hear this.

201
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,828
So just leave before she comes.

202
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,123
-Seung-hee.
-And one more thing.

203
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,336
Don't resent me for the things
I do from this point on.

204
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,547
You brought this upon yourself.

205
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,716
Seung-hee.

206
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,344
But I still don't get it.

207
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,846
You lost your son as well.

208
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,015
How can you not empathize with us?

209
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,642
Right.

210
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,436
-He wasn't your biological son, was he?
-Ms. Jin!

211
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:27,940
Watch what you say.

212
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:31,360
What's the matter? That's also true.

213
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:34,321
You're all about the truth, aren't you?

214
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:39,159
Then tell me the truth.

215
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,204
If everything you're saying is true,

216
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,040
does that mean Seung-ho deserved to die?

217
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,667
No, Seung-hee.

218
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,627
That's not what I'm saying here!

219
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,920
Then what are you saying?

220
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,714
Why did you have to
make Seung-ho die, Kim Jae-eun?

221
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,510
She's Kim Hye-joo.

222
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,101
Not Kim Jae-eun.

223
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,186
Please stop calling her that.

224
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,523
You're free to do

225
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,775
whatever it is that you want to do.

226
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:16,029
But if you ever contact my wife again
and mistreat her like this,

227
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,950
I will make you pay for it.

228
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,225
I had no choice.

229
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,247
Mr. Jang.

230
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,044
I'm in Youngsan.

231
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:15,005
I'll text you an address.
Could you send a tow truck?

232
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,842
Yes. It's my wife's car,
but it's under my name.

233
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,929
No one's hurt. Yes.

234
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,723
Just take care of it quickly
without involving insurance.

235
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:26,934
Okay, thanks.

236
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:33,857
Just…

237
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,735
forget all about this.

238
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,300
Goodness.

239
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,054
Good grief. What's this?

240
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:05,013
Whose car is this?

241
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:13,814
Seung-hee.

242
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:14,898
Seung-hee!

243
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,986
Seung-hee, what's all that mess outside?

244
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,697
Did you crash into that car?

245
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,991
Is that why you rushed me?

246
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,784
No.

247
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,494
What's with that car then?

248
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,038
Why won't you answer me?

249
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,082
Did you do something wrong?

250
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,752
No, I didn't do anything.

251
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,838
There's no need to raise your voice.

252
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,258
Hey.

253
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,801
-Seung-hee!
-Where are you going?

254
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,346
Where are you going without me?

255
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,600
Seung-hee.

256
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:54,521
Yes, that's Jae-eun's car.

257
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,565
I told her to come and apologize.

258
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,566
Happy?

259
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:58,942
Are you hurt anywhere?

260
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:02,404
You're okay, right?

261
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,239
You're not hurt, are you?

262
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:06,450
No.

263
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,201
I'm fine.

264
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,245
That's a relief.

265
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:12,873
Wait.

266
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,666
-Where is Hye-joo--
-It's Kim Jae-eun.

267
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,878
The person who caused Seung-ho's death

268
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,339
is Kim Jae-eun, not Kim Hye-joo.

269
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,924
-Seung-hee.
-Don't follow me.

270
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:25,677
Don't worry.

271
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,679
I'm not going to kill myself.

272
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,993
Hello, Mr. Choi.

273
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,787
You were home.

274
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,192
Stop lying.

275
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,402
We're friends. Don't you trust me?

276
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,946
Of course I do.

277
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,491
Do you not…

278
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,285
believe your own family?

279
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,247
Yes.

280
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,582
I do.

281
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:53,390
300,000 won, right?

282
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:54,891
Yes.

283
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,853
This is brand new.

284
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,022
This is such a bargain.

285
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,691
Thank you.

286
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:22,252
Hey.

287
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:29,968
Pay up.

288
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,095
You need to pay for that.

289
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,390
Ms. Hyeon, she didn't pay.

290
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,268
Hey, why are you leaving without--

291
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,354
Come back for some kalguksu, okay?

292
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:42,939
-Be careful not to spill that.
-But--

293
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:43,982
Go on.

294
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:44,900
Bye.

295
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,987
FREE FOOD FOR CHILDREN, TEENAGERS,
AND PREGNANT WOMEN

296
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,749
Thank you.

297
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:12,802
You can have this.

298
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,221
I got it for you.

299
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:16,473
For me?

300
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,475
Why?

301
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,562
The weather is dry these days.

302
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,689
Your lips could be chapped.

303
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,233
And that would hurt.

304
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,823
Make sure you use it.

305
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,118
Aren't you getting one for yourself?

306
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:47,420
Hey.

307
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,714
Why did you get dumplings again
and not kalguksu?

308
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,300
I had some in the afternoon.

309
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:56,304
The lady told me to come by
in the evening for some dumplings.

310
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:57,931
Why not in the afternoon?

311
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:01,518
My older sister comes home late
from her part-time job.

312
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:06,439
So the lady told me to come back
for freshly steamed ones.

313
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,443
Goodbye.

314
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,364
-About that lady.
-Pardon?

315
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,450
Don't trust that kalguksu lady.

316
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,368
She's a hypocrite.

317
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,203
What's a hypocrite?

318
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,247
She pretends to be someone she's not.

319
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,126
-Pardon?
-Good deeds don't make her a good person.

320
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,460
Why not?

321
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:29,921
Forget it.

322
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,757
Keep going there
for kalguksu and dumplings.

323
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,134
Okay.

324
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,804
-Go on. Bye.
-Goodbye.

325
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,642
Thank you

326
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,520
for the lip balm.

327
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,105
Bye.

328
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,672
No, we don't want money for the car.

329
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,090
Just mail us what was inside.

330
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,925
Yes.

331
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:18,928
Okay. Goodbye.

332
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:26,061
She should have just stayed out of it
while her husband sorts everything out.

333
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,527
Let's suppose that Ms. Lee
exposes Ms. Kim,

334
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:37,697
claiming that Ms. Kim
was the one responsible

335
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,824
for the death
of her model student of a son.

336
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,702
People will start criticizing Ms. Kim.

337
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,746
What would we do in response?

338
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,295
We would claim that Mr. Jin Seung-ho
was an assailant of sexual assault.

339
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,548
What do you think would happen next?

340
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,384
Then what would happen?

341
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,388
Ms. Lee Yoo-sin would
sue us for defamation.

342
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,931
Of course she would.

343
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,141
But defamation of the deceased is

344
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,227
only punishable
if the statement is untrue.

345
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,646
And this case was never investigated

346
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,815
due to Jin Seung-ho's death.

347
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:15,318
To be exact, there was no time
to uncover the truth.

348
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:19,614
Which is why there's room for dispute
in regard to whether Jin Seung-ho

349
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,158
actually committed the crime.

350
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:26,079
It'll be a messy fight.

351
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,372
Absolutely.

352
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:31,960
Her beloved son was supposed to have died
of a tragic heart attack on the same day

353
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,045
he got into the SNU School of Law.

354
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:38,383
His sexual assault charges would
become the talk of the town.

355
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:41,553
No parent would want that.

356
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,144
I'm telling you that you'd be
spitting on both of our faces.

357
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,896
Here's another thing.

358
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,567
There is no evidence
or a witness for Ms. Kim's case,

359
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:58,153
so it'll just be
a case of "he said, she said."

360
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,740
But what about
Ms. Lee's real estate speculation?

361
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,493
Do you really think
that we have no proof of it?

362
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,418
Are you suggesting

363
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,212
that we make a deal
and sweep everything under the rug?

364
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,632
A deal?

365
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,427
Isn't a deal usually made

366
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,014
between two parties
that are on par with each other?

367
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,478
I'm just trying to

368
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,981
explain the current situation.

369
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,443
You didn't seem to understand.

370
00:29:51,206 --> 00:29:52,207
Yeong-su.

371
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,593
Jeez.

372
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,803
Did I keep you waiting?

373
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,888
I guess I waited an appropriate amount.

374
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,517
I didn't expect you
to cover the story right away.

375
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,436
It was recently revealed
that he had uploaded

376
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,105
his illegal video of his ex-girlfriend

377
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:20,026
on pornography websites
right before he committed suicide.

378
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,570
You told me you had a scoop.

379
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,365
You had the nerve to call me
so early in the morning,

380
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,909
and now you're complaining
that I covered it early?

381
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,202
It was just too soon.

382
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,329
Either way,

383
00:30:31,412 --> 00:30:33,832
I feel bad for that med student's mom,

384
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,209
but what he did was awful.

385
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,877
I get that he was about to die,

386
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,589
but how could he leak the video
right before he jumped?

387
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,843
Anyway, I'm famished.

388
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,470
Right. What do you want to eat?

389
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,727
-I'll see you next time.
-Goodbye.

390
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,313
All right.

391
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:00,942
My goodness.

392
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,903
Look who it is!

393
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,574
-Hello.
-Hello.

394
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,993
Do you enjoy tofu dishes?

395
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,789
I bet thousands of ex-convicts

396
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,876
ate tofu thanks to you
back when you were a judge.

397
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:21,337
You know,

398
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:25,925
there's a quiet little tofu jeongol place
behind the Blue House.

399
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:27,844
Let me treat you sometime.

400
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:29,888
Goodness.

401
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:34,934
But you probably don't want to
have a meal with someone like me.

402
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,855
I was so excited
that we had something in common

403
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,024
that I got ahead of myself.

404
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,862
Please do understand.

405
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,531
I would like that.

406
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,782
Sorry?

407
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:54,078
A shared goal is more important
than with whom you sit.

408
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,288
Right.

409
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:58,625
Plus, I couldn't have jeongol on my own.

410
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,461
Let's eat together when the time is right.

411
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,340
-Now if you'll excuse me.
-Sure.

412
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:07,926
Goodbye.

413
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,523
That's a bribe.

414
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:23,942
Pardon?

415
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,486
My sister-in-law has been

416
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:30,031
whining to my wife about
her land problems every single day.

417
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,910
She complained to her for hours
on the phone earlier.

418
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:39,499
Given the situation,
I couldn't go home empty-handed.

419
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,834
Assemblyman Nam hasn't made any moves,

420
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,211
so I think he might drop it.

421
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,381
I doubt it.

422
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,425
He's not the type to back off that easily.

423
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:55,682
YOUNGSAN HIGH SCHOOL

424
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,354
Seung-hee, call me.

425
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,481
At least tell me where you are.

426
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:05,191
Have you eaten?

427
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,403
I'm worried about you. Please pick up.

428
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,157
Seung-hee, where are you?

429
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,731
Don't do anything stupid.

430
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,024
Just stay put for now.

431
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:49,235
-Uncle--
-You have no witnesses or proof.

432
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:53,281
If you act rashly,
Nam Joong-do will retaliate.

433
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,700
Don't provoke him if you're not ready.

434
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,618
Just stay put.

435
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,287
Got it?

436
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,707
Why aren't you answering me?

437
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,795
All right.

438
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:10,590
We'll talk later.

439
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:12,967
I'll be in touch.

440
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,857
-Hyeong-tae.
-Yes, sir.

441
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:34,072
How are your old buddies doing?

442
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,700
I'm afraid I don't know
who you're talking about.

443
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,913
Have I ever

444
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,582
told you about my wife's niece

445
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,585
who almost pursued a legal profession?

446
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,969
You should head in first.
I'll go park the car.

447
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,439
Why aren't you asking me anything?

448
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:14,612
Why aren't you asking me
how I knew you'd be there?

449
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,954
I got a call from Mr. Choi
when I was in Sangju.

450
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,581
He said you might be coming to Youngsan.

451
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:32,463
I'm sorry.

452
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,007
For what?

453
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,510
This could complicate things for you…

454
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:42,431
with the election coming up, right?

455
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:47,520
Probably.

456
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:54,694
Will you go back there
and apologize if you're sorry?

457
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,907
You can't, can you?

458
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:03,452
If you were capable
of making a fake apology,

459
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,372
you would have done so
even if I dissuaded you.

460
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,792
So don't be sorry.

461
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:11,878
You did the right thing.

462
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,925
Plus, they wouldn't have dropped it
even if you had apologized.

463
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,553
So don't answer her calls anymore.

464
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,555
I'll take care of this.

465
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,642
What will you do?

466
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,979
I'll have to think about it.

467
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,357
But still,

468
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,238
you don't have to do anything
or worry about anything.

469
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,658
You trust me, right?

470
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,620
You just have to forget…

471
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,206
about everything.

472
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,170
Also,

473
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,589
Hye-joo.

474
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,175
Yes?

475
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,220
About your past.

476
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,556
You don't need to explain anything to me.

477
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,686
There may be no proof or witnesses,

478
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,565
but I still believe you.

479
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,570
Because it's you.

480
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,688
SINYANG YOGURT 50TH ANNIVERSARY EVENT

481
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,573
DEAR ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

482
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,046
-Ms. Cho.
-Ms. Cho.

483
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,215
Ms. Cho!

484
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,258
Ms. Cho.

485
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,720
Mr. Jang.

486
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,431
It's me.

487
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,017
-Ms. Cho.
-Could you tell me Namgoong Sol's address?

488
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,561
-Ms. Cho.
-I think her grandmother is

489
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,396
in a bad place, psychologically.

490
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,731
Ms. Cho!

491
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,441
Yes.

492
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:40,943
I'm at the mill.

493
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,654
Please hurry.

494
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:44,780
Over here.

495
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,828
-Are you the one who called?
-Yes.

496
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:53,205
And you think someone
is attempting suicide in here?

497
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:55,374
We're not sure. This is her workplace.

498
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,794
We're looking into her home address,
so please check here first.

499
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,755
We can't force the door open

500
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,840
if you're not sure.

501
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:07,970
Wait, isn't he an assemblyman?

502
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,764
I'm Assemblyman Nam Joong-do of Sinyang.

503
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,017
I'll take responsibility for everything.

504
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,227
Please hurry.

505
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,368
Hello? Yes.

506
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,204
Do you have the last location
of her phone signal?

507
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,247
Yes. Is this it?

508
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,874
All right.

509
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,468
Ma'am, are you all right?

510
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,930
Ma'am!

511
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,309
Wake up, ma'am!

512
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,149
She's conscious!

513
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,503
JEONGSUN MEDICAL CENTER

514
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,577
Honey.

515
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,838
Dear Assemblyman Nam.

516
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,299
We can't disclose
our students' personal information.

517
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,635
Please, I beg of you.

518
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:15,139
My granddaughter died because of him.

519
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,350
I am just so upset,

520
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,644
and I want to confront his parents.

521
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:23,314
We really can't do that, ma'am.
You should leave.

522
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:38,120
Honestly, he wasn't really the type
to take illegal videos

523
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,371
or blackmail someone.

524
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,414
You're right.

525
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,750
Maybe she was after his money.

526
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,751
His money?

527
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:45,294
That's not true!

528
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:49,507
That's not true.

529
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,425
You better watch what you say!

530
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:57,264
He killed himself because he was guilty
and didn't want to go to prison.

531
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:03,103
And in the end,
he leaked the video to the world!

532
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,535
Please let my death be covered on the news

533
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,288
so that the world will know

534
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:24,250
-my granddaughter's misfortune
-My poor baby.

535
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,418
and all the horrid things

536
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:28,963
that he did to her.

537
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,674
I beg of you.

538
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,761
Dear Assemblyman Nam.

539
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:39,431
I am ending my life

540
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,977
because it tears me apart
that he didn't pay for his crimes.

541
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:47,189
Please help me

542
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,109
so that my death won't be in vain.

543
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:55,322
I beg of you.

544
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:01,161
I couldn't answer her back there.

545
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,873
Does that mean Seung-ho deserved to die?

546
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,419
I…

547
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,338
despised Seung-ho.

548
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:15,968
I went to the police station
because I wanted him to be punished.

549
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:18,971
But I have never thought

550
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:23,434
that he deserved to die.

551
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:29,481
His death tormented me even more.

552
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:33,902
And a part of me was resentful.

553
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,488
I was called a liar.

554
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:40,200
But the thing is…

555
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,580
I could never speak for myself.
Do you know why?

556
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,292
Because he died.

557
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,173
So why…

558
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,469
Why is it happening all over again?

559
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,517
I'll do it.

560
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,023
I'll make sure to find a way

561
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:12,983
so that no one has to

562
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:16,195
face injustice ever again.

563
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,199
Trust me.

564
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,941
Don't think about anything
and get some rest.

565
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,195
So much happened today.

566
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,156
I'll be working in the study.

567
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:02,491
Get some sleep.

568
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,034
Okay.

569
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,088
Rest up.

570
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,031
Is Ms. Kim okay?

571
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,800
If you mess with her
or hurt her in any way,

572
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,386
you won't be able to
handle the consequences.

573
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:36,293
Ms. Kim used to be
all alone with no family,

574
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:37,628
but that's no longer the case.

575
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:41,590
And that is a significant difference.

576
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,137
-Seung-hee.
-I'm tired. I'm going to sleep.

577
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:06,240
COMMENTS FROM RELATED ORGANIZATIONS,
TO BE REVIEWED THOROUGHLY

578
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,348
Yes.

579
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,310
I already told you last time.

580
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:20,647
We need something more than just rumors
about new roads being built.

581
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,232
Yes.

582
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,152
All right. Goodbye.

583
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:32,242
You took photos of the land
last time we went together, right?

584
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:33,452
Send them to me.

585
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,537
After I'm done eating.

586
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,913
Just send them now!

587
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,999
It doesn't even take that long.

588
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:41,918
Fine.

589
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:45,756
Jeez.

590
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:49,259
You should have
just settled down in Canada

591
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,803
if you were going to treat me like this.

592
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,056
Or you should have gone
to Australia with Ki-young.

593
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,057
Mom.

594
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,351
I got them.

595
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,687
That's right.

596
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:06,151
This place would be perfect
with some roads.

597
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:14,618
Who taught you table manners?

598
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,621
Jeez.

599
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:22,167
Seung-ho should be here.

600
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,002
Not that little brat.

601
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,504
Mother.

602
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:29,091
Hey, I checked the photos again.

603
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,718
And I still think it's too expensive.

604
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:41,186
3 YEARS AGO

605
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,771
You want to study abroad in Canada?

606
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:43,689
By yourself?

607
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:45,857
Yes.

608
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,029
I'm going to lose my mind
if I spend any more time with my mom.

609
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:57,119
But I'm too worried
to leave her all by herself.

610
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:00,247
But Seung-hee,

611
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,332
we're married.

612
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,292
You can't just leave me here.

613
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,628
I just want to take a breather,

614
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,964
but I can't leave her alone.

615
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,717
So…

616
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,886
please stay with her, Ki-young.

617
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,304
Please?

618
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:18,056
I'll be back soon.

619
00:50:18,974 --> 00:50:20,392
Please, Ki-young.

620
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:51,339
ENTER PIN

621
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:04,686
Soo-bin.

622
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:08,940
What are you doing?

623
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:11,359
You were in the bathroom.

624
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,575
Please don't go into my room
when I'm not here.

625
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:21,870
Okay.

626
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:23,872
I'm sorry.

627
00:51:25,957 --> 00:51:27,501
I'm off to work.

628
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,169
I'll see you later.

629
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:30,504
Bye.

630
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,169
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JI-HOON

631
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:16,091
INCOMING CALL

632
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,404
Don't worry about the hospital bill

633
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:39,614
and focus on getting better.

634
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:42,868
Thank you.

635
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,912
Thank you so much, ma'am.

636
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,981
There's a hairline fracture here.

637
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:16,234
-It must have hurt to move around.
-Yes.

638
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,613
Anyway, you need to give it
some time to heal on its own.

639
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,240
Try to avoid
any rigorous physical activities,

640
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,909
and I'll prescribe you some painkillers.

641
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,410
Take them when the pain gets worse.

642
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:27,412
Okay. Thank you.

643
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:39,090
HYE-JOO

644
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:48,850
I didn't want to come here.
Why do you keep making me?

645
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:50,018
Hello.

646
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:51,978
Hello, Doctor.

647
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,041
NAM JOONG-DO

648
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,795
NAM JOONG-DO HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR MEDICAL STUDENT'S DEATH

649
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,254
NAM JOONG-DO TO REFORM
DIGITAL SEX CRIME LAW

650
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,131
NAM'S INVESTIGATION ON
KANG SOON-HONG'S FAMILY PUT ON HOLD

651
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:29,808
SORT BY DATE

652
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,606
MOTHER OF DECEASED MEDICAL STUDENT
ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

653
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,085
Hello?

654
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,421
MOTHER OF DECEASED MEDICAL STUDENT
ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

655
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:04,551
Don't provoke him if you're not ready.

656
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,594
Just stay put.

657
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,238
Hey, Seong-chang.

658
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,239
It's me.

659
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:30,201
I'd like to know the number
of a person who was on the news.

660
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,830
Your sister-in-law is a reporter, right?

661
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,791
As you all know,

662
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:39,377
if an assailant dies after being sued,

663
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,505
the prosecution loses
its right of arraignment

664
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,549
and the investigation ends there.

665
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:47,510
But when it comes to sex crime cases,

666
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,764
the suspect's death
will not only end the case

667
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:53,975
but also prevent the truth
from being uncovered.

668
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:57,103
As a result, the victim will suffer
secondary victimization.

669
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,734
Therefore, I would like to propose
an amendment to the sex crime law

670
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,236
that allows investigations to continue

671
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:10,325
by retaining the prosecution's
right of arraignment

672
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:14,412
even when the suspect is deceased
due to suicide or otherwise.

673
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:19,459
Sir,

674
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:24,714
similar amendments were
proposed during the last term,

675
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:28,218
but the Legislation and Judiciary
Committee rejected them.

676
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:29,177
She's right.

677
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:30,887
Their expert member said

678
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,680
that they agreed with its intentions

679
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:35,391
but that there could be juridical issues.

680
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:37,811
You're right,

681
00:56:39,354 --> 00:56:40,605
which means

682
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:44,484
that it won't be easy
for this amendment to pass.

683
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:49,656
However, I believe that the
suicide of an accused or a suspect

684
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:53,618
shouldn't get in the way of
uncovering the truth

685
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:56,871
or destigmatizing the victims.

686
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,421
I'm with you. Let's do this.

687
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,759
The bill may not pass,

688
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,555
but if we manage to create a consensus
and bring this issue to light,

689
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,682
I think that would be meaningful enough.

690
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:16,599
No.

691
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,476
I'm not proposing the amendment

692
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,353
just to raise public awareness.

693
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,399
I will make sure it passes at all costs.

694
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,917
There have been amendments
with juridical issues in the past.

695
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,462
And legislation was only possible

696
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,214
thanks to strong support from the public.

697
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:51,217
As you all know,

698
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,053
nothing concerns the National Assembly
more than public opinion.

699
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,431
I am going to work with you

700
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,641
to convince the public

701
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,602
and gain their support.

702
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,818
I like you, Kim Jae-eun.

703
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,071
Jae-eun.

704
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,285
I mean, Hye-joo.

705
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:20,497
Hi.

706
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,420
What business did you have with Ki-young
that you came all the way here?

707
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,590
It's nothing.

708
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,718
Is there something you find suspicious?

709
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,929
It's a protective measure.

710
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,389
For her?

711
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:39,849
Or for yourself?

712
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,685
Don't be mistaken.

713
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:46,773
I'm asking you to do this as her husband,
not an assemblyman.

714
00:58:49,567 --> 00:58:51,903
But first, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

715
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,040
It's about my wife.

716
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:34,404
TROLLEY

717
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,739
All there's left will be controversy.

718
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:39,742
I wish the media would stop making
a bigger issue out of this.

719
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,786
You know what's great about the internet?

720
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:44,831
You throw them a bone,
and they all jump on it at once.

721
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:47,292
I don't want anyone
to get hurt because of me.

722
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,711
Look into that dead son of his.
