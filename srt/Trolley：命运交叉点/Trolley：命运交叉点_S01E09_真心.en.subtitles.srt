1
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:34,719
The police

2
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,555
didn't find the phone
Ji-hoon had been using.

3
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:05,416
SOO-BIN

4
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,632
Don't ever say you want to break up.

5
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,717
Do you have a death wish?

6
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,929
I'm going to kill myself.

7
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,105
I'M GOING TO KILL MYSELF

8
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,485
It wasn't…

9
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,530
an accident.

10
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,259
SOO-BIN

11
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,724
Soo-bin.

12
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:04,893
Soo-bin…

13
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,984
Soo-bin.

14
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,986
Soo-bin, what…

15
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,238
Soo-bin…

16
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,009
SINCERITY

17
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,684
Is that you, Soo-bin?

18
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,394
-Soo-bin--
-It's me.

19
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,771
You were home.

20
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,109
What's the matter? What is it?

21
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,113
What's wrong, Hye-joo?

22
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,158
What do I do?

23
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,536
-What's wrong?
-What do I do?

24
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,832
Yeo-jin, what do I do?

25
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,877
What's the matter?

26
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,552
Oh, right.

27
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,138
I heard a chief advisor
was caught soliciting sex.

28
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:06,556
It was on the news.

29
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,558
Whose advisor was it?
Anything on the group chat?

30
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:09,892
Not yet.

31
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,062
I hope it's not anyone
from our party this time.

32
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,567
Mr. Jang, didn't you once cover
a similar case when you were a reporter?

33
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,902
Do you remember who and which party?

34
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:22,822
That one? It was…

35
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,074
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

36
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,912
-That was a long meeting.
-Yes, it was.

37
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,503
HYEON YEO-JIN

38
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,713
Let's begin the meeting.

39
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,214
-Okay.
-Okay.

40
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,843
The person you are trying to reach is…

41
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,345
NAM JOONG-DO

42
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:49,474
I'M IN A MEETING.
I'LL CALL YOU BACK LATER.

43
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,768
Call me. It's urgent.

44
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:54,228
-Yeo-jin.
-Yes?

45
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,733
Do you think Soo-bin left
because she saw this?

46
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:03,988
Why else would she suddenly leave?

47
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,451
That can't be.

48
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,578
She couldn't have seen this.

49
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,791
Then why did she leave all of a sudden?

50
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,085
Yeo-jin.

51
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,088
Where do you think she is?

52
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:24,008
Do you think she went
to a single mothers' shelter?

53
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,514
How can I find her?
She doesn't even have a phone.

54
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,224
I…

55
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,227
I really need to find her.

56
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:38,272
I need to find out

57
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,858
what this is all about.

58
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:45,404
Get yourself together, Hye-joo.

59
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,160
Look.

60
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,955
Let's say we find her.

61
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,082
But when we do,

62
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,167
do you think you could
believe what she says?

63
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,170
I couldn't.

64
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,422
Look at this.

65
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,550
They had a rocky relationship.

66
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,385
She was scared that you'd find out.

67
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,388
Hye-joo.

68
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,015
Let's not look for her.

69
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,726
I think that'd be best for everyone.

70
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,272
They obviously had a bad breakup.

71
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,983
Who knows what she'll say
when we do find her?

72
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
No, Yeo-jin. She's still…

73
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,243
She's still the last person
that Ji-hoon talked to.

74
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:33,786
SOO-BIN

75
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,746
What did they talk about

76
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,790
that he suddenly--

77
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,307
Hello?

78
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,143
Hello, ma'am. Are you not at the studio?

79
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:01,022
I'm here with my son,
but it seems like no one is inside.

80
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:10,031
Welcome.

81
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,460
Mom.

82
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,546
Have you decided?

83
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,634
What will you do with the baby?

84
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,598
Mom.

85
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,020
Is that…

86
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,189
all you have to ask?

87
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,401
You acted the same way last time.

88
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:50,029
Do you even care about how I've been,

89
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,490
what I'm doing, or how I'm getting along?

90
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:54,909
Why don't you ask me those things?

91
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:56,953
Why?

92
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,583
You're pregnant?

93
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,711
Who's the father?

94
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,632
Do you not know who it is?

95
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,968
I know who the father is.

96
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,844
Hey, Mom.

97
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:16,180
Hi, Yun-seo.

98
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,432
Aren't you tired?

99
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,821
Ma'am.

100
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,242
Would you like a bag for 100 won?

101
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,165
Ma'am.

102
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,713
No. Just the reward points, please.

103
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,256
Here's my number.

104
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,972
Please look it up and give me my points.

105
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,224
Ma'am.

106
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,022
You forgot your purchase.

107
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,163
Your daughter shows up in 10 years
and says she's pregnant,

108
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,165
but you weren't worried at all.

109
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,083
How could you not even ask me

110
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,252
if I'm doing okay

111
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:30,588
or if I'm feeling sick?

112
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,381
Talk to me.

113
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,928
But that lady…

114
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,391
Do you know what she said to me
when I told her I'm pregnant?

115
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,310
By any chance, did Ji-hoon…

116
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:50,441
force you in any way without your consent?

117
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,526
She asked if it was consensual.

118
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,696
That's what she asked.

119
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:57,948
But you…

120
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,536
I gave you my number
after I told you I was pregnant.

121
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,830
How could you not call once?

122
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,210
Did you know

123
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,338
that I kept this phone on
in case you'd call?

124
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,928
What do you want me to do?

125
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,057
To take responsibility
for leaving you as a child?

126
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:26,644
Or are you here to ask me
to raise your baby?

127
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:27,561
Is that it?

128
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:34,902
I'd never ask you to do that.

129
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,946
Be happy with your new daughter.

130
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,408
Was it Yun-seo?

131
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,079
How do you know her name?

132
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,665
If you ever…

133
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:52,294
If you ever approach her
or try to hurt her,

134
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,712
I will make you regret it.

135
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,175
Sure.

136
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,761
I don't know what I was expecting.

137
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,307
I won't bother you again.

138
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,934
Goodbye.

139
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,146
Soo-bin.

140
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,691
That lady you mentioned earlier.

141
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,317
Who is she?

142
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,489
Is she forcing you to do things
you don't want for money?

143
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,199
What do you take me for--

144
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,368
Then who is she?

145
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,709
She's just a lady I know.

146
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,223
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

147
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,600
That's why I was torn about

148
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,228
whether I should tell my mom

149
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:35,397
that my dad is cheating.

150
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:36,815
You should've told me sooner.

151
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,567
I had no idea.

152
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,278
I just thought
you were being weird lately.

153
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:43,948
Sorry.

154
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,368
I feel much better
now that I got it off my chest.

155
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,120
Stay strong.

156
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,456
Thanks.

157
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,380
I actually have a secret too.

158
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,882
What is it?

159
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,510
You can't tell anybody about this.

160
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,310
What?

161
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,563
Your brother's girlfriend
showed up pregnant?

162
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:16,981
Yes.

163
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:19,275
I hate that she's living with us.

164
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,903
I understand.

165
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:23,988
Yes.

166
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,117
But I'm better off than you, right?

167
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,953
You have it worse. I mean, an affair…

168
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,539
It's so gross.

169
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,915
It's the worst.

170
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,507
As you can see, all the ripped pages

171
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,177
have been restored,

172
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:51,015
and all the stained pages
have been cleaned up.

173
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,809
I hope you like it. Please take a look.

174
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:54,935
Okay.

175
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,687
Goodness.

176
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:58,772
Touch it. Isn't it so pretty?

177
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,611
It got a complete makeover.

178
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,446
-What is this?
-It's a magpie.

179
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,199
A magpie flew into my arms in my dream
when I became pregnant with you.

180
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,160
You still remember that?

181
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:14,580
How could I ever forget that?

182
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,208
Right. Her son is the same age as you.

183
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:22,504
What was his conception dream?

184
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,424
I think you may have told me,
but I can't seem to remember.

185
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,386
I can't believe how brand new this looks.
This is so incredible.

186
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,512
Right?

187
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:40,189
I'm nearby, so call me
when your client leaves.

188
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,357
I'll come get you.

189
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,365
So…

190
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,742
you can't tell Ms. Kim

191
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,204
about this.

192
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,623
Okay?

193
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,092
Thank you so much for this.

194
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,969
I'll come again.

195
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,387
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

196
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,930
-I got it.
-Okay.

197
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,598
What do you want to eat?

198
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,350
-Seolleongtang?
-Sure.

199
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,519
-Are you okay with that?
-I love it.

200
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,539
Hey, honey.

201
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,585
Is something wrong?

202
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,713
Honey.

203
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:48,507
Honey.

204
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,094
Ji-hoon…

205
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,015
Honey, our Ji-hoon…

206
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,517
What's the matter?

207
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,273
Hye-joo!

208
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:08,485
She should try not to be
stressed out for a while.

209
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,529
Okay. Thank you.

210
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,679
-What did they say?
-She'll be okay

211
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,266
She was just really shocked.

212
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,110
I picked it up at her studio.

213
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:54,990
Thanks.

214
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,079
I'll stay with her.

215
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,580
You can go on home.

216
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:03,749
Okay.

217
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,669
Here's her bag.

218
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,047
Let me know when she wakes up.

219
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,468
Yeo-jin.

220
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,181
Please keep it a secret from Yoon-seo.

221
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,061
About what happened today
and everything else.

222
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,191
All right. I will.

223
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,110
Thanks.

224
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:19,825
Hye-joo.

225
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,413
Honey.

226
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:29,960
Honey.

227
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,338
Ji-hoon…

228
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,719
I'm sorry.

229
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,099
I didn't want you to know.

230
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:52,858
Sir,

231
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,235
please keep this a secret from my wife.

232
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,738
Whether he fell or walked into the water,

233
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,408
it's all the same to you.

234
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,163
If she hears about this,

235
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,290
she'll be crushed.

236
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,502
So just like the autopsy report suggests,

237
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,422
he has to have fallen due to intoxication.

238
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:20,886
But you know,

239
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,265
I think this could be good for us.

240
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,187
We can pin the blame for his death…

241
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,192
on that girl.

242
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,601
SEUNG-KYU'S DINING TABLE

243
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,829
We're closed for the day.

244
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,124
Excuse me.

245
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,837
Look at this.

246
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,092
I don't even know how they found
the restaurant's social media page.

247
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,095
We lost the will to live
after losing our son,

248
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,807
but we had to keep working
to make ends meet.

249
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:52,644
Regardless,

250
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,438
I can't believe that couple

251
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,898
both took innocent lives.

252
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,902
That's actually…

253
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,696
why I'm here.

254
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,616
Let's

255
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,244
work together as victims

256
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,330
and make something happen.

257
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,098
Stay safe, Soo-bin.

258
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,602
Both you and your baby, okay?

259
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,479
I'm Ji-hoon's mom,

260
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,150
so I'd be lying if I said
I didn't want to see the baby.

261
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:44,154
The fetus died,
but it's still in your womb,

262
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,822
so you need surgery.

263
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,951
You can't tell Ms. Kim about this.

264
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,876
Hyeong-tae,

265
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,836
did the old man have good things to say?

266
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,214
I haven't reported back to him.

267
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,049
I don't know how she's
related to Nam Joong-do.

268
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,384
If I'm not thorough,
he'll give me an earful.

269
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:08,762
You fixed up the package
you opened, right?

270
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:12,015
Come on. That's my specialty.

271
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,271
I'm positive that I've seen her before,

272
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,940
but I can't put my finger on it.

273
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,359
Maybe she's a call girl.

274
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,029
I think she's the dead son's girlfriend.

275
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,073
Judging by his conduct,

276
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:31,827
-his girl could have been one of those.
-Don't be absurd.

277
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,788
I handpick my call girls.

278
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,373
She's not one of them.

279
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,293
Plus, I haven't seen one in a while
with the election coming up.

280
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,419
I need to be careful.

281
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:42,838
I see.

282
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,050
Right.

283
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,385
About that girl…

284
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,011
Who?

285
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,394
Other than the police,

286
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,314
does anyone else know
what really happened to Ji-hoon?

287
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,233
Woo-jae does.

288
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,570
Then honey.

289
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,782
Let's not tell Yoon-seo, okay?

290
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,910
Okay.

291
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,916
Why?

292
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,461
It was Seung-ho back then…

293
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,506
and now it's the medical student
and Ji-hoon.

294
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,216
Why does this keep happening?

295
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,763
Ji-hoon is different.

296
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,516
He's not the same.

297
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,770
He might have made his share of mistakes,

298
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,191
but he didn't die
to run from his crimes like the others.

299
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,779
So let's not torture ourselves
thinking he was like the others.

300
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,532
Okay?

301
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,707
Here.

302
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,419
There are photos of Ji-hoon in there.

303
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,591
I looked at them in the study

304
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,968
whenever I missed him.

305
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,392
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.

306
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,955
How come you haven't
talked to that assemblyman yet?

307
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:44,417
I won't be able to relax
until that land issue gets sorted out.

308
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,419
Mom, I'm home.

309
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,633
Why didn't you take
your husband with you today?

310
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,386
Where have you been?

311
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,389
I had some errands to run.

312
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,767
Had Seung-ho been alive,

313
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:04,938
he would have easily
taken care of all my headaches.

314
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:05,897
Mom.

315
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,192
What's the use of having
a daughter and a son-in-law?

316
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,944
Jeez.

317
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:18,285
Let's work together as victims
and make something happen.

318
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:24,165
They took not one, but two innocent lives.

319
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,545
Will you still let him go on
living as an assemblyman?

320
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,424
Let's talk to the press
or write something online--

321
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,550
No.

322
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,802
I just want this

323
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,430
to be over.

324
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,348
Ma'am,

325
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,184
I know how difficult it's been for you.

326
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,814
Had it not been for that assemblyman,
your son would still be alive.

327
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:51,901
If you stop here,
you'll regret this forever.

328
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,529
Just like my mom.

329
00:26:58,992 --> 00:26:59,909
Actually,

330
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,620
there's a reason we want to end this.

331
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,582
We haven't told anyone,

332
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,418
but the cops told me after his funeral.

333
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,754
They said the girl

334
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:12,714
was a sex worker.

335
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,592
Apparently, that's how they met.

336
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,179
A sex worker?

337
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,014
It wasn't like…

338
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,184
he picked her up at a street corner.

339
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:27,771
She was a call girl.

340
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,232
We don't want people to find out.

341
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,277
That's why we don't want
to pursue it any further.

342
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,538
Ki-young.

343
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,793
If a victim of illegal filming

344
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:52,670
turned out to have been a sex worker,

345
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,716
some people would say
she brought it upon herself, right?

346
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:58,843
A sex worker?

347
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,597
I guess some people might react that way.

348
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,557
Although they shouldn't.

349
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,185
Why do you ask?

350
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:08,895
What?

351
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,649
No reason.

352
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,942
I was just wondering.

353
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,592
-Yeo-jin.
-Are you all right?

354
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,226
I'm fine.

355
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,401
Mom, I'm hot.

356
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:07,722
If you hid Ji-hoon's phone
out of concern for Hye-joo,

357
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,141
you should have deleted
those texts beforehand.

358
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:14,604
She showed up here the day
the police gave me the phone.

359
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,690
I thought the texts
might be useful one day.

360
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,236
One of his texts failed to send.

361
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,447
I thought I might show it to her one day.

362
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,657
Goodness.

363
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,910
Were you planning to use the
text against her?

364
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,208
I didn't feel good about it.

365
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:39,087
Imagine how I felt whenever
Hye-joo told me to be nice to her.

366
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,592
Just by not showing her that text,

367
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,387
I was being as generous
as I possibly could.

368
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,228
I did my best given the situation.

369
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,272
But I…

370
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,902
I didn't expect Hye-joo
to open that drawer.

371
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,656
She usually doesn't touch
my stuff in the study.

372
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,325
It was…

373
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,453
just a mistake.

374
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,913
Exactly.

375
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,165
If you were going to hide it,

376
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,876
you should have been more thorough.

377
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,088
What do you want me to do now?

378
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:25,049
Are you saying this is all my fault?

379
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,071
How's Ms. Kim doing?

380
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,781
She's doing okay.

381
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,742
The girl left the house.

382
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,006
It feels so weird
to see you home at this hour.

383
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,050
-You don't like it?
-Of course I do.

384
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:09,552
I love it.

385
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,596
-Dad.
-Yes?

386
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,972
Are you taking the day off?

387
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,223
This is a first.

388
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:20,563
Actually, we're going to
visit your brother today.

389
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,235
I wish I could go.

390
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,573
Take me with you next time.
I miss him too.

391
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:35,286
All right. We'll go together next time.

392
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,957
-Hurry. You're going to be late.
-Okay.

393
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,709
Mom and Dad, I'm off to school.

394
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,045
-Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

395
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,818
Right.

396
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,028
My phone.

397
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:30,967
Hello?

398
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,888
Yes, this is Soo-bin's phone. Who is this?

399
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:41,728
Her boyfriend?

400
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,230
Are you the father of her child?

401
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,068
POOREUN EUNHA MEMORIAL PARK

402
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,408
You came together today.

403
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,169
LEE GYEONG-SUN
I MISS YOU GRANDMA. SINCERELY, JI-HOON

404
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,880
NAM JI-HOON

405
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,351
I said I'd be smiling
the next time I saw you.

406
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:27,148
I'm sorry I couldn't
keep my promise, Ji-hoon.

407
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,669
DRAW AND WRITE JOURNAL
NAM JOONG-DO

408
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,593
I HAD A LOOSE TOOTH.
MY MOM PULLED IT OUT USING A STRING.

409
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:02,600
TODAY IS CHILDREN'S DAY

410
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:11,692
I WANT TO BECOME A GOOD DAD
WHEN I GROW UP

411
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:18,241
I WANT TO BECOME A GOOD DAD
WHEN I GROW UP

412
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,408
A good dad?

413
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:26,124
I completely failed to be one.

414
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,752
That's not true.

415
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,006
You've always been a good dad.

416
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:39,053
I'm always proud of you
and grateful to you.

417
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,942
You have no witnesses or proof.

418
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:56,988
If you act rashly,
Nam Joong-do will retaliate.

419
00:35:57,071 --> 00:36:00,199
Let's talk to the press
or write something online--

420
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,410
We don't want people to find out.

421
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:05,204
That's why we don't want
to pursue it any further.

422
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,425
CREATE A NEW POST

423
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,728
A SEX WORKER…

424
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,607
DEOKSUNG MILL

425
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,820
Ms. Cho.

426
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,412
People are bad-mouthing me

427
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,707
for still running the mill…

428
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,502
despite losing

429
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,297
my granddaughter.

430
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,927
But I have to support myself.

431
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,472
And I need to keep busy

432
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,850
to keep my mind off of her.

433
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,567
Was it this spring?

434
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,779
Sol told me

435
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,533
since she was making a lot of money
through her part-time job,

436
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,995
I can stop working.

437
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,040
But…

438
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,293
had I listened to her back then,

439
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,839
I don't think…

440
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,009
I could have handled all of this.

441
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:49,058
I'm sure she's in a better place now.

442
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:51,686
Thank you.

443
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:56,524
Ms. Kim, thank you so much.

444
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,778
I'm thankful that someone like you

445
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,032
came to see her off.

446
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,994
And I'm grateful that someone
who's busy as Assemblyman Nam

447
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:12,164
made time to come see her before sundown.

448
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,630
But didn't he stop by late at night--

449
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,048
No.

450
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:25,386
How could I forget someone
wearing an assemblyman's badge?

451
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,140
Are you in?

452
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,224
Yes.

453
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,060
Goodness. You had a guest.

454
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,979
She's a very special guest.

455
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,815
Right. Give me a moment, ma'am.

456
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,818
It's okay. I should get going now.

457
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:41,861
All right.

458
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,827
Do you think Assemblyman Nam is okay?

459
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,370
He even took the afternoon off.

460
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,707
To be frank,
I don't think he took enough time off

461
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,751
after what happened to his son.

462
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,921
He looks like he's completely fine,
but there's no way he is.

463
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,465
I agree.

464
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,425
He didn't have time to grieve,

465
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,635
but the aftermath can be devastating.

466
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,555
I'm worried about him.

467
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,890
And about Ms. Kim.

468
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,519
PARK YEONG-SU, YBS REPORTER

469
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,856
Hey, Yeong-su.

470
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:25,071
-What?
-I saw a post online.

471
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,656
The victim of the medical student case
was a sex worker.

472
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,408
A sex worker?

473
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,336
MEDICAL STUDENT'S GIRLFRIEND
WAS A CALL GIRL

474
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,712
DO YOU GUYS REMEMBER THIS CASE?

475
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:46,884
NAM JOONG-DO IS DONE FOR

476
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,135
SHE WAS MY FRIEND'S CLASSMATE

477
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,637
DID NAM REALLY HAVE TO EXPOSE HIM?

478
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,975
These comments are just fantastic.

479
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,437
The nature of the post
is quite provocative.

480
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:01,440
The girl everyone considered
to be the innocent victim

481
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,568
turned out to be a sex worker.

482
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:09,865
It doesn't change the fact
that she's a victim of a crime,

483
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,745
but it's only natural
that people see her in a different light.

484
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:18,916
We need Namgoong Sol
to propose the amendment, don't we?

485
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,502
How did you miss this?

486
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,130
I'm sorry, sir.

487
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:32,805
Nothing is going as planned!

488
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,362
I'm sorry.

489
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,739
I've got a lot going on.

490
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,453
I need some time to think.

491
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,331
Yes, sir.

492
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,813
What?

493
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,439
You gave my phone to a stranger?

494
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,525
Why would you do that?

495
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,985
He wasn't a stranger.

496
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:53,696
He called and said he was your boyfriend.

497
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,030
My boyfriend?

498
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,866
What did he look like?

499
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,118
I don't know.

500
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,869
A girl came to pick up your phone.

501
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:04,456
I thought you had sent
your friend to pick it up.

502
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,250
But it was my phone…

503
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,087
Mom.

504
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,716
You didn't say much to the guy, did you?

505
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,675
Like what?

506
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:18,929
You didn't tell him
that I was pregnant, did you?

507
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:21,640
Did you?

508
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:23,183
What am I, crazy?

509
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,020
It's nothing to be proud of.

510
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,867
KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

511
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,539
KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

512
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,549
SOO-BIN

513
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,554
Did you cancel your old phone?

514
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,182
You don't want a stranger using it.

515
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,516
I did.

516
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,440
KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

517
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,448
The person you are trying to reach is…

518
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:33,796
Soo-bin.

519
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,422
This is Ji-hoon's mom.

520
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,258
Please call me when you see this.

521
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,804
SOO-BIN, THIS IS JI-HOON'S MOM.
PLEASE CALL ME WHEN YOU SEE THIS.

522
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,451
We didn't have to come all the way here.

523
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,456
We haven't been on a date
ever since you came back.

524
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,254
JI SEUNG-KYU'S FATHER

525
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,632
Excuse me.

526
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:22,386
Hello?

527
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,680
What?

528
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,143
It wasn't me. I didn't post it.

529
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,394
Don't lie to me!

530
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,729
You were the only one we told.

531
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,774
They're bad-mouthing my son again!

532
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,652
Sir, it really wasn't me.

533
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,904
I'm going to sue you.

534
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,948
Hello?

535
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,033
Hello?

536
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:46,493
Sir.

537
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:49,872
What's wrong?

538
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,874
Is something wrong?

539
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,965
Well done.

540
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,758
Well done indeed.

541
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,261
Thank you, sir.

542
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,807
About that girl.

543
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:09,808
Who?

544
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,477
The girl you used to go to.

545
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,562
The call girl from Sangsu.

546
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:16,231
You haven't seen her in a while, right?

547
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:18,775
No. What about her?

548
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:19,776
She died.

549
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:20,694
What?

550
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,863
She died? Why?

551
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,990
Remember that medical student
who killed himself

552
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,242
after Nam Joong-do called him out on TV?

553
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,328
He was also a client of hers.

554
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:33,207
He threatened to leak a sex video of her.

555
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:36,251
That's why she committed suicide.

556
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:43,842
I bet Nam Joong-do
is quite ticked off right now.

557
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,261
That's why this is the best time

558
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,015
to blackmail him with his wife's past

559
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:54,311
and tell him to stop digging
around the real estate speculation.

560
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:55,771
Yes, sir.

561
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,525
Let's keep an eye on public opinion
for a couple more days,

562
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,737
and then arrange a meeting
with Nam Joong-do.

563
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,614
Yes, sir.

564
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,076
Excuse me, sir.

565
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:11,912
It's okay. You can pick it up.

566
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,497
Yes, sir.

567
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,458
What is it?

568
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,169
What?

569
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,255
Posted what?

570
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,423
Hey.

571
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,008
Yoon-seo.

572
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,093
What?

573
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:30,556
Someone posted this to our group chat.

574
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:32,683
Isn't this…

575
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,772
your dad?

576
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,112
ASSEMBLYMAN GETS BEATEN UP
BY SEX-SOLICITING MED STUDENT'S FATHER

577
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,071
Answer me!

578
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,617
You killed my son!

579
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:53,537
Let me go!

580
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,080
Let me go!

581
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,508
-Hello.
-Hey.

582
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:18,103
The internet is going crazy
over the video of Assemblyman Nam.

583
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,314
What perfect timing.

584
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,398
I know, right?

585
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,317
It definitely helped

586
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,069
cover up the news
about a chief advisor soliciting sex.

587
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:31,074
When I saw the news,
I was worried you might be involved again.

588
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,037
But I guess that was a long time ago.

589
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:37,998
You don't do that anymore, right?

590
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,334
Mind your own business.

591
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,004
And just worry about that girl
living at Assemblyman Nam's place.

592
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,548
Yes, sir.

593
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,146
You want five million won
for a scratch on your bumper?

594
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,023
If you don't want to,

595
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,068
I could tell the reporters about
a chief advisor's drunk car accident.

596
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,111
What? Are you blackmailing me?

597
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,992
Why would I give you money
when you crashed into my car?

598
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,369
Do you not want to?

599
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,038
Should I call in some reporters then?

600
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,791
And tell them about your call girls?

601
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,087
-Bye.
-I'll call you.

602

SHIN HYEONG-TAE
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

603
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,182
Fine.

604
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,601
-Give me your account number.
-Now we're talking.

605
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,438
Kim Soo-bin.

606
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,356
What?

607
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,776
Have it wired to your account.

608
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,736
-To mine?
-Yes.

609
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,946
Okay.

610
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:59,204
Give me your number,
and I'll text it to you.

NARA BANK
KIM SOO-BIN

612
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,560
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

613
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,270
Honey, Woo-jae is calling.

614
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,021
Can you take it for me?

615
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,234
Hello?

616
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:31,653
Hey, how are you?

617
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,488
He's just washing up.

618
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:35,490
Do you want me to put him on?

619
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:39,703
That's okay. I'll speak to him tomorrow.

620
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:42,789
Actually, Ms. Kim.

621
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,128
Do you mind if I stop by for a minute?

622
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,548
I'm sorry to bother you this late.

623
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,842
No, don't be.
You should be getting home to rest.

624
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,469
I almost feel bad inviting you in.

625
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,386
Not at all.

626
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:59,347
These are the items
I told you about over the phone.

627
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,935
They're the dashcam and items
in your former vehicle.

628
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:06,229
I've been meaning to
give them to Assemblyman Nam

629
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,606
but I forgot about it.

630
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:10,901
I was going to go
after I dropped these off.

631
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,194
I'm sorry for the trouble.

632
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,613
Not at all. Thank you.

633
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,739
-Come in.
-Okay.

634
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,451
-Hello.
-How have you been?

635
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,413
-The stew is almost done.
-Okay.

636
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,626
-Hey.
-Sir.

637
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:38,553
How?

638
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,097
How could you go there?

639
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:43,600
How dare you go there?

640
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,685
Get out of here.

641
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,438
Get out of my sight right now.

642
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,650
Did you know that Assemblyman Nam
visited the assailant's mother?

643
00:51:53,735 --> 00:51:56,029
What did you just say?

644
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:00,283
He visited her at the hospital
when she was hospitalized.

645
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,702
He's using you.

646
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,544
My granddaughter died
because of their son!

647
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,173
Were you that worried about his parents?

648
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:16,633
Were you?

649
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,218
Ma'am.

650
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:22,722
How could you betray me like this?

651
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:27,686
Goodness. My poor baby.

652
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:28,979
Ms. Cho.

653
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:34,234
If you were using Sol to your advantage,

654
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,904
I will not let you get away with this.

655
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:48,707
Stay here.

656
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:55,338
Ms. Cho,

657
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,966
There was no other intention
in my visit to the hospital.

658
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:02,470
-I simply went there as a parent who--
-Stop making excuses!

659
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:07,142
Leave.

660
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:10,604
And don't ever come back here.

661
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,856
Ms. Cho.

662
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,691
Ms. Cho.

663
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,917
Why is nothing going right?

664
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,878
Didn't I advise you
not to go to the hospital?

665
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:39,174
Everything a politician does
sends out a message.

666
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,844
Please do not try to explain
your intentions ever again.

667
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:46,014
Regardless of your reasons,
if the victim's family is offended,

668
00:53:48,183 --> 00:53:51,353
you're at fault no matter what.

669
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:55,649
All right.

670
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:58,860
I get it. You can stop talking about it.

671
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,415
Is that you, Yoon-seo?

672
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,877
Come in.

673
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:21,424
What's the matter?

674
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,343
Are you sick?

675
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,095
Mom.

676
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,180
What's wrong?

677
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:31,309
Did something happen on your way home?

678
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,560
No.

679
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:34,854
Mom.

680
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,523
Dad…

681
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:38,650
Dad got…

682
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,611
He got beaten up.

683
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,031
How dare you come here?

684
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,373
You have no right to come here,
you murderer!

685
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,297
I wish you'd stop using the media

686
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,341
to make a bigger issue out of this.

687
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,927
Please stop this.

688
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:08,388
I'm begging you.

689
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,725
Were you that worried about his parents?

690
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:12,767
Were you?

691
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,773
You're still up?

692
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,903
Honey.

693
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,788
I'm sorry, honey.

694
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,416
I'm sorry.

695
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:41,046
I had no idea what you were going through,

696
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,839
and I…

697
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:46,634
I'm really sorry, honey.

698
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,599
Are you okay?

699
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,684
Are you hurt anywhere?

700
00:55:56,186 --> 00:56:00,023
Why didn't you tell me? I had no idea.

701
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:05,445
I see you every day
and I still didn't know.

702
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,282
I'm okay.

703
00:56:10,075 --> 00:56:11,493
It didn't hurt at all.

704
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:13,703
I'm completely fine.

705
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:17,540
Don't cry.

706
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,751
I'm really fine.

707
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:26,382
What's wrong?

708
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:30,845
-That's where it hurts, isn't it?
-It's nothing.

709
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,222
-Let me see.
-I'm okay.

710
00:56:32,305 --> 00:56:34,516
-Let me see!
-I'm really okay--

711
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,311
I'm all right.

712
00:56:52,992 --> 00:56:53,993
I'm sorry.

713
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:22,272
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

714
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,663
Give me back my phone.

715
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,501
Hi.

716
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:55,680
I forget about criticism in no time.

717
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,726
So don't worry about me.

718
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,897
How do you do that?

719
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:07,817
I just always have.

720
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:11,112
I don't remember any of it.

721
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,045
I love you.

722
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,380
Don't ever doubt that.

723
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,343
I've never doubted

724
00:58:34,802 --> 00:58:35,637
your sincerity.

725
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,196
Did you get a good look?

726
00:58:56,574 --> 00:58:58,660
Hold on to the footage just in case.

727
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,702
Yes, sir.

728
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,716
MOVE TO TRASH

729
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,829
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

730
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,650
TROLLEY

731
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:14,110
So you want to make a deal?

732
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:16,613
Make use of this old woman
as much as you want.

733
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,114
Do you trust Assemblyman Nam?

734
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:20,700
Kim Soo-bin will come back
even if we don't look for her.

735
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:22,577
How much do you want?
Isn't that why you're here?

736
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,537
Soo-bin isn't exactly a good girl.

737
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,539
Don't ever meet or talk to that kid again.

738
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:27,957
Does she have anything else on you?

739
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,793
That's what it feels like
to be betrayed by someone you trust.

740
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:35,757
