1
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:54,888
Coming.

2
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,224
That wasn't the first time

3
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,729
that my life was turned upside down.

4
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:09,569
Who are you?

5
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,620
I learned that

6
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,456
one day is all it takes

7
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:24,959
for my entire life

8
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,172
to be turned upside down.

9
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,342
I learned that…

10
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:33,968
Hi.

11
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,512
Long time no see.

12
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,932
…for the first time 20 years ago.

13
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,017
ON DUTY FOR YOUR SAFETY AND HAPPINESS
YOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

14
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,271
Hey, kid.

15
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,315
Is something wrong?

16
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:48,775
Do you need help?

17
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,740
Wait, is that…

18
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:57,200
blood on your clothes?

19
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,083
Hey!

20
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,379
YOUNGSAN EXPRESS BUS TERMINAL

21
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,223
LEGAL NAME CHANGE FORM

22
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,307
And

23
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,184
I heard…

24
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:26,479
NEW NAME
KIM HYE-JOO

25
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,189
…that name again…

26
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,566
Kim Jae-eun.

27
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,571
…for the first time in 20 years.

28
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:36,614
Or should I say…

29
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,199
Kim Hye-joo?

30
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,249
You murderer.

31
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,722
CONFRONTATION

32
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,641
How have you been?

33
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,436
Right.

34
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,605
I know it's late,
but congratulations on your marriage.

35
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,399
The wife of an assemblyman?

36
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,276
That's amazing.

37
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,329
You had reached out to my chief advisor

38
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,415
but I wanted to meet you personally.

39
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,838
Look…

40
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,256
Is that your daughter?

41
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,466
No.

42
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,384
Then who is she?

43
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,348
She's a kid I know.

44
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,314
Yes, she's just a kid I know.

45
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,317
Look, Seung-hee.

46
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,154
I'm a bit busy today,

47
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,697
so let's talk…

48
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,283
Let's talk another time, okay?

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:06,996
All right.

50
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,250
Let me get your number then.

51
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,001
Sure.

52
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:30,979
Save my number.

53
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,772
I'll call you.

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,776
Okay.

55
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,571
It's so nice to see you.

56
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,328
I missed you,

57
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,330
my friend.

58
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,377
See you later.

59
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,015
Ms. Kim.

60
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,350
Ms. Kim.

61
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,358
Let's visit Ji-hoon some other time.

62
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,528
I'm feeling unwell.
I need to get some rest.

63
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:31,331
What?

64
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:32,248
My name?

65
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,333
Yes.

66
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,169
I'm taking out a mortgage
to fund the election campaign.

67
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,212
I needed our resident registration forms

68
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,214
since the house
is under both of our names,

69
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,300
and yours said you had changed your name.

70
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:43,760
Kim Jae-eun?

71
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,596
It's a pretty name. Why did you change it?

72
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,266
No reason.

73
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:52,685
"Kim Jae-eun."

74
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:55,188
That's new.

75
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:57,148
Go to bed first.

76
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,941
I'll be in the study.

77
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,711
Thank you for reaching out to us.

78
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:25,009
I came here to tell you
to stop what you're doing.

79
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,513
My mother-in-law has done nothing wrong.

80
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,599
We can get into that later.

81
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,310
Are you originally from Youngsan?

82
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,729
It's also my wife's hometown.

83
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,107
I see.

84
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:44,779
She often talks about
fond memories of Youngsan,

85
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,866
so whenever I meet people from there,
I feel at home as well.

86
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:52,495
But I try to stay professional

87
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,038
and distinguish

88
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:56,165
right from wrong.

89
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,266
Now that we're acquainted,
try to arrange a meal with him.

90
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,811
What are you doing?

91
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,773
Sir, it's about Ji Seung-kyu's family.

92
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,692
Ji Seung…

93
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,610
Right, the medical student? What is it?

94
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,948
His mother swallowed some pills.

95
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:41,002
Do you think Mr. Nam's meeting
with Mr. Choi didn't go very well?

96
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,212
He's been looking kind of uneasy.

97
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:44,839
Right?

98
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,175
What could it be?

99
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,219
ASSEMBLYMAN'S OFFICE

100
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,637
Thanks. Bye.

101
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,270
They pumped her stomach,
so her life is not in danger.

102
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,150
Why did she do it?

103
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,403
I'm not sure.

104
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,321
Well…

105
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,991
She must be either heartbroken
over the loss of her son

106
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,701
or shocked by the hateful comments.

107
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,789
Every article about him had quite a few
comments saying that he deserved to die.

108
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,962
I called them "hateful comments",

109
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,340
but that's the public sentiment.

110
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,092
So please don't blame yourself

111
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,970
for what happened to him or his mother.

112
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,688
Are you thinking about Ji-hoon?

113
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,026
How could I not?

114
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,863
He must have received
tens of thousands of hate comments.

115
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,324
Every time he did something wrong

116
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,743
and even after his death.

117
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,997
It's true that what he did was wrong,

118
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,668
and he should be scolded
and punished for it.

119
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,005
But…

120
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,675
NAM JOONG-DO MUST TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR HIS SON'S MISDEEDS AND STEP DOWN

121
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,220
Most parents beg for mercy

122
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:18,015
when their children do something wrong…

123
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:21,394
I ask for him to be punished
strictly by the law,

124
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:24,355
and I sincerely apologize as his father

125
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,774
for failing to discipline him properly.

126
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,276
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

127
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,445
…but I did the opposite.

128
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:34,031
Hi, honey.

129
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:46,544
NAM APOLOGIZES FOR SON'S ASSAULT CASE
AT PRESS CONFERENCE

130
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,883
And it hurt my wife greatly.

131
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,141
Don't give a criminal a narrative.

132
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:04,812
What?

133
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,482
"Don't give a criminal a narrative."

134
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,444
That's what the audience says these days

135
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,239
when characters in movies or dramas
say something like that.

136
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:19,327
They refuse to give criminals
any room for pity

137
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:21,078
or being understood.

138
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,164
That's the public sentiment.

139
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,210
I have a heavy heart
whenever I think of Ji-hoon,

140
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,463
but that's the reality.

141
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,383
What I mean by that is,

142
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:37,428
you have to keep your pity,
or any form of personal sentiments

143
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,056
toward Ji-hoon or
Ji Seung-kyu's mother, at home.

144
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,516
You should only express it to your wife.

145
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,978
You're not Ji-hoon's father right now.

146
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,272
You're an assemblyman
with an election coming up.

147
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,192
Just like you said,
you have to stay professional.

148
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,801
If you were to lose your child,

149
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,804
what would you rather have
the cause of death be?

150
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,182
Suicide, murder…

151
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,268
or an accident?

152
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,441
The last one would be the least painful.

153
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,990
It would be, wouldn't it?

154
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,826
Yes.

155
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,288
At least as a parent.

156
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,473
She often talks about
fond memories of Youngsan,

157
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,935
so whenever I meet people from there,
I feel at home as well.

158
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,354
-She ran away?
-Yes.

159
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,232
She left town as soon as she graduated.

160
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,651
She ran away from her crimes.

161
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,458
SEOUL TO YOUNGSAN

162
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,844
KIM JAE-EUN

163
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:56,525
You've been living
a happy life, haven't you?

164
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,654
NEW MESSAGE FROM SEUNG-HEE

165
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,326
MEDICAL STUDENT COMMITS SUICIDE
AFTER BEING EXPOSED BY NAM

166
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,497
Your husband killed someone as well.

167
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,583
By the way,

168
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,418
does he know about your past?

169
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,309
INCOMING CALL

170
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,607
-Hey, Seung-hee.
-I saw the news.

171
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,236
Hey.

172
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,362
Look, Seung-hee…

173
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,114
Did you think fleeing to Seoul
and changing your name

174
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,075
would cover up the murder you committed?

175
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:32,997
If that's what you wanted,
you should have kept a low profile.

176
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,790
Did you think no one would recognize you

177
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,626
when you're the wife of an assemblyman?

178
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,006
Come to Youngsan.

179
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,674
We should…

180
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,051
continue our little chat.

181
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,139
Come here tomorrow.

182
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,766
And don't even think about running away.

183
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,021
Seung-hee--

184
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,449
YOUR HUSBAND KILLED SOMEONE AS WELL.
DOES HE KNOW ABOUT YOUR PAST?

185
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,797
Mom.

186
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,551
Mom.

187
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,178
Hey, I'm home.

188
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,349
Where have you been all day?

189
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,517
Sorry.

190
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,685
I had to take care of something.

191
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,772
Mom.

192
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,025
What is it?

193
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,443
Well…

194
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:47,237
I know we're supposed to go
shopping for land tomorrow,

195
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,323
but can you go without me?

196
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:50,991
Why?

197
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,077
Something's come up.

198
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,622
You're meeting your friends
in the evening anyway.

199
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,958
I'll go with you next time, okay?

200
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,709
Just for tomorrow.

201
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,420
I wouldn't be of much help anyway.

202
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:09,009
Hey, is Ki-young home yet?

203
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,181
"Ki-young"?

204
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:18,644
You come home
after spending the entire day out,

205
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,730
and the first person
you ask about is your husband?

206
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:26,694
Are you not worried about me
who's been at home all alone?

207
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:32,324
You two should have just gone
to live in Australia without me.

208
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,037
Mom.

209
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,790
Could you please stop saying that?

210
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,252
I'm really sorry for saying
I wanted to move to Australia.

211
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,504
But I didn't go. So please--

212
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:46,755
I don't want to hear it.

213
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:51,176
You're the only child I have left
after Seung-ho passed away,

214
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:55,014
but I don't want to talk
to a heartless person like you anymore.

215
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,017
I'll go by myself tomorrow.

216
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,686
And I'll drop dead right there

217
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,354
-and go meet Seung-ho.
-Mom.

218
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:06,900
Fine.

219
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,360
I'll come with you, okay?

220
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,237
I'm sorry about everything
and I'll come with you.

221
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,948
So please just stop it, will you?

222
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,961
COME TO THIS ADDRESS

223
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:34,011
Come to this address at 7 p.m. tomorrow.

224
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:37,681
You murderer.

225
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:49,902
DELETE

226
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,695
YOU MURDERER

227
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,988
DELETE FROM THIS DEVICE

228
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:16,553
I'll revise the parts you mentioned today

229
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:17,846
and report back to you.

230
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,972
Yes, that would be great.

231
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,767
But if I'm being honest,

232
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,353
It seems a bit premature
to discuss the next term's agenda

233
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,022
as we prepare for the upcoming election.

234
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,357
Not at all, sir.

235
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,567
You should definitely look far ahead.

236
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:34,071
I decided to work with you this term

237
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,157
because I saw you
advocating for the underprivileged

238
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:39,827
during your previous term.

239
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,580
I didn't join to be here
for just a single term.

240
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,584
You need to stay in politics

241
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,003
and improve our country.

242
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,088
Absolutely.

243
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,673
And don't worry about the election.

244
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,258
We'll do all the legwork.

245
00:18:54,341 --> 00:18:56,009
I've been jogging 30 minutes a day.

246
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,470
Take it easy.

247
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,849
Thank you for your encouragement.

248
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,225
I'll do my best.

249
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,476
-You got this, sir!
-You got this.

250
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,118
Why are you out here?

251
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:22,578
Ki-young.

252
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,083
Were you waiting for me?

253
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,212
You weren't coming home,
so I thought you left me.

254
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,967
Do you want to go out for dinner tonight?

255
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:38,635
It's been a while.

256
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,888
Maybe another time.

257
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,056
My mom is home alone.

258
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:46,643
Ki-young.

259
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,647
Things will…

260
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,233
get better soon.

261
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,371
Hey, come and eat.

262
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,041
Hye-joo isn't eating. She has a headache.

263
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,834
Maybe she has a cold.

264
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,170
Are you feeling better?

265
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,632
-Yes.
-Go ahead and eat.

266
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,509
I'll eat after bringing her some porridge.

267
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,136
I'll bring it to her.

268
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,400
What are you…

269
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,528
Give me that.
Why are you touching my phone?

270
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,864
MISSED CALL FROM HUSBAND

271
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,705
Don't come into my room or touch my stuff
without my permission. Understand?

272
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,250
Okay.

273
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,710
I'm sorry.

274
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,626
Hi, honey.

275
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,920
I missed your call.

276
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,214
Sorry. What's up?

277
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:23,967
What?

278
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,510
My voice?

279
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,473
No, I'm not sick.

280
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:31,016
I think it's just a cold.

281
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,520
Were you just calling to check in?

282
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,481
Okay.

283
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,816
All right. See you later.

284
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,734
Bye.

285
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,671
So please don't think about visiting
Ji Seung-kyu's mother at the hospital.

286
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,382
You'll only receive public backlash.

287
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,612
-Mom.
-Hey, Yoon-seo.

288
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,073
Are you sick?

289
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,702
Did you catch a cold?
Or is it something else?

290
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,246
No, I'm fine.

291
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:35,914
Did you eat?

292
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,499
Yes. Are you hungry?

293
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,209
I already ate.

294
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,502
Should I get you some medicine?

295
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,878
That's okay.

296
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,965
-Mom, don't be sick.
-Yes?

297
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,927
-Okay?
-I'm not sick. I'm totally fine.

298
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,637
Are you sure?

299
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,205
How dare you?

300
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,709
How dare you come here?

301
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,677
You killed my son!

302
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,637
Are you here to see
if his mother died as well?

303
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,599
You have no right to come here,
you murderer!

304
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,273
Say something, damn it.

305
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:46,693
Why did you do that to Seung-kyu?

306
00:24:47,694 --> 00:24:49,905
Being an assemblyman
doesn't give you that right!

307
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,991
Where's that badge of yours?

308
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,159
What is it?

309
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,369
Are you going to resign
for what you've done?

310
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,287
Are you?

311
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,333
I also

312
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,461
lost my son recently.

313
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,381
I'm not here today

314
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,468
as an assemblyman.

315
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,304
I'm here…

316
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,265
as a father…

317
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,268
who lost his son.

318
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,483
Drop the act!

319
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,071
No matter what you say,
it won't bring my son back.

320
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,656
Answer me!

321
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,076
Did he really deserve to die?

322
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,994
Answer me!

323
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,460
You killed my son!

324
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,880
Let me go!

325
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,468
Let me go!

326
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:12,946
Don't come into my room or touch my stuff
without my permission. Understand?

327
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,303
She gave it to me here,

328
00:26:37,846 --> 00:26:39,431
and I put it in my bag.

329
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,100
Where the heck is it?

330
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,720
YOUNGSAN
SESAME OIL

331
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,308
I'm feeling unwell.
I need to get some rest.

332
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:37,947
YOUNGSAN TO SEOUL

333
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:38,865
Youngsan?

334
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,001
COLD MEDICINE

335
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,300
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

336
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,346
Honey.

337
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,767
I'm sorry. Did I startle you?

338
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,853
Just leave it, honey. I'll clean it up.

339
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,563
-Just leave it.
-It's okay.

340
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,233
Sorry, I'll make some again.

341
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,692
That's okay.

342
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,277
I'm going to head out.

343
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,952
Right, Yoon-seo's class is
visiting the National Assembly today.

344
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,996
Right. That was today.

345
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:35,416
Hold on.

346
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,338
You're not running a fever.

347
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:44,092
You sounded sick yesterday,
and you look really pale right now.

348
00:30:45,301 --> 00:30:46,636
No, I'm okay.

349
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,848
Don't just say that.
Go see a doctor later.

350
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,058
Okay.

351
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,685
All right. See you later.

352
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:24,924
SEUNG-HEE: COME TO THIS ADDRESS AT 7 P.M.

353
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:58,791
Come in.

354
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,213
For breakfast and lunch…

355
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:07,592
Right.

356
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:12,847
I thought you forgot these.

357
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,599
Did you bring these from my studio?

358
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,725
Sorry?

359
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:16,643
Yes.

360
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,355
I stopped by last night
to look for my lip balm.

361
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,273
-Lip balm?
-Yes, my lip balm.

362
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,027
I saw the passcode
when you were opening the--

363
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,570
What did I tell you?

364
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,907
I told you not to go into my space
without my permission, didn't I?

365
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,706
I'm sorry.

366
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,210
I'm just a kid you know.
I shouldn't have gone into your space.

367
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,214
But I only did so

368
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,760
because you didn't keep
your promise about finding my lip balm.

369
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,225
Aren't you taking these?

370
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,230
Should I put them back?

371
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,606
Or should I throw them away?

372
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,159
There's a statue too.

373
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,411
You're right.

374
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,788
It's huge.

375
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:21,040
Hello,

376
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,376
I'm Assemblyman Nam Joong-do of Sinyang.

377
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:26,546
-You're awesome!
-You're so handsome!

378
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,548
-You're so amazing!
-It's nice to meet you!

379
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:29,966
How do you like being here?

380
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,926
-We love it!
-It's so nice!

381
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,720
-You're so cool!
-You're amazing.

382
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:34,762
Thank you.

383
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,414
Hye-joo told you to bring this to me?
Why isn't she using it at home?

384
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,832
I'm not sure.

385
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,751
All right.

386
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,046
It's all done.

387
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,684
Have some kalguksu as well
next time, okay?

388
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,562
Thank you. Goodbye.

389
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,897
Bye.

390
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,440
Pay up.

391
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,567
You need to pay for that.

392
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,445
Ms. Hyeon, she didn't pay.

393
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,865
Hey, why are you leaving without--

394
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:21,828
Come back for some kalguksu, okay?
Be careful not to spill that.

395
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:23,579
-But--
-Go on.

396
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:28,584
FREE FOOD FOR CHILDREN, TEENAGERS,
AND PREGNANT WOMEN

397
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,798
Have you had lunch?

398
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:38,594
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

399
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:41,139
It's nice to meet you.

400
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,098
Gosh.

401
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,559
-This is so cool.
-Nice to meet you.

402
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,561
-Your dad is so amazing.
-I'm going to frame this.

403
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,437
See you at home.

404
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,607
So you're Da-som.

405
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,608
Hi.

406
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,652
-Hello.
-It's nice to meet you.

407
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,115
By the way,
is this really your personal number?

408
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,242
Yes. Call that number, and I'll pick up.

409
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,451
No way.

410
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,370
Do you give dating advice?

411
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,832
I'm sorry, but I only do that
on the weekends.

412
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,126
Did you not have breakfast?

413
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:12,170
Then you get an extra.

414
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,379
Thank you.

415
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,803
You didn't know how things work here,

416
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,889
so I don't blame you,

417
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:26,934
but it still bothers me

418
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,686
that I couldn't explain it properly.

419
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,316
Lots of kids are coming by today.

420
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,067
-Really?
-Yes.

421
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:39,780
I still wish more kids would stop by.

422
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:43,910
Didn't you say Yoon-seo's grandmother
gave you dumplings for free?

423
00:36:43,993 --> 00:36:44,827
Yes.

424
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:49,207
Whenever my mom was working late,

425
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:52,501
I'd come here by myself
and ask for some dumplings.

426
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:58,591
And when my mom would
hurry over to apologize and try to pay,

427
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,510
she wouldn't take the money
and she'd say children had to eat well.

428
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,681
And she would say
that's what neighbors are for.

429
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,561
When I came back to this neighborhood

430
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,897
and didn't know how to make ends meet,

431
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,442
she gave me a job here.

432
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,444
I was truly grateful.

433
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,405
Had she been around a bit longer,

434
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,824
she would have seen her son
become an assemblyman.

435
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,327
Come to think of it,

436
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,829
Assemblyman Nam must
take after his mother.

437
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:34,168
Yeo-jin, can I take
a couple bottles of that oil home?

438
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,670
Sure.

439
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:41,842
OPTIMIZATION OF SEX CRIME VICTIM SUPPORT

440
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,803
PENALTY AND VICTIM SUPPORT
FOR DIGITAL SEX CRIME

441
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,222
Sir,

442
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,808
I'm sure you know, as a member of
the Legislation and Judiciary Committee,

443
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,645
but there hasn't been a single
proposed amendment regarding sex crimes

444
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,856
that passed the committee's review
to be referred to the plenary session

445
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,566
this year.

446
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:01,362
With dozens of bills proposed every day
in the National Assembly,

447
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,241
it makes sense that not every one
of them is discussed in depth.

448
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,786
My term will be over in a few months.

449
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,081
All bills that fail to be passed by then

450
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,583
will automatically be disposed of.

451
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,043
Right.

452
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,755
If I'm being completely honest,

453
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:23,592
unless a major case of sex crime occurs

454
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,386
that brings about

455
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,431
a great public uproar,

456
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,685
it won't be easy to push ahead with a bill

457
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,396
in merely six months.

458
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,523
I agree with her.

459
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,108
During Ji Seung-kyu's case,

460
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,611
the public demanded
severe punishment for sex offenders…

461
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,030
But it didn't last long.

462
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,159
We live in Dynamic Korea
where we have a new headline every day.

463
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:52,413
Sir, it's time for you
to visit the district office.

464
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,206
Okay.

465
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,645
Why are you still here?

466
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,522
I haven't paid.

467
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:19,982
Forget it.

468
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,650
No, I want to pay.

469
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,778
We don't charge pregnant women either.

470
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,529
You didn't read it thoroughly, did you?

471
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,906
FREE FOOD FOR CHILDREN, TEENAGERS,
AND PREGNANT WOMEN

472
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:29,283
Did you think
I didn't charge you last time

473
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,036
because you were pregnant
with Ji-hoon's child?

474
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:35,664
Although that's also true.

475
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:36,582
Either way,

476
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:40,002
I'm glad you can eat our dumplings
despite your morning sickness.

477
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,671
Come by whenever you want.

478
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:46,425
Okay.

479
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,295
YEO-JIN

480
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:37,017
-Hey, Yeo-jin.
-Hey, Hye-joo. It's me.

481
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,310
I received the oil.

482
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,812
Are you sure you want me to use it here?

483
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,689
Why aren't you using it at home?

484
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,944
I mean, you can give some to Yeong-seon.

485
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:50,781
-I already did.
-Oh, my goodness.

486
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,783
-…hit a motorcycle by the Cheongdam Bridge
-Goodness.

487
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,118
-around 1 a.m.
-What is it?

488
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,661
-and drove away.
-My gosh.

489
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,538
Do you know Ko Ji-seop
from the Daehan Party?

490
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,832
Anyway, his wife drove off

491
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:02,585
after running a man over and killing him.

492
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:04,545
Oh, my.

493
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,589
-They can't reach him right now.
-The police

494
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,340
analyzed the CCTV footage…

495
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,302
Of course I feel bad about the victim,

496
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:14,221
but I'm worried about her husband.
He's a politician.

497
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,270
Ms. Woo, please give us a comment
on the current situation.

498
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,036
-Yes?
-Your car is waiting out front, sir.

499
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,162
Okay, thank you.

500
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,793
See you later.

501
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,221
The wife of Assemblyman Ko Ji-seop
of the Daehan Party

502
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:58,057
hit a delivery bike
with her foreign car, killing the rider.

503
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,559
The accident occurred
on the Cheongdam Bridge

504
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,395
at 1 a.m. three days ago
and is causing an uproar.

505
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:06,065
-See you tomorrow.
-The police analyzed the CCTV footage

506
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:09,235
-and has arrested Ko's wife.
-Goodbye.

507
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,904
Do you really think
Assemblyman Ko didn't know?

508
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:12,863
I'm not sure.

509
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:16,825
They really need to
keep their family in line.

510
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:19,328
Their careers could end
from one mistake by their family.

511
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:20,829
Exactly.

512
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,334
-Hello.
-Hello.

513
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,967
ASSEMBLYMAN KO JI-SEOP

514
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,187
Poor Assemblyman Ko.

515
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:50,025
Assemblyman Nam is lucky
to have Ms. Kim as his wife.

516
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:53,195
She may not help at all,
but she doesn't cause any trouble either.

517
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:58,200
But when a quiet person causes
a problem, it tends to be a huge one.

518
00:42:58,284 --> 00:42:59,326
Come on.

519
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:01,161
Be careful what you say.

520
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,872
Still, she's not the type

521
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,542
who'd cause trouble.

522
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:08,252
Right, Mr. Jang?

523
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,632
Yes, let's hope so.

524
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,350
WOO JIN-SEOK PRESSURES

SERIES OF CONTROVERSIES
IN THE DAEHAN PARTY

526
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,402
INCOMING CALL

527
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,589
Why aren't you picking up?

528
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:14,985
Hey, Seung-hee.

529
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,737
You weren't picking up.

530
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:20,991
It stopped ringing
just as I was picking up.

531
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,914
-But Seung-hee--
-You're coming to Youngsan later, right?

532
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:30,793
Yes.

533
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:31,752
Okay.

534
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,796
You didn't reply to my texts,

535
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,839
so I thought you weren't coming.

536
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,591
So I thought,

537
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,135
"Did she run away again?"

538
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,346
"She's making things more interesting."

539
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:46,517
No, I'm coming to Youngsan.

540
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,394
I'll be there.

541
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:51,480
All right. See you later.

542
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,201
See that greenhouse over there?

543
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,537
-You'd be buying that much.
-But we don't even know

544
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:07,746
if the road will be built there.

545
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,164
Goodness, ma'am.

546
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:11,708
The price has already doubled
since last month.

547
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,253
It'll skyrocket
if a road really gets built.

548
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,134
You were taking so long
that I thought you left.

549
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,010
Were you talking to your husband again?

550
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:23,720
No.

551
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,807
Gosh, she must be very happily married.

552
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,808
Who cares?

553
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,812
She's so happy with her husband
that she neglects her old mother.

554
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:34,356
-Mom.
-Hey, I don't need you either.

555
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,316
I'm going to meet my friends.

556
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,235
So go to your husband.

557
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,656
Mr. Park, let's go.

558
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:51,790
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

559
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:56,003
SONMAT NOODLES

560
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,387
Hello, sir.

561
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,014
-Hello.
-Hello.

562
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,016
-I'm rooting for you.
-I appreciate it.

563
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:10,309
-You can do it.
-Thank you.

564
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,404
THE COMPETENT ASSEMBLYMAN!
WE BELIEVE IN YOU, NAM JOONG-DO

565
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,243
Ma'am.

566
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,120
Goodness, Assemblyman Nam.

567
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,499
-Ma'am, what are you doing here?
-What the…

568
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,292
-Well…
-Assemblyman Nam.

569
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,585
Goodness.

570
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:39,963
Ma'am, you're cleaning out here again?

571
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:43,926
You should just come inside
and have some tea.

572
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:49,306
I'm forever grateful to you,

573
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,642
so I wanted to give you something,

574
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:54,603
but they told me
you couldn't accept any gifts.

575
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:57,981
There's nothing else I could do for you.

576
00:46:58,065 --> 00:47:02,778
It's no big deal, so don't worry about me.

577
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,198
Sir.

578
00:47:06,281 --> 00:47:07,574
Oh, no.

579
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,368
That's a dirty rag.

580
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,870
Goodness. Sir.

581
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,206
Thanks to you,

582
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,875
that bastard got what he deserved.

583
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:18,835
And now,

584
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,047
I'm finally at peace.

585
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:28,428
I'll repay your kindness at all costs.

586
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:30,889
Thank you.

587
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,100
Thank you so much.

588
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,435
Thank you.

589
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,981
Get home safely.

590
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,608
Goodbye, ma'am.

591
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:53,245
She doesn't know yet.

592
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:56,498
That bastard uploaded the video

593
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,250
right before he jumped.

594
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,795
When the arrest warrant was applied for,

595
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,505
he had only threatened to leak it.

596
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:07,134
Then the case was closed
following his death.

597
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,970
So no one knew about the leak
until later on.

598
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,016
Has it spread widely?

599
00:48:14,891 --> 00:48:17,519
The police are still hunting down
whoever redistributes it.

600
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,272
The specialist you personally hired

601
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,649
is working to remove all the videos.

602
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:26,778
But it's not easy to get rid of
all of them in such a short time.

603
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,660
It's a relief that the case
isn't in the spotlight anymore.

604
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,997
She's so elated
that he got what he deserved.

605
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,167
If she hears about the video on the news…

606
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,087
She'll be utterly shocked.

607
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,258
For her sake, there shouldn't be
any follow-up articles

608
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,677
that draw attention to this case again.

609
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,679
You're right.

610
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,349
We can't have that happen.

611
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,630
1 JEONGMIMUL-RO 2-GIL, YOUNGSAN-SI

612
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,185
YOUNGSAN

613
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,222
We have a total of
370 members as of today.

614
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,975
That's a ten-percent increase
in new members compared to last month.

615
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,227
And it's on a steady rise.

616
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,188
We have a more luxurious interior
and better equipment

617
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:26,898
compared to our competitors.

618
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,901
That's believed to be the main factor
that attracts customers.

619
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,195
Good work.

620
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:35,115
Please make sure
our customers can exercise

621
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,409
in a pleasant environment at all times.

622
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:38,785
Yes, sir.

623
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,926
Hey, Seung-hee. It's me.

624
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,764
Since your mother is meeting
her friends this evening,

625
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,683
how about you and I go out for dinner?

626
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:06,021
I see. You already have plans?

627
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:08,982
With a friend?

628
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:10,817
Okay.

629
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:11,985
Have fun.

630
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:13,487
I'll see you at home.

631
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:15,572
Okay. Bye.

632
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,118
A friend?

633
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:34,216
Welcome to Youngsan,
a city full of love and happiness.

634
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,528
YOUNGSAN CHILDREN'S HOME

635
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:55,737
Seung-ho.

636
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:01,159
I asked you last time
not to show up like this.

637
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:05,413
Do you not like me?

638
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,416
Why not?

639
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,212
Seung-ho, you see…

640
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:17,467
I've never thought of you
to be more than Seung-hee's brother.

641
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,936
So I'm asking you. Please.

642
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,900
Don't come here again.

643
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,370
Bye.

644
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,457
Kim Jae-eun.

645
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:57,799
Seung-ho, please let go of me.

646
00:52:58,508 --> 00:52:59,342
Okay?

647
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,362
ON DUTY FOR YOUR SAFETY AND HAPPINESS
YOUNGSAN POLICE STATION

648
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,374
Hey, kid.

649
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,209
Is something wrong? Do you need help?

650
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,964
Hey, is that blood on your clothes?

651
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:46,431
Hey!

652
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,815
I'd like an apology.

653
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,986
And please stay away from me.

654
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:06,743
Pardon?

655
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,870
Boys can be like that

656
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,832
when they like someone.

657
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,919
And I'll be blunt.

658
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,129
Nothing really happened.

659
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,632
You just scraped your palms and knees.

660
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:21,549
That's…

661
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,552
That's because I ran away.

662
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:26,054
If I hadn't, I would have…

663
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,182
Here.

664
00:54:30,016 --> 00:54:31,977
Take this, okay?

665
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,606
I understand that you're hurt
and upset right now,

666
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:39,901
But can you just pretend
that you briefly went out

667
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,737
with a law student
from Seoul National University?

668
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:43,947
Let me go.

669
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:48,243
I'll…

670
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,205
I'll get you a scholarship
to Gyeongji University.

671
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,167
My husband's aunt is the chairwoman there.

672
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:03,008
How will you pay your tuition

673
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,051
when you don't have parents?

674
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,722
I'll make sure you get that scholarship.

675
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:13,393
So let's not make a big deal
out of nothing, okay?

676
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:25,447
I'll…

677
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,324
take the scholarship then.

678
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:30,577
Okay.

679
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,538
I'll make sure you get it.

680
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:35,832
The scholarship.

681
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:48,845
Kim Jae-eun.

682
00:55:56,644 --> 00:55:57,771
Don't be mistaken.

683
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,608
It's not like I actually liked you.

684
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,236
If you needed money,
you should have just said so.

685
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,989
You pathetic orphan.

686
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,800
JIN SEUNG-HO OF YOUNGSAN HIGH SCHOOL
ACCEPTED TO SNU SCHOOL OF LAW

687
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:31,513
But can you just pretend
that you briefly went out

688
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:33,932
with a law student
from Seoul National University?

689
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,314
Jin Seung-ho.

690
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,451
Twenty years ago,

691
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,872
the day my life was

692
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,251
turned upside down
for the very first time…

693
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,797
You killed him.

694
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,341
You murderer.

695
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:16,432
My Seung-ho…

696
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,856
My poor baby…

697
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:29,195
My goodness, Seung-ho…

698
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,785
JIN SEUNG-HO OF YOUNGSAN HIGH SCHOOL
ACCEPTED TO SNU SCHOOL OF LAW

699
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:41,833
YOUNGSAN TO GANGNAM

700
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,589
The only thing I could do…

701
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,761
was to run away.

702
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:00,685
KO JI-SEOP'S WIFE CAUSES
BIGGEST CRISIS OF HIS CAREER

703
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,439
I never thought I would come back.

704
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:43,520
ILHWADANG

705
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:51,945
There she is.

706
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,252
Honey.

707
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:18,638
You made it.

708
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,466
TROLLEY

709
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,468
This is between us. My husband--

710
00:59:57,552 --> 01:00:01,180
Your husband is an assemblyman, no less,
and the elections are coming up.

711
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:04,058
Should I put up banners
and hand out fliers about what you did?

712
01:00:04,142 --> 01:00:07,478
My wife will not have any influence
over my political activities.

713
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,981
I know it's too late,
but I have to do something.

714
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,357
Let's do one thing at a time, shall we?

715
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:12,859
Why did she have to get involved?

716
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,819
You. Can you take responsibility?

717
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,571
You're one to talk.

718
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,573
Why do you want to know?

719
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,658
