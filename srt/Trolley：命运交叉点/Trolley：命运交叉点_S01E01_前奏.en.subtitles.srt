1
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,009
My daughter is missing.

2
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:54,137
Ma'am, please try to calm down.

3
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,973
She's missing,
and her phone is turned off.

4
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,767
I see.

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,851
And the name?

6
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,436
It's Nam Yoon-seo.

7
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,104
Is that your name, ma'am?

8
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:06,483
No. My name is Kim Hye-joo.

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,568
Nam Yoon-seo is my daughter's name.

10
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,736
When was she born?

11
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,696
In 2008. She's in 8th grade.

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,406
She attends Jicheong Middle School.

13
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,657
What's your home address?

14
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,618
It's 14, Sumyeong-ro 3-gil, Sinyang-gu.

15
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,328
What's your phone number?

16
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,040
Look. I think my daughter
ran away from home.

17
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,458
As in it was voluntary?

18
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,960
You don't think she's been abducted
or gone missing?

19
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:26,920
Abducted?

20
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,423
It's uncommon,

21
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,675
but it's also a possibility.

22
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,971
It shouldn't be ruled out,
particularly with women or teenagers.

23
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,726
Why do you think she ran away from home?

24
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,604
Did she text or leave you a note?

25
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:46,397
No, she didn't.

26
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,484
But we had an argument earlier today.

27
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,238
You had an argument. I see.

28
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,450
Has she ever run away from home before?

29
00:01:57,534 --> 00:02:00,203
No, she's not the type to do such a thing.

30
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,668
This is

31
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,754
the first time this has happened.

32
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,346
PRELUDE

33
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,361
13 HOURS AGO

34
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:38,533
BOOK CONSERVATION

35
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:15,612
Let me confirm everything
we've talked about until now.

36
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,406
First of all,

37
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:23,328
I'm going to restore the ripped, damaged,

38
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,873
and tainted pages such as these.

39
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,626
As for the new cover,

40
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:35,673
I have both thin and thick boards.

41
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,592
And I'll be using the latter.

42
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,637
As for the cover,

43
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:45,433
I'll be using this silky one
that you've already picked out.

44
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:48,019
Then I'll insert a photo of your son
on the cover.

45
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,854
Take a look at this sample.

46
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:52,065
Could you feel around the edges?

47
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:55,151
Right. I'm going to make an indentation

48
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,820
and insert his photo inside.

49
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:59,113
Okay.

50
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,783
I can't wait.

51
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,496
You can look through that

52
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,957
while I double-check your request form.

53
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,333
Sure.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,043
Goodness.

55
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,131
So you fixed all of these torn-up books.

56
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,889
I found my son's baby book recently

57
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,308
while moving.

58
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,938
I recalled hearing about
book conservation studios, so I came.

59
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,025
I'm really glad that I visited you.

60
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:37,944
Goodness.

61
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,992
Ma'am, are you married?

62
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,912
-Yes.
-I see.

63
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,080
Do you have a child?

64
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,040
Yes.

65
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,418
Son or daughter? How old are they?

66
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,548
My son is 22,
and my daughter is in 8th grade.

67
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,216
He's 22?

68
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:05,263
Goodness, you must have
gotten married very early.

69
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:07,890
I expected your child
to be in elementary school.

70
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,310
My son is 22 years old as well.

71
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,730
Goodness.

72
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,941
He used to be so adorable.

73
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:21,029
But these days, he never replies to me.

74
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:24,741
And if I nag him out of frustration,
he just looks all sulky.

75
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:27,243
He'll be the death of me.

76
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:33,249
When he was little,
we were pretty much attached at the hip.

77
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:38,671
Who knew our sons
would grow apart from us, right?

78
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:46,846
Jeez, I can't help but envy moms
who have daughters.

79
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:50,850
You can be honest with me.

80
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,811
Don't you love your daughter
a bit more than your son?

81
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,777
Of course not. I love them both equally.

82
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:06,908
I've confirmed everything.

83
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,118
I'll contact you once it's completed.

84
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:12,663
You can pay half the amount today
and pay the rest when you pick it up.

85
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,664
-Okay.
-Please check.

86
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,374
-Thank you so much.
-My pleasure.

87
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,709
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

88
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,726
Is it going to rain?

89
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:43,945
ALARM

90
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,613
Right.

91
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,950
WOMEN'S CLINIC

92
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,417
Hye-joo!

93
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,254
Hey, I thought you were running late.

94
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:02,839
That's what I thought too.

95
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,674
I thought you weren't coming.

96
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,302
I felt bad about not showing up very much.

97
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,097
The moms are going to love it.

98
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,057
They're all eagerly waiting to meet

99
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,893
the mom of the class president
and top student.

100
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,437
That's why I haven't been going.

101
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,730
Yoon-seo doesn't receive any help from me.

102
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:22,692
Fine. Good for you.

103
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,777
-Here.
-This looks delicious.

104
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
-It's been a long time.
-I know.

105
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,115
Here you go. Eat up.

106
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:36,247
I heard Yoon-seo doesn't
even take a lot of after-school classes.

107
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:37,373
Does she have a tutor?

108
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:40,126
No, she only goes to after-school classes.

109
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:43,880
Come on. You don't need
to be so secretive.

110
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,840
Or do you help her with her studies?

111
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,218
Not at all. I'm not involved whatsoever.

112
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,345
She studies on her own.

113
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:52,889
She just takes after her dad.

114
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,975
Goodness. What does your husband do?

115
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:57,226
Is he a professor?

116
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,604
Wellâ€¦

117
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,490
He just has a regular job.

118
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,493
Your husband is the professor.
At Seoul National University, at that.

119
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:17,288
Right. Let's have brunch
at his school this Sunday.

120
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:18,915
There's a cafe with a nice view.

121
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,541
-Sure.
-Okay.

122
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,668
Then should we meet at 11 a.m.?

123
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,878
-Okay.
-Sure.

124
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,381
Ji-soo, you're coming with Hye-joo, right?

125
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:29,926
Yes, that's the plan.

126
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,636
To SNU?

127
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:35,473
What for?

128
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,142
Hasn't Yoon-seo told you?

129
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,353
Tell me what?

130
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,148
-Let's come here again.
-See you on Sunday.

131
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,942
-Okay.
-See you Sunday.

132
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,485
-At 11 a.m.
-At 11 a.m.

133
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:50,696
-Let's go.
-That place was nice.

134
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,451
Sorry for not telling you sooner.

135
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,454
Getting our kids' names

136
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,957
in a professor's thesis
will open many doors for them.

137
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,917
They all do it.

138
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,836
Only those without
connections can't do it.

139
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,965
Why would you say no
when the opportunity is given to you?

140
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:11,968
I appreciate the offer,

141
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:13,594
but I'll pass.

142
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:15,680
Do you mean that?

143
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:17,139
Yes.

144
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,559
I'll get going then.

145
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,104
Okay. I have patients
in the afternoon too.

146
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:24,814
See you next time.

147
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:27,900
Bye.

148
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,826
SONMAT NOODLES

149
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,669
Hey.

150
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,883
FREE FOOD FOR CHILDREN,
TEENAGERS, AND PREGNANT WOMEN

151
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,677
NO NEED TO SHOW YOUR WELFARE CARD.
JUST ENJOY.

152
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,275
-Thank you for the meal.
-My pleasure.

153
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,487
No, you don't need to show that.
I told you before.

154
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:16,824
Come back once you finish that.

155
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,701
You're welcome even if I'm not here.

156
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,828
You can order dumplings to go.

157
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,873
Children eat for free here.

158
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,916
Come again.

159
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,918
-Thank you.
-Sure. Goodbye.

160
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,511
Gosh, I'm so stuffed. I can't breathe.

161
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,723
You ate so much. Did you not have lunch?

162
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,642
Of course I did.

163
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,894
I actually had lunch outside.

164
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,146
But she wouldn't have eaten if I didn't.

165
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,731
That's why I ate.

166
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,776
However, your food tasted so good

167
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,611
that I just couldn't stop.

168
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,822
I thought I'd never be able
to cook like Joong-do's mom.

169
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,659
-Maybe I'm close now.
-Why would you compare yourself to her?

170
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:03,454
She has her style,
and you have your own as well.

171
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,706
Jeez, look at you brown-nosing me.

172
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,000
-Were you grocery shopping?
-Yes.

173
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,169
I want to make some short ribs
for Ji-hoon.

174
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,588
Lucky him.

175
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,548
I should get going now.

176
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,176
I've been strangely busy all day.

177
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,053
I need to pick up some perilla oil too.

178
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:23,349
I recently found a place that extracts
the oil without roasting the seeds.

179
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,644
So I'm trying them out.
It's near Taeyang Apartment.

180
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,774
-What's funny?
-You spoke in dialect.

181
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,692
I did?

182
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:37,113
Yes, you said, "It's near
Taeyang Apartment," in a dialect.

183
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,656
Where's your hometown?

184
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,492
North Chungcheong.

185
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,577
I see. Which area?

186
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,997
Ask if they have domestic sesame oil.

187
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,582
Okay. Bye.

188
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:49,959
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

189
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,135
Did I say something I shouldn't have?

190
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,013
She doesn't like talking
about her hometown.

191
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,724
She's been through a rough childhood

192
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,643
so she must not have many fond memories.

193
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,353
Gosh. I see.

194
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,356
But still, she's successful now.

195
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,860
Don't be ridiculous.
She doesn't have any money.

196
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,280
She donates all the money she earns.

197
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:23,242
No, I'm not talking about money.
I mean she's very happy.

198
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,623
Good job.

199
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,043
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

200
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,379
Hello, ma'am. Hello.

201
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,007
-Hello.
-Hye-joo, long time no see.

202
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,467
Have you been well?

203
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,801
Yes. How about you?

204
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,345
We've been good as always.

205
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,599
Oh, these?

206
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,642
We still receive them
along with some cash.

207
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,853
The donor is still anonymous.

208
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,314
We were too busy this morning,

209
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,524
so we're finally moving them in now.

210
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,692
Then let me help.

211
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:57,902
-No.
-No.

212
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,154
It's okay.

213
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,909
All right. I'll call before
I stop by next time.

214
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:07,495
Okay. Call and stop by
when we're not too busy.

215
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,997
I will. See you next time.

216
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,790
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

217
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,167
Bye.

218
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,755
Who is she?

219
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,216
She used to work with us.

220
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,092
I see. She's a social worker?

221
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:25,262
No, she's not.
She was just a contract worker.

222
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,306
I think she started as a part-timer.

223
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:28,557
I'll head inside, then.

224
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,476
-Okay.
-See you.

225
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:34,230
Her husband is the district assemblyman.

226
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,358
An assemblyman for Sinyang-gu?

227
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,652
-Exactly.
-No way.

228
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,615
What's the name
of the district assemblyman again?

229
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,493
I'm Nam Joong-do of the Daehan Party.

230
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,539
Dear citizens,

231
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,249
I am standing here today

232
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,544
to speak against
the repeated illegal land speculation

233
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,879
engaged by my fellow assemblymen.

234
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:03,425
I am here today with a great sense
of responsibility and a heavy heart.

235
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,638
For this country to be free of corruption,

236
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:11,267
we must eradicate
all illegal real estate speculation

237
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,061
by members of the National Assembly.

238
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:15,396
NEW BILL TO ERADICATE
ILLEGAL REAL ESTATE SPECULATION

239
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,357
The sister-in-law of Kang Soon-hong
of the Nation and People's Party

240
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,443
-purchased farmland in Youngsan last year.
-That littleâ€¦

241
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,281
Recently, that land was chosen
to be redeveloped by the MOLIT.

242
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,490
Damn it.

243
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,951
He claims that he had no part inâ€¦

244
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,329
I promise to eradicate
real estate speculation.

245
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,082
In addition, I request once again

246
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:39,795
that a special investigation
led by experts

247
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,380
be held as urgently as possible.

248
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,050
How did Kang Soon-hong
get elected for the fifth time

249
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,344
when his family members take turns
causing controversies?

250
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,806
His wife's wealth got him elected,
so he's returning the favor.

251
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,559
We don't need family men like him.

252
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:57,021
I can't help but think this way
whenever such incidents occur.

253
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:59,315
It may be a blessing for Assemblyman Nam

254
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,610
that his late mother was
the only family member he had.

255
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,613
His wife doesn't have any family either
and she keeps to herself.

256
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,156
That's not always a good thing.

257
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,200
He started off as a list member

258
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,202
and finally managed to run for office.

259
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:15,289
But she's never shown up
to any of his campaignsâ€¦

260
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:20,377
No, she's never shown herself
in public at all.

261
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:23,672
The other wives do their best
to win over the electorate.

262
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,050
This is what everyone's been thinking

263
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,052
during the last general election.

264
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,596
According to Mr. Jang,

265
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,141
she had allowed her husband
to run for office under that condition.

266
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:38,312
She apparently didn't want
any part in his political career.

267
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,150
In a way, Assemblyman Nam isâ€¦
How should I put this?

268
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,110
What's to think about?

269
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,570
He's the perfect husband.

270
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,531
Not many husbands would
ever go that far to protect their wives

271
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,826
regardless of what people say
behind their backs.

272
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,663
Did you have a big fight yesterday?

273
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:56,997
No.

274
00:15:57,081 --> 00:16:00,501
You got pretty riled up talking about
other husbands just now.

275
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,002
Are you okay?

276
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,045
About tonight's dinnerâ€¦

277
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,922
Ms. Woo wants to see you.

278
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,048
Okay.

279
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,931
Hello, Assemblyman Kang.

280
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,559
Who was he again?

281
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,688
Are you a secretary?

282
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,274
It's Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party.

283
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:27,277
I see. You're an assemblyman.

284
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,195
Goodness.

285
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:30,406
My apologies.

286
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,950
You just looked so young

287
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,911
that I thought you were
an assemblyman's secretary.

288
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,831
That's okay.

289
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,958
When you were my age,

290
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,752
you were a secretary to the late
Assemblyman Kim Myeong-jae.

291
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,254
I understand the confusion.

292
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,547
-That'sâ€¦
-Goodbye.

293
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,974
How young and brash he is.

294
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,102
DAEHAN PARTY CHAIRWOMAN
WOO JIN-SEOK

295
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:03,022
I'm sure you're busy preparing
for the National Assembly inspection.

296
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,941
When did you prepare all this?

297
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,069
I envy your youth.

298
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,657
I've been hearing that a lot today.

299
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,328
I was only elected four times so far,

300
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,540
but 15 and a half years
have passed in the blink of an eye.

301
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:26,462
The Nation and People's Party is probably
to blame for some of these gray hairs.

302
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,839
I can count on you, right?

303
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,842
We have eight months
until the general election.

304
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,428
The timing is just right.

305
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:36,722
I'll do my best.

306
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,891
Sure. I don't worry one bit.

307
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:43,020
You're the best our party has to offer.

308
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,370
Do you like the view here?

309
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,664
The eighth floor isn't that low.

310
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,336
Haven't you been using
your office on the tenth floor

311
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,379
since your first election?

312
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,173
Yes, that's correct.

313
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,383
Why didn't you come down during this term?

314
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,637
Did you feel like you didn't deserve it

315
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,265
because you were
only a list member last time?

316
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:21,767
Not at all.

317
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,522
I signed up for the same room
because I wanted to remain humble.

318
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,817
Humble?

319
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,029
Eight years of humility
is more than enough.

320
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,533
Once this general election pans out,

321
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,284
you'd be elected for the third time.

322
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,079
You'll be able to pick
any office you like.

323
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,167
Would you like this room instead?

324
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:50,254
I'm a bit tired of that view now.

325
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,172
No, I'm fine.

326
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,176
Or sign up for the room
on the sixth floor that the president used

327
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,428
during his time as an assemblyman.

328
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,391
The competition for that room
is quite fierce.

329
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:06,562
But if you want it,
I can pull some strings.

330
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,731
I couldn't possibly do that
during my third term.

331
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,109
I'm content with my current room.

332
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,362
You sure aren't greedy.

333
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,952
I can't say that I'm not greedy at all.

334
00:19:23,036 --> 00:19:24,746
Why else would I be here?

335
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,002
You see,

336
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,838
none of the offices
anywhere in this building

337
00:19:32,921 --> 00:19:35,299
have a view of Bugaksan
like the Blue House does.

338
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,767
That's right.

339
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,104
As long as you're in Yeouido, that is.

340
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,067
Pardon my thoughtlessness.

341
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,238
Your current office
will soon become the office

342
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,491
that the assemblymen will compete to have.

343
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:09,499
-Hello.
-Hello.

344
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,667
What's next?

345
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,712
You have an interview with SBC.

346
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,173
Honey, I'll be home
around midnight tonight.

347
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:18,842
Guess what?
I got called young twice today.

348
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,386
-And for dinnerâ€¦
-How do you like having a young husband?

349
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:23,138
Okay.

350
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,352
DEOKSUNG MILL

351
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,413
HOW DO YOU LIKE HAVING A YOUNG HUSBAND?

352
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:50,207
Jeez.

353
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,795
Good for you.

354
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,964
But I'll always be younger than you.

355
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,552
Come on. We're almost the same age.

356
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,847
-Are you here for oil?
-Yes.

357
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,059
No one's in, right?

358
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:10,435
She must be out.

359
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,272
Her granddaughter passed away.

360
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:15,565
I'm sorry?

361
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:20,279
She was a university student.
She hanged herself.

362
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,697
NAMGOONG SOL

363
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,156
She fought with her boyfriend,

364
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,576
and he threatened to spread
some embarrassing photos of her.

365
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,330
But the police haven't even
arrested that bastard.

366
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,959
He's apparently a medical student.

367
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:37,754
They didn't arrest him
saying that he wouldn't flee.

368
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,467
Excuse me. Do I know you?

369
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,722
Right. You came by the mill yesterday.

370
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,687
Please eat.

371
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,900
How did you come all the way here?

372
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,531
She lost her parents at a young age,

373
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:08,577
so I raised her with the utmost care

374
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,079
to the best of my abilities.

375
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,835
But the police won't even
arrest that bastard.

376
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,856
ROOM 5
NAMGOONG SOL

377
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,940
Look.

378
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,611
Please sign the guest book
before you leave.

379
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,864
I'm so grateful that you came,

380
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,657
so I want to remember you.

381
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,619
Will you do that for me?

382
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:54,122
-It's fine.
-But stillâ€¦

383
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:55,707
Right.

384
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,001
I have your perilla oil ready.

385
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,046
Don't worry about it. I'll come by later.

386
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,256
All right, then.

387
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,220
Sol used to tell me

388
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,682
to close down the mill and stop working.

389
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:17,312
She said I didn't have to work
because she had a part-time job.

390
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,566
But now I'm glad
that I didn't listen to her

391
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,319
to be able to have a guest at her funeral.

392
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:29,282
Thank you so much for coming.

393
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,034
I mean it.

394
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,830
Don't mention it. I'll be going now.

395
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,048
Go on.

396
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,941
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

397
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:05,193
A special education school
next to a regular one?

398
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,112
That's just absurd.

399
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,739
It's important that we build this school
for disabled children

400
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,992
who struggle to travel long distances.

401
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,162
We only have a bus from Manil-dong
to Jicheong Station every 20 minutes,

402
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,581
which is just too long.

403
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:21,251
All the other buses come by
every 6 to 13 minutes at most.

404
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,919
-That's quite a difference.
-It is.

405
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,254
-Well noted.
-Please check.

406
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:27,883
We can't have such large vehicles
driving by where children commute.

407
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,928
Despite being a school zone,
there's too much speeding.

408
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,848
She's right. It's a very dangerous area.

409
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,766
Right. I agree.

410
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,189
Please give me a call
through the number on my card

411
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,940
if you need anything else.

412
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,319
Is this your personal number?
Not your secretary's?

413
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,987
Yes, it's mine.

414
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,448
I'll be picking up, so call me anytime.

415
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:53,241
I see. Thank you.

416
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,410
-Goodbye.
-This way.

417
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:57,162
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

418
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,788
Thank you for your time, everyone.

419
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,542
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

420
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:03,919
Good work.

421
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:05,962
Gosh, what a busy day.

422
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:13,720
Do you really answer
all their calls yourself?

423
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,180
Of course.

424
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,849
I may not be able to resolve everything,

425
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,269
but it provides a chance
to vent their frustrations and feel heard.

426
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,773
Speaking directly with an assemblyman
provides some assurance.

427
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,777
Some of them curse me out
as soon as I pick up,

428
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,279
but I'll live longer thanks to them.

429
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,493
I'll give you a summary
of today's discussions later.

430
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:37,452
Okay. Thank you.

431
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:40,205
We finished much earlier than I thought.

432
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,999
When's the dinner with our sponsor?

433
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,377
At 7 p.m. at Haniljeong.

434
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,897
SINYANG-GU WOMEN AND YOUTH SHELTER

435
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:14,781
THANK YOU FOR THE DELIVERY
ENJOY

436
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,941
Is that you, Yoon-seo?

437
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:54,779
-Mom!
-What is it this time?

438
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,574
Did you say I can't go to SNU this Sunday?

439
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,909
-Yes.
-Why?

440
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,330
My friends' parents are
pulling all the strings they can

441
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,998
to beef up their kids' resumes.

442
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:08,418
It's not like I asked Dad for help.

443
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,920
So why would you decline their help?

444
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,716
How can a middle school student
be credited as a co-author?

445
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,385
What can you even do to help
a professor with his thesis?

446
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,846
There must be something.
He told us to come.

447
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,473
You don't even know anything.

448
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,016
Of course I do.

449
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,726
You didn't even go to university.

450
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:29,981
Sorry.

451
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,692
That may be true,

452
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:35,779
but I know that it's absurd
for you to be credited as a co-author.

453
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,614
Dad would have said no too if he--

454
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,866
There you go, bringing him up again.

455
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,785
Stop using him as your excuse.

456
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:45,288
Why can't I do what all my friends do
just because of him?

457
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,249
Jeez. This is so annoying.

458
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,044
Yoon-seo, we're not done talking.

459
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,005
Forget it. I won't go, all right?

460
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,716
Yoon-seo, stop right there.

461
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,677
Yoon-seo.

462
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,598
Did you lock the door? Open up.

463
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,266
Go away. I'm going to study.

464
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,437
Really? You're going to be
in serious trouble, young lady.

465
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,814
Nam Yoon-seo.

466
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,703
I'm sorry.

467
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:28,415
He texted me saying he was almost home.

468
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,961
Why the long face? Is it Yoon-seo?

469
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:38,466
She's acting out more and more.

470
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,718
She's going through puberty.
Ji-hoon was the same.

471
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,305
I feel terrible the moment
I'm done scolding them.

472
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,684
Maybe it's because he's a politician,

473
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:50,687
but I don't think we're doing
as well as other parents are.

474
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,523
You two are doing a terrific job.

475
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,610
Right. Do you want to use Ji-hoon's room?

476
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,946
Me? Why? I already have a room.

477
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,781
Your room is too small

478
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,868
because it was
my late mother-in-law's storage room.

479
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,370
Had we known you'd be living with us,

480
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,540
we would have built a room for you
upstairs when we first moved in.

481
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:13,084
Forget it.
The upstairs is for your family.

482
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,377
I'm fine with my room.

483
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,258
Yeo-jin, you know
how grateful I am for you, right?

484
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:25,180
When my mother-in-law passed away
and I was pregnant with Yoon-seo,

485
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,890
I was going through so much.

486
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,350
Had you not offered to live together,

487
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,728
I wouldn't have been
able to endure it all.

488
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,189
Thank you so much.

489
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,238
-I'm home.
-Hey.

490
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,658
You're home awfully early today.

491
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,202
I should take a breather too.

492
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,621
You're still up? It's late.

493
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,414
She wanted to have a beer.

494
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,916
Why? Did I do something wrong?

495
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,250
Why? Are you feeling guilty?

496
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,420
Recycling is tomorrow.

497
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:59,297
I haven't done anything wrong.

498
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:02,592
-Give it to me.
-Thank you. I enjoyed it.

499
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:03,843
No problem.

500
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,054
Give it to me. I'll wash it with the rest.

501
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,305
No, I can do it.

502
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,681
Just give it to me.

503
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,226
How can you make him vegetable juice

504
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,269
every morning for the past eight years?

505
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:16,147
But this is the only thing
that I'm doing for him.

506
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,775
Exactly. I didn't bargain well.

507
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,277
I should have asked
for some other things too.

508
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,946
-Rest up. Thanks.
-Okay.

509
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,614
-Good night.
-You too.

510
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,408
-Good night.
-Good night.

511
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,380
You must be exhausted.
Wash up and go to bed, honey.

512
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,222
Why are you staring at me?

513
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,349
My face is flushed, isn't it?

514
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,812
You're pretty.

515
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,774
-Are you drunk?
-No.

516
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,861
What's with you? Go to bed.

517
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,119
Stop that. Just go to bed.

518
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,080
I came home early for once.
I can't just go to bed.

519
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:21,504
What's wrong with you?

520
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:38,897
Honey, your phone.

521
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:42,525
But I already clocked out.

522
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:49,282
It's Woo-jae. It must be something urgent.

523
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,950
-Pick up.
-No.

524
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:53,202
Pick up, Mr. Assemblyman.

525
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,374
Yes, ma'am.

526
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,716
Yes?

527
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:09,469
I see.

528
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,888
Okay.

529
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,060
I need to go out for a bit.

530
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,978
There's a wake I have to attend.

531
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:20,647
Whose wake?

532
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,484
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law passed away.

533
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,945
But isn't it too late right now?

534
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,947
I have a tight schedule tomorrow.

535
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,657
It's better to go now.

536
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,791
-Go to sleep.
-Okay.

537
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,341
Bye.

538
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,197
Right, the short ribs.

539
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:19,455
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

540
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,374
He must have been in a hurry.

541
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,603
It's pouring.

542
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,531
Yoon-seoâ€¦

543
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,870
I see. So she's not there?

544
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,249
Never mind.
She must be out somewhere else.

545
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,126
Okay. I'm sorry for waking you up.

546
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,629
-She's not at Da-som's?
-No.

547
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,839
Where did she go in this rain?

548
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,341
Her phone is still off.

549
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,259
Joong-do isn't picking up either.

550
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,678
I should go to the police station.

551
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,473
Can you go back home?
What if Yoon-seo returns and no one--

552
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,183
Okay. I'll stay at home.

553
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:04,227
-Don't worry too much.
-Thanks.

554
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,817
-Call me if anything comes up.
-Okay.

555
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,029
That's all.

556
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,990
I came here after that.

557
00:35:18,074 --> 00:35:20,868
When we get a report of a runaway,

558
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,745
we start by tracking their whereabouts.

559
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:26,582
But we can't really do that
since your daughter's phone is off.

560
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,002
We'll go out and ask around.

561
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,256
Are there any places
she frequents regularly?

562
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,924
What was she wearing?

563
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,426
It wasâ€¦

564
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,722
-Forget it. I won't go, all right?
-It was brick-red.

565
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,685
She's probably wearing
a brick-red windbreaker.

566
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,687
It's thin and has a hoodie.

567
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,648
She's constantly wearing it
ever since we got it recently.

568
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,077
Honey.

569
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,079
-Honey.
-Honey.

570
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:07,832
It's okay.

571
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,376
I'm sure she's fine.

572
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,504
Are you her husband?

573
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,590
-Yes.
-Please come with us.

574
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,300
This way.

575
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,760
She'll be okay.

576
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,928
Let's go.

577
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,782
-Do you know Nam Yoon-seo?
-No, I don't.

578
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,076
Do you know Nam Yoon-seo?

579
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,745
Have you seen her at school?

580
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:46,746
I don't know.

581
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,915
Sir!

582
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,794
-Have you found her?
-Not yet.

583
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,173
I'll park the car

584
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,008
-and look over there.
-Okay.

585
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,344
-Then I'll go that way.
-Yes, sir.

586
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,017
Yoon-seo.

587
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,977
Excuse me.

588
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,065
-Yoon-seo.
-Pardon?

589
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,996
Ma'am, since our shift has ended,

590
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,999
those two will take over for us.

591
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,126
We're regularly checking the CCTV cameras.

592
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,504
I'm sorry,

593
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,091
but could you get
a few more detectives to help us?

594
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,343
This is the standard procedure
for runaways.

595
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:46,472
We're doing the best we can,
so don't worry too much--

596
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,684
-How could I not be worried?
-Honey.

597
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:52,687
She's been gone
for more than 12 hours now.

598
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,941
Could you bring on at least
two more detectives?

599
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:58,484
Honey, calm down.

600
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,236
How could I be calm right now?

601
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,114
It's our child we're talking about.

602
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,701
Ma'am, please try to calm down.

603
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,078
We're doing our best.

604
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,831
-We're checking the cameras.
-Check your phone.

605
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:14,208
I'm sure she's fine.

606
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,459
HE'S ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO!

607
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,752
Don't worry.

608
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,548
Sir.

609
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:24,260
Are you the assemblyman of Sinyang-gu?

610
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:31,100
You're Assemblyman Nam Joong-do, right?

611
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,271
Yes, I am.

612
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:39,317
I wish you would have told us sooner.

613
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,986
One minute.
Let me report this to the higher-upsâ€¦

614
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,447
-That's not necessary.
-Pardon?

615
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:46,866
Please treat this case like any other.

616
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,200
I don't want any favors.

617
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,618
Honey.

618
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:51,871
Honey.

619
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,082
Let's ask them for help.

620
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,336
Just this once, honey.

621
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:02,256
What if something happens to Yoon-seo?

622
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,219
You're her dad
before you're an assemblyman.

623
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,805
Please?

624
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,029
-I got you some coffee.
-Thank you.

625
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,452
Yes, Chief.

626
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,205
I'll put him on the phone.

627
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,875
-It's our chief.
-Thank you.

628
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,337
Hello, sir.

629
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,381
Yes.

630
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,758
You're making it a missing persons case?

631
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,178
I see.

632
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,722
I'm sorry for troubling you
on your day off.

633
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:54,308
Okay. Goodbye.

634
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:57,978
Thank you.

635
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:05,236
-Hey.
-She goes to Jicheong Middle School.

636
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,612
Have you seen her before?

637
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:10,616
SAUNA, GYM

638
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:14,829
INTERNET CAFE

639
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,182
LOOKING FOR NAM YOON-SEO

640
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:37,476
FEMALE, 15 YO, 163CM, 45KG,
BRICK RED WINDBREAKER

641
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,479
Can you please have a look?

642
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,983
Could you look at this, please?

643
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:50,072
MISSING PERSON

644
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,568
INCOMING CALL

645
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:54,094
She's in shock right now,
so she doesn't remember much.

646
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,307
-My goodness.
-I can't believe this happened.

647
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,684
Hello, sir. Let him in.

648
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,329
Mom, is this my sister Yoon-seo?

649
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:59,285
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

650
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:05,332
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party's eldest son

651
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,419
was found dead
on the banks of the Han River

652
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,920
around 8:55 p.m. this evening.

653
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,797
The police stated they found the bodyâ€¦

654
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,173
-Mom.
-â€¦earlier this afternoon,

655
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,968
while they were searching the area

656
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:18,470
for Assemblyman Nam's missing daughter.

657
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,556
Further investigation into his death

658
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,684
will be carried out
once the body has been recovered.

659
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,687
Nam had been on probation last March

660
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,774
for an intoxicated assault case
at a club in Gangnam

661
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:34,612
when he assaulted another pedestrian
while drunk, resulting in injuriesâ€¦

662
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,405
You can be honest with me.

663
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:39,283
Don't you love your daughter
a bit more than your son?

664
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:40,492
Why wasn't Iâ€¦

665
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,788
Fine. I'd rather you disappear
than cause trouble like this!

666
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,921
Of course not. I love them both equally.

667
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,466
â€¦more honest at that moment?

668
00:43:58,469 --> 00:43:59,803
Is that whyâ€¦

669
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,225
I'm being punished?

670
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:07,686
Ji-hoon.

671
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,356
Ji-hoon.

672
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,596
Soâ€¦

673
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:47,017
your son's biological mother
has passed away?

674
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:49,395
Yes.

675
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:53,816
Your son was released
from prison 15 days ago.

676
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,652
That's right.

677
00:44:56,735 --> 00:45:00,447
Do you know his whereabouts
between that day

678
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,282
and the time of his death?

679
00:45:09,456 --> 00:45:10,666
I went to pick him upâ€¦

680
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:16,046
on the day of his release.

681
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,079
You should have some.
I bought it at the market this morning.

682
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,165
You used to love tofu from there.

683
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,710
Have some. Just a bite.

684
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:44,551
Are you kicking me out now
because I'm an ex-convict?

685
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,263
Your room at home will still be there.

686
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:50,265
Feel free to move back in
whenever you want.

687
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,644
But you want this more than us, don't you?

688
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:58,273
I'll pay the rent and the maintenance fee.

689
00:46:59,525 --> 00:47:02,152
There's 1.5 million won on this card.

690
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,737
This is for your living expenses.

691
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,698
Once that's gone, you're on your own.

692
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:11,119
You must have a lot of money
to get me a house and some allowance.

693
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,833
It was meant to be your college tuition.

694
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:23,382
Keep the house tidy.

695
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:26,343
And come home to eat at least once a week.

696
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:31,598
Answer me, will you?

697
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,768
Okay.

698
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,436
Don't drink too much.

699
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,565
And call your dad.

700
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,611
Take care of yourself.

701
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:47,155
Bye.

702
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:50,534
Here.

703
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,578
I bought you something to wear.

704
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,629
Ji-hoon.

705
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,968
Why don't we stop

706
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:10,929
breaking each other's hearts now?

707
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:14,308
Stop beating around the bush.

708
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,436
You want me to just drop dead
instead of ruining Dad's career.

709
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:19,438
-Ji-hoon.
-You can stop pretending.

710
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,815
You know that's what everyone wants.

711
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:23,567
How could you even say--

712
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,776
What?

713
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,778
Has that never occurred to you?

714
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:29,281
Not even once?

715
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:32,451
Fine.

716
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:36,955
I'd rather you disappear
than cause trouble like this!

717
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:43,920
Are you happy now?

718
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,715
Is that what you wanted to hear?

719
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:02,856
That's all.

720
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,485
On the day of his release,

721
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:11,448
I drove him to his new place.

722
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:16,286
So, have you seen him since then

723
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,121
until the day of the accident?

724
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,041
No.

725
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,044
Just yesterday,

726
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:27,172
I was going to visit him
with some homemade dishesâ€¦

727
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,885
I see.

728
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:38,475
What about you, sir?
Did you meet with him?

729
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,143
No.

730
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:43,647
All right. First of allâ€¦

731
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:49,236
we found one gram
of methamphetamine in his pocket.

732
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,619
No.

733
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,038
That couldn't have been his.

734
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:03,333
-Ji-hoon would have never--
-Honey.

735
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:07,337
And the phone he had with him

736
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,506
turned out to be a burner phone.

737
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:11,466
A burner phone?

738
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,261
Are you sure?

739
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,346
Yes. The phone he had under his name

740
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,223
is still currently turned off.

741
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,559
But the last signal

742
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:24,062
was from about 4.5km upstream.

743
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,981
We're currently looking for it.

744
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,776
We're checking all the CCTV cameras,

745
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:34,573
but there was heavy rain
at the presumed time of his death.

746
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:38,452
And there aren't any cameras
near the Han River.

747
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:40,871
Truthfully,
we're having some difficulties.

748
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:45,041
Althoughâ€¦

749
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,502
a waiter at a club in Gangnam testified

750
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:51,673
that he had seen your son
at the club alone, drinking heavily,

751
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,467
just a few hours prior to his death.

752
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,303
We've obtained CCTV footage
of your son there.

753
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,931
The autopsy result will come out
in 10 to 15 days.

754
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,893
The forensics team will have
to look into his phone,

755
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,603
but judging by the circumstances

756
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:07,397
and the absence of any signs of trauma,

757
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,191
it's most likely

758
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,903
that he drowned after losing his footing

759
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:16,531
while under the influence

760
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,034
of alcohol or narcotics.

761
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,496
We don't know how he obtained
the methamphetamine,

762
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:24,039
but since he's dead,

763
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,126
we won't be able to prosecute him,
and the case will be closed.

764
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,796
Mom! Dad!

765
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:34,132
Mom! Dad!

766
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,468
Momâ€¦

767
00:51:37,219 --> 00:51:38,303
Mom.

768
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:43,058
I just wanted to make you and Dad
worry about me.

769
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,729
Since I didn't have to go to school today

770
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:50,023
I was planning to

771
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:53,777
stay at a sauna somewhere far from homeâ€¦

772
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,407
So why is Ji-hoonâ€¦

773
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,368
Whyâ€¦

774
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,746
I'm sorry.

775
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:06,915
It's all my fault.

776
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:09,668
No, Yoon-seo.

777
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,920
It's not your fault.

778
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:13,922
Yoon-seoâ€¦

779
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,316
SINYANG FUNERAL HOME

780
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,489
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

781
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,744
Please don't bring in any more.

782
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,464
REST IN PEACE
SNU COLLEGE OF LAW ASSOCIATION

783
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,924
DAEHAN PARTY CHAIRWOMAN
WOO JIN-SEOK

784
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,344
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

785
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,388
Thank you.

786
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,976
This is Mr. Bae Gyeong-guk,
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader.

787
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,147
Hello. Thank you for coming.

788
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,774
I can't believe this.

789
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,776
My mother-in-law's funeral
took place here,

790
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,779
and her coffin was borne out this morning.

791
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,489
Stay strong.

792
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:23,783
Thank you.

793
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:34,461
Honestly, his son must have been
such a headache for him.

794
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,505
His son got into trouble right before
the last general election

795
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:38,673
and almost cost him the election.

796
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,926
This could actually be for the best

797
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,219
with the next election around the corner.

798
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,764
The least you can do
is keep your mouths shutâ€¦

799
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,727
if you can't empathize with him.

800
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,897
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

801
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:06,701
Are they her relatives?

802
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,830
I think she'sâ€¦

803
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,751
I think it's Ji-hoon's
maternal grandmother.

804
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,587
His mother's side?

805
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,132
I mean, his biological mother's?

806
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,094
Yes.

807
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,512
By the way,

808
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:29,099
I had no idea her husband
was an assemblyman.

809
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:31,351
How did you hide it from everyone?

810
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,028
2 WEEKS LATER

811
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,375
Hello?

812
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:39,085
Are you really moving out?

813
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,837
It's only been one month.

814
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,923
Yes. I'll call you once everything is set.

815
00:55:45,633 --> 00:55:48,261
Okay. Goodbye.

816
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:40,563
DEATH CERTIFICATE

817
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:58,456
NAME: NAMâ€¦

818
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,224
Hello, ma'am.

819
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,101
Hello.

820
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,562
Were you away on a trip?

821
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,649
-Pardon?
-That box had been empty for a while.

822
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:26,818
THANK YOU FOR THE DELIVERY
ENJOY

823
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,571
I'm sorry. I've been quite busy.

824
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:31,364
Please, don't apologize.

825
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,741
Did you visit somewhere nice?

826
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:39,247
Goodbye, then.

827
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,582
Goodbye.

828
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,239
Hello.

829
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,576
Hello.

830
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:22,707
I'm sorry, but who are you?

831
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,376
I'm--

832
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,006
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

833
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,342
What did you say?

834
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,512
I'm pregnant.

835
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,432
Excuse me?

836
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,350
I'mâ€¦

837
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:42,852
pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby.

838
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,942
The police found

839
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,695
a gram of methamphetamine
in the pocket of Assemblyman Nam's son

840
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,698
whose body was found 15 days ago.

841
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:59,118
According to Sinyang Police Station,

842
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,578
they found a small resealable bag

843
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,414
containing one gram of methamphetamine

844
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,999
as well as a burner phone.

845
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:08,795
To investigate the details of his deathâ€¦

846
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,258
You're pregnantâ€¦

847
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,262
with Ji-hoon's baby?

848
00:59:20,014 --> 00:59:20,848
Yes.

849
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:01,264
TROLLEY

850
01:00:01,347 --> 01:00:03,474
How could they do this
to someone who just lost his son?

851
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:05,810
We're in Yeouido.
You know how it is in politics.

852
01:00:05,893 --> 01:00:06,894
What does she want?

853
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,689
She wants a place to stay.
She has nowhere to go.

854
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:13,151
Your son was caught on the camera
at the entrance of the restroom.

855
01:00:13,234 --> 01:00:14,777
Is Ji-hoon really the father?

856
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,238
I guess you don't want to believe it.
I'll get an abortion.

857
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,157
Everyone is a stranger at first.

858
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,867
She's not just a stranger!

859
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:23,911
That's enough.
Are you here to blackmail them?

860
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,705
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do of
the Daehan Party must take responsibility

861
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:27,582
and step down from his office.

862
