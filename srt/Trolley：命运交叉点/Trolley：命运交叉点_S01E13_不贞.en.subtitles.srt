1
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,777
-There's a wake I have to attend.
-Whose wake?

2
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,864
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law passed away.

3
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,200
But isn't it too late right now?

4
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,452
I have a tight schedule tomorrow.

5
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,204
It's better to go now.

6
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,793
He came around dinnertime

7
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,629
but he didn't even stay for dinner
because he was busy.

8
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,842
The night Ji-hoon died,

9
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,263
Mr. Nam was the last person he met.

10
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,058
What?

11
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:42,769
What about you, sir?
Did you meet with him?

12
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,646
No.

13
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,127
Honey.

14
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:09,796
Did you meet

15
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,465
Ji-hoon that night?

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,301
What?

17
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,471
On the night of Ji-hoon's accident.

18
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,225
Did you meet him?

19
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,859
After you came home from work
that evening,

20
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,778
you got a call from Woo-jae
and went to attend

21
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,364
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law's wake.

22
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,577
But he told me

23
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,747
that you came around dinnertime,

24
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,374
not at night.

25
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,673
Who did you go out to meet that night

26
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,634
after you lied to me
saying Woo-jae called you?

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,725
Did you meet…

28
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:06,352
Ji-hoon?

29
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,112
Why won't you say anything?

30
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,572
I didn't meet him.

31
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,659
You didn't?

32
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,330
Then who was it?

33
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,083
Who did you meet
that you had to lie to me about it?

34
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,257
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,761
I can't tell you.

36
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,098
Why can't you tell me?

37
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:47,560
Are you having an affair?

38
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,188
Hye-joo, what do you mean?

39
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,272
That's absurd.

40
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:53,024
Then who in the world did you meet?

41
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,485
Was it really not Ji-hoon?

42
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,989
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

43
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,996
We need to get back to the office,
so let's just have one drink each.

44
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,290
-Thank you.
-Okay.

45
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,751
Oh, my goodness. What was that?

46
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,337
-Here you go, Bit-na.
-Thank you.

47
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,838
-Thank you for your work.
-Sure.

48
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:16,839
This thing is awesome.

49
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,967
-Third term! Let's go!
-Let's go!

50
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,264
Look, it's Assemblyman Nam.

51
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,059
7 OUT OF 10 SUPPORT NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW

52
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:31,437
To be honest, I was a bit skeptical

53
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,274
about pushing for Namgoong Sol's Law.

54
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,151
There are a lot of juridical issues.

55
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:42,198
But seeing how huge
the response from the public is,

56
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,242
I'm beginning to think

57
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,703
it may actually pass.

58
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,997
We have nothing to lose
even if it doesn't pass.

59
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,250
Grabbing the public's attention
will definitely help us in the election.

60
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,630
To be frank,

61
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,882
I was really shocked.

62
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:04,220
How could someone like him
have a son like that?

63
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,016
And I'll be honest.

64
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:10,476
I get that his son
made a really bad choice,

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,520
but when he called
his own son out publicly,

66
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:15,440
for the first time,

67
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,983
he kind of scared me.

68
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,986
You shouldn't be scared by that.

69
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:21,195
You should be impressed.

70
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,739
That's right.

71
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,741
Here's your pork belly.

72
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,743
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

73
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,619
-Would you like another glass?
-Sure.

74
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,039
Excuse me.

75
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,459
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

76
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:39,756
Hey, Yeong-su.

77
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,595
What?

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,437
Sorry, one minute.

79
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:58,441
What is it?

80
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,528
What?

81
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,239
A post written by Jin Seung-hee
is spreading quickly.

82
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,667
Mom.

83
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,420
I wrote all about it online.

84
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,091
That Seung-ho died
because Kim Jae-un framed him

85
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,051
saying he molested her.

86
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,471
What?

87
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,183
You've lived in agony
and grief for so long.

88
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,895
It'll be over soon.

89
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,900
Right.

90
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,407
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO'S WIFE
KILLED MY TWIN BROTHER

91
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:51,119
20 YEARS AGO IN YOUNGSAN…

92
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,167
HE HAD THE NERVE TO PROPOSE
NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW

93
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,585
IT WOULD ONLY PROTECT THE LIKES OF HER

94
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,003
HE'S COVERING UP
HIS WIFE'S WRONGDOING

95
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,058
LEE JAE-U, GYEONGHU DAILY REPORTER

96
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,287
Stop reading them.

97
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,922
Since the case was never
properly investigated,

98
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,175
it'll be up to the court
of public opinion.

99
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,969
The public will decide
who is telling the truth.

100
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,432
So don't hide.

101
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,850
You have to stand tall.

102
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,604
That's the only way
people will believe you.

103
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,150
What I'm saying is…

104
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,152
Let's go on TV.

105
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,237
We're all out of options.

106
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,535
You keep pressuring me to go on TV.

107
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,581
Are you sure you haven't
made that decision before asking?

108
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,416
-Hye-joo.
-Answer me.

109
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,043
I didn't.

110
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,377
Believe me.

111
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,337
No.

112
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,673
I can't believe you right now.

113
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,509
Hye-joo.

114
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,677
I just don't understand
what could be so bad

115
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,930
that you'd rather have me
think you're cheating

116
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,973
or if there even could be
something so bad.

117
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,439
I'll think about going on TV.

118
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,900
Just give me some time.

119
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,655
Okay.

120
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,497
Mom.

121
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,917
Why were you in Seoul?

122
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,627
What?

123
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,755
Do you still not remember
why you drove yourself to Seoul?

124
00:09:07,838 --> 00:09:10,007
You can't drive too well.

125
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,469
I don't know.

126
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,055
My head hurts. I'm going to sleep.

127
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,735
UNCLE

128
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,869
The person you are trying to reach is…

129
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,288
Darn it.

130
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:45,501
Why won't she pick up
after making such a mess?

131
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:47,878
This way, ma'am.

132
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,672
My goodness.

133
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,507
Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok.

134
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,217
Good evening.

135
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:54,677
I'm sorry for being late.

136
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,304
Not at all.

137
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,014
You're right on time.

138
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,974
Please have a seat.

139
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,025
So you'll make sure
that all the pending bills

140
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,528
proposed by the Daehan Party
will pass the deliberation process

141
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,572
at the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee?

142
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,824
Is that what you're saying?

143
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,328
That's correct.

144
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,623
I'll make sure

145
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:28,127
that at least ten of them will pass.

146
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,175
On what condition?

147
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:39,180
I'd like for the Daehan Party to oppose

148
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,725
to Namgoong Sol's Law
proposed by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

149
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:47,313
There's no way it will pass anyway

150
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:50,608
due to the juridical issues involved.

151
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,444
I just…

152
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,697
don't want to see you get swept up
in Assemblyman Nam's incitement

153
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:00,326
and waste your energy in the wrong places.

154
00:11:00,409 --> 00:11:03,913
Strictly speaking, it's not impossible.

155
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,247
It's simply difficult.

156
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,168
If he can win over the public,

157
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,587
who knows what will happen?

158
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,842
You have several
excellent public welfare bills

159
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:20,805
pending at the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee.

160
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,765
Yes.

161
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,266
And it's all thanks to

162
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,936
the Nation and People's Party.

163
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:32,983
That is exactly why I'm making this offer.

164
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:37,279
A mere penal code amendment

165
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,449
that will only benefit
a handful of people,

166
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:43,119
or ten welfare bills

167
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,829
that can benefit countless people.

168
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,209
Which one do you think is more valuable?

169
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,316
I'll sleep in another room tonight.

170
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,253
Can't fall asleep?

171
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,963
Because of that online post?

172
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,259
There is that.

173
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:47,183
Is there something else?

174
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,187
Did you have a fight with Joong-do?

175
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,029
No.

176
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,322
Go to sleep, Yeo-jin.

177
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:31,519
The online post is undermining
the favorable public opinion

178
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,396
that formed after you proposed
Namgoong Sol's Law.

179
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,814
Right.

180
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:40,778
The point of this bill is
to allow investigations to continue

181
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:46,075
even after the sex offender dies
in order to bring justice to the victim,

182
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,494
and the post claims that Ms. Kim

183
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:52,331
framed an innocent person for a sex crime

184
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,084
and drove him to his death.

185
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,798
Reporters have been calling all morning.

186
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,427
It's only a matter of time
before this gets covered by the media.

187
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,268
I know you're all frustrated,

188
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,728
but please give me time
to figure out my next move,

189
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:19,149
and tell the reporters
that I'll make a statement soon.

190
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,071
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

191
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,252
Nam Joong-do's wife, Kim Hye-joo!

192
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,715
Is it true that you framed a man
for sexual assault and caused his death?

193
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,594
Kim Hye-joo! Come out this instant
and tell us the truth!

194
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,137
Kim Hye-joo!

195
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,558
The entire nation wants to know the truth!

196
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,935
Nam Joong-do! Kim Hye-joo!

197
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,022
Come out and tell the truth!

198
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,442
Tell us the truth! Tell us now!

199
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,028
Nam Joong-do's wife framed
an SNU law student-to-be

200
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,238
of a sexual crime

201
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:09,199
and drove him to his death.

202
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:14,872
I'm in front of her house
to meet her right now.

203
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,585
Nam Joong-do of the Daehan Party
is misleading the nation

204
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:23,631
with a disgraceful bill
named after a prostitute

205
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:25,925
when this was revealed about his wife.

206
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,927
How ironic is that?

207
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,811
-Are you okay? I'm sorry.
-Yes, I'm fine.

208
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,242
HEADQUARTERS CS TEAM

209
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,039
Hello?

210
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,211
CS training at the headquarters?

211
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:06,090
Yes. I called to inform you
that it's been postponed a week

212
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,634
as the trainer is unavailable
due to personal reasons.

213
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,390
Mr. Choi went to the Seoul headquarters
for the CS training.

214
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,350
He went to the Seoul headquarters?

215
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,104
I thought the training
took place last week.

216
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,522
Last week?

217
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,524
It's held once every quarter, ma'am.

218
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,254
I'm so glad you got here early.

219
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,881
You must have come here
straight from the headquarters.

220
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:50,342
Yes.

221
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,142
Mom?

222
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,902
LEE JAE-U, GYEONGHU DAILY REPORTER

223
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:11,238
NEW MESSAGE
MISSED CALL

224
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,249
POWER OFF

225
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,028
HUSBAND

226
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,072
The phone is turned off.

227
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:56,742
You will be redirected to voicemail.

228
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,290
Call me.

229
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,759
Isn't the news about
Yoon-seo's mom shocking?

230
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:14,676
Yes.

231
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,012
What happened to her brother
wasn't so shocking,

232
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,180
but this totally was.

233
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,272
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO'S WIFE
KILLED MY TWIN BROTHER

234
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,774
20 YEARS AGO IN YOUNGSAN…

235
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,150
SHE FRAMED HIM FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT

236
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,907
Yoon-seo, don't go
to after-school classes today.

237
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:37,950
Come to the studio.

238
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,620
You can't go home. Understand?

239
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,666
Yes, Yeo-jin.

240
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,585
Don't go home after work.

241
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,755
Meet me and Yoon-seo at my studio
so we can go home together.

242
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,550
Yes.

243
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,803
Okay. Thanks.

244
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,859
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

245
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,156
Hello, Ms. Kim.

246
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,365
Woo-jae.

247
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,828
Sorry? At your house?

248
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,251
I see.

249
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,174
Are you at your studio right now?

250
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,134
Yes.

251
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,305
Ms. Kim.

252
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,684
I'm just getting my facts straight,
so don't take this personally.

253
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,146
About Jin Seung-ho's case…

254
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,318
If there's anything
you haven't told Assemblyman Nam,

255
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,906
could you please tell me right now?

256
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,449
We need to come up with a plan.

257
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:01,992
Woo-jae.

258
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,660
I told the truth.

259
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,372
Okay. I understand.

260
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,501
Things aren't looking good
after the online post today.

261
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:13,754
Could you…

262
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,382
go on the news this evening?

263
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,259
Today?

264
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,429
Is everything already decided?

265
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,182
No, ma'am.

266
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,767
We're waiting for you to decide.

267
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,982
I'll ask someone at the district office

268
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,109
to go to your house and check.

269
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,153
I'll inform Assemblyman Nam as well.

270
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:40,572
I'll be in touch.

271
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:42,991
Goodbye.

272
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:49,122
She'll really need to grow thicker skin.

273
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,589
Hello, Mr. Yoo.

274
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:14,314
You should tell Seung-hee the truth.

275
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,734
Apologize to Jae-eun…

276
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,027
No.

277
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,029
You should beg for her forgiveness.

278
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:22,614
No.

279
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,784
I could never do that.

280
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,329
Mom, I got into
the SNU School of Law today.

281
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,878
Are you going to let her
accuse me of a sex crime?

282
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,214
No, right?

283
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,017
I will

284
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,145
never let anyone call my son

285
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,314
a sex offender.

286
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,732
Ms. Lee.

287
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,734
What?

288
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,777
Are you going to tell Seung-hee?

289
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:18,378
Seung-hee.

290
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,548
Do you have anything to tell me?

291
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,096
I do.

292
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,975
Jae-eun

293
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,102
didn't lie.

294
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:38,106
She was molested by Seung-ho.

295
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,444
-What?
-Your mother was the one who lied.

296
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:44,404
She's been deceiving you for 20 years.

297
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,493
Don't be ridiculous.

298
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,578
I'm innocent.

299
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,665
Kim Jae-eun is lying.

300
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,793
Seung-ho was innocent when he died.

301
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,878
He told me so.

302
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,296
That's not true.

303
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,756
He lied to you.

304
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:04,758
Before he died,

305
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:07,094
he came clean with your mother.

306
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,768
Did you meet with Jae-eun?

307
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:19,815
You did.

308
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,983
Do you like her?

309
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,321
Is that why you're accusing
Seung-ho and my mom of lying?

310
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,531
To defend her?

311
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,657
Seung-hee.

312
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,702
He's the one who's lying!

313
00:23:34,121 --> 00:23:36,623
You're the one who lied, not me!

314
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,291
Seung-hee.

315
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:41,044
He was scheming with
Jae-eun's husband behind our backs.

316
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:46,591
He was going to give him
evidence of my real estate speculation.

317
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,261
I came to Seoul to confront him
and got into that accident.

318
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,012
Ms. Lee!

319
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,848
Choi Ki-young.

320
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,890
Is this true?

321
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,602
Seung-hee, let's talk outside.

322
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,521
You can leave.

323
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:02,941
Get out.

324
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:03,984
Right now.

325
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,699
What's the point of advocating
severe punishment for sex crimes

326
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,617
and conducting seminars?

327
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,537
We can't keep our own people in order.

328
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,415
Assemblyman Nam,
what's the matter with your family?

329
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:20,375
This will affect the general election.

330
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:21,459
Leave the party!

331
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:24,254
Look, Assemblyman Nam.

332
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,884
You should give up on
that Namgoong Sol's Law first.

333
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,927
With the election coming up,

334
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,514
I'm afraid a sensitive issue like this
will divide the people.

335
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,435
Bringing the people together
should be our priority.

336
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,771
I'm sorry for causing a stir.

337
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,609
But I will take care of my wife's case,

338
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,612
and I'll win the public over again.

339
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,324
Just like you said,
this is a sensitive issue.

340
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,119
If we handle it well,
it'll help us greatly in the election.

341
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,121
So I'm…

342
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,999
asking for your support.

343
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:05,545
Chairwoman Woo,
haven't you always supported

344
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,089
severe punishment for sex crimes?

345
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:11,468
I need your help.

346
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,054
We already have a ton of bills

347
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,806
pending at the Legislation
and Judiciary Committee.

348
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,226
Why would we put
all our eggs in that basket?

349
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,486
Mom, I'm here.

350
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,529
Hey, Yoon-seo.

351
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,244
You're here.

352
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:39,913
Did you come straight from school?
Are you hungry?

353
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,917
-Mom.
-Yes?

354
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,211
I read the post.

355
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,299
You did?

356
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,717
Yes.

357
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,760
But Mom.

358
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,017
You didn't lie, did you?

359
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,021
-Yoon-seo.
-After reading that post,

360
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,731
I'm having doubts.

361
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:10,277
You are an innocent victim

362
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,737
like you told me before.

363
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,657
Right?

364
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,249
Yoon-seo.

365
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,003
I didn't lie.

366
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,840
Why would I lie about that?

367
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:36,136
After he died, I was really--

368
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,512
But it's just odd.

369
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,474
He got into SNU
and had a bright future ahead of him.

370
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,767
So why would he do that?

371
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,105
Hye-joo, I'm here.

372
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,732
Are you telling the truth?

373
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,442
Can I believe you

374
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,195
instead of everyone else?

375
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:59,909
You didn't lie to get money, did you?

376
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,161
Yoon-seo!

377
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,095
Yeo-jin.

378
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,681
Can you take her to your restaurant?

379
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,769
Are you sure
you don't want to come with us?

380
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,648
Yes, I have some work to finish
before I leave.

381
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,488
Okay.

382
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,448
Call me.

383
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:42,786
Yoon-seo, let's go.

384
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,290
Yoon-seo.

385
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:52,522
Sir.

386
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,482
Yes?

387
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,944
Ms. Kim called.

388
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,197
Some people showed up outside your house.

389
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:03,575
Because of that online post?

390
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,701
Yes.

391
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,204
She's at her studio right now.

392
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,374
They were gone by the time
Mr. Yoo went to check.

393
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,546
HYE-JOO

394
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,632
Hey, honey.

395
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,301
I'll go on TV.

396
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,512
And I want to do it as soon as possible.

397
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,432
If I can't avoid it,
I might as well get it over with.

398
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,019
Okay.

399
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,022
-Then--
-Hye-joo.

400
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,358
Thank you for your courage.

401
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:39,778
I mean it.

402
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,048
She says she'll go on TV.
Let's do it tomorrow.

403
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,593
Not today?

404
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,639
No one cares about a guy
who puts out a small fire.

405
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:10,892
Let's wait for it to turn into a wildfire.

406
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,897
But the longer we wait,
the riskier it will be for us.

407
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,191
Those currently supporting
Namgoong Sol's Law

408
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,859
might turn their backs on us.

409
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:20,902
I know.

410
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,863
But for that law to pass,

411
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,825
I have no choice but to take a gamble.

412
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,662
But Ms. Kim will suffer
and be condemned for that much longer.

413
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,878
I have no choice

414
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,213
for the greater good.

415
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,633
Plus, I'm doing all of this

416
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,718
for her sake as well.

417
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,346
Yes, sir.

418
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,810
Ms. Jin accused my wife on the internet.

419
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,478
What?

420
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,479
She did?

421
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,857
I guess you didn't know.

422
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,526
As a result,

423
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,820
my wife is suffering greatly.

424
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,370
I'm determined
to get to the bottom of that case.

425
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:17,041
And I'm about to give you
a chance to reveal the truth

426
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,294
and set things right.

427
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,923
Evidence of Assemblyman Kang
and your mother-in-law's land speculation.

428
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:25,758
Please hand it over.

429
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,929
I'll give you one day.

430
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,269
I'll be in touch.

431
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:37,604
I will…

432
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,775
have it ready for you tomorrow.

433
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,989
Okay.

434
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,450
Thank you.

435
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,535
Like I promised,

436
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:54,704
I'll keep you anonymous.

437
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,539
I'm giving you the evidence,

438
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,084
but not because I'm afraid
my wife will find out.

439
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,213
Once the truth is out,

440
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,717
this situation will change…

441
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,846
in one way or another.

442
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,310
Hey, Hye-joo.

443
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,270
Mr. Yoo gave us a ride home.

444
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,397
No one's here now, so hurry home.

445
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:23,942
Okay, I will.

446
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,361
Bye.

447
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,369
DA-SOM'S MOM (HWANG JI-SOO)

448
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,168
Hey, Ji-soo.

449
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:47,465
Can I call you back? I'm a bit--

450
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,805
About Ji-hoon?

451
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,810
Let me get you on an IV first.

452
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,979
You look so pale.

453
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:02,522
Tell me what you wanted to say.

454
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,571
Actually,

455
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,323
I'm not supposed to tell you this

456
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,117
because of doctor-patient confidentiality.

457
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,538
But I thought you could
get some weight off your chest.

458
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,500
The…

459
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,338
The girl who was allegedly
sexually assaulted by Ji-hoon…

460
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,634
Is her name Kim Soo-bin?

461
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,221
How did you know that?

462
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,849
I see.

463
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:40,768
Last time we met…

464
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,441
Who's that in the picture?

465
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,485
She's Ji-hoon's…

466
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,488
I recognized her in the photo
that you dropped.

467
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,868
She was a patient of mine.

468
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,662
She didn't know she had a miscarriage.

469
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,584
She had a miscarriage?

470
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,420
I guess you didn't know.

471
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,214
It was a missed miscarriage.

472
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,263
So…

473
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:21,100
So is she okay?

474
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,811
She came back with abdominal pain
after the surgery.

475
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,980
But it was nothing serious.

476
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,942
By the way,

477
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,445
did she tell you

478
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,115
that the baby was Ji-hoon's?

479
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:38,618
Yes.

480
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,414
Was it not?

481
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,002
No, it wasn't.

482
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:53,674
She got pregnant
while Ji-hoon was in prison.

483
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,052
So it couldn't have been his.

484
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,312
NA YE-EUN

485
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,940
Why aren't you here?

486
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,316
Did you go see a doctor?

487
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,610
Are you pregnant?

488
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,612
SOO-BIN, I'M IN TROUBLE
PLEASE ANSWER YOUR PHONE

489
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,822
How have you been?

490
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:31,254
She had the miscarriage
about eight weeks into her pregnancy.

491
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,215
Apparently, he was drunk.

492
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:38,970
Ji-hoon passed away about two weeks

493
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,597
after he was released from prison.

494
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:50,898
That means she became pregnant
during his time in prison.

495
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,527
The pregnancy test kit can be inaccurate,

496
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,446
so I had a blood test
at the hospital yesterday.

497
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,575
This number means I'm five weeks pregnant,

498
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,035
so I got pregnant three weeks ago.

499
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:07,832
Which means there's no way
it could have been Ji-hoon's baby.

500
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,004
And I don't think

501
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,214
she was sexually assaulted either.

502
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,511
I have a question about induced abortion.

503
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,680
I was told at another clinic

504
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:24,724
that it's now legal

505
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:27,226
for someone who isn't
a rape victim to get it.

506
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,771
Anyway,

507
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,151
do you do that here?

508
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,239
I wasn't raped

509
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,658
or anything like that.

510
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,038
She said that she wasn't raped,

511
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,331
so it must be true.

512
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,959
Although you'd have to ask her to be sure.

513
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,558
Not who you were expecting?

514
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,771
You're so naive.

515
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,775
Why is Ji-hoon's family such a mess?

516
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,027
Even his mom made the news today.

517
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,404
Why?

518
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,907
When she was young and money hungry,

519
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,826
she framed a top student
for molesting her,

520
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,286
and he killed himself.

521
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,581
His sister exposed her online.

522
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:32,917
Yeo-jin.

523
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,837
Back when I lived in Youngsan,

524
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:40,383
my friend's brother died.

525
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:45,721
I was molested by him,
so I went to the police.

526
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,308
And that night,

527
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:53,521
he killed himself.

528
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:57,942
She really was molested.

529
00:37:58,651 --> 00:37:59,568
It's true.

530
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,861
Who cares?

531
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,491
You know,

532
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:10,204
when I first found out you were pregnant,
I thought I was the father.

533
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,790
So I regretted breaking up with you.

534
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,875
It would have been the token of our love.

535
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,086
-I was pissed to find out Ji-hoon--
-Hold on.

536
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,300
How did you know I was pregnant?

537
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,182
What?

538
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:32,018
Ji-hoon's dad

539
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,104
didn't mention that
at the press conference.

540
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:36,605
How did you know?

541
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,030
Were you the one
who sent my medical records

542
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,116
to that other assemblyman?

543
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,328
Did you go through my phone too?

544
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,455
What did you expect after betraying me?

545
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,126
I didn't do much.

546
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:01,088
I found a medical document on your phone.

547
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,300
…that you got pregnant
as a result of a sexual assault.

548
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,219
I just asked Ye-eun to go
to the clinic and pretend to be you.

549
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,389
You said the assailant was your boyfriend.

550
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,309
Why did you frame Ji-hoon for rape?

551
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,314
You couldn't get any money
because his dad told the press, right?

552
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,156
Hey.

553
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,286
Run an errand for me.

554
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,958
No? Would you rather go to prison?

555
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,046
What?

556
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,133
You lent out your bank account
for dealing meth.

557
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,344
When did I ever--

558
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,933
BACK

559
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,727
Someone's been busy.

560
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,278
Is that why you took my bankbook and card?

561
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,168
Did he really…

562
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,170
Did Ji-hoon really

563
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:24,839
do that

564
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,216
to you?

565
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,015
No.

566
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,522
The person you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

567
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,652
KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

568
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,546
The person you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

569
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,590
Please leave a message at the tone.

570
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,225
Soo-bin, it's Ji-hoon's mom.

574
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,064
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong.

575
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,690
This is Woo Jin-seok.

576
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,785
Then I'll lower the security deposit
by ten million won.

577
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,995
Okay. Thank you in advance.

578
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,924
Yeo-jin, are you in?

579
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,467
Hey, you're home.

580
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,934
Yeo-jin.

581
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,562
Soo-bin had

582
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,939
a miscarriage.

583
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,111
And the baby wasn't Ji-hoon's.

584
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:58,117
And it doesn't seem like

585
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,830
he sexually assaulted her.

586
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,710
Is that right?

587
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,299
Thank goodness.

588
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,302
That's a relief.

589
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:20,723
That's a huge relief.

590
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,857
Soo-bin told me

591
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,694
that Joong-do met Ji-hoon

592
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,405
just before his accident.

593
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,119
But Joong-do says
that he didn't meet him that night.

594
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:46,165
But he won't tell me who he met.

595
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,544
He lied to me
that he was attending a wake.

596
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,966
I even asked him
if he was having an affair.

597
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,638
But he still wouldn't tell me.
Who could it have been?

598
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,768
But you know what?

599
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:10,439
He told me he'd been
blackmailed by Soo-bin.

600
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,734
But what if…

601
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,196
God forbid, what if that was a lie?

602
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,534
I'm just so scared that there might be
something else I don't know about.

603
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:30,376
But I can't believe
everything Soo-bin tells me.

604
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,130
I can't trust anybody right now.

605
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,682
I guess there's someone I can trust.

606
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,185
I still have you.

607
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,129
Take this burner phone.

608
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,756
Come out when I call you.

609
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:21,343
Okay?

610
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,806
I was wondering why
Ji-hoon had meth on him.

611
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:30,310
You had him make a drop, didn't you?

612
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,106
No.

613
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:35,941
That bastard

614
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,360
stole it.

615
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,321
I told him to deliver it
on the day he died.

616
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,490
But he refused, so Ye-eun went instead.

617
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,535
But he snatched it

618
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,912
before the client could pick it up.

619
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,249
He refused to get involved in drug dealing

620
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,667
only to use it himself.

621
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,878
He got what he deserved.

622
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:57,421
Don't you agree?

623
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,889
BLOCKED NUMBERS

624
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,516
RECENTS

625
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,852
Ms. Kim?

626
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,317
YOU CAN NOW RECEIVE
CALLS AND MESSAGES FROM THIS NUMBER

627
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:32,706
Listen, Kim Soo-bin.

628
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:35,876
Just a second.

629
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,181
INCOMING CALL

630
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,563
"JD"?

631
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,398
Is he the father?

632
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,988
What's wrong?

633
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,114
Is he harassing you?

634
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,035
Did you stay at
Mr. Nam's place to avoid him?

635
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,592
If you cooperate with us,
we can keep you safe from him.

636
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:31,557
And how are you going to do that?

637
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:34,226
It's really not that hard for us.

638
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,729
So don't worry about that

639
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,399
and stay away from Ms. Kim.

640
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,734
Just cooperate with us.

641
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,072
Got it?

642
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,370
Okay.

643
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:56,123
Good.

644
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,134
You're still up.

645
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,262
It's late.

646
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,517
TV is scheduled for tomorrow.

647
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:21,398
If you ever felt like
I was pressuring you to do this,

648
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,026
that's my fault.

649
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:26,528
I'm sorry.

650
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,782
Honey.

651
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:35,412
What you should be sorry about is

652
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,623
what happened that night.

653
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:43,545
Are you really not going to tell me
who you met that night?

654
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,683
Do you know how it feels
when the husband that I love

655
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,644
is hiding something from me?

656
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:05,150
It's a living hell.

657
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,740
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

658
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,792
I met Ji-hoon that day.

659
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,129
Ji-hoon?

660
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,426
You met him that night?

661
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,428
Is that true?

662
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,722
That's not what you said yesterday.

663
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:40,143
That night…

664
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,022
I…

665
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,069
scolded him.

666
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,911
Sir. You didn't drink too much, did you?

667
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:02,040
No, the patron didn't seem to drink much.

668
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,876
I'm almost home.

669
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,052
NAM JI-HOON

670
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,643
Long time no talk, Ji-hoon.

671
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,854
How have you--

672
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,149
What?

673
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,234
You called me for the first time in months

674
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,778
to tell me you got in trouble while drunk?

675
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,363
What are you--

676
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:36,074
So get over here right now!

677
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,035
Where are you?

678
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,288
Text me the address.

679
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,500
HYE-JOO

680
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:49,963
Okay. Get home safely.

681
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,507
I swear, this kid…

682
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,596
Where are you meeting him? I'll drive you.

683
00:50:59,055 --> 00:51:00,348
I can't go right away.

684
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,434
I told Hye-joo I was almost home.

685
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:06,521
And I can't tell her
he got in trouble again.

686
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,817
She might actually collapse
from the shock this time.

687
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,323
You should go home and come out later.

688
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,616
I'll give you a call.

689
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,076
Tell her you're attending

690
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,539
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law's wake.

691
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,797
Why won't you let your mom live in peace?

692
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:35,300
Think about all the times
you got in trouble!

693
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:36,968
Get it together!

694
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:41,556
I got pretty upset with him.

695
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,686
And he passed right after.

696
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,858
It drove me crazy.

697
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,863
So when you asked me about it,

698
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,117
I got flustered and I lied to you.

699
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,830
I was in so much pain…

700
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,917
that I didn't want to tell anyone.

701
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,046
Especially not you.

702
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,758
I really wanted to

703
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,636
hide it from you.

704
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,226
That's why I couldn't tell you.

705
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:31,898
I'm sorry

706
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,734
for hurting you.

707
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:43,034
Fine. I'd rather you disappear
than cause trouble like this!

708
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,712
No.

709
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:57,257
Don't blame yourself, okay?

710
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:00,093
You had no idea

711
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:03,722
that it would be

712
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:07,017
the last time you'd see Ji-hoon.

713
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,515
CURRENT HUMIDITY

714
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,366
Soo-bin.

715
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,837
I came to tell you something.

716
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,220
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICEMAIL
PRESS THE CALL BUTTON TO LISTEN

717
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,438
Soo-bin.

718
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:03,610
Even if you had falsely accused Ji-hoon,

719
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,153
I'll forgive you.

720
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,865
So please just tell me the truth.

721
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,204
But above all, Soo-bin,

722
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:16,831
I truly hope

723
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,628
you weren't sexually assaulted.

724
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:23,379
Of course

725
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:28,510
it's partially because I don't want
my son to be a sex offender,

726
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:31,054
but more importantly,

727
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:36,101
I really hope that you didn't go through

728
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:39,437
something so terrible.

729
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,565
And Soo-bin.

730
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:47,278
I heard you had a miscarriage

731
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,449
and that the baby wasn't Ji-hoon's.

732
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,787
I also heard you were alone
when you got the abortion.

733
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,460
I wish you would have just told me.

734
00:57:03,711 --> 00:57:05,880
How did you bear
all that pain on your own?

735
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,525
Your husband…

736
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,572
and the lady from the noodle shop…

737
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:34,159
are having an affair.

738
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,081
I'm blackmailing you right now.

739
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,043
I know you're having an affair.

740
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,464
Ji-hoon and I

741
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,175
saw everything at your house.

742
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,177
Are you afraid that Hye-joo will find out?

743
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,476
It was the day of Ji-hoon's accident.

744
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,066
The day I ran into you
in front of the clinic,

745
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,820
what I was going to tell you there was…

746
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:16,284
It was that your husband
might have killed Ji-hoon.

747
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:19,829
What?

748
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,957
Have you gone crazy? How could you say--

749
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,334
Ji-hoon told me

750
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,961
he was going to confront his dad
about the affair that day.

751
00:58:28,838 --> 00:58:30,715
You're having an affair.

752
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,470
And he died right after that.

753
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,973
That's why I think…

754
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,936
he might have killed Ji-hoon.

755
00:59:18,596 --> 00:59:22,809
INFIDELITY

756
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:49,168
TROLLEY

757
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,546
Don't tell anyone about what you just saw.

758
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:53,298
Are you afraid that Hye-joo will find out?

759
00:59:53,381 --> 00:59:55,675
He's definitely capable of killing.

760
00:59:55,758 --> 00:59:57,468
Just what are you accusing me of?

761
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:59,679
I want both of you out of this house.

762
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:02,098
I'll handle Namgoong Sol's law on my own.

763
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,391
Throw it away!

764
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,892
There's no way it was suicide.

765
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:08,062
Whatever she says, we can just deny it.

766
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,439
Have you lost your mind?

767
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,899
It was inevitable for the greater good.

768
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:16,863
