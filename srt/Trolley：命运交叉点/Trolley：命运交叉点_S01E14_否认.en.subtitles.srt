1
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,434
Your husband is…

2
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,438
having an affair with that lady.

3
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,859
Ji-hoon and I saw everything
at your house that day.

4
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,571
That's why he went
to see his dad that night.

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,949
To tell him he knows
and that he needs to stop.

6
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,786
That's why I think…

7
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,790
he might have killed Ji-hoon.

8
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:34,010
INFIDELITY

9
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:37,555
DENIAL

10
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,310
Mom.

11
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,479
AUGUST 19, 2022
THE DAY OF JI-HOON'S ACCIDENT

12
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,314
Mom.

13
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,152
I guess she's not here.

14
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:01,121
CONTACTS

15
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,583
MOM

16
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,088
Let's go to my house.

17
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,423
She must be there.

18
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,177
Your house?

19
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:18,304
That would be kind of awkward--

20
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,305
It's okay.

21
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,683
My mom will definitely help you.

22
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:24,853
She knows

23
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,939
what it's like to be without family.

24
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,776
You want to end it with Jung-dae,

25
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,778
don't you?

26
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,372
Who parked in front of my house?

27
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,424
Come in.

28
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,112
Mom.

29
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,335
Why did you stop in high school?

30
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,837
What?

31
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,048
You stopped measuring after middle school.

32
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,384
No reason.

33
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,553
Here's some water.

34
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,805
Thanks.

35
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:53,107
Can I take a nap until your mom gets home?

36
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,985
I've been oddly tired lately.

37
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,612
I can't seem to stay awake.

38
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,824
-Sure.
-Just a quick nap.

39
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,937
Where are you going?

40
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:20,611
Is your mom here?

41
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,323
No.

42
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:26,534
Then what is it?

43
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,406
I made a mistake.

44
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,741
Don't call it a mistake.

45
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,119
It wasn't a mistake.

46
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,163
Will you keep it down?

47
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,081
Why?

48
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,291
Are you afraid that Hye-joo will find out?

49
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:22,799
Fine.

50
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,802
It may have been a mistake for you.

51
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,763
But I've been confused
and tormented ever since.

52
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,101
I can barely…

53
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:07,260
Let's get out of here.

54
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:57,602
Hey.

55
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,229
Are you all right?

56
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,027
Don't tell anyone

57
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,987
about what you just saw.

58
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,865
Okay.

59
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,580
5 YEARS AGO, THE NIGHT OF
JI-HOON'S MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION

60
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,502
NAM JI-HOON
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

61
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,879
DIPLOMA, NAM JI-HOON
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

62
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,965
NAM JI-HOON

63
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,334
It's so disgusting.

64
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,384
That was five years ago
and it's still going on.

65
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,428
That's exactly why I left home.

66
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,770
I'm sorry you had to see me like this.

67
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,816
It's so embarrassing.

68
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,988
I feel the same way.

69
00:10:15,323 --> 00:10:17,742
I've been trying to break up
with Jung-dae but I can't.

70
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,203
And you've put up with that.

71
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,542
I'm surrounded by pieces of shit.

72
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,799
That does it.

73
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,468
I need to meet Dad.

74
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,845
-Right now?
-No.

75
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,764
I can't see him at this hour anyway.

76
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,724
His schedule is always full.

77
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,393
He wouldn't show up

78
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,145
unless I was dead or something.

79
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,398
Jung-dae wanted to see me today.

80
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,817
I'll meet up with him first

81
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,736
and I'll go see my dad late at night.

82
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,033
Do you have to meet Jung-dae?

83
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,535
Why does he want to see you?

84
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,704
No idea.

85
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:06,040
But if I don't go,

86
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,875
he'll think I helped you run away.

87
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm going to tell my dad
that I'll expose his affair

88
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,010
if he doesn't stop now.

89
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,180
If he wants to keep
his political career alive,

90
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,474
he'll have to stop.

91
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,855
Then he left.

92
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:45,704
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party's eldest son

93
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,749
was found dead
on the banks of the Han River

94
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,167
around 8:55 p.m. this evening.

95
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,671
Nam had been on probation last March
for an intoxicated assault case

96
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,673
at a club in Gangnam

97
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:58,467
when he assaulted
another pedestrian while drunk,

98
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,554
resulting in injuries
that would take six weeks to recover.

99
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:05,558
He had just finished
his 4-month sentence about 15 days ago…

100
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,308
INCOMING CALL

101
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,317
MISSED CALL

102
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:03,991
Are you hiding again?

103
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,951
Do you think I won't find you?

104
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,965
She knows what it's like
to be without family.

105
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,010
My mom will definitely help you.

106
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,232
Hello.

107
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,901
I'm sorry, but who are you?

108
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:54,250
Could you let me stay here?

109
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,882
Ji-hoon said he was going to

110
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,927
threaten his dad
saying he'll expose his affair.

111
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:08,764
That's why I'm saying his death
might not have been an accident.

112
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,975
That's not what happened, Soo-bin.

113
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:12,017
Ji-hoon was going to…

114
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,897
I know his text said he was going to
kill himself because of me.

115
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,441
But you got it all wrong.

116
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,194
How did you know about the text?

117
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,405
Mr. Nam told me.

118
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:27,950
But there's no way it was suicide.

119
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:30,202
Because the last time I talked to him, he…

120
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,537
What?

121
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,581
You're pregnant?

122
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,250
Yes.

123
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,754
Should I tell Jung-dae?

124
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,506
What do I do?

125
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,591
No.

126
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,175
If you do, you're stuck with him.

127
00:14:45,843 --> 00:14:48,846
God knows what he'll do
if you try to break up with him again.

128
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,557
Don't call him.

129
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,726
If I do what with Jung-dae?

130
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:55,227
You're breaking up.

131
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,395
Hold on.

132
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,985
RECENT CALLS
NAM JI-HOON

133
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:04,945
Don't ever say you want to break up.

134
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,616
Why do you keep doing that?

135
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,910
Do you have a death wish?

136
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,542
NAM JI-HOON

137
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,755
-Hello?
-Did you see my text?

138
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,340
Stay put for now.

139
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,424
I'll be there soon.

140
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,176
All right.

141
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,845
Did you meet your dad?

142
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:30,971
Where are you?

143
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,598
I did.

144
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,433
I'm on the banks of the Han River.

145
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,894
I talked to him
right after he met his dad.

146
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,938
He was furious at my boyfriend

147
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,357
when I told him I got pregnant.

148
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,901
It makes no sense
that he would kill himself.

149
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:45,277
He said he was going to kill him.

150
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:47,988
Wait, Soo-bin.

151
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,325
What did Ji-hoon say he was going to do

152
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,410
to your boyfriend?

153
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,121
That he was going to kill him.

154
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,958
He said he was going to kill him.

155
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,459
I'm on the banks of the Han River.

156
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,336
I'll be there soon.

157
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,462
The riverbank?

158
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,214
I'm going to… Jung-dae.

159
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,801
-What?
-I'm going to kill him!

160
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:17,184
He's so dead.

161
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,812
I'm going to kill him.

162
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:22,523
I'M GOING TO KILL MYSELF

163
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,485
At first,

164
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,114
I tried to tell myself
that no father would kill his own son.

165
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:33,993
And the news said Ji-hoon
got drunk and fell to his death,

166
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,327
so I believed that.

167
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,039
But I changed my mind
when Mr. Nam went ahead

168
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,668
and held that press conference
after I told him I wasn't raped.

169
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,713
He's definitely capable

170
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,132
of killing his own son

171
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,051
over his affair.

172
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,853
I had no money after I left your house,

173
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,855
so I went to blackmail him.

174
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,607
He told me he'd find me a place to stay

175
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,193
if I kept my mouth shut about it

176
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,363
and went along with the rape story.

177
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,243
That's why I stayed quiet
after the press conference.

178
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,455
I'm sorry.

179
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,170
But something is definitely going on

180
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,006
between those two.

181
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,092
And it has been for years.

182
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,213
You didn't pick up your phone.

183
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,508
Were you at the studio?

184
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,760
Yes, it's raining.

185
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,180
You were asleep, so I snuck out.

186
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,681
I didn't know you called.

187
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:24,394
You walked there in the rain?
You should have woken me up.

188
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,356
I woke up, so I started some work.

189
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,235
Right, and your car will be here tomorrow.

190
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,487
Okay.

191
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,197
Let's go back to sleep. It's late.

192
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,913
Wait.

193
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,668
I forgot to finish up some work.

194
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,919
You did?

195
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,339
Yes, I'll do it on Yoon-seo's computer.
You can go to sleep first.

196
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,550
It's late. Do it tomorrow.

197
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:55,509
No.

198
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,761
I have to do it today.

199
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,721
You go ahead.

200
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,765
Are you sure?

201
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,309
Then I'll work some more too.

202
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,187
Let me know when you're done.
I'll go to sleep then.

203
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,314
Okay, I will.

204
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,307
JANG ***-JAE

205
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,185
They're the dashcam and items
in your former vehicle.

206
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,519
I had them delivered.

207
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,943
I took a short nap in Ji-hoon's room
while I waited for you

208
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,571
and I woke up to their voices.

209
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,535
You were

210
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,872
really at home

211
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,958
that afternoon.

212
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,856
I needed surgery after the miscarriage,

213
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,691
and Ms. Hyeon accompanied me.

214
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,069
You didn't know, right?

215
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,948
That's because I told her
I'd expose her affair

216
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,034
if she told you.

217
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,921
Come in.

218
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:45,929
Are you done?

219
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,514
One second.

220
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:50,726
Honey.

221
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,643
Yes?

222
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,692
I forgot to ask you something earlier.

223
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:00,360
What is it?

224
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,698
It's about that day.

225
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,118
The day of Ji-hoon's accident.

226
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:13,915
What kind of

227
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,461
trouble was he in?

228
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,505
What?

229
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,426
You said he had to see you
because he got in trouble.

230
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,096
What did he do?

231
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,433
It wasn't a big deal.

232
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,893
What was it?

233
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,312
Drugs?

234
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,856
Or raping Soo-bin?

235
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,525
No.

236
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,237
It was just an excuse.

237
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:45,989
He wanted money.

238
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:49,701
Money?

239
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,579
Yes.

240
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,250
Did he blackmail you
into giving him money?

241
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,504
Just like Soo-bin did?

242
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,974
Did Ji-hoon blackmail you
just like Soo-bin did

243
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,270
saying he'd expose your affair?

244
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,027
What?

245
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,382
Honey.

246
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,634
Did you meet Kim Soo-bin again?

247
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,345
Did she tell you some nonsense again?

248
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,014
Are you…

249
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,435
Are you and Yeo-jin…

250
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,355
really having an affair?

251
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,439
Me and Yeo-jin?

252
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:03,608
That's ridiculous, Hye-joo.

253
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:04,776
Lower your voice.

254
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:06,736
Yoon-seo is upstairs.

255
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,365
Ji-hoon had told Soo-bin

256
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,118
that he was going to meet you

257
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:17,122
and tell you he knew everything
and you needed to stop.

258
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:21,168
You said you met him that day.

259
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,505
And Ji-hoon

260
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,467
died right after meeting you.

261
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,556
Hye-joo.

262
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,185
Just what are you accusing me of?

263
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,271
Are you sure what I just said…

264
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,733
wasn't the reason

265
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:49,154
-he needed to see you?
-No, it wasn't.

266
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,281
Why do you trust her
more than me, Hye-joo?

267
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,492
Is that so?

268
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:58,163
Was I fooled by Soo-bin again?

269
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,505
Okay then.

270
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,175
I'll check with Yeo-jin.

271
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,605
Good.

272
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,274
I was just coming to see you.

273
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,903
Come in.

274
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,077
Let's talk inside.

275
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,411
Yoon-seo is upstairs.

276
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,933
If I'm talking crazy, just tell me.

277
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,435
Is there…

278
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,023
really something going on between you two?

279
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,157
Answer me.

280
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,867
Yes.

281
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,413
What?

282
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:27,335
-No.
-Yes.

283
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,962
Are you insane?

284
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,882
Hye-joo, it's not true.

285
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,009
It is.

286
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,805
There is something going on.

287
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,765
What's wrong with you?

288
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,770
Hye-joo, let's talk in private.

289
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,896
Get out.

290
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,153
I want both of you
out of this house right now.

291
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,088
Pardon?

292
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,465
What did she find out?

293
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,009
That time.

294
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,555
Kim Soo-bin showed up

295
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,725
and said she was aware
of your affair with Ms. Hyeon

296
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,352
and asked for money?

297
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,270
Yes, it's all crazy nonsense.

298
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,483
But things can get messy
if she runs her mouth.

299
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:16,111
Find her a place to stay.

300
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,073
Yes, sir.

301
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,494
What Kim Soo-bin said is…

302
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,706
true.

303
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,091
I see.

304
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,094
How's Ms. Kim taking it?

305
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,600
Don't worry about Kim Soo-bin.

306
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,353
Whatever she says,

307
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,105
we can just deny it.

308
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:56,901
Please just keep an eye on Ms. Kim.

309
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,071
Okay.

310
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,594
I saw everything.

311
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,388
You…

312
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,600
and Aunt Yeo-jin.

313
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:32,979
You're cheating on Mom.

314
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,187
Ms. Kim.

315
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,022
Hello.

316
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,316
How come you two are coming together?

317
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,861
-We met on the bus.
-I see.

318
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,030
What are you looking at?

319
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:15,827
PASS NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW
TRUTH MUST BE REVEALED!

320
00:33:17,787 --> 00:33:21,249
But that online post
about Assemblyman Nam's wife

321
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,251
goes directly against that law.

322
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,168
I know.

323
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,838
They haven't made
a statement yet, have they?

324
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:27,964
No.

325
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:36,139
Let's hope the tables will turn

326
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,099
after Ms. Kim's TV appearance tonight.

327
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:39,809
Yes.

328
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,394
As long as that goes well,

329
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:45,273
her past will play a big part
in publicizing Namgoong Sol's Law.

330
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,859
Let's go.

331
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,409
Assemblyman Kang.

332
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,328
That bill won't pass, will it?

333
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,999
If it actually passes
with the public's support,

334
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,126
the Daehan Party will get all cocky,

335
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,211
saying the citizens are on their side.

336
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,423
Don't worry about that.

337
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,926
Even the Daehan Party
is divided on that bill.

338
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,554
So why should we worry?

339
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,223
Are they not supporting it?

340
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:23,811
But Nam Joong-do is one of
Woo Jin-seok's closest associates,

341
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:28,149
and she's so vocal about
severe punishment for sex crimes.

342
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,444
I'll be resuming your shave.

343
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,321
Excuse me.

344
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:39,619
I understand.

345
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,455
If the party won't help me,

346
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,750
I'll handle Namgoong Sol's law on my own.

347
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,225
What did the Nation and People's Party…

348
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,977
No, what did
Assemblyman Kang offer in return?

349
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,483
Assemblyman Nam.

350
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,112
Who are you in politics for?

351
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,033
In my case,

352
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,868
I'm in it for the citizens,

353
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,079
not for the Daehan Party.

354
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:26,624
I guess your definition of "citizens"

355
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,962
doesn't include sex crime victims
whose assailants have killed themselves.

356
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,447
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

357
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,825
It's Choi Ki-young.

358
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,078
I just emailed you the evidence.
Please check.

359
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,834
Hello.

360
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,669
Welcome.

361
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,972
I JUST EMAILED YOU THE EVIDENCE.
PLEASE CHECK.

362
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,604
Me?

363
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:31,522
A news interview?

364
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,692
Yes, I already did mine outside.

365
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:35,943
Yes, ma'am.

366
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:39,572
We just need you to share with us
how much you've been suffering

367
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,824
since the loss of your son.

368
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,385
You two were

369
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:05,014
the first family I ever had in my life.

370
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,894
I learned that family
isn't just about blood

371
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,354
thanks to you two.

372
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,486
How could you do this to me?

373
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,991
What went through your mind
every day when you saw me?

374
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,172
I'll give you two hours.

375
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,050
Pack up your things and leave.

376
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,655
Right.

377
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,116
The post on the internet.

378
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:08,953
Yes.

379
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,455
My wife is all right.

380
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:15,543
I heard about Ms. Kim from a customer.

381
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,337
I was just so worried.

382
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:21,882
Yes, everything will be resolved soon.

383
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,052
Thank you for your concern.

384
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,722
Yes, goodbye.

385
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,409
HUSBAND

386
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:04,592
What?

387
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,719
About the news appearance tonight.

388
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:09,847
I'll send you a car later.

389
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,186
It seems like

390
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,314
I really didn't know you at all.

391
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:23,235
Do you really think
I'll still go on the news with you?

392
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,196
We're doing this for your sake.

393
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,740
And this is unrelated.

394
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,242
Please consider it so.

395
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,828
And about what happened…

396
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,539
Let's talk about it tonight.

397
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,832
Let me ask you something.

398
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,420
When you said Soo-bin blackmailed you
saying Ji-hoon raped her,

399
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,005
you were lying, weren't you?

400
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,720
Yes.

401
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:51,639
I'm sorry.

402
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:56,811
How can you do this?

403
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,439
I know I've wronged you and Ji-hoon.

404
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:04,026
But it was for Namgoong Sol's Law.

405
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:06,320
Have you lost your mind?

406
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:10,324
How could you do this to Ji-hoon?

407
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,828
Don't you know what people said about him
after your press conference?

408
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,205
I do.

409
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,125
But it was inevitable
for the greater good.

410
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,669
This wasn't easy for me either.

411
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,045
Ji-hoon is my son.

412
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,507
Are you sure he wasn't
just one of your tools?

413
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,051
Hye-joo.

414
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:35,850
Ji-hoon died…

415
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:42,523
right after he met you
on the banks of the Han River.

416
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,486
Do you really have nothing
to do with his death?

417
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,530
Hye-joo.

418
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,032
That's absolutely not it.

419
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,456
I can't go on the news with you.

420
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,874
No, I won't.

421
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,084
If you're telling me

422
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:05,838
that I have to be on the news with you
after you used my son like that,

423
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,506
you're a real piece of shit.

424
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:25,900
Mr. Jang.

425
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:53,177
You should go on the news
with or without her.

426
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,103
Jang Woo-jae.

427
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,397
Yes, sir.

428
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,150
On the day

429
00:42:08,943 --> 00:42:10,152
of Ji-hoon's accident…

430
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:14,698
Take this.

431
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,633
HYE-JOO
I'M AT THE POLICE STATION

432
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,761
I think Yoon-seo ran away from home.

433
00:42:35,844 --> 00:42:37,137
I'm at the police station.

434
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,141
Assemblyman Nam, how did it go?

435
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,435
I think Yoon-seo ran away.

436
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,396
Sorry?

437
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,148
Can you follow him?
Make sure he doesn't cause trouble.

438
00:42:49,149 --> 00:42:51,569
I need to go see Hye-joo.

439
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,528
Thank you.

440
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:57,825
Sir!

441
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,705
-Have you found her?
-Not yet.

442
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,666
I'll park the car

443
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,710
and look over there.

444
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:08,794
Thank you.

445
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,170
Wait.

446
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:12,006
Did you get Ji-hoon home?

447
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,049
I lost him.

448
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,302
He ran off. I'm sorry.

449
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,053
Don't worry about it.

450
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,180
-Then I'll search that way.
-Yes, sir.

451
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:22,933
You said you lost Ji-hoon.

452
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:31,650
-Yes.
-So tell me.

453
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:36,113
Did you meet him that night?

454
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,117
On the banks of the Han River?

455
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,045
I did.

456
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,467
Jang Woo-jae.

457
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,429
Did you…

458
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,391
kill him?

459
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,810
You know he took his own life.

460
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,936
No, he didn't.

461
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,940
He didn't kill himself.

462
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,193
When I told him I got pregnant

463
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:17,196
on the phone that night,
he got pissed at my boyfriend.

464
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,531
He was ready to kill him.

465
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,325
There's no way he killed himself.

466
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:26,038
He was hammered that night
and there was heavy rain.

467
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,623
It could have been an accident,

468
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,917
but it definitely wasn't suicide.

469
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,587
She didn't seem like she was lying.

470
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,756
So I figured it really was an accident.

471
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:36,840
Ji-hoon died

472
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:43,555
right after meeting you
on the banks of Han River.

473
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:49,269
She said Ji-hoon met me
on the banks of the Han River.

474
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,023
It just doesn't add up.

475
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,984
I met him…

476
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,447
in Gangnam.

477
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:05,494
And that day, on our way to see him,

478
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,578
you said…

479
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,580
Sir.

480
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:13,252
We'll have to hear out Ji-hoon
about what he's done this time,

481
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,714
but it could be a risk
with just eight months until the election.

482
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:23,220
If he's getting involved
with sex crime or drugs…

483
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,893
I'll get it under control at all costs.

484
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:36,024
…that Ji-hoon could not be
involved in sex crime or drugs

485
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,528
and you'd get it
under control at all costs.

486
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,741
And he was found with meth in his pocket.

487
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,536
Tell me, Jang Woo-jae.

488
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,083
Did you kill Ji-hoon

489
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:56,253
after seeing him carrying drugs…

490
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:00,757
in case he ruins my career?

491
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,763
Answer me!

492
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,226
No, sir.

493
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,478
Then explain this.

494
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,815
Tell me why you lied to me
about losing him.

495
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,167
-Where to?
-The banks of the Han River.

496
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,841
The banks of the Han River.

497
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,011
I was wondering why,
then something hit me.

498
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,137
Darn it.

499
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:49,473
The public toilet.

500
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,226
A typical location for a drop.

501
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,353
So I tailed him just in case…

502
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,439
and caught him in the act.

503
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,399
You idiot!

504
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:00,734
I scolded him.

505
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,570
You're messing with drugs.

506
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:07,616
That's on a whole different level
from what you've been up to until now.

507
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:08,700
You got that?

508
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:12,913
Ji-hoon.

509
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,166
If your mother finds out, she'll faint.

510
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:17,960
Do you understand?

511
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,754
Think of your mother for once.

512
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:28,679
I'll take you to your apartment.
Throw the drug away and follow me.

513
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,310
I said, throw it away!

514
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,736
Come on.

515
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:48,782
But then…

516
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,250
Ji-hoon!

517
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:00,586
Nam Ji-hoon!

518
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,798
Man, where did this kid go?

519
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,844
Damn it.

520
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,557
Ji-hoon didn't follow me,
and I couldn't find him.

521
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,685
Give me a break.

522
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,276
So I drove off.

523
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,530
This is something
you should have told me right away.

524
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,742
What are you hiding, Jang Woo-jae?

525
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,331
Did you really kill Ji-hoon?

526
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:43,337
HUSBAND
YEO-JIN

527
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,631
REPORTER JUNG GYEONG-EUN

528
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,968
Call me if you have anything to tell us.

529
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,104
It's me, Seung-hee.

530
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:03,065
Open the door right now.

531
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,693
I know you're in there.

532
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,416
Did you read what I wrote online?

533
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:25,212
Yes.

534
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,468
Then why is there no response
from you or your husband?

535
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,595
Seung-hee.

536
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,889
Did you have to do that?

537
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,685
Why won't you believe anything I say?

538
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,146
Did you forget

539
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,816
why you ran off and lived in hiding?

540
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,694
You killed a person with your lie.

541
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,613
You ran away because you were guilty.

542
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,243
We were friends.

543
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,329
But from the beginning,

544
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,081
you were convinced that I was lying.

545
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,542
Has it never occurred to you

546
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,544
that Seung-ho might have lied?

547
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,049
Because he's family.

548
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:13,844
If I don't trust my family,
who else can I trust?

549
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,806
You probably don't know
because you didn't have one,

550
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,850
but that's what family is.

551
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,731
You lived in hiding all these years,

552
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,567
and now you're going after my husband?

553
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,902
Wasn't Seung-ho enough?

554
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,529
What?

555
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:35,532
You met Ki-young here
a couple of days ago.

556
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,328
Don't you dare try to lie to me again.

557
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,207
I've already checked
the dashcam and the GPS.

558
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:48,628
-Are you two having an affair?
-It's not like that.

559
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,713
Then what is it?

560
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,759
Tell me. What is it?

561
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,552
You just said it yourself.

562
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,637
You trust your family.

563
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,767
You're right, I'm not your family.

564
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,935
But what about Ki-young?

565
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,981
Why can't you trust him? He's your family.

566
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,944
You have no idea.

567
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,363
Kim Jae-eun.

568
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,699
You've probably never feared

569
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:21,578
that your husband might leave you.

570
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:25,874
I'm different.

571
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,377
I've always been scared

572
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,255
that Ki-young might leave me.

573
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:36,134
I've wondered if I'm keeping him

574
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:38,595
in this suffocating family
against his will.

575
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:42,057
I've always been anxious.

576
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,601
I can't keep doing this.

577
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:49,231
-Ki-young.
-Living here is

578
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,899
just too much for me.

579
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:52,609
I'm not happy here.

580
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,655
Seung-ho died because of you…

581
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,618
and I became utterly miserable.

582
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,412
So…

583
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,790
why do you get to be happy?

584
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,715
-Seung-hee.
-Kim Jae-eun.

585
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,346
I want you to be miserable,

586
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:25,433
just like me and my family.

587
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,687
That would be fair.

588
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,473
Ji-hoon was caught

589
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,475
on your dashcam that night

590
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,022
as he walked into the river.

591
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:17,485
Why would he do that?

592
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,529
I don't know.

593
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,780
But from the footage,

594
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,285
it looked like he drowned
while trying to retrieve the meth.

595
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:35,962
This is the dashcam footage
that shows his accident.

596
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,174
It might be painful for you to watch.

597
00:53:40,175 --> 00:53:43,219
Whether you watch it or not
is completely up to you.

598
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:45,430
However,

599
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,767
if you have
even an ounce of doubt about me,

600
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:52,354
please do watch it.

601
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,268
Ji-hoon!

602
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:35,772
Nam Ji-hoon!

603
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:41,486
Man, where did this kid go?

604
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,238
Damn it.

605
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,396
Mom!

606
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,356
I'm so pissed.

607
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:20,608
I got leftover food poured on me.

608
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:24,070
They're bullying me saying
I'm a greedy murderer's daughter!

609
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,655
Darn it.

610
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,634
Let's go on TV.

611
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,053
TV?

612
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,721
Since there was no investigation,

613
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,640
there's no proof that you didn't lie.

614
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,226
In order for the public to believe us,

615
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:57,687
you have to be there yourself.

616
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:59,856
You are an innocent victim

617
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,400
like you told me before.

618
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,111
Right?

619
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,905
Did you forget

620
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:09,699
why you ran off and lived in hiding?

621
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,577
You killed a person with your lie.

622
00:56:13,244 --> 00:56:15,663
You ran away because you were guilty.

623
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,161
Hello.

624
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,331
I am Kim Hye-joo,

625
00:56:58,414 --> 00:57:00,959
the wife of Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party.

626
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:17,767
Twenty years ago,

627
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,311
I was molested

628
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,856
by a boy I went to school with.

629
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,610
I reported him to the police,

630
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,405
but the assailant

631
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:32,991
immediately took his own life,

632
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:34,868
and the case was closed

633
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,413
without further investigation
as there was no one to indict.

634
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:42,417
As a result,

635
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:46,004
I lost my chance to reveal
the truth of the incident.

636
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,132
I ended up having to leave my hometown

637
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:53,887
as I was falsely accused of lying
and driving the boy to his death.

638
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:02,979
Even though he put me
through much emotional pain,

639
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,107
I can swear

640
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,694
that I never wished for him
to take his own life.

641
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:11,321
Never.

642
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,365
Not even for a moment.

643
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:21,581
JI-HOON'S GRADUATION

644
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,283
Sorry?

645
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,163
What did you just say?

646
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:05,041
Five years ago,

647
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,878
I was raped…

648
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,217
by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

649
00:59:49,627 --> 00:59:52,171
TROLLEY

650
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,757
-I'm going to see a lawyer tomorrow.
-Don't take off your ring.

651
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:55,800
You're lying.

652
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:57,552
If you don't call the police, I will.

653
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:59,178
Who will believe you
when you have no proof?

654
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:01,055
This is your last warning.

655
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,349
-Suicide?
-It was a miscalculation on my part.

656
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,977
It was an arbitrary decision
by Assemblyman Nam.

657
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,230
I don't want to hear your excuses and
I have no reason to. Just stop talking.

658
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:12,233
Ms. Kim is speaking in private
with Chairwoman Woo at the moment.

659
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:17,196
