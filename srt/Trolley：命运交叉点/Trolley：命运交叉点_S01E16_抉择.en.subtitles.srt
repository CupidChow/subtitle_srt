1
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,059
Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok.

2
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,437
You told me…

3
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,859
that it was up to me to decide
what would be more beneficial

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,239
and more helpful to this world.

5
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,623
You know what it's like

6
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,335
to be falsely branded as a liar
and to suffer because of it.

7
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,337
And now…

8
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,548
you say you want to reveal the truth,

9
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,219
but you're turning a blind eye
to another truth.

10
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,848
Are you really okay with that?

11
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:42,769
Hye-joo,

12
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,354
I…

13
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:49,692
never received a sincere apology.

14
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:54,114
He said he'd atone for what he'd done
by making the world better

15
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,117
and told me to remain silent.

16
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,120
That's hardly an apology.

17
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:06,251
I'm not…

18
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,920
at fault for this, am I?

19
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,593
It's…

20
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,682
the one at fault
who should receive punishment.

21
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:23,935
I have…

22
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,938
made my choice.

23
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,025
I am

24
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:34,654
terribly afraid right now.

25
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,532
However,

26
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,119
I no longer wish to suffer
from someone else's choices…

27
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,499
I'll be opening the door now.

28
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,256
…or to run away from them.

29
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,554
I am…

30
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:53,399
I AM KIM HYE-JOO,
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO'S WIFE…

31
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,996
I am Kim Hye-joo.

32
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,956
And I'd like to be

33
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,583
honest with myself

34
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,795
and with the world.

35
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,339
My son…

36
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,220
did not sexually assault anyone.

37
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:28,184
I lied despite knowing the truth.

38
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,728
However,

39
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,896
above all,

40
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:35,191
The reason I decided to do this

41
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,319
was no other than my child.

42
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,488
Don't do it, Mom.

43
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,116
I'm begging you. Please don't expose him!

44
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,035
Do you want me to live
as a sex offender's daughter?

45
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,787
No, right?

46
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,707
You can't expose him!

47
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,251
Dad can stay in politics

48
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,586
and do a lot of good for the world.

49
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:59,132
This is nothing more than a little stain.

50
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,093
A stain that's so small
that no one can even see.

51
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:04,804
It's not like he killed anyone.

52
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,347
That was the moment

53
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,975
I made up my mind.

54
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,101
What I'm saying is,

55
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:13,396
everything will be fine as long as you
and Aunt Yeo-jin stay quiet!

56
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,444
I'll be nicer to Aunt Yeo-jin too.

57
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:22,572
So please don't expose him!

58
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,407
Please don't do this!

59
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,201
-You can't do this.
-That for her sake,

60
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,704
-Don't do it, Mom.
-I'd have to commit to my decision.

61
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,372
No!

62
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,874
Let go of me!

63
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:35,001
I'll resent you for life if you do it!

64
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,669
-My decision
-Let go of me!

65
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,422
-may torment her right now.
-Don't do it!

66
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,090
You can't do it, Mom!

67
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,467
But I hope

68
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,719
that she will

69
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,930
learn not to run away
in the face of a decision

70
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,977
and to be honest with herself.

71
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,149
-That is…
-Don't do it, Mom.

72
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,276
why I chose to do this.

73
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,073
And my husband…

74
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,541
sexually assaulted a woman five years ago.

75
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,592
CHOICE

76
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,266
It just ended, sir.

77
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,364
WIFE CLAIMS NAM JOONG-DO
"RAPED A WOMAN 5 YEARS AGO"

78
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,578
I have no excuses.

79
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,790
I realize that I have
disappointed the people.

80
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:59,001
I will have the property sold immediately

81
00:06:59,794 --> 00:07:03,381
and give back any profit to society.

82
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,309
Throw this out.

83
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:16,352
Sir.

84
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:22,358
What? Nam Joong-do raped someone?

85
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,152
When did that get out?

86
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,487
His wife just held a press conference.

87
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,948
Why didn't you know about this?

88
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,577
If I had known, I wouldn't have held
this press conference.

89
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,371
Damn it.

90
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,666
NAM'S WIFE EXPOSES HIS SEX CRIME

91
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,418
Look at that.

92
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,797
When I heard he was
married to Kim Jae-eun,

93
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:46,966
I knew he'd be like that.

94
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,556
How could someone like him
become an assemblyman?

95
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,266
He should resign.

96
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,309
WIFE EXPOSES ASSEMBLYMAN'S SEX CRIME

97
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:05,234
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do's office
has stated that he is out of reach.

98
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,278
How will Assemblyman Nam respond

99
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,239
to the allegations of his sexual assault
that were made today?

100
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,949
All eyes are on him.

101
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,660
Meanwhile, Ms. Kim Hye-joo only read

102
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,913
the victim's statement on her behalf

103
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,790
without sharing any evidence of the crime

104
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:22,585
or revealing the identity of the victim.

105
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,422
Hence, if Assemblyman Nam
denies these allegations,

106
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,965
it'll take a long time to uncover…

107
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,812
Yoon-seo.

108
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:43,439
Should I heat up your lunch?

109
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,858
You haven't eaten anything--

110
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,195
Did my dad

111
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,322
really do that?

112
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,573
Did he really?

113
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,663
Then you should have gone to the police.

114
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,624
Why make my mom
hold that press conference?

115
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,708
Nam Yoon-seo.

116
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,671
Don't talk to Aunt Yeo-jin like that.

117
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:11,217
I've already explained everything to you.

118
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,678
-And Dad--
-Yes, exactly!

119
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,596
Since he owned up to it,

120
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:19,016
you could have talked in private
and patched this up.

121
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,271
Did you really have to advertise it
to the entire nation?

122
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:29,068
Because you and Dad lied
that Ji-hoon was a sex offender,

123
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,112
the kids at my school gave me a hard time.

124
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,450
And now my dad is one!

125
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,455
I can't go to school anymore.

126
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,790
I'm dropping out!

127
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,641
Hey, you can't run away.

128
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:01,851
Don't be so shameless.

129
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,269
Did you go to tell your dad on us?

130
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,271
Your dad's screwed for good.

131
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:06,230
Totally agreed.

132
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,482
I'll report you to be disciplined.

133
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,860
Her mom exposed him
in front of the whole country.

134
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:27,543
Have you eaten anything?

135
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,003
How are you feeling?

136
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,255
I'm fine.

137
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,264
Should we order in something good?

138
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:41,599
I'm sorry, Hye-joo.

139
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,186
I put all the burden on you.

140
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,771
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,196
Don't say that.

142
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,782
There's no reason for you to be sorry.

143
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,661
I know.

144
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,621
You did

145
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,999
your best to be courageous.

146
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:13,130
It took me 20 years to decide
not to run away anymore.

147
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,063
Sir.

148
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,233
Sir.

149
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:46,497
You can't turn yourself in.

150
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,250
We'll just make it so that

151
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,254
Ms. Hyeon is making false accusations.

152
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:55,714
She put her restaurant up for sale.

153
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,801
We'll say she was in financial need
and demanded money from you,

154
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,178
then held a grudge when you declined.

155
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,680
As for Ms. Kim,

156
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,307
we'll say she was mentally unstable

157
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,143
due to Ji-hoon's incident and her past

158
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,019
and blindly believed Ms. Hyeon.

159
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,982
-Jang Woo-jae.
-Your marriage is already over.

160
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,234
So deny it at all costs.

161
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:16,861
There's no evidence,

162
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,239
so even if they take you to court,
it will take a while,

163
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,741
and people will have forgotten by then.

164
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,037
So don't turn yourself in.

165
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,877
Why won't you say anything?

166
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,880
Answer me, sir.

167
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,594
Do you understand me, sir?

168
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,304
You can't turn yourself in.

169
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,890
Okay?

170
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,349
Answer me.

171
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,977
Please just answer me!

172
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,693
You can't turn yourself in.

173
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,114
Not after what I've done for you.

174
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:07,495
DAEHAN PARTY
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO SUPPORTERS

175
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:25,137
Promise me that you'll
never turn yourself in.

176
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,389
Are you just going to give up?

177
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,976
Are you going to throw it all away?

178
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,568
If you admit to the allegations,

179
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,363
all your achievements and plans…

180
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,534
They'll all go down the drain.
Is that what you want?

181
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,459
So just deny the allegations,

182
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,712
get Namgoong Sol's Law passed,

183
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:03,968
continue to do good for our society,

184
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,011
and create a better world.

185
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,227
That's how you can atone
for what you've done.

186
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,448
The person you are
trying to reach is currently…

187
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,909
MS. KIM

188
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,751
-This morning, Ms. Kim Hye-joo…
-Listen.

189
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,754
-Who are we?
-…exposed her husband's sex crime

190
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,674
–and it's been causing a great stir.
-Assemblyman Nam Joong-do…

191
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,926
-His whereabouts are currently unknown…
-Many people are out here…

192
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,929
I know her well
because I've worked for her.

193
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,307
There's no way she was raped.

194
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,934
Why would he do that
when he has a young and pretty wife?

195
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,769
It doesn't make any sense.

196
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,313
And if what she said was true,

197
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,857
how could they have been
living under the same roof?

198
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,694
So why do you think she started this?

199
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:06,488
She had feelings for Assemblyman Nam.

200
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:09,575
Right. A long time ago,

201
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,953
he gave her legal assistance
after her husband killed her daughter.

202
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,165
That's when she got feelings for him.
But when he turned her down,

203
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,792
she lied that he had raped her.

204
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,796
When I found out about her feelings,
she fired me right there and then.

205
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,048
She's lying!

206
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,218
She got fired for stealing money.
That's why she's bad-mouthing her.

207
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,471
-I didn't steal anything!
-I saw you!

208
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,556
Everything she says is a lie--

209
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,475
I'm sorry, but who are you?

210
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,685
Do you know the victim?

211
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,520
Or are you Ms. Kim's acquaintance?

212
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,022
How do you know them?

213
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:47,279
I'm just…

214
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,990
a kid they know.

215
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,325
-How do you know them?
-How do you know them?

216
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,243
What's your relationship with Ms. Kim?

217
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,204
-Tell us!
-Who are you?

218
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,539
-What's the relationship?
-Do you know the victim?

219
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,999
-Tell us!
-Say something!

220
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,877
-Tell us who you are!
-What's your relationship?

221
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,338
Assemblyman Nam's wife, Kim Hye-joo,

222
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,924
had accused a classmate of molesting her

223
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:09,051
-back in high school,
-Serves you right.

224
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,971
-She's being punished
-The suspect killed himself,

225
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,556
-for killing Seung-ho.
-which caused controversy.

226
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,519
Currently, Assemblyman Nam's office
has not made an official statement.

227
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:20,187
-This exposure--
-Hey.

228
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,731
That's enough.

229
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,567
I know how you feel,
but this has nothing to do with Seung-ho.

230
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:27,194
What are you saying?

231
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,406
Her family didn't just screw me
with Seung-ho's incident.

232
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,492
I've been losing sleep
over that land deal.

233
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,578
But Nam Joong-do is going down on his own.
How great is that?

234
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,665
With that land, I can make
at least 30 billion won.

235
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:41,625
What do you know?

236
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,585
Goodness.

237
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,381
I should give Soon-hong a call.

238
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,133
Seung-hee. Ms. Lee.

239
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,135
Hey, Ki-young.

240
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,972
You couldn't have cared less
if I got discharged from the hospital.

241
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,473
Are you here to get your share?

242
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:01,395
You did absolutely nothing
to resolve that land issue,

243
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,105
so don't even dream about it.

244
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,481
Uncle Soon-hong announced

245
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,402
that he'd sell the land
and donate the profits.

246
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,945
What?

247
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:12,031
He's going to do what?

248
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,533
Nam Joong-do got his hands
on some evidence

249
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,869
of you and Uncle's land speculation.

250
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,496
That's why Uncle Soon-hong
turned his back on you.

251
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:21,582
There's no way.

252
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,418
Soon-hong?

253
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,211
The phone is turned off. You will be--

254
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,588
No!

255
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:30,299
Hey, listen.

256
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:32,718
Call Nam Joong-do right now

257
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:35,429
and tell him to bring the evidence. Now!

258
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,014
He's not insane.

259
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,348
Why would he give it back?

260
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,143
Make a deal with him.

261
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:44,480
Tell him I'll forget about Kim Jae-eun

262
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,483
as long as he lets me keep my land.

263
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:49,485
You can't make a deal with that.

264
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,529
You lied about Jae-eun to begin with.

265
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,323
Who cares about that?

266
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,700
Everyone believed me!

267
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:01,288
Go ask what I can do for him.

268
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,792
If he tells me to sign a paper that says

269
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,794
Kim Jae-eun didn't lie, I will.

270
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,003
-So please--
-Mom.

271
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,595
What are you talking about?

272
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,353
Was Jae-eun really molested by Seung-ho?

273
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,897
And you knew that?

274
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,862
Say something!

275
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:38,826
Yes.

276
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,578
I lied.

277
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:46,041
No matter what happens,

278
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,670
my child comes before anyone else.

279
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,256
You ruined a person's life

280
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:54,508
just to cover up your child's fault.

281
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,052
Would you prefer it

282
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:02,141
if I went around telling everyone

283
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,892
what my own son did?

284
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,312
I would rather die.

285
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,772
I could never…

286
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,109
-Mom!
-Ms. Lee.

287
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,407
After I found out

288
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,077
she had lied about Jae-eun,

289
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,581
I hoped the truth would come out

290
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,041
whether it was about the land or Seung-ho.

291
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,585
That's why

292
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,670
I took this risk.

293
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
All this time,

294
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,344
I thought

295
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,389
Jae-eun was the one lying.

296
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,740
It's a friend's vacation home.

297
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,826
You can stay with me and clear your mind.

298
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:20,761
I'll grab a few things we'll need.

299
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:49,873
CHATS

300
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,208
ASSEMBLYMAN KIM TAE-YUN:
WHAT IN THE WORLD IS GOING ON?

301
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,542
ASSEMBLYMAN HWANG SE-JUN:
DID YOU SEE YOUR WIFE'S PRESS CONFERENCE?

302
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,044
HYE-JOO SENT A VOICE MESSAGE

303
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,553
I'LL BE HOLDING A PRESS CONFERENCE SOON

304
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,183
Hey, I just finished the press conference.

305
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,103
I don't think…

306
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:16,858
you should have decided
how you should atone.

307
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,279
Long ago,

308
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:22,072
I had to suffer

309
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,783
because of an irresponsible choice
made by someone else.

310
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,080
And I was denied the opportunity
to clear my name or to have a future.

311
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,250
Same goes for Yeo-jin.

312
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,670
You said

313
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,882
you'd make amends
by making the world a better place.

314
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:45,721
But in your plan to make things right,

315
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,848
you left Yeo-jin out.

316
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:54,187
I don't think anyone should suffer

317
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,231
the consequences of
someone else's decision.

318
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,736
I really hope

319
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,905
that we see eye to eye on this.

320
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,008
-I'll put these back.
-Sure.

321
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,980
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

322
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:48,825
Hello?

323
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,161
Has Assemblyman Nam called you?

324
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,455
No.

325
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:56,208
He drove off with my car,

326
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,251
and his phone is off.

327
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,213
I've never seen him so out of it.

328
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,591
Do you have any idea where he might be?

329
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,968
No, not at all.

330
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,067
The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message--

331
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:32,911
Honey.

332
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,580
Should we visit Sokcho after the election?

333
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:44,256
The election will be over soon.
Just a bit longer.

334
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,883
Let's go on a trip in spring.

335
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,079
Honey!

336
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,708
Joong-do!

337
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,403
The phone is turned off.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

338
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,947
A charge will be incurred.

339
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,121
No.

340
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:44,876
Honey!

341
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,836
No!

342
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,131
Honey!

343
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,468
Joong-do!

344
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,724
No, honey!

345
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,231
Joong-do!

346
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:14,906
Honey!

347
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,668
Joong-do!

348
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,503
Honey! No!

349
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,635
Honey!

350
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,220
Don't do it!

351
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,685
Honey.

352
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:00,493
Why?

353
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,828
Why would you die?

354
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,206
Why would you kill yourself?

355
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,626
If you die like this,

356
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,672
don't you know it'll hurt everyone
including me and Yeo-jin?

357
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:17,177
Do you want to be remembered
as a coward forever?

358
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,814
I was…

359
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:34,235
so ashamed of what I'd done.

360
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,614
I couldn't take it anymore.

361
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,871
Then just live with that shame.

362
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:51,336
Live in shame and be punished!

363
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,922
Don't run away like a coward!

364
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,467
Live and be punished!

365
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,720
Why would you die?

366
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,006
I was too arrogant.

367
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:41,928
I had sincerely repented
and apologized for what I had done,

368
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,640
so I thought I had been forgiven.

369
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,601
That's why I tried my best…

370
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,814
to make the world better
as a means of atonement.

371
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,987
But that was just me being arrogant.

372
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,491
I shouldn't have been the one…

373
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,662
to forgive myself…

374
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,958
or decide how I can be forgiven.

375
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,131
I won't…

376
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,467
make any excuses.

377
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,222
I'm so sorry.

378
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,055
-He's coming.
-He's here.

379
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,389
-He's here.
-That's his car.

380
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,004
I'm sorry.

381
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,924
I sincerely apologize…

382
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:47,178
to the victim.

383
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:49,931
I betrayed

384
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,851
the trust of Sinyang residents

385
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,144
and all the other citizens.

386
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:59,440
I am deeply sorry.

387
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,995
You can't turn yourself in.

388
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,497
Not after what I've done for you.

389
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,172
When did you start using?

390
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,257
Show me your arm.

391
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,592
Let go of me.

392
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,051
I don't do drugs.

393
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,553
What's this then?

394
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:29,762
Weren't you just picking it up?

395
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:31,598
No,

396
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,683
My friend was making a drop
and I stole it.

397
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:34,809
To screw Dad over.

398
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,605
-What?
-I was going to get arrested with this

399
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,857
and end my dad's political career!

400
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,066
Look here.

401
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,611
Just wait and see.

402
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,780
I'll make sure he retires.

403
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,865
I'll end his career.

404
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,033
You little punk!

405
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,995
You're messing with drugs.

406
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:58,124
That's on a whole different level
from what you've been up to until now.

407
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,042
You got that?

408
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,383
Ji-hoon.

409
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,180
If your mother finds out, she'll faint.

410
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,890
Do you understand?

411
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,601
Think of your mother for once.

412
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:25,443
I'll take you to your apartment.
Throw the drug away and follow me.

413
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,158
I said, throw it away!

414
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,126
Come on.

415
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,390
Ji-hoon!

416
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,684
Nam Ji-hoon!

417
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,605
Man, where did this kid go?

418
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:06,943
Damn it.

419
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,950
Give me a break.

420
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:34,429
Damn it.

421
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,431
CONTACTS

422
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:45,481
What the hell?

423
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:49,193
That little…

424
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,488
Ji-hoon!

425
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,575
Just wait and see.

426
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:58,369
I'll make sure he retires.

427
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,580
I'll end his career.

428
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:53,174
DAEHAN PARTY
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO SUPPORTERS

429
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,026
You're cheating on Mom with Aunt Yeo-jin!

430
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,361
I'm going to tell Mom.

431
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,320
That's not true!

432
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,532
Why won't you let your mom live in peace?

433
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,787
Plus, do you really think
she'd believe you?

434
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,791
Think about all the times
you got in trouble!

435
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,129
MEMORY CARD REMOVED
RESTARTING SYSTEM

436
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:41,806
Ji-hoon…

437
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,994
Did you personally apologize
to the victim?

438
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,538
-Do you admit the charges?
-Just a moment, Mr. Nam!

439
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,165
Do you admit it?

440
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:28,561
NAM JI-HOON

441
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,460
PASS NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW
TRUTH MUST BE REVEALED!

442
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:58,174
INVESTIGATIONS MUST CONTINUE
EVEN AFTER THE ASSAILANT DIES

443
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,345
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY
OF THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA

444
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,930
Hello.

445
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:07,475
I am Woo Jin-seok,
Chairwoman of the Daehan Party.

446
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:18,402
As the Chairwoman of the party,
I would like to apologize

447
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,071
to the victim and the public

448
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:24,075
for the sex crime
committed by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

449
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,369
The Daehan Party

450
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,080
has decided to expel him

451
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,416
not only from the party
but also from the National Assembly.

452
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:39,173
I thought I should let you know first.

453
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,970
This is my personal business,

454
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,640
but it won't just affect my family.

455
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,393
Why don't you wait

456
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,397
and see what happens
with Namgoong Sol's Law?

457
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,822
I can't divorce him right now,

458
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,574
I can't expose him right now…

459
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,370
When can I?

460
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,504
Call this number.

461
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:21,632
They'll help you
with the press conference.

462
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,354
Once again, I apologize to the victim

463
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:37,523
and the public.

464
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:07,678
LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT PLAN
YEARS 2023 TO 2025

465
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,829
-Ms. Kim Soo-bin?
-Yes.

466
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:35,164
One second.

467
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,890
Your father-in-law,
Nam Joong-do, screwed up.

468
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,061
But what victim?

469
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:58,938
I'm sure she had fun.

470
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,528
Hey, don't you dare insult her like that.

471
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,199
Why are you angry at me?

472
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,742
Right.

473
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,578
Because you had fun with Ji-hoon too?

474
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,707
But his mom said Ji-hoon didn't rape you.

475
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,501
How much did you get paid?

476
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:22,169
Guess what?

477
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,505
The baby.

478
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,591
It was yours, not Ji-hoon's.

479
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:28,926
What?

480
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,220
I got an abortion
because I want nothing to do with you.

481
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,763
Listen.

482
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,391
I'm going to make you pay.

483
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,601
I'm not scared of you.

484
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,491
MINYEONG POLICE STATION

485
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,969
I had no idea when I let him
use my bank account.

486
00:41:13,637 --> 00:41:15,598
If I have to be punished, so be it.

487
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,228
One more thing.

488
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,107
I also have information
about prostitution.

489
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:26,358
Prostitution?

490
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,359
Yes.

491
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,695
The solicitor was…

492
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,448
the chief advisor

493
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:34,116
for Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong.

494
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,830
How's Ms. Hyeon doing?

495
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,041
She's much better.

496
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,959
Thanks for your concern.

497
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,714
Right.

498
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,133
These are for you.

499
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,471
What's this?

500
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,015
Some pictures

501
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:00,184
of Ji-hoon.

502
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,938
Do you

503
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:07,942
happen to have any photos of Ji-hoon?

504
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,194
Photos of Ji-hoon?

505
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,030
I just don't have many photos of him.

506
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:16,742
I was wondering if you had any.

507
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,161
Is there something important
on that phone?

508
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,499
You could have gotten
a new one with a million won.

509
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,043
RESTORE DELETED ITEMS

510
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,381
THE IMAGES HAVE BEEN RESTORED

511
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,097
Ji-hoon said…

512
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:42,893
he regretted getting into
trouble after finding out

513
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:46,897
about his dad.

514
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,152
At first, he was disgusted
by his dad and Ms. Hyeon…

515
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,406
-…and Mom seemed completely oblivious.
-Honey.

516
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,992
-I was frustrated…
-Have a good day.

517
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,785
-Okay.
-…and I began acting out.

518
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,078
Be safe.

519
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,665
I ended up on the news

520
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,793
and started getting in my dad's way.

521
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,589
I thought I should
actually ruin his career

522
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,674
for good.

523
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,760
But that was stupid of me.

524
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:20,180
You're sentenced to four months in prison.

525
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:25,477
DEFENDANT

526
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,812
For the first time, I regretted it.

527
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,941
I was disgusted at my dad,

528
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:34,528
but it was no reason to ruin my own life.

529
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,367
By the time I came to my senses,

530
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,745
I had strayed too far.

531
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,540
But I don't want to

532
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,627
break my mom's heart anymore.

533
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,966
I even finished the tofu.

534
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:00,638
He also said

535
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,517
that he finished the tofu
that you had gotten him.

536
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,272
He said he'd never go back to prison.

537
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,370
Ms. Kim.

538
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,376
About the drug he had on him…

539
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,170
I doubt it was for himself.

540
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,423
My ex-boyfriend must have

541
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,926
told him to make a drop.

542
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:42,054
He threatened me to do it too.

543
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,847
I'm sure

544
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,558
he had no choice

545
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,603
but to do as he was told.

546
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,153
He also said…

547
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,449
he didn't want to break your heart again.

548
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,493
I remember it clearly.

549
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:08,789
I just wanted…

550
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,000
to tell you that.

551
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,358
Thank you for telling me, Soo-bin.

552
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:57,337
This is a boarding call
for passengers flying to Osaka.

553
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,630
You should get going now.

554
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:00,883
It's not too late.

555
00:46:01,508 --> 00:46:03,135
Why don't you just come with me?

556
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,387
I want us to leave together

557
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:07,264
and make a fresh start.

558
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,435
I'm sorry.

559
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,856
I want to take responsibility
for what I've done

560
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,818
before I leave.

561
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,243
Okay.

562
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,204
I'll wait.

563
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,625
Okay.

564
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,211
I'll be there.

565
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,420
Please wait for me.

566
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,067
Sue me and my mom.

567
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,070
Sue us for the things

568
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,322
we've done to you.

569
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:07,449
I'll take the punishment.

570
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:10,536
Seung-hee!

571
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:13,956
Seung-hee, don't go.

572
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:18,043
With Seung-ho gone,
what am I going to do without you?

573
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:21,463
I'm sorry for everything.

574
00:47:21,547 --> 00:47:23,298
You should apologize

575
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:24,716
to Jae-eun first.

576
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,603
I didn't know any better,

577
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,398
but that's just an excuse.

578
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:44,987
I'm really sorry.

579
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:48,949
So sue me and my mom.

580
00:47:50,742 --> 00:47:52,536
I'll receive the punishment.

581
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,586
I'm sorry for everything.

582
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,757
Hye-joo.

583
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,241
I WILL FIGHT FOR THE POWERLESS
LAWYER NAM JOONG-DO

584
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,976
5 MONTHS LATER

585
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,315
These are the divorce papers.

586
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,777
I'll take care of it through my lawyer.

587
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:51,822
Okay.

588
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,742
Your trial is tomorrow, right?

589
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:57,869
Yes.

590
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:02,582
Whatever they decide, I won't appeal.

591
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:07,546
Okay.

592
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,299
I'll be going then.

593
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,303
Hye-joo.

594
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:22,394
I am really,

595
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,230
really sorry.

596
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:51,214
Moving on.

597
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,884
The so-called Namgoong Sol's Law

598
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,927
that aroused nationwide interest last fall

599
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:59,931
is likely to be discarded
at the end of the term next month.

600
00:51:00,015 --> 00:51:02,559
Daehan Sex Crime Victim Support Center,

601
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,020
an avid supporter of Namgoong Sol's Law,

602
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,564
held a protest in front of
Gwanghwamun this morning,

603
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:10,275
while a professor at a university in Seoul

604
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:12,861
was accused of repeatedly
molesting a grad student

605
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,738
and committed suicide

606
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:16,990
while he was under investigation…

607
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,658
POOREUN EUNHA MEMORIAL PARK

608
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,118
Yes, that's me.

609
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:25,832
You caught Heo Jung-dae?

610
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,795
Yes. Your bank account misuse
will be handled alongside his case.

611
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,546
You'll be charged with a fine.

612
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:33,298
I see.

613
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,509
Please keep me updated.

614
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:36,676
Thank you.

615
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,931
MS. KIM

616
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,141
They caught him!

617
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:59,616
MS. KIM

618
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:01,827
MS. KIM

619
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:20,428
What?

620
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,681
Your mom already knew?

621
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:24,015
About your dad's…

622
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:28,895
Yes.

623
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:32,566
She knew he was having an affair

624
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,735
but turned a blind eye
so I wouldn't get hurt.

625
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:41,783
She'll divorce him soon.

626
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,335
It's okay.

627
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,879
It's not your fault, okay?

628
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,551
I think

629
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:02,387
you did the right thing
by telling your mom.

630
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:05,599
Thanks.

631
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:11,313
Do you

632
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:14,441
still resent your mom

633
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,153
for exposing your dad?

634
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:26,328
Because she was the one
who gave me courage.

635
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,080
She was?

636
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:31,041
Yes.

637
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:34,127
She faced the inconvenient truth

638
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:36,504
and decided not to hide it.

639
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:39,174
It takes great courage.

640
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:41,801
Now that I've done it,
I'm starting to get it.

641
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:51,811
Gross. A rapist?

642
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,271
That is so disgusting.

643
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,773
I'd drop out if I were her.

644
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,066
Does she have no shame?

645
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,817
-Hey.
-Yes.

646
00:53:58,818 --> 00:54:00,195
I'm a rapist's daughter.

647
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:04,324
But I'm also the daughter of my mom,
who bravely exposed him.

648
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,659
Why don't you talk about that?

649
00:54:06,242 --> 00:54:08,495
If you want to talk about my parents,

650
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,205
you should acknowledge my mom too.

Mom.

653
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:46,700
Hey, Yoon-seo.

654
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,244
Mom.

655
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,954
What's wrong?

656
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,958
Mom, I'm sorry.

657
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:58,712
I've been…

658
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:02,090
too mean to you.

659
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:08,096
It's okay, Yoon-seo.

660
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,264
It's okay, don't cry.

661
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:10,682
I'm fine.

662
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,767
Yoon-seo, don't cry.

663
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:18,356
I love you so much, Yoon-seo.

664
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:19,899
Don't cry.

665
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,236
Don't cry.

666
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:31,494
YOU INSPIRED ME TO BE BRAVE
THANK YOU

667
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:42,714
I still can't sleep without the pills.

668
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:47,302
But it's much better than before.

669
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,223
I could…

670
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,979
get better from now on, right?
