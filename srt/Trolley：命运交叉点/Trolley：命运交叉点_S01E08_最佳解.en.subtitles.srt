1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,150
Seung-hee.

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,527
Your twin brother is
an SNU law student now.

3
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,528
What will you do?

4
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,447
Please.

5
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:15,075
It's enough to have my mom
compare me to Seung-ho.

6
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,829
I'm just wondering,

7
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,040
but where's Ki-young applying?

8
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:23,541
Ki-young?

9
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:26,753
He's only applying
to schools in Seoul, right?

10
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,129
Yes.

11
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,424
So he's going to Seoul after all.

12
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,220
Why do you suddenly look so down?

13
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,222
Are you interested in him?

14
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,890
No.

15
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:39,849
No way.

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,602
No one in our class likes him.

17
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,395
Right, Jae-eun?

18
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,482
Yes, right.

19
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:48,858
That's odd.

20
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,443
You sit next to him, don't you?

21
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,321
-Yes.
-Isn't he so gentle and kind?

22
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,158
-I'm not so…
-They never even talk.

23
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,202
Anyway,

24
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:02,705
you're also applying to the Cheongju
Campus of Gyeongji University, right?

25
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,582
Jae-eun.

26
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:06,376
I'll be done soon, so wait for me.

27
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,965
Ki-young.

28
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:19,848
Jae-eun.

29
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,442
I like you.

30
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,697
I like you, Kim Jae-eun.

31
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,578
You knew that, right?

32
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,130
I've never thought of you

34
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,675
as anything more than a classmate.

35
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:00,513
Sorry.

36
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,104
Jae-eun.

37
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,902
I mean, Hye-joo.

38
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,905
Hi.

39
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,913
THE RIGHT THING TO DO

40
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,214
Do you live around here?

41
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,884
No.

42
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,304
I asked to meet
in a different neighborhood.

43
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,264
I'm sure you know why.

44
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,058
Right.

45
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,851
Good call.

46
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,189
I know it's late,
but congratulations on your marriage.

47
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,233
You two make a great couple.

48
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,568
Thanks.

49
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,407
I took a peek at Seung-hee's
phone for your number.

50
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:04,535
Please don't tell her that we met.

51
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,205
All right. I won't.

52
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:14,671
Hye-joo.

53
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,466
About Seung-ho…

54
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,887
Could you apologize to them?

55
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,107
I thought you were Hye-joo.

56
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,193
What has gotten into you?
You're vacuuming?

57
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,696
While you're at it, do the rooms too.

58
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,951
-I don't want to.
-You don't…

59
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:46,452
Hey.

60
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,455
After all she's done for you,
you can't do this much?

61
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,375
She's got it rough these days.

62
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,711
-Then you shouldn't stab her in the back.
-What?

63
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,051
You can do the master bedroom.

64
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,553
I already got Yoon-seo's room.

65
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,390
I can't believe that girl.

66
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,689
She said not to go in without permission.

67
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:35,918
AUTOMATIC TRANSFER

68
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,920
100,000 WON TO SINYANG-GU
WOMEN AND YOUTH SHELTER

69
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:40,340
60,000 WON TO COUNSELING CENTER
FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIMS

70
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:41,924
80,000 WON TO SUNFLOWER CHILDREN'S SHELTER

71
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,974
200,000 WON TO SUICIDE LOSS SURVIVORS
SUPPORT CENTER

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,775
I never imagined that
such things happened in Youngsan.

73
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,905
Just thinking about what
she's been through breaks my heart.

74
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:11,496
Anyway, I don't think they'll
keep their mouths shut forever.

75
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,625
So we need to make the first move
before anything else happens.

76
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,251
But I'm worried

77
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,088
about Ji Seung-kyu's case.

78
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:24,967
If they conflate the two cases,
things will get quite messy.

79
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,438
You know what's great about the internet?

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,526
You throw them a bone,

81
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,737
and they all jump on it at once.

82
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,468
About Seung-ho…

83
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,846
Could you apologize to them?

84
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,433
I don't know

85
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:00,271
who is telling the truth
between you and Seung-hee.

86
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,568
I heard the police didn't investigate it
because of Seung-ho's death.

87
00:08:06,652 --> 00:08:07,695
That's why

88
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,282
I wanted to ask you in person.

89
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,744
I want to know

90
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,954
what really happened.

91
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,335
But I can already tell

92
00:08:24,128 --> 00:08:24,962
by your face.

93
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,215
You…

94
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,092
didn't lie.

95
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,433
But Hye-joo.

96
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,144
Could you just apologize to them?

97
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,982
-But Ki-young--
-You may not have done anything wrong,

98
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,568
but you understand the pain
of losing a family member.

99
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,529
Don't you?

100
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:54,742
My mother-in-law is mentally unstable,

101
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,203
so Seung-hee always feels restless.

102
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,793
I think the only thing
that could alleviate their situation

103
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,837
is your apology.

104
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,091
That's why…

105
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,969
I'm asking you for a favor.

106
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:16,889
Could you

107
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,724
apologize to them?

108
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,861
Hold on tight.

109
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:34,657
You can sit here.

110
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,075
Thank you.

111
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,042
Thank you so much.

112
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,752
You're not going far, are you?

113
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,838
No, I'm getting off
at Jicheong Elementary.

114
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:49,755
I see.

115
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,468
Mom, it's like a shower outside.

116
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:57,096
-My gosh, you're right.
-This stop is…

117
00:09:57,179 --> 00:10:00,933
-It's really pouring down.
-…Korean District Heating Corporation.

118
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,145
The next stop is…

119
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,519
Goodness, Soo-bin.

120
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,731
Ms. Kim.

121
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:49,690
Hold this.

122
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:52,109
My goodness.

123
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,361
It's okay.

124
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,571
It's pouring down.

125
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,407
Why are you outside this late?

126
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,242
Let's get you inside.

127
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,203
It was raining.

128
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,746
What was that?

129
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:07,416
It was pouring.

130
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:28,312
But if it suddenly
starts pouring at night,

131
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,524
I come by to check at times.

132
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:35,403
Because I'd rather check in person.

133
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:41,033
You said you came to check your studio
when it starts pouring at night.

134
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,120
It was pouring down but you weren't home,

135
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,539
so I thought you'd be at the studio.

136
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,875
I came to make sure just in case,
but the lights were off.

137
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,587
So I went inside
and checked the dehumidifier.

138
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,007
-You--
-I know you said

139
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:00,010
not to go into
your space without permission,

140
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:01,971
but I kept giving you attitude

141
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,432
and hurt your feelings.

142
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,726
It felt too awkward to call and ask.

143
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,980
So I just went in without telling you.

144
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,482
I'm sorry.

145
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,526
It won't happen again.

146
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:25,786
Don't do this.

147
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,873
Don't ever do this again.

148
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,295
Promise me that you won't.

149
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,423
Okay.

150
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,300
I won't do it again.

151
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,135
Not without asking you--

152
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,220
I don't want anyone to get hurt

153
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,307
because of me.

154
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,437
Stay safe, Soo-bin.

155
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,354
Both you…

156
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,482
and your baby, okay?

157
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:01,238
The fetus's heart has stopped.

158
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,492
It's a miscarriage.

159
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:11,749
So don't ever get rained on because of me.

160
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,958
Okay?

161
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,017
An amendment to
the Criminal Act that allows

162
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,145
the investigation to continue
even after the sex crime suspect dies

163
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,731
and becomes unable to be prosecuted?

164
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:23,028
You realize there are
some juridical issues there, right?

165
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,113
Yes.

166
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,409
Continuing an investigation
without anyone there to punish

167
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,745
contradicts the foundation
of the criminal justice system.

168
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,457
But the juridical aspect of the matter

169
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,377
will only be understood by people
like us who have studied law.

170
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,421
Public sentiment is a different story.

171
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,927
Public sentiment has
nothing to do with legislation.

172
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,221
But I'm sure you're aware of that.

173
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,392
During my time as a judge,

174
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,979
I saw many sexual violence victims
experience secondary victimization

175
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,064
after the assailants

176
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,858
took their own lives.

177
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:04,278
However, the law is the law.

178
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,405
And it won't just be difficult

179
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,033
for this amendment to pass.

180
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,701
It will be impossible.

181
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,998
Even if you manage to win over the public,

182
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,543
all there's left will be controversy.

183
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,587
I welcome controversy.

184
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,882
That controversy will
arouse people's interest

185
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:27,593
and make what's impossible, possible.

186
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,348
When you suggested that I run
as a list member eight years ago,

187
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,350
you said that I couldn't
work alone in politics

188
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,518
and that I'll need
the public and the party's support.

189
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,064
I'll form the public opinion.

190
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:43,317
I'm asking you to lead the party
as the chairwoman

191
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,027
in supporting this amendment.

192
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,599
Things must have been hectic for you

193
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,393
with Ji-hoon's incident.

194
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,188
It took a bigger toll on Hye-joo.

195
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,731
But thankfully,

196
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,609
she seems to be doing better.

197
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,452
You know, you haven't changed a bit

198
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,413
since the first time we met.

199
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,590
I'll do my best

200
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:50,884
alongside Attorney Nam Joong-do.

201
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,103
MAN ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
AFTER KILLING HIS FAMILY

202
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,229
PUNISH FILICIDE SEVERELY

203
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,523
I'll never forget how hard you tried

204
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,110
to get my story out
after I filed the constitutional appeal.

205
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,779
Thank you so much for that.

206
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:12,406
Don't mention it.

207
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:14,992
Plus, your appeal was
dismissed in the end.

208
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,912
We couldn't change anything. I'm sorry.

209
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,873
Don't say that.

210
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,251
I knew it was an uphill battle.

211
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,133
But as I fought through it,

212
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:33,510
I realized that I had
a lot of people on my side

213
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,012
and it helped me go on.

214
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:44,104
Do you regret quitting
your job as a reporter

215
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,439
to be in the National Assembly?

216
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,610
I do.

217
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,863
That was a permanent position,

218
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,865
but my current position is temporary.

219
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,869
Assemblyman Nam can fire me
at a moment's notice.

220
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,958
If you get fired,
I'll give you a job here.

221
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,752
Okay, well…

222
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,338
I'll give it some thought.

223
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,635
I became a reporter…

224
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,805
wanting to change this world.

225
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:21,850
Then I met Assemblyman Nam
during my rookie days.

226
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,811
And then…

227
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,523
I got to know him better
through Chae-eun's case.

228
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:32,820
I began to think that
I could bet my life on him.

229
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:38,200
So when he asked me
to join him in the Assembly

230
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,910
seven and a half years ago,

231
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:42,538
I quit without hesitation.

232
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,378
So I hope the general election goes well

233
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:52,714
and we'll go further.

234
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,226
You know…

235
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,480
-Mr. Jang.
-Betting my life on him

236
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,275
was the best option I had,

237
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,572
and I will make it
the best decision of my life.

238
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,456
Anyway,

239
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,501
you had something to tell me today.

240
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:33,172
What was it?

241
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,258
Please tell me.

242
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,557
Is it about Assemblyman Nam?

243
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,145
No.

244
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,441
It wasn't anything important.

245
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,405
Okay.

246
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,290
Come in.

247
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,799
Come in and put on the slippers.

248
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,386
This is our only bathtub.

249
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,015
My husband will be home late,
so don't worry about him.

250
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:26,391
Warm yourself up.

251
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,852
Make yourself at home and take your time.

252
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:55,963
Yoon-seo.

253
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,844
You haven't gone to sleep.

254
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,596
No, but I'm going to bed soon.

255
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,514
What's up?

256
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,771
What are you doing, Mom?

257
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:16,316
When did my little girl grow up so much?

258
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,241
-Were you doing homework?
-Yes.

259
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:25,659
Mom.

260
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:27,411
Have you heard of the Trolley Dilemma?

261
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:30,414
-The Trolley Dilemma?
-Yes.

262
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,499
Here's the thing.

263
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,793
This is the trolley.

264
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,463
And the brakes are broken,

265
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:39,923
so if it keeps going,

266
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,758
-it'll kill five people.
-Okay.

267
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,095
But if you switch the track,

268
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,055
it'll change its direction
and only kill one.

269
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,057
What would you do?

270
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,351
Well, I'm not sure.

271
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,979
This is a tough question.

272
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,231
No, it's not that hard.

273
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,357
-What?
-Look.

274
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
It's five to one.

275
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,236
You should obviously switch the track.

276
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,530
But Da-som asked me

277
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,158
what I'd do if that one person was

278
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,285
someone I loved.

279
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:13,040
If that was you or Dad…

280
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:18,295
Then what would you do?

281
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:24,259
I don't know. I'd just run away.

282
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,596
If I don't make a decision,
I'm sure someone else will.

283
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,563
Why did you put
Dad's business card up there?

284
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,482
Just because.

285
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,109
Is it because you love him?

286
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,069
Yes.

287
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,446
-Mom.
-Yes?

288
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,907
You should sleep here tonight.

289
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:47,824
Should I?

290
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,160
Should we snuggle up like we used to?

291
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,578
Yes, I'd love that.

292
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,629
YOON-SEO'S HUNDREDTH DAY

293
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,216
No cheating, okay?

294
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,343
Stop it. Stay away.

295
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,678
Dad!

296
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,475
Stop that.

297
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,728
-Come on, that's cheating.
-Give me that.

298
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:18,563
Right here.

299
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:22,692
All right.

300
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,569
I got it.

301
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,321
Try and steal it.

302
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:27,614
-It's your turn.
-Hold on.

303
00:23:27,697 --> 00:23:28,698
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

304
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,951
No cheating, okay?

305
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,176
-Soo-bin.
-Yes?

306
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,138
You're up.

307
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,597
Are you feeling okay?

308
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,015
Yes.

309
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,268
Good morning.

310
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,146
Good morning to you too.

311
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,314
The thing is,

312
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,401
I'm going to run an errand
before heading to work.

313
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,988
Do you like to come to the studio later?

314
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,031
Let's get something delicious for lunch.

315
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,491
I'm actually…

316
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:15,412
meeting a friend for lunch.

317
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,082
I see.

318
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,500
It's not a guy.

319
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,377
What?

320
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:25,797
I'm not meeting a guy.

321
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,217
Okay.

322
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,389
Be careful and have fun. I'll get going.

323
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,433
Actually, I'll come.

324
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,562
I'll stop by before lunch.

325
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,857
I have nothing better to do anyway.

326
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,445
What time should I be there?

327
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,573
Let's sit you down.

328
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:56,453
Goodness.

329
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,331
Ms. Kim.

330
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,667
You came so early
in the morning for my discharge,

331
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,128
you paid my hospital bills…

332
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,090
How could I ever repay your kindness?

333
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,177
Please don't mention it.

334
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,430
Get some rest so you'll feel better soon.

335
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:18,725
I will.

336
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:29,653
Hey, Soo-bin.

337
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,154
Sorry, I'm running a bit late.

338
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:33,365
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

339
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,992
You're there already?

340
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,954
Then you can let yourself in. Okay.

341
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,295
KIM SOO-BIN

342
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,631
FAVORITES

343
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:28,795
I LOVE YOU, MOM AND DAD.
SINCERELY, NAM JI-HOON

344
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,267
Darn it.

345
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:43,893
Hello?

346
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,937
Hey, Yoo-sin.

347
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,273
Why are you calling
so early in the morning?

348
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,192
I see.

349
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,778
Yoo-sin.

350
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:57,866
I'm not very thrilled

351
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,493
about having Nam Joong-do
on my back either,

352
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,871
but it's only a matter of time

353
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,623
before everyone forgets about it.

354
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,792
I have to be somewhere,

355
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,961
so I'm hanging up. Bye.

356
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,132
Damn it, man.

357
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:17,135
Does she think I'm some old man
with nothing to do?

358
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:22,098
And why haven't you gotten back to me?

359
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,351
What are your old buddies doing?

360
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,144
I'm sorry, sir.

361
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,943
That dead son of his.

362
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,320
Sorry?

363
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:36,821
Look into him.

364
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:41,242
If he bought meth,
I'm sure he's done a lot more.

365
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,208
So annoying.

366
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,127
Mom, can you just sell off that land?

367
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:52,712
What am I, crazy?

368
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,672
Hey, you.

369
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,051
Did you talk to
that Assemblyman Nam or not?

370
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,929
You didn't, did you?

371
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,516
Why can't you even do what you're told?

372
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:05,809
-What's wrong with you?
-Mom!

373
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,435
Don't be so hard on him.

374
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:08,770
He'll be late to work. Let's go.

375
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:12,482
You're doing this on purpose, right?

376
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,614
-Seung-hee.
-I'm sorry.

377
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:22,784
She's in a bad mood
after talking to Uncle Soon-hong.

378
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,702
I apologize on her behalf. I'm sorry.

379
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,912
Seung-hee,

380
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,957
your mother is obsessed
with her land right now.

381
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,918
Let's not mess with Jae-eun
for the time being.

382
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,045
This involves her husband.

383
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,133
Seung-ho means the world to Mom.

384
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,802
If Seung-ho's case is
exposed the wrong way,

385
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,512
his reputation will be ruined.

386
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:44,973
That's why she couldn't
sue her for false accusation.

387
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,475
-But--
-Look.

388
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,187
This will stress her out even more,
on top of her land issue.

389
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,106
So for the time being,

390
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:56,776
at least until Uncle Soon-hong
takes care of the land issue,

391
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:00,697
let's not harass Jae-eun
about Seung-ho, okay?

392
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,369
You know what kind of man her husband is.

393
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,127
Okay.

394
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,296
Good.

395
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,922
I'll be going now.

396
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,795
Why do you put
so much effort into the photos?

397
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,963
Isn't it just for the record?

398
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,591
That's one reason,

399
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:05,136
but I believe that
the damaged state of the books

400
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,474
shows how much their owners
love and value them.

401
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,601
If that wasn't the case,

402
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,854
the owners would have thrown them out

403
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,564
instead of having them restored.

404
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,693
So I keep records of such emotions

405
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:22,862
by taking these photos,

406
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,449
and I give them to the owners
along with the books.

407
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,868
That's why I try to take good photos.

408
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,039
I see.

409
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,849
Can you take one of me?

410
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,518
What?

411
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,895
Can you take a photo of me?

412
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,444
Okay.

413
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,946
I'll take one of you. Stand there.

414
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,868
Good. Right there.

415
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:13,830
Okay. Here we go.

416
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,083
-One, two--
-Wait.

417
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,420
Should I be smiling?

418
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,590
Do as you like.

419
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:25,675
Okay.

420
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,636
Here we go again. Look here.

421
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,014
All right.

422
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,726
One, two, three.

423

JI-HOON

425
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,262
-Hey, Soo-bin.
-Yes?

426
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:17,268
Do you happen to have
any photos of Ji-hoon?

427
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,521
-Photos of Ji-hoon?
-Yes.

428
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,317
Right, you lost them with your phone.

429
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,362
No, I don't have any.

430
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,993
Why do you ask?

431
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,788
I just don't have many photos of him.

432
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,500
I was wondering if you had any.

433
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,461
By the way,

434
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,673
does the friend that you're meeting
know Ji-hoon as well?

435
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,675
No.

436
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,135
No?

437
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:54,639
If you meet any of his other friends,

438
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,057
could you ask them

439
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,309
if they have any photos of him?

440
00:32:59,143 --> 00:33:01,354
Yes, I'll do that.

441
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:03,773
Thank you.

442
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,453
Ms. Kim.

443
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:19,539
Yes?

444
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,708
Why haven't you asked?

445
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,960
About what?

446
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,338
Whether I'm going to

447
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,382
have the baby or not.

448
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:39,976
Is it okay if I ask?

449
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,854
What do you want me to do?

450
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,363
I'm Ji-hoon's mom,

451
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,285
so I'd be lying if I said
I didn't want to see the baby.

452
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:02,498
But then again,

453
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,419
I believe everyone has
their story and situation

454
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:11,799
and they end up
making the best choice they can.

455
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:16,971
Whatever you decide to do with it,

456
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,933
I hope you make
the best decision for yourself.

457
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,728
I mean it.

458
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,492
I have to leave for lunch.

459
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,243
Bye.

460
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,703
Okay then.

461
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,247

JI-HOON

466
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,592
You understand the pain
of losing a family member.

467
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:38,678
Don't you?

468
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,306
That's why I'm asking you for a favor.

469
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:44,517
Could you…

470
00:35:45,268 --> 00:35:46,727
just apologize to them?

471
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,612
-Don't touch me.
-Whatever, you're so annoying.

472
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,493
-You know…
-Yes?

473
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,078
If…

474
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,497
And this is a big "if."

475
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,835
Actually, never mind.

476
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,130
What is it?

477
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,215
Finish your sentence.

478
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,178
If…

479
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:22,680
your dad were having an affair

480
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,308
and you found out,

481
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,895
would you tell your mom about it?

482
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,188
My mom?

483
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,273
Why would I stop there?

484
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,399
What?

485
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,402
He didn't just betray her
by having an affair.

486
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,905
He betrayed the trust
of his entire family.

487
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,823
So obviously I'd tell mom,

488
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,701
and I'd tell the whole world
and put him to shame.

489
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:52,084
But would you be okay
with everyone knowing

490
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:53,920
that your dad cheated?

491
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,131
Why should I care?
I didn't do anything wrong.

492
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:02,386
Anyway, I'd do everything I can
to humiliate him publicly.

493
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,597
Who cares if he's my dad?

494
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:07,892
So gross.

495
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,685
Cheaters are so disgusting.

496
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,523
What's with that face?

497
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,568
Was this about you?

498
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,781
Yes, my dad is having an affair.

499
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,408
Guys, time for class.

500
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,219
-Hello, I'm Nam Joong-do.
-Hello.

501
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,474
I'm Park Yeong-su.

502
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,601
Yes, nice to meet you.

503
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,020
-Let's talk as we go inside.
-Sure.

504
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,746
The fetus died,
but it's still in your womb,

505
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,415
so you need surgery.

506
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:17,211
If you experience fever or abdominal pain
after taking the drug,

507
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,588
come back here right away.

508
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,536
I'm taking off.

509
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:51,746
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

510
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,497
Enjoy your meal.

511
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,207
-Thanks.
-…he took his own life,

512
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,209
which was all over the media.

513
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:00,546
You're right. Ms. Cho didn't know
about the video leak until later.

514
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,631
-It's him.
-…left a note on her desk,

515
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,550
then attempted suicide.

516
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,511
Nam Joong-do is one good-looking man.

517
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,514
He really put the video up.

518
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,141
What a total scumbag.

519
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:16,562
But to be frank,
I'm sure the girl was no better than him.

520
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:18,773
I wasn't going to say this,

521
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,525
but women who date men
like that can't be--

522
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,819
-What are you talking about?
-Sorry?

523
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,030
The girl was a victim.

524
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,074
You shouldn't talk about her like that.

525
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,368
All right.

526
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,328
I shouldn't have said that.

527
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,038
You should go home.

528
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,166
He already committed suicide
and is dead, correct?

529
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,045
So how is this video
still being redistributed?

Ms. Kim Soo-bin.

532
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:51,305
Mom.

533
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:54,308
Mom.

534
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:57,812
Mom.

535
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,146
Mom…

536
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,363
Mom, are you okay?

537
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,740
-Mom!
-Goodness.

538
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:13,119
You scared me. What's wrong?

539
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,789
What is it?

540
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,332
Wait.

541
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,000
What's all this?

542
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:23,712
This medication is only for nighttime.

543
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,423
Did you take these today?

544
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,383
The doctor said it's only for nights.

545
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,677
I didn't take any today.

546
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,222
"Today"?

547
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,932
So you've been
taking these during the day?

548
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,351
-Mom.
-Stop yelling!

549
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,727
Goodness.

550
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:42,106
If you're so worried,
do something about it.

551
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,609
You abandoned your sick mom
and went abroad,

552
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,403
and now you're pretending to be worried?

553
00:40:47,486 --> 00:40:49,572
-Mom.
-I don't want to hear it. Get out.

554
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:06,630
KO SEONG-CHANG (YOUNGSAN SCHOOLMATE)

555
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,384
Sorry. My sister-in-law says
she can't disclose personal information.

556
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,588
I'm sorry, but please excuse me.

557
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:48,923
I'm not very hungry.

558
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,341
Okay.

559
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,512
Hye-joo, are you okay? Are you hurt?

560
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:55,429
Give me the rag.

561
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,597
Stand still. You'll get hurt.

562
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,557
-It's okay, I got it.
-Give it to me.

563
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,063
What's wrong?

564
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,065
Is something going on?

565
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,404
Yeo-jin.

566
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,493
Back when I lived in Youngsan,

567
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,747
my friend's brother died.

568
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,920
I was molested by him,
so I went to the police.

569
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,048
And that night,

570
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,719
he killed himself.

571
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:50,776
Yeo-jin.

572
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:56,115
I never imagined
that he would end up like that.

573
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:58,117
It's okay.

574
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,536
You don't have to say anything.

575
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:03,163
You don't have to say anything, Hye-joo.

576
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,791
Goodness.

577
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,919
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

578
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:12,756
How could you keep this bottled up

579
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,759
without telling anyone for so long?

580
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,223
It must have been so tough.

581
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,861
In the end, nothing was resolved.

582
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,323
Joong-do said

583
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,867
that he'd take care of everything

584
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,827
and that I shouldn't do anything.

585
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,787
But…

586
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:51,712
I think it might be best for everyone
if I apologized to his mother.

587
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,922
No, Hye-joo.

588
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,966
Your husband is a public figure.

589
00:43:56,675 --> 00:44:00,304
If you apologize,
they'll use that to blackmail you again.

590
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,139
Still…

591
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,100
His mother and my friend

592
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,853
lost a son and a brother.

593
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,485
After losing Ji-hoon,
I can understand their pain,

594
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:17,780
and it just torments me even more.

595
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:22,618
I see.

596
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:27,748
I know how it feels to lose your child.

597
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,500
I understand.

598
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:32,836
But Hye-joo.

599
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,214
You shouldn't apologize.

600
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,926
You don't apologize
for something like this.

601
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:41,553
You show remorse
for what happened. That's all.

602
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,974
It was an accident.

603
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,185
It wasn't your fault.

604
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,363
It's always hard for those
who are left behind.

605
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:04,243
I heard the mill lady tried
to follow her granddaughter.

606
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,288
She was in shock about
her granddaughter's video getting leaked.

607
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,085
Who told you that?

608
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,671
What?

609
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,381
About the mill lady.

610
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,592
Joong-do mentioned it on TV
this afternoon.

611
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:24,138
On TV?

612
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:25,514
GRANDMOTHER ATTEMPTS SUICIDE

DID THEY NOT KNOW THEIR SON
WAS A PIECE OF SHIT?

622
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:11,101
I HOPE THEY ALL DIE

623
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,895
I'M SUSPICIOUS OF THE GRANDDAUGHTER TOO

624
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,193
Hey.

625
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,029
Why are you still up? It's late.

626
00:46:24,781 --> 00:46:26,575
Why won't you say anything?
You're scaring me.

627
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:27,951
Did I do something wrong?

628
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,121
-Honey.
-Yes?

629
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:37,085
About your appearance
on TV this afternoon…

630
00:46:37,669 --> 00:46:39,004
So you saw that?

631
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,464
Yes.

632
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,050
Did you have to mention

633
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,512
the mill lady on TV?

634
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,347
What do you mean?

635
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:50,432
Look at this.

636
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,727
Everyone is cursing out
the med student's parents.

637
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,441
So what about it?

638
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,822
When the suicide attempt
of his mother made the news,

639
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,741
the family got really harsh comments.

640
00:47:07,824 --> 00:47:10,786
And now that you mentioned
the mill lady on TV today,

641
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,120
it's happening again.

642
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:16,500
That med student
did commit a serious crime,

643
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:20,337
but his mother tried to kill herself
after seeing comments against her son.

644
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,673
With another flood
of all these hateful comments…

645
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,842
I'm really worried, honey.

646
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,805
I did it for the mill lady
and her granddaughter.

647
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,225
Some people are criticizing her
and her granddaughter too.

648
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,812
They're saying she was after money
and that this is a show for settlement.

649
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,021
If she finds out…

650
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,273
Don't worry about that.

651
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,108
She already knows.

652
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,110
How does she know?

653
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,113
I went to the hospital
to get permission to share her story,

654
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:48,782
and I told her what to expect.

655
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,330
You can make use of me
as much as you like.

656
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:57,457
I don't care what people say about me

657
00:47:58,041 --> 00:48:01,003
as long as the world knows
about Sol's misfortune.

658
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:15,350
But I keep worrying about
the med student's parents

659
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,519
whenever I hear her granddaughter come up.

660
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,438
Why do you empathize with the assailant?

661
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,065
I'm not empathizing!

662
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:24,276
What would you call this then?

663
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,611
No, I'm just…

664
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:35,621
Fine, I am empathizing.

665
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:37,998
But not with the assailant.
With his mother.

666
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,585
That med student is obviously a criminal,

667
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,712
but what about his family?

668
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,341
They're still here living in pain.

669
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,552
If something else bad happens,
how will the rest of them live?

670
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,179
-Hye-joo.
-Honey.

671
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:57,517
I'm so scared that another
tragedy might take place.

672
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:04,399
So I wish you'd stop using the media

673
00:49:04,983 --> 00:49:07,944
to make a bigger issue out of this.

674
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,905
Honey.

675
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,990
Stop it.

676
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,326
Please stop this.

677
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:16,870
I'm begging you.

678
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:19,623
I'm sorry.

679
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:22,000
But this will only get bigger.

680
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,127
Until the entire country knows.

681
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:25,962
Honey.

682
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:28,632
I'm going to propose an amendment

683
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:33,428
that allows investigations to continue
even after a sex criminal dies.

684
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,723
I'll need more of those
hate comments in the future.

685
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:40,435
That's the public sentiment
that will help this amendment pass.

686
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:46,233
I'm trying to prevent more pain
caused by the suicide of assailants.

687
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:49,277
Don't you want that too?

688
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,534
If the law had been different,

689
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:59,162
you and that family wouldn't have
had to live in pain for 20 years.

690
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,754
So please support me in my plan.

691
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,675
Your support is
the most important thing to me.

692
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:15,971
I need the support of my beloved wife.

693
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,736
You should go to sleep.

694
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,071
We'll talk again later.

695
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:42,372
Collateral damage is inevitable

696
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,000
for the greater good.

697
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:39,805
Ms. Kim.

698
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:41,515
Hey, you're up.

699
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,017
Are you feeling okay?

700
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,477
Yes.

701
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,438
Go have breakfast.
You skipped dinner last night.

702
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:52,651
You don't have to
prepare meals for me anymore.

703
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,320
Okay.

704
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,447
But it was Yeo-jin today.

705
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,115
You should thank her later.

706
00:51:59,699 --> 00:52:00,951
Okay.

707
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,577
Bye, then.

708
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:05,580
Wait, Ms. Kim.

709
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,415
Yes? What is it?

710
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,045
It's nothing.

711
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,173
Go ahead and eat.

712
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,484
Ms. Kim Soo-bin.

713
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:21,531
So…

714
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,075
you can't tell Ms. Kim

715
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,328
about this.

716
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,914
Okay?

717
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,633
Today, not tomorrow?

718
00:54:27,263 --> 00:54:29,849
In that case, can you come around 3 p.m.?

719
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:31,559
I'm finishing up right now.

720
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:35,230
Okay, thank you.

721
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:42,195
YOUR PACKAGE FROM PRINT PHOTO
HAS BEEN DELIVERED

722
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,238
JI-HOON'S MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER

723
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:28,116
How come I never thought
of sending her photos?

724
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,089
Soo-bin, I'm stopping by for a moment.

725
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,051
Is she asleep?

726
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,770
I remember buying some large envelopes.

727
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:58,897
Right, the envelope.

728
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,149
In a drawer in the study.

729
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:02,984
Right.

730
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,139
That's where the ink pad was.

731
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:39,771
Not here.

732
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:46,653
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

733
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,948
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

734
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,074
The police

735
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,910
couldn't find the phone
Ji-hoon had been using.

736
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:03,771
SOO-BIN

737
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,281
Don't ever say you want to break up.

738
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,908
Do you have a death wish?

739
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,085
Ji-hoon died…

740
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,008
because of that kid.

741
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,314
I'm going to kill myself.

742
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,274
I'M GOING TO KILL MYSELF

743
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:49,294
TROLLEY

744
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:51,754
If you were going to hide it,
you should have been more thorough.

745
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,839
It was just a mistake.

746
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,258
Let's work together as victims
and make something happen.

747
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,427
Arrange a meeting with Nam Joong-do.

748
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:59,887
How could you betray me like this?

749
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:00,972
How did you miss this?

750
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,765
Nothing is going as planned!

751
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,017
Can you believe her?

752
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,310
Yeo-jin, please keep it a secret.

753
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:07,270
I was being as generous
as I possibly could.

754
01:00:07,353 --> 01:00:09,522
Everything a politician does
sends out a message.

755
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,524
You're at fault no matter what.

756
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:16,487
