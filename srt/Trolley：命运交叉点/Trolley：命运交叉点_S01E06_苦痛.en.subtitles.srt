CHUNGJU CITY COUNCIL

2
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,720
We'll be wrapping up the seminar here.

3
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:57,390
I'd like to thank our panelists
who came all the way from Seoul.

4
00:00:57,474 --> 00:00:59,517
Daehan Party Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok,

5
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,811
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do,

6
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,730
and Assemblyman Son Yeong-gyun.

7
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,231
Please give them a big hand.

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,201
Chairwoman Woo,

10
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,912
I'm sure things were quite hectic today.

11
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,121
Thank you for coming.

12
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,664
We had to.

13
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,042
You did a great job organizing the event.

14
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:24,959
It's nothing.

15
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,088
You know, I feel bad for Assemblyman Ko.

16
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:29,589
He didn't cause the accident.

17
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,924
When you're driving,

18
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,258
accidents can happen

19
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,803
-even if you do nothing wrong.
-It was a hit-and-run.

20
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,224
What's worse is that
she kept silent about it for three days.

21
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,727
Even if he wasn't at fault,
he won't escape the blame so easily.

22
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,939
Politicians' families are
public figures too.

23
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,442
If you don't address this,
it could upset the election.

24
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,485
Yes.

25
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,321
Him leaving the party isn't enough.

26
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,365
We should have him resign from his office.

27
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:56,407
Yes.

28
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,493
If you think about it,

29
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:02,997
singles with no parents
would make the best politicians.

30
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,959
There's no risk of family trouble.

31
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,419
And even then, they can't be divorced.

32
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:10,213
Times may have changed,

33
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,799
but nothing reflects worse
on politicians than divorce.

34
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:16,219
No, it's worse to have children
who cause trouble.

35
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:19,347
If they can't even discipline
their own children properly,

36
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,683
how are the people supposed to…

37
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,977
Exactly, there have been
quite a few politicians

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,146
whose careers were at risk
because of their…

39
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,274
Right.

40
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,194
A truly competent politician

41
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,698
should be able to turn
such a crisis into an opportunity.

42
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,449
Of course.

43
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:41,286
I need to clean up a little.

44
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,999
I'll see you outside.

45
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,425
If you're unmarried,
it's "Why aren't you married?"

46
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:58,011
If you don't have kids,
it's "Why don't you have kids?"

47
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,514
You're criticized for
anything you do or don't do.

48
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:03,224
That's our fate as politicians.

49
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,020
Yes.

50
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,814
I'll just have to endure it.

51
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,568
Chairwoman Woo, shall we go to dinner?

52
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,615
So you commute from Youngsan every day?

53
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,326
Yes, it's not too far.
About 40 minutes by car.

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,785
Let's go.

55
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,081
Yes.

56
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,959
I'm sorry for calling out of the blue,

57
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,544
but could we have dinner tonight?

58
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,923
I can be in Youngsan in an hour.

59
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,341
Sure.

60
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,026
ILHWADANG

61
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,075
Mr. Choi.

62
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,244
Good evening.

63
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,912
Hello.

64
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,624
Thank you for meeting me
on such short notice.

65
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:10,959
Don't mention it.

66
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,461
Did you have any trouble
finding the place?

67
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,004
Not at all.

68
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,339
Let's go inside.

69
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:21,970
Seung-hee.

70
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,554
What are you doing here?

71
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,062
You're Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

72
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:32,981
Fancy meeting you here.

73
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,566
Hello, I am…

74
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,362
There she is.

75
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,451
You made it.

76
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,078
Honey.

77
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,930
PAIN

78
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,526
The assemblyman who raised
the issue of your mother's land purchase.

79
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,944
That's him.

80
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:23,448
We met once
to have a talk about it before,

81
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:26,117
and he suddenly called today
saying he was in the area.

82
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,703
Did you know that
he's Kim Jae-eun's husband?

83
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,748
No.

84
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,541
I had no idea.

85
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,612
I knew she was from Youngsan,

86
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,530
but I had no idea that the two…

87
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,242
I mean, the three of you
went to school together.

88
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,206
And I had no idea
that she would marry an assemblyman.

89
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,752
So how did you meet?

90
00:06:18,419 --> 00:06:19,670
When did you get married?

91
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,715
We met while volunteering.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,051
And we've been married…

93
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,594
for about 16 years now, right?

94
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,681
That's a long time.

95
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,559
You mentioned volunteering.

96
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,479
May I ask what kind of work
you used to do?

97
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,981
I was a lawyer at a small firm.

98
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,736
You were a lawyer.

99
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:46,906
I took a shine to her back then

100
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,533
and chased her around.

101
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,288
That makes sense.

102
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,583
She's always been very popular.

103
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,837
Was she?

104
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,297
I knew it.

105
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:07,760
Jae-eun…

106
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,721
You know that she changed her name, right?

107
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,223
Yes, I do.

108
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,227
We lost touch after we graduated,

109
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,229
then I recently saw her on the news,

110
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,814
and I recognized her right away.

111
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,485
Right, the news.

112
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:29,115
Yes, about your son.

113
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,580
It's belated,

114
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,915
but I'm sorry for your loss.

115
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,044
Thank you.

116
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,638
I once read this in a book.

117
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,477
They quantified and ranked
various types of psychological pain

118
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,898
caused by different events in human lives.

119
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,110
Imprisonment, infidelity, divorce…

120
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,988
Experiences of the sort.

121
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,284
I don't exactly remember
how each event ranked,

122
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,122
but the most excruciating event
one could experience turned out to be…

123
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,170
the death of a family member.

124
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,011
I've experienced that one.

125
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,556
I hope I won't experience the others.

126
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,019
I hope you two will

127
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,064
never have to experience

128
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,983
any of the events that you mentioned.

129
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:49,487
Yes,

130
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,989
I hope so too.

131
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,118
Not anymore.

132
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:19,976
Auntie Yeo-jin,

133
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,145
my friends kept saying
Dad is handsome today.

134
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,065
Honestly, I don't see it.

135
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,111
Was he popular when he was younger?

136
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:32,488
I'm not sure.

137
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,365
I don't remember.

138
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,534
But you lived right next door.

139
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,912
Anyway, that's not what's important.

140
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,913
What's important is

141
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,791
that the people love him
because he's righteous.

142
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:45,376
How would you know that?

143
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,337
Know what? That he's popular?

144
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,217
I mean, how do you know he's righteous?

145
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,970
-Do you have proof?
-Isn't it obvious?

146
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,682
Think about that med student
that killed himself.

147
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,976
People were saying
that he deserved a Nobel Prize.

148
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:02,893
I'm done.

149
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,021
Bring me the dishes when you're done.

150
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,772
Wait, Auntie Yeo-jin.

151
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,316
I'm done.

152
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:12,445
-Should I do the dishes?
-Forget it.

153
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,196
-Let's do it together.
-It's okay.

154
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,698
No, please let me pay.

155
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,199
-No, let me.
-No.

156
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,076
I asked you to come.

157
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,994
I'll pay.

158
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,707
I'm buying today.
You can treat us next time.

159
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,875
Sure.

160
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:28,002
I'll see you soon.

161
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:32,340
We'll treat you to a meal next time.

162
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:34,133
Yes, I hope to see you again.

163
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,847
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

164
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,974
Right.

165
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,852
I would enjoy a tour
of the National Assembly.

166
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,230
Of course.

167
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,859
Want to go to the restroom?

168
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,584
Seung-hee.

169
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,629
I never get involved
with my husband's work.

170
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,006
So I didn't know they were acquainted

171
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,883
and I don't know what it's about.

172
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,349
That's such an elaborate explanation.

173
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,683
Why?

174
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,102
What are you afraid of?

175
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:29,522
Your husband killed someone,
just like you.

176
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,316
Will it get complicated
if your secret gets out?

177
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:34,068
Seung-hee, that's--

178
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,779
You and your husband
have so much in common.

179
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,574
What's really baffling to me is,

180
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,620
did you fall in love and get married
within just a few years,

181
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,831
after what happened with Seung-ho?

182
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,210
If I went through something
bad enough to take to the police,

183
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,964
I wouldn't have been able to date
or get married for at least ten years.

184
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,716
Wouldn't it be normal
to be afraid of physical intimacy?

185
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,303
So how did you manage to date
and marry another man so soon afterward?

186
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,602
Let's make it fair.

187
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:13,983
My family was destroyed because of you,

188
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,026
but you've been living a happy life.

189
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,238
It's just too unfair.

190
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,323
Don't you think so?

191
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,248
Come back to Youngsan tomorrow.

192
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,667
Come down here

193
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,502
and apologize to my mother.

194
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,547
For framing Seung-ho for tuition money

195
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,175
and driving him to his death.

196
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,678
Apologize for everything.

197
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,390
What?

198
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,392
You can't?

199
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,811
Then what should I do?

200
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,189
Should I put up banners

201
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,483
and hand out fliers about what you did?

202
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:56,400
Or better yet,

203
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,277
there's always the internet.

204
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,655
Kim Jae-eun.

205
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,036
Your husband is an assemblyman, no less,
and the elections are coming up.

206
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:10,331
Should we see what happens?

207
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,166
Seung-hee.

208
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,294
This is between us. My husband--

209
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,755
Don't even think about
running away this time.

210
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,674
Come and apologize tomorrow.

211
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,428
Kneel before my mom
and apologize, Kim Jae-eun.

212
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:47,785
Jae-eun,

213
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:49,620
even with a scholarship,

214
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,623
it will be expensive to live in Seoul.

215
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,375
So…

216
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:55,459
2003 CSAT SCORES
KIM JAE-EUN

217
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,502
Here.

218
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,338
Apply to the Cheongju Campus
of Gyeongji University, okay?

219
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:01,757
Okay.

220
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,178
Jin Seung-ho got offered
early admission to SNU!

221
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,724
Everyone, Jin Seung-ho from my class
got into the SNU School of Law!

222
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,020
He's going to SNU after all.

223
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,941
I taught him.

224
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,317
Seung-hee.

225
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:23,070
Your twin brother is
an SNU law student now.

226
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,405
What will you do?

227
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,948
Please.

228
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,492
It's enough to have my mom
compare me to Seung-ho.

229
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,329
Why did they have to announce it today?

230
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,164
I'm supposed to go shopping
with Mom this weekend.

231
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,377
I can't believe Seung-ho
got into SNU School of Law.

232
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:42,172
You know how much
my mom adores him, right?

233
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:45,050
So I'm waiting for the day
he becomes so smitten with a girl

234
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,720
that he neglects Mom
and only cares about his girlfriend.

235
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,641
But if he does that,
she might actually faint from shock.

236
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:57,354
Jae-eun.

237
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,064
What do you think about Seung-ho?

238
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,610
-What?
-To be frank,

239
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:06,530
to be really frank,
Seung-ho isn't bad-looking.

240
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,741
And my mom likes you.

241
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,077
She'd prefer that he dates you
than some random girl in Seoul,

242
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,245
-and I would also be--
-No.

243
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:15,748
Don't be so flippant.

244
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,792
Just kidding.

245
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,503
No need to get so serious.

246
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,797
Then again,

247
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,467
even though all the other girls
are all over him,

248
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,011
I knew you'd find him off-putting.

249
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,931
You're definitely my friend.

250
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:36,268
-To Eupnae-dong, please.
-Sure.

251
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,145
-Are you taking the bus?
-Yes.

252
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,189
-Okay then. Bye.
-Bye.

253
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,483
Kim Jae-eun, my love!

254
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,276
See you tomorrow.

255
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,319
Bye.

256
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:47,237
-Let's go, sir.
-Okay.

257
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,238
I love you!

258
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,174
YOUNGSAN CHILDREN'S HOME

259
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:40,040
He's a senior at Youngsan High.

260
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:43,711
His name is Jin Seung-ho.

261
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,845
You killed him.

262
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:55,180
You murderer.

263
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,184
You framed Seung-ho for tuition money.

264
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:01,729
That's not true, Seung-hee.
Why would I do that?

265
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:03,522
Stop lying!

266
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,735
You killed Seung-ho.

267
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,023
Were you and my wife close back in school?

268
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,237
No, we were just classmates.

269
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,615
I haven't seen her since graduation.

270
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:58,243
But you recognized her
right away after 20 years.

271
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:07,044
My wife doesn't know anything
about our discussions.

272
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,548
We never talk about
anything related to my work.

273
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,052
Although it may sound odd to you.

274
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,724
Ms. Jin mentioned
that she saw my wife on the news.

275
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,519
Before what happened to my son,

276
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,523
she had never been seen by the press
or made an official appearance.

277
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,441
She wasn't involved in my campaign either.

278
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,736
That was her condition
for letting me get into politics,

279
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,490
and I intend to keep respecting her wish.

280
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,119
That also means

281
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:45,082
that she will not have any influence
over my political activities.

282
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,131
Yes, I understand what you mean.

283
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,258
I will not contact Jae-eun…

284
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,593
I mean,

285
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,596
Ms. Kim, about matters
concerning my mother-in-law.

286
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,349
Let's meet again soon.

287
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,809
I'll be in touch.

288
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,941
Sorry to keep you waiting.

289
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:36,967
-Honey.
-Hey.

290
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:41,889
Did you call a taxi?

291
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,223
Yes.

292
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,225
Where's Mr. Park?

293
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,394
I'm actually getting a ride from you.

294
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:51,064
I let Mr. Park go while we were eating.

295
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,403
Then please excuse us.

296
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,614
I had a great time tonight.

297
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,157
-Yes.
-Goodbye.

298
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:02,743
Get home safely.

299
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:04,036
See you again.

300
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,079
Okay.

301
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,716
Sorry for making you drive so late.

302
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,384
I felt like I had to drink with them.

303
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,594
It's okay.

304
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,638
I was going to drive anyway.

305
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,348
I guess you're right.

306
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:32,356
Lean back and get some sleep.

307
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,027
ESTIMATED TIME: 1 HOUR 42 MINUTES

308
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,864
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing a friend?

309
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,784
You're a busy man.

310
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,079
I still feel a little hurt.

311
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,957
I've never met
any of your friends until today.

312
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,044
You only told me you'd be late,

313
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,712
not that you'd be out of town.

314
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,967
Since when do you care
so much about my work?

315
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,097
Right.

316
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,641
You're right. I'm sorry.

317
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,559
Goodness.

318
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,270
A NEW MESSAGE FROM SEUNG-HEE

319
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,942
Come by noon tomorrow.

320
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,652
To the same old house.

321
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,282
POWER OFF

322
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:24,992
I shouldn't have said it like that.

323
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:25,993
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:26,910
DESTINATION: HOME

325
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,578
PLEASE WAIT

326
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,136
You said you were meeting a friend.

327
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,930
I told you.

328
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,100
I saw her on the news by chance
and met her on a whim.

329
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,564
What did you two talk about
in the restroom?

330
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,444
I went to see Seung-ho
before going to dinner.

331
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,489
And I promised him

332
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,576
that I'd clear his name.

333
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:13,248
So I told Jae-eun
to come and apologize to Mom.

334
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,125
Seung-hee.

335
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,462
Why? Is that wrong?

336
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,923
She's living the life
as an assemblyman's wife

337
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,718
after killing someone with her lies.

338
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,431
Why should my family
continue to live in misery?

339
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,684
Do you think my mom was always like that?

340
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,315
Seung-hee.

341
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,151
Are you really sure

342
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:44,362
that Jae-eun framed Seung-ho?

343
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,907
Yes,

344
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,992
that's what he told me.

345
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,161
He told me

346
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,371
that day.

347
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,878
Mom, I'm done with my bath.
Can you give me my cucumber facial?

348
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:02,798
Mom?

349
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,342
She's not here.

350
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,760
What?

351
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:08,136
Where is she?

352
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,555
The police station.

353
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:12,265
The police station?

354
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,227
Did you get in trouble?

355
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,148
What?

356
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,234
What is it?

357
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,279
Kim Jae-eun reported me to the cops.

358
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,365
She told them

359
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,367
that I forced myself on her.

360
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,786
What?

361
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:34,704
Hey.

362
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,166
I got accepted to SNU today.

363
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,752
So why would I do something like that?

364
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,965
I'm telling the truth!

365
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,718
You don't believe me, do you?

366
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:52,222
Hey, Jin Seung-hee.

367
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,226
Do you not believe me?

368
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:01,857
Do you not…

369
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,611
believe your own family?

370
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,502
I'm innocent.

371
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,298
Kim Jae-eun is lying.

372
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,777
Mom.

373
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,113
You have to eat something.

374
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,990
Okay?

375
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:55,952
Mom.

376
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,290
It's for money.

377
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,459
What?

378
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,588
She framed him for money.

379
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,591
That day,

380
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,886
Jae-eun came over and told me

381
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,015
she was applying to Gyeongji University.

382
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:22,812
She said she knew I had a relative there

383
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,940
and asked me to get her a scholarship.

384
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,651
But I told her

385
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,862
I couldn't do that.

386
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:36,493
Then she ruined her clothes,
went to the police station,

387
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,288
and falsely accused Seung-ho.

388
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,792
She's trying to get
settlement money from us.

389
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,044
Goodness.

390
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,382
My poor baby…

391
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,844
Goodness, Seung-ho.

392
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,265
Goodness.

393
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:04,521
My poor Seung-ho…

394
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,773
But my mom

395
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,943
couldn't sue her
for making a false accusation.

396
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,280
I was adamant that we should

397
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,032
but she couldn't even bear the thought

398
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,286
of damaging Seung-ho's reputation

399
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,163
with a sexual harassment trial.

400
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:25,667
That's why we said he had a heart attack.

401
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:29,337
I know it's too late,

402
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,173
but I have to do something.

403
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,719
I should have done it long ago.

404
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:37,679
I can't

405
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:42,517
bear the sight of her living so happily

406
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,228
after she destroyed my family

407
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,772
with her lies.

408
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,283
Mom should be home soon.

409
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,703
Don't tell her anything yet.

410
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:05,123
Seung-hee.

411
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:18,970
What business did you have with Ki-young
that you came all the way here?

412
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,182
It's nothing.

413
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:25,518
We met briefly for work.

414
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,312
I was at a seminar in Chungju,

415
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,731
and I gave him a call
since I was close to Youngsan.

416
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:33,151
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,779
For what I said earlier.

418
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,156
You're fine.

419
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,658
I'm sorry too.

420
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,994
I must have been tired
from driving for so long.

421
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,997
And I made you drive again.

422
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,125
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

423
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,504
Why don't you sleep? You must be tired.

424
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:54,506
It'll take more than an hour to get home.

425
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,841
Okay.

426
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,468
Thank you.

427
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:20,865
Mom.

428
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,827
Why did you drink so much?

429
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,412
Goodness.

430
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,583
Are you worried about me?

431
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:37,674
My precious daughter.

432
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:40,927
Mom.

433
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,263
Can you hug me like this

434
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,182
when you're not drunk as well?

435
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,393
Just like you used to?

436
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,021
What did you say?

437
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:54,983
Nothing.

438
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,568
-Let's go inside.
-Okay.

439
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,446
-This way.
-You're right.

440
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,499
Honey.

441
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,793
Yes?

442
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,296
About that med student…

443
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,348
What about him?

444
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,018
If…

445
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,729
If you could…

446
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,317
If you could go back in time,

447
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:42,238
would you call him out on the news again?

448
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,910
What would you do?

449
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:48,995
Me?

450
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,749
I don't know.

451
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,795
I don't know what's right, what's just,

452
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,963
or what should have been done.

453
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,425
I just don't know.

454
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,762
Do you regret…

455
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,101
getting married to someone
who wants to be in politics?

456
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,771
Do you regret it?

457
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:24,489
Yes.

458
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,491
I do.

459
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,286
But as for falling in love with you…

460
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,122
I don't regret it.

461
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,958
Never.

462
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,802
Thank you, Hye-joo.

463
00:31:19,752 --> 00:31:20,753
You.

464
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,262
Can you take responsibility?

465
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:37,103
You're one to talk.

466
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,711
Honey, did you sleep well?

467
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,754
Yes.

468
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,923
And you?

469
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,675
-Yes.
-Are you going to a funeral?

470
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:11,596
Yes, I'm going to Sangju today.

471
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,805
Sangju?

472
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,017
To Ji-hoon's mother's family?

473
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,103
It's the 20th anniversary.

474
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,067
I'm taking the afternoon off.

475
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,444
I forgot to tell you beforehand. Sorry.

476
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,113
Don't be. You should go.

477
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,324
You haven't been there in a while.

478
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,785
Have a safe trip.

479
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,328
You should have told me sooner.

480
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:39,999
Do you have cash?

481
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,376
Yes.

482
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,711
I'm sure you're bringing plenty,

483
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,755
but you should give them
even more than that.

484
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,592
And use an envelope
that says "assemblyman" on it.

485
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,303
I think they'll like that.

486
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,554
Right, the envelope.

487
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,641
Okay. I'll pick one up at the office.

488
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,685
You might forget.
Don't you have any at home?

489
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,770
In a drawer in the study.

490
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,939
I'll get it for you. One second.

491
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,444
Never mind, you should find it.

492
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,406
I can't find anything in your study.

493
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,117
I don't want to misplace anything
while looking for it.

494
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:16,828
Okay, I'll get it.

495
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,388
Honey.

496
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,308
Should we visit Sokcho after the election?

497
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,395
We'll take the same route
as our honeymoon.

498
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,359
You wanted to go to the sea
for our honeymoon.

499
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,653
You'd never been there.

500
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:55,908
So we said we'd go to the sea
for our vacation every year,

501
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,872
but we've never gone on a vacation
since Yoon-seo started school.

502
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,543
I'm sorry.

503
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,219
The election will be over soon.

504
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:16,929
Just a bit longer.

505
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,560
Let's go on a trip in spring.

506
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,729
Okay.

507
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,607
Yes, let's do that.

508
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,447
Good morning.

509
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,574
-Good morning. Sorry I'm late.
-It's fine.

510
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,683
MESSAGES

511
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,643
SEUNG-HEE

512
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,520
Come apologize properly

513
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,856
for framing Seung-ho
and driving him to his death.

514
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,193
-Honey.
-Yes?

515
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,236
I need your car keys.

516
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,029
My car keys?

517
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,493
Wait, honey…

518
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,636
NAM JOONG-DO IS A MURDERER

519
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,188
LOADING

520
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,507
Mr. Park.

521
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,051
Could you help her clean up?

522
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,929
I'll drive myself
to the breakfast meeting.

523
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,889
No, honey.

524
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,099
I can clean up.
You should go with Mr. Park.

525
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,643
No, I can drive myself.

526
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,062
No, it won't take long.
Don't worry about me and go.

527
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,606
Mr. Park, please drive him.

528
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,066
Yes, of course.

529
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,863
Honey, you should go. You're late.

530
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,698
Okay.

531
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:23,616
I'm sorry, honey.

532
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,409
I'll call you later.

533
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:55,606
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

534
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,736
Mr. Jang.

535
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,156
Why won't she pick up?

536
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:07,785
Hello?

537
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,037
Mom, why weren't you picking up?

538
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,832
-Me? You called?
-Yes.

539
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,125
Where are you?

540
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:17,128
I heard there was a good piece
of property in Jecheon,

541
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,254
so I'm on my way there.

542
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,215
But your car is at home.

543
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,592
The realtor is giving me a ride.

544
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,552
What's the matter?

545
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:28,764
Then when will you be home?

546
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:31,726
How should I know?
I'm not even in Jecheon yet.

547
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,060
What is it?

548
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,605
By any chance,

549
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,234
can you look at the property another time
and come home right now?

550
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,652
What for?

551
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,446
I need to see this one today.

552
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:46,574
Fine.

553
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,286
After you're done with all that,
what time can you be home?

554
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,998
You'll see when you're here.

555
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:56,500
Four o'clock?

556
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:58,711
Okay, then.

557
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,005
You have to be home by four, okay?

558
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,470
Be here by 4 p.m.…

559
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,476
Be here by 3:30 p.m. today.

560
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:18,564
SEUNG-HEE: BE HERE BY 3:30 P.M. TODAY.

561
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,295
High school classmates?

562
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,965
Yes, I knew she lived in Youngsan,

563
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:47,051
but I never imagined they'd be classmates.

564
00:39:50,846 --> 00:39:52,515
Anyway, that Jin Seung-hee.

565
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,058
Lee Yoo-sin's only daughter.

566
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,978
She said they were close friends
but they didn't seem close at all.

567
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,647
Even if it had been 20 years.

568
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,400
It almost looked like the opposite.

569
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:07,571
And Hye-joo seemed
oddly uncomfortable with Choi Ki-young.

570
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,786
I need you to look into it.

571
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,373
Hye-joo's old name was Kim Jae-eun.

572
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,918
Yes, sir.

573
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,548
I didn't expect her to be linked
to Kang Soon-hong like this,

574
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:30,219
but it would be good news
if this helps us find some dirt on him.

575
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:44,942
Hye-joo moved to Seoul by herself
at 20 and met me at 22.

576
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,027
She was 23 when we got married.

577
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,449
As you know,
she grew up in a children's home,

578
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:55,494
so I figured she didn't want to recall
the tough memories from those days.

579
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,330
That's why I've never asked her.

580
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:03,377
So why do you want to know now?

581
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,295
Is there…

582
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,630
something you find suspicious?

583
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,716
It's a protective measure

584
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,427
for whatever might happen.

585
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,430
A protective measure…

586
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,349
for her?

587
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,767
Or for yourself?

588
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,105
Don't be mistaken.

589
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,943
I'm asking you to do this as her husband,
not an assemblyman.

590
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,530
Yes, sir.

591
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,200
Have a safe trip. I'll be going too.

592
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,095
What did I tell you?

593
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:58,474
I told you not to go into my space
without my permission, didn't I?

594
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,267
I'm sorry.

595
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:03,437
I'm just a kid you know.
I shouldn't have gone into your space.

596
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:12,738
Soo-bin.

597
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,784
Do you have something to say?

598
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,246
No, I'm just going to work.

599
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:22,164
Okay.

600
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,290
I'm going to the bathroom.

601
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,542
Hey, Soo-bin.

602
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:30,798
I'll be home late tonight.

603
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,008
You don't have to tell me these things.

604
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,471
You don't need my permission
to go in and out of your house.

605
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,584
MURDERER

606
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,263
DAON WOMEN'S CLINIC

607
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,563
Sorry?

608
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,568
Induced abortion?

609
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,404
Yes.

610
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:39,325
I was told at another clinic
that it's no longer illegal.

611
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:42,911
Do you do that here?

612
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:48,709
Goodness.

613
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:51,754
Hi.

614
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,552
CHUNG YOO-NA DERMATOLOGY

615
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,933
Were you here for a check-up?

616
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,519
How's the morning sickness?

617
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,189
Don't mind my business,

618
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,857
and mind your own skin care.

619
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,945
Hey, Soo-bin, wait.

620
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:19,865
What?

621
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,450
Sure.

622
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:25,871
I get that pregnancy hormones
can cause mood swings.

623
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:28,874
That's why I try my best
to cut you some slack.

624
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:31,543
But this attitude isn't going to work.

625
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:33,796
You're just being rude right now.

626
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,591
What?

627
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,469
You think I'm being nosy
when I don't even have kids?

628
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,432
I've been pregnant, I've given birth,

629
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,559
and I've raised a kid.

630
00:44:58,487 --> 00:45:00,197
Have you ever heard of
"didn't ask, don't care"?

631
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,658
What?

632
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:28,559
NAM JOONG-DO IS A MURDERER

633
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,691
NAM JOONG-DO'S WIFE IS A MURDERER

634
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,537
Fine.

635
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:34,583
So what if I become a liar?

636
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:45,177
YOUNGSAN CHILDREN'S HOME

00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,731
MEDIA COMMUNICATIONS
CLASS OF '04 KIM HYEON-U

638
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,149
Here they are.

639
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,859
Pretty good editing, right?

640
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,194
They look so real.

641
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,661
Good work.

642
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,892
Could it be a groundless
and malicious rumor?

643
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:36,895
No, according to our source,
the rumor is true.

644
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,064
Supposedly, she had been stressed out

645
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:41,733
by the public criticism
toward her deceased son.

646
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,693
Fortunately…

647
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,118
Exactly. It was recently revealed
that he had uploaded

648
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:53,620
his illegal video of his ex-girlfriend

649
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:58,125
on pornography websites
right before he committed suicide.

650
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,460
-What?
-When the arrest warrant was applied for,

651
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,546
-he had only threatened to share it.
-What?

652
00:48:02,629 --> 00:48:03,755
You're right.

653
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,550
The police believe
he spread the video as revenge

654
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,302
after deciding to take his own life

655
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,014
when the police reapplied
for his arrest warrant.

656
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:14,141
How was it revealed

657
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,018
-that the video was shared?
-He did…

658
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:19,855
-He did what?
-Investigators came across the video

659
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,524
during the recent crackdown
on pornography websites.

660
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:24,651
The police tracked the IP address,

661
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,654
which led back to the assailant's laptop.

662
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,742
At the time, Assemblyman Nam
went on live TV…

663
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,666
SEUNG-HEE

664
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,961
BE HERE BY 3:30 P.M. TODAY

665
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,966
MILL LADY

666
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,638
Hello?

667
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:54,890
Ms. Kim.

668
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,185
Ma'am, what's wrong?

669
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,648
What? A video?

670
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,320
No.

671
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,572
I haven't heard anything about it.

672
00:49:12,824 --> 00:49:13,867
Yes.

673
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:16,745
Yes, ma'am.

674
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,914
Please calm down.

675
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,542
I'll find out what happened.

676
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,086
Okay.

677
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:32,386
HUSBAND

678
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:40,477
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

679
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,062
Yes, Ms. Kim.

680
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,816
We only found out about the leak
a couple of days ago.

681
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,734
The police are on it,

682
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,945
and Mr. Nam paid out of
his own pocket to hire a company

683
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,239
to delete the video.

684
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,116
Yes.

685
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,830
We didn't think it'd be on the news.

686
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,164
I see.

687
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,293
All right then. I'll talk to you later.

688
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,176
Let's do one thing at a time, shall we?

689
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,512
Why did she have to get involved?

690
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,514
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

691
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,309
MILL LADY

692
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,480
Jae-eun wouldn't tell me the details.

693
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,694
I'm the man who'll be by her side
for the rest of her life.

694
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,946
I need to know what happened in her past

695
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,948
to be able to protect her

696
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,700
from whatever might happen.

697
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:23,079
So please tell me. I ask of you.

698
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,797
It's related to someone
named Jin Seung-hee, right?

699
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:34,883
Jae-eun…

700
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,053
mentioned her?

701
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,013
Yes, just the name.

702
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,232
There was this boy

703
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,442
who was accepted into
the SNU School of Law

704
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:54,861
for the first time from Youngsan High.

705
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,615
Okay. I'll be there by 3:30 p.m.

706
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,017
HERE LIES JUNG SU-HYEON

707
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,353
You know that
Su-hyeon was a stubborn girl, right?

708
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,273
Yes.

709
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,861
That persistence was something
that kept her going since childhood.

710
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,697
I couldn't believe she even had cancer,

711
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,324
but she also refused treatment
because she was pregnant.

712
00:52:41,408 --> 00:52:45,787
I did everything I could to convince her
that she could always have another child,

713
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,747
but she just wouldn't listen.

714
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,624
After Ji-hoon was born,

715
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,918
she didn't last a year, did she?

716
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,130
No.

717
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,468
To be honest, back then,
I blamed you more than her.

718
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,847
But having thought about it
after she passed,

719
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,183
I realized that her decision
must have been tougher for you.

720
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,436
Right?

721
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:16,943
So I thought I would be fine
as long as Ji-hoon lived a good life.

722
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,946
And even though I didn't see him often,

723
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,949
I figured he was doing well

724
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,743
with his dad, stepmom, and sister.

725
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,872
But I kept seeing him on the news
for being up to no good.

726
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,709
I never thought he'd go like this.

727
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,797
It's all my fault.

728
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,258
I'm sorry.

729
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,432
You can stop sending us holiday gifts.

730
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,184
There's no need.

731
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:53,229
You only got to live with her
for less than two years,

732
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,774
yet you've cared for us
for the past 20 years.

733
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,693
I'm saying we should cut our ties.

734
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,323
We don't have to see each other
unless there's bad news.

735
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,034
We won't ask much of you.

736
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,869
Just forget all about us

737
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,830
and do good work for the country.

738
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,509
Eat with us before you go.

739
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,135
Yes, I will.

740
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,653
YOUNGSAN MIDDLE SCHOOL
YOUNGSAN HIGH SCHOOL

741
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,587
My mom will be here soon.

742
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,883
Your phone was off.

743
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,636
I called in case you changed your mind.

744
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,222
But you found your way here.

745
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,768
I used to come here often.

746
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,441
The house hasn't changed at all, has it?

747
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,028
It's the same

748
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,656
as it was 20 years ago.

749
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,844
Go wash your face.

750
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:14,013
And wipe your tears off.

751
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:19,018
Don't you dare try to make
my mom feel sorry for you.

752
00:57:20,061 --> 00:57:21,020
You got that?

753
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,643
Seung-hee, what's wrong?

754
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:26,753
Ms. Jin, open the door right now.

755
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,755
Now!

756
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,456
TROLLEY

757
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,624
Just stay put for now.

758
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,960
Nam Joong-do will retaliate.

759
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,962
I'll get on my knees
and do anything you ask.

760
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:12,173
Don't resent me for the things
I do from this point on.

761
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,175
-Ms. Kim should have stayed out of it.
-What are you doing?

762
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:16,553
Please don't go into my room
when I'm not here.

763
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,640
This could complicate things for you
with the election coming up, right?

764
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,393
You don't have to do anything
or worry about anything.

765
00:59:23,476 --> 00:59:25,520
If you mess with her
or hurt her in any way,

766
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:27,188
you won't be able to
handle the consequences.

767
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,732
Why is it happening all over again?

768
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,484
I'm Assemblyman Nam Joong-do of Sinyang.

769
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,778
I'll take responsibility for everything.

770
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:39,450
