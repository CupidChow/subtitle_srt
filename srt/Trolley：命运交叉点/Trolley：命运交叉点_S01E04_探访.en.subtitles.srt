1
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,680
It's all my fault.

2
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,976
They lost their son.

3
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:11,780
BOOK CONSERVATION

4
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,971
I'm so sorry but something came up.

5
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,265
Will you go home first?

6
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,159
I haven't been here for so long.

7
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,954
I know.

8
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:19,722
Do you want to go out and get some air?

9
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:22,517
No, let's just stay here.

10
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:28,064
You can work. I won't bother you.

11
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,776
It's okay. I'm not in a rush.

12
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,279
Should we just go home then?

13
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:35,947
No.

14
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:38,992
I just want to…

15
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,620
be here with you.

16
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,207
Feel free to work.

17
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:49,210
I came by to see you,
so I'll just be doing that.

18
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,797
That's all I need.

19
00:02:58,803 --> 00:02:59,929
I'm back.

20
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,306
-Hello.
-Hello.

21
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:04,642
Is Assemblyman Nam all right?
What about the hospital?

22
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:07,270
He's fine. He's just a little tired.

23
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,980
I see. What a relief.

24
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,691
After the final inspection,

25
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,985
he'll be busy preparing
for the general election.

26
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:17,030
He hasn't taken a day off
since his last term,

27
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,489
so I was getting worried.

28
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,158
He hasn't had a single day off?

29
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,162
No, I was in charge
of his schedule back then.

30
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,789
On weekends,
he'd do rounds in his district

31
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,625
or party events around the country.

32
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:32,170
And on holidays, he'd visit
senior welfare centers and such.

33
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,839
So he hasn't taken a whole day off

34
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,008
for seven and a half years now.

35
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:38,635
-Good grief.
-My gosh.

36
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:41,012
At least today's schedule was light.

37
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:46,476
A lot of assemblymen skip
plenary sessions around this time, right?

38
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,853
Some are busy
preparing for the inspection,

39
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,272
and others only care
about the general election.

40
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:54,400
They return to their districts
to secure votes.

41
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,777
That's not the case anymore.

42
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,029
The people are watching.

43
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:03,326
And they can keep bills pending
by keeping their seats in those sessions.

44
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:04,827
He's right.

45
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,413
Especially around the end
of a term, like now.

46
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,999
If a bill doesn't pass before the term,

47
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,334
it gets scrapped.

48
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,044
You're right.

49
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:15,713
I see, a bill can get scrapped
at the end of a term.

50
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:19,050
This is Assemblyman Nam's jacket.

51
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:21,010
-Can you get this dry-cleaned?
-Yes, sir.

52
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,347
Actually, never mind.

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,265
I'll go.

54
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:26,266
Okay.

55
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:59,507
The wake is taking place
at Kwangsun University Hospital.

56
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,469
You're not going, are you?

57
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,557
I'm sorry, but could you cancel
my schedule for the day?

58
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,268
Mr. Jang, should I drop you off
in Yeouido?

59
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,020
No, one second.

60
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,569
KWANGSUN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

61
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:44,844
Let's go to Yeouido.

62
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,266
Wait, one second.

63
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,986
Ji-hoon might not be the father.

64
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,405
You're right.

65
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
He might not be.

66
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,160
How much did he pay you?

67
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,705
-What?
-How much do you charge for a night?

68
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:14,707
How much did Ji-hoon pay?

69
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,587
Let go of me.

70
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,546
Let go of me!

71
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,839
I said let go!

72
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,259
Pay attention when an adult
is talking to you.

73
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,311
So you haven't put out for money.

74
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,022
Ji-hoon and I dated.

75
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,273
Even so,

76
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,026
that's no guarantee
that this child is Ji-hoon's.

77
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:42,985
Just like you said.

78
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,989
Just cut to the chase.

79
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:48,908
Sure.

80
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:54,330
Are you going to stay in that house?

81
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,210
Then lay low, as if you're dead.

82
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:04,173
If you're not up for that,
feel free to just die.

83
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,805
Should you be saying that?

84
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,015
The dashcam is…

85
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,912
The dashcam is now connected.

86
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,125
You're right.

87
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,169
Who knows what it'll capture?

88
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,796
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

89
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,219
An assemblyman?

90
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,304
A list member?

91
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:19,600
Yes.

92
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,396
I met Assemblywoman Woo Jin-seok
from the Daehan Party last night

93
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,607
and she offered to nominate me
as a list member.

94
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,695
She even gave me a favorable slot.

95
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:39,745
You already made your decision.

96
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:44,667
I'm sorry.

97
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,296
But…

98
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,424
I would still…

99
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,970
like your support in this decision.

100
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,391
I've dreamt of this for a long time,

101
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,769
and I could use that reassurance.

102
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,365
I promised you when we got married

103
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,243
that even if I got into politics one day,

104
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,622
I'd make sure that
you would keep living a quiet life

105
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,082
just as you wanted.

106
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,630
I'll keep that promise at all costs.

107
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:35,343
I will never do anything
to break the peace in your life.

108
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,637
I promise.

109
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,107
Under one condition.

110
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,529
I know nothing about politics

111
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,075
and I probably never will.

112
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,412
So from now on, we'll be living together

113
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,414
but we'll be walking on different paths.

114
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,417
But…

115
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:13,047
if things ever get too hard,

116
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,634
please share it with me.

117
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,555
That's my condition
for supporting your decision.

118
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,685
I will.

119
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,938
I'll make sure I do that.

120
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,899
I promise.

121
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,534
Thank you, honey.

122
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,619
Thank you so much.

123
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,261
Thank you for keeping your promise.

124
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,022
THE VISIT

125
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,276
Your noodles are ready.

126
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,736
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

127
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,658
-Yeo-jin.
-Yes?

128
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:24,326
Aren't you working too late?

129
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,704
Am I not allowed to?

130
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,124
Well, I wouldn't say
you're not allowed to,

131
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,710
but Hye-joo asks me
to make sure you don't work too much

132
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,004
every time she sees me.

133
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,715
This is me making sure.

134
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,885
So if you feel sick tomorrow,
it's not on me.

135
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,638
Fine, I'll leave.

136
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,569
Yeo-jin, did you get off work?

137
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:01,906
I think I'll be a little late today.
Can you make dinner for Soo-bin?

138
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,635
Whatever.

139
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,389
What are you doing there?

140
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,824
Come and eat.

141
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,843
Thank you for the food.

142
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,556
How can you be
so relaxed about everything?

143
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,600
Meanwhile, everyone in this family
is stressed out because of you.

144
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,604
They say being calm is good for the baby.

145
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,439
Good for the baby?

146
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:21,026
Do you think pregnancy is that easy?

147
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,486
Have you experienced it?

148
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,157
Are you having the baby?

149
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,119
I'm not sure.

150
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
This has gone bad.

151
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,266
It's fine.

152
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,232
It must be morning sickness.

153
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,526
Welcome.

154
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,653
May I have the name on your reservation?

155
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,322
Hey, Choi Ki-young!

156
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,823
Hey, over here!

157
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:10,492
Look at you.

158
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:19,251
Anyway, how long have you been
married to Seung-hee?

159
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,463
-Five years?
-Already?

160
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,758
Time sure flies, doesn't it?

161
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,094
It was when you were
visiting from Australia

162
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,596
that I invited you to the reunion.

163
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,097
That's when you met her.

164
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,098
Remember that?

165
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,476
I do.

166
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,560
Hold on.

167
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,021
Were you two even close in high school?

168
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:43,067
No, we were just in the same class
in senior year.

169
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,276
Right?

170
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:48,197
That's why we were surprised to hear
that you two were getting married.

171
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,991
Hey, Ki-young.

172
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,370
I played a huge part
in your marriage, okay?

173
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,704
Don't you ever forget that.

174
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,624
All right.

175
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,628
So what's with this three-year-long
language exchange program she's on?

176
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,171
Wasn't she going for a year?

177
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:08,175
And why didn't you go with her?
Why are you here like a widower?

178
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,304
She finished her studies
and came back today.

179
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:13,389
Today?

180
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:15,975
I wouldn't have called you if I knew that.

181
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:16,976
I'm sorry.

182
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:17,977
Right.

183
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,728
You don't have any kids yet, do you?

184
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,855
I won't ask to go for another round.

185
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,192
Go home early and have a great time,
if you know what I mean.

186
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,532
Anyway, Ki-young…

187
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,285
Can I borrow some money?

188
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,246
-Money?
-Yes.

189
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:40,290
I'm sorry to even ask you this,

190
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,876
but it's my work,
so could you spare 50 million?

191
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,255
I'm sorry, but I don't
have that kind of money.

192
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,426
You own so many buildings.
Of course, you have money.

193
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,136
I don't. I mean it.

194
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,430
I just manage
my mother-in-law's buildings.

195
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:56,515
They're all under her name.

196
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,850
Hey, same difference.

197
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,644
It'll become your wife's soon.

198
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,190
You married into
the richest family in Youngsan.

199
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,443
Don't play innocent with me.

200
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,527
Forget it.

201
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,867
Have a good night, sir.

202
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,286
-Okay.
-I'll give you a call.

203
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,665
Gosh.

204
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:25,461
Ms. Lee, thank you for taking the time
to write up the contract.

205
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:29,423
She said she'll only seal the deal
once you're in Korea,

206
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,801
so the seller and I waited
for over a month.

207
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,597
Mom, if you need someone,
you have Ki-young.

208
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,141
He manages your real estate anyway.

209
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,476
He's not my son.

210
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,021
I need to seal the deal before you

211
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:48,067
so you know where my land
and buildings are even after I'm dead.

212
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,820
Stop talking about dying.

213
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,989
Everyone dies.

214
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,297
When will you be home?

215
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,011
Hey, you're home early.

216
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,765
Yes, I guess I am.

217
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,768
Have you had dinner?

218
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,937
I ate with Mom.

219
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:33,028
You must be tired. You should go to bed.

220
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,114
Okay.

221
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,687
-You're home.
-Hey.

222
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:08,772
I'm home too.

223
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,858
How come you two came together?

224
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,317
We met out front.

225
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,528
Are you going out again?

226
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,989
-No, I clocked out.
-What's gotten into you?

227
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,574
Yoon-seo isn't home yet, right?

228
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,284
Where's Soo-bin?

229
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:31,170
Come in.

230
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,382
No, stay in bed.

231
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:39,052
I heard you felt sick and skipped dinner.

232
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,220
Do you feel better now?

233
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,640
-Yes.
-That's a relief.

234
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,435
It can be really painful
when morning sickness gets bad.

235
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,812
I had that in the early stages
of my pregnancy too.

236
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,192
I brought some barley tea
that Yeo-jin made.

237
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,318
It should help.

238
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,739
Then get some rest.

239
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,324
Wait.

240
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,043
Here.

241
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:15,797
I got tested for drugs.

242
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,135
Was it really negative?

243
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,721
I saw the test results.

244
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:29,895
Honey.

245
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,692
I don't know what to feel
whenever I see her.

246
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,363
I'm still quite confused
about this situation.

247
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,281
But…

248
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,826
she's pregnant with Ji-hoon's child,

249
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,121
so I'm trying my best to like her.

250
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:54,169
So just try to be
a bit more understanding, okay?

251
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,090
She even brought up
the drug test before I did

252
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,133
and got herself tested.

253
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,012
And she's having morning sickness now.
It must be hard for her.

254
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:07,933
Okay.

255
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:12,479
But honey,

256
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,941
don't get too attached to her.

257
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,736
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

258
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,614
Okay.

259
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,784
But we already let her into our house,

260
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,162
so let's just try to trust her, okay?

261
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,875
And she doesn't seem like a bad kid.

262
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,881
Do you want to take a bath?
I'll draw a bath.

263
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,720
You should. You must be tired.
It'll help you sleep.

264
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:46,305
Okay, thanks.

265
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,100
Where's your top?

266
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,269
What?

267
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,188
I mean your suit jacket.

268
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,858
We must have left it at the studio.

269
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,235
No, it's in my car.

270
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:01,778
I see.

271
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,499
Why is her bag…

272
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,792
Hey, Yoon-seo.

273
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,462
Jeez, Mom.

274
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,714
I was startled
thinking you were throwing up.

275
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,176
Soo-bin isn't feeling well.
She has morning sickness.

276
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,096
I can't believe her.

277
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,807
Watch what you say.

278
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,185
What did I do?

279
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,519
-Nam Yoon-seo.
-Nam Yoon-seo.

280
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,688
Don't talk to your mom like that.

281
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,483
Why are you always scolding me?

282
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,777
This is so annoying.

283
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,112
-Yoon-seo.
-Nam Yoon-seo!

284
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,575
She's doing that
because you keep scolding her.

285
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,118
Look at her attitude.

286
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,121
I've babied her
because there was so much going on.

287
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,165
Nam Yoon-seo, come out.

288
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,167
Stop it. I'll talk to her, okay?

289
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,378
You should go to your room.
That's enough, okay?

290
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,184
Let go of me.

291
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,185
Let go of me!

292
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,394
I said let go!

293
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,451
Don't be so hard on Yoon-seo.

294
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,703
This must be confusing
and tough for her too.

295
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,539
I'll talk to her.

296
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,294
It's not just about today.

297
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:44,172
Being a good student isn't everything.

298
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,260
Yoon-seo is in middle school, honey.
She's an adolescent.

299
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,763
And she's been through a lot.

300
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,561
Your daughter is kind
and brilliant just like you

301
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,231
and I couldn't be more proud of her.

302
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,278
I've stayed the closest
to Yoon-seo for the last eight years,

303
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,487
so I can vouch for it.

304
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,449
Are you scolding me
for making you raise her alone?

305
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,494
You catch on quick.

306
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,955
You're a smart one, aren't you?

307
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,416
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,003
I have no excuses.

309
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,257
You know that…

310
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,262
I gave you up to share
with the world, right?

311
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,600
I do.

312
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:40,687
Thank you.

313
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,815
I love you.

314
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,152
Me too.

315
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:50,989
I love you too.

316
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:06,106
JIN SUSHI

317
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,759
Good morning.

318
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:46,354
You got ready so early.

319
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,773
One second.
I have to bottle the vegetable juice.

320
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:51,818
Take your time.
I'll be putting my shoes on.

321
00:27:01,619 --> 00:27:04,456
First off, I made a round in Youngsan.

322
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,960
Lee Yoo-sin's family, that is,
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong's in-laws,

323
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,130
have been community leaders
in this area for generations.

324
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,424
No one around here is willing to talk.

325
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,553
Nonetheless, I did find
a new piece of information.

326
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,557
Lee Yoo-sin doesn't approve
of her son-in-law.

327
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:24,517
Her son-in-law?

328
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,145
The one who manages her real estate?

329
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,814
Yes, his name is Choi Ki-young,

330
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,733
and he runs an indoor driving range.

331
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,068
Is he a local?

332
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:35,820
Yes, he met Lee Yoo-sin's daughter

333
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,198
at a high school reunion
before he married her.

334
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,950
They live in
Lee Yoo-sin's home to this day.

335
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,662
Also, Lee Yoo-sin's daughter
went to Canada alone about three years ago

336
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:48,041
to study abroad, then returned recently.

337
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,044
Leaving her husband
with her mom who disapproves of him?

338
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,630
Yes.

339
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,341
I see. What an interesting couple.

340
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:01,221
But if her son-in-law is in charge of
managing her real estate,

341
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,139
it means she trusts him.

342
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,350
So why does she disapprove of him?

343
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,601
Well, apparently…

344
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,729
his family isn't very wealthy.

345
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,483
They weren't well-off to begin with,

346
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,695
so Lee Yoo-sin gifted him
the driving range when they got married.

347
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,155
FROM MOTHER-IN-LAW LEE YOO-SIN

348
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:23,827
She drags him around
and walks all over him.

349
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,872
-So people are reluctant to talk,
-Not from there. What are you doing?

350
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,666
but they all feel bad for him.

351
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,209
Get a good angle. Good.

352
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,004
If she left her husband alone
to go overseas

353
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,423
in spite of all that,

354
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,299
the couple may not be on good terms.

355
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,468
Did she return to finalize their divorce?

356
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,723
You can't find out
what's going on between a couple.

357
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:49,561
Right, but the word about Choi Ki-young
and his mother-in-law seems to check out,

358
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,646
so why don't we talk to him?

359
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,983
If everyone else could see
how much she belittles him,

360
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,735
I'm sure he's got a lot bottled up.

361
00:28:56,818 --> 00:29:00,447
Right, and if he's managing
her real estate, he'll have information--

362
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,283
No, let's not mess with the son-in-law.

363
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,286
Things may be bad between them,
but they're family.

364
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,456
They'd have each other's backs
through worse things.

365
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,792
But he's just an in-law.

366
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,420
Family is more than just blood.

367
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,674
And if he's staying in that marriage

368
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,676
despite all the public mistreatment,

369
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,554
it could speak to how much
he loves his wife.

370
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,347
I see.

371
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,266
Love is so difficult.

372
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,310
Do you think that's
why I'm not married yet?

373
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,020
-Precisely.
-Darn it.

374
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,646
-Ms. Kim.
-Yes, sir.

375
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,440
I know you're working hard,

376
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,861
but can you find a different approach
not involving the son-in-law?

377
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,030
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, good work.

378
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:48,286
Hey, it's me. Can you talk right now?

379
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:52,707
You were in a delivery? You must be busy.

380
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,545
Actually, I called to ask something.

381
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,758
I hear there's a medicine
for morning sickness these days.

382
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:04,761
What?

383
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,556
It's not for me. That's nonsense.

384
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,270
About five weeks now.

385
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,900
I see.

386
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,112
Okay, you should get back to work.

387
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,906
Yes, okay. Thank you.

388
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:45,093
I LOVE YOU, MOM AND DAD.
SINCERELY, NAM JI-HOON

389
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,358
Darn it, where's my lip balm?

390
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:05,071
I got it back from her
and then put it in here.

391
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,491
Did I drop it somewhere?

392
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,916
MS. KIM

393
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,921
I'll ask her later tonight.

394
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,173
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

395
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,802
Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok will come by
during the campaign, right?

396
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,015
I really hope she does.

397
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:35,435
She was of great help
during the last general election.

398
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,811
I know that very well.

399
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,024
And Assemblyman Nam.

400
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,653
You need to be more active
in making contact with local residents.

401
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:48,948
Sure, I'll make more time.

402
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,454
I wasn't talking about you.

403
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,164
I meant Ms. Kim.

404
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:01,586
I didn't want to bring this up again,

405
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,881
but as the chief of the district office

406
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,050
and the chief of your election campaign,

407
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,637
frankly, I'm very disappointed
in your wife.

408
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,722
I said it.

409
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,601
Other assemblymen have their wives

410
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,312
visit local residents
to secure their votes,

411
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,231
but Ms. Kim never participates.

412
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,317
I mean, okay.

413
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,153
I can understand that to a certain extent.

414
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:30,490
But she has to come out
during the elections.

415
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,662
Honestly, it's very discouraging.

416
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,746
And no,

417
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,208
we may not be your family.

418
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,543
But we work day and night for months,

419
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:45,505
taking IV fluids
and breaking our backs for you.

420
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,341
But your wife doesn't even show up

421
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,551
and doesn't seem to care at all.

422
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,638
We can't help but get discouraged.

423
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,442
I completely understand what you mean.

424
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,571
However…

425
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,074
I'm sorry.

426
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,701
I don't think…

427
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:17,453
my wife can help.

428
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,428
I'm so sorry, Mr. Yoo.

429
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,263
Wait, Assemblyman Nam.

430
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:37,640
Goodness.

431
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,103
I'll put in the extra effort
to make up for her absence.

432
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,815
So please do understand.

433
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:51,279
That's a promise I made to my wife.

434
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:54,032
I'm sorry.

435
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,536
Goodness, Assemblyman Nam.
Please don't do this.

436
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,288
Assemblyman Nam. Please.

437
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,637
SINYANG-GU'S SON!
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER!

438
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,599
Why is a flier from
the last general election here?

439
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,894
I was so young.

440
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,272
Time flies.

441
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,316
I worked so hard back then.

442
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,114
Assemblyman Nam.

443
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,659
Why did you want to get into politics?

444
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,995
That was out of nowhere.

445
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,460
I wanted the world
to change for the better.

446
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:53,174
Having said it out loud,
it sounds like a kid's journal entry.

447
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,178
But it's true.

448
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,599
That's what I wrote when they asked me
what I wanted to be and why

449
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:03,643
back when I was young.

450
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,774
In that case,

451
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,653
if you had to choose

452
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:18,324
between the world you dream of
and your wife,

453
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,954
which one would you choose?

454
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,952
Honey.

455
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,328
Hey, honey.

456
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,123
-Were you on your way home?
-No.

457
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,334
Is something wrong?

458
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,544
No, everything is fine.

459
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,130
I was just at the district office.

460
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:16,966
The main street was jammed,
so we took a detour and saw you.

461
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:18,301
I see.

462
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,928
-Were you on your way home?
-Yes. Have you had dinner?

463
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,264
I'm on my way to a dinner engagement.

464
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,433
-Don't drink too much.
-Yes, ma'am.

465
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:28,853
Hello.

466
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,062
-Hello.
-Hello.

467
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,689
Thank you for your hard work.

468
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,316
Go on.

469
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,984
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

470
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:46,829
There.

471
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,000
What's wrong?

472
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,919
It's nothing. You should go.

473
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:53,836
Goodbye.

474
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,588
-See you later.
-Bye.

475
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,732
I'd like to hear the answer
to my question before.

476
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,239
Do you choose your wife?

477
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,661
What makes you think
I can only have one of the two?

478
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,421
Don't get too attached to her.

479
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,382
I'm afraid you'll get hurt.

480
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,426
You've barely touched your food.

481
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,346
-Is it bad?
-No, it's not that.

482
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,681
I just don't have an appetite.

483
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,267
Good grief.

484
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,644
One has morning sickness
and the other has no appetite.

485
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,771
Give me a role too, will you?

486
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,734
What is it?

487
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,695
Is something wrong?

488
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:04,532
It's nothing.

489
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,684
Come in.

490
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,692
Are you coming back from work?

491
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:41,277
Yes.

492
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,115
What is it?

493
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,491
Well,

494
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,827
about your lip balm…

495
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,663
The one with sticker residue.

496
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,999
Yes, it was at your studio, right?

497
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,587
No, I didn't see it around.

498
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,921
It wasn't there?

499
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,216
I could have sworn I put it in my bag.

500
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:10,139
Could you take another look
when you get to work tomorrow?

501
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,393
Sure. I'll do that.

502
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:15,519
Thank you.

503
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,522
But what did you want to say about it?

504
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,276
-Right.
-If you didn't find it,

505
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,903
what was it about?

506
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:28,866
I wanted to ask you
about the name of the color.

507
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,242
The name of the color?

508
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,329
It was pretty,
so I wanted to get one for Yoon-seo.

509
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,416
Right.

510
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,669
There's a lot of them in the shop,

511
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,922
so you just pick one out.

512
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,965
I see.

513
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,260
-Thank you.
-Sure.

514
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,535
Lucky her.

515
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,004
Hey, you're home.

516
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,257
I'm sorry. Did I wake you?

517
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:29,051
No, I wasn't asleep. I couldn't sleep.

518
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:30,678
Why not?

519
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:32,471
Just because.

520
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,100
You're late. You said
you'd be home around midnight.

521
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:39,478
I had dinner with the district delegates,

522
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,314
and one of the entourage
hit a car while pulling out theirs.

523
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,859
So I drove them home in my car.

524
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,112
Back to their home? Who?

525
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,322
You wouldn't know them.

526
00:40:51,073 --> 00:40:53,033
It was Delegate Song Yu-jin.

527
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,828
Wait a second.

528
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,164
How come you're suddenly interested in me?

529
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,999
-What?
-Think about it.

530
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:04,962
You never showed any interest
in who I meet and what I do.

531
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,339
But now you're asking who I was with

532
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,341
and asking if I took them home.

533
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,468
That's…

534
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,387
making my heart race.

535
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,558
Dream on.

536
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,478
I do not care at all
about Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

537
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,479
Wash up and sleep.

538
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:24,440
I like it. Give me some attention.

539
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,358
Stop it. You need to wash up.

540
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:28,944
-Goodnight.
-Okay.

541
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,201
-Actually, honey.
-Yes?

542
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,122
-Do you usually have…
-Yes?

543
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:43,959
other people in your car
besides you and Woo-jae?

544
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,002
Other people?

545
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,087
Yes.

546
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,589
Well, I guess so.

547
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:53,093
Other than Mr. Jang,
I usually take Ms. Kim

548
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,680
to the district offices
or to events outside of the office.

549
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,891
I see, Ms. Kim too?

550
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,309
Yes, usually.

551
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:04,438
Pretty much everyone from the office.
Ko Min-seok, Choi Ja-young, everyone.

552
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,982
-Why do you ask?
-What?

553
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,026
It's nothing.

554
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:11,111
You must be tired. Go wash up.

555
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:14,114
-Okay, goodnight.
-Goodnight.

556
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,791
My heart's still racing.

557
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,170
What is wrong with you?

558
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,053
I must have been mad.

559
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:35,547
Oh, right.

560
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,508
Are you still in touch
with anybody in Youngsan?

561
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:39,927
-Youngsan?
-Yes.

562
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:41,929
Why all of a sudden?

563
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:45,557
I've been doing something
and Youngsan came up.

564
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,102
It's your hometown,
so I was wondering if you knew anyone.

565
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:49,770
I see.

566
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,773
I've been away for so long,

567
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,359
so I've lost touch with friends
from the children's home or school.

568
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,570
That's what I thought.
I was asking just in case.

569
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,905
-Sure.
-I'll go now.

570
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,240
-Take this.
-Right.

571
00:45:03,659 --> 00:45:05,994
-Have a great day.
-You too.

572
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,037
Thanks.

573
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,106
NAM JOONG-DO, YOUNGSAN

574
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,984
KANG'S IN-LAW SUSPECTED OF
LAND SPECULATION IN YOUNGSAN

575
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,363
NAM'S PRESS CONFERENCE
ON SPECULATION CONTROVERSY

576
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,325
"Lee"?

577
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,245
Lee…

578
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,875
I can't think of anyone.

579
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,447
Assemblyman Kang.

580
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,032
Yes?

581
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,618
Oh, Yoo-sin.

582
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,536
Hello, Soon-hong.

583
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,456
That assemblyman's secretary or whatever

584
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:34,791
came down to stir things up.

585
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,877
I mean, that's all fine.

586
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:42,716
But she keeps snooping around
and harassing these busy people.

587
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:44,384
Yes, right.

588
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:47,513
So I told them to warn her
that they'll report her

589
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:51,016
for obstruction of business
if she ever visits them again…

590
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:51,934
What?

591
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:55,562
It's not like you did anything illegal.

592
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,858
Your late mother told you
to buy some land in a dream,

593
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,568
so you bought some.

594
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,488
And it just happened
to become a development site.

595
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:10,160
Yes, there's nothing to worry about.

596
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,787
Okay, Soon-hong.

597
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:14,122
Goodbye, then.

598
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:15,290
Okay.

599
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,709
Darn it.

600
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,878
What did he say?

601
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:24,341
He told me not to worry
since it was just a baseless accusation.

602
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,970
It's easy for him to say
when he's all the way in Yeouido.

603
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,888
Good grief.

604
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm so annoyed about that secretary
snooping around the neighborhood.

605
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,311
Goodness.

606
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,731
Just because I have family in Yeouido,

607
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,317
they're coming all the way down
to this rural town

608
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,070
to dig up dirt on me
just for buying some land

609
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:47,239
when I'm just a hard-working woman.

610
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:51,326
This is a serious case of defamation
and a violation of my human rights.

611
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,619
What's going on?

612
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,164
I just managed to fall asleep
because of my jet lag.

613
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:00,544
What's going on?

614
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,296
Is something wrong?

615
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,006
It's none of your concern.

616
00:48:05,382 --> 00:48:07,759
Soon-hong is right.

617
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:11,346
They don't have the money
or the connections for investment

618
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,640
and call it speculation
because they're jealous.

619
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,726
Good grief, this is unbelievable.

620
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,521
-Ki-young.
-Yes?

621
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,024
You need to silence that assemblyman.

622
00:48:22,608 --> 00:48:25,652
Say we'll report him for spreading
false information and defamation.

623
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:32,993
Why haven't you done
anything to prevent this?

624
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,953
Why are you yelling at Ki-young?

625
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:38,248
Why do you think?
He can't even do his job right.

626
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:39,958
You're late. Let's go.

627
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,295
You aren't late!

628
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,047
She's always siding with him.

629
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,050
Yes, I see.

630
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:51,428
Then please send me a photo
of that secretary's business card.

631
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,431
Okay, thank you.

632
00:48:56,558 --> 00:49:00,604
-Is he an assemblyman around here?
-No, in Seoul. He's with the Daehan Party.

633
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:02,564
I see, the Daehan Party.

634
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,733
Your mom bought that land

635
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,487
because Uncle Soon-hong told her
that it'll be developed soon.

636
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:10,739
It was announced soon after,

637
00:49:10,822 --> 00:49:13,075
and the land tripled in value
over six months.

638
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:16,703
So what do we do now?

639
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,291
What do you mean?
She told me to take care of it.

640
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,502
And how will you do that?

641
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,504
Don't get yourself involved.
Just stay put.

642
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:28,090
How will staying put get anything done?

643
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:33,428
Ki-young, I know that
this is tough for you,

644
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:36,306
but you know why my mom
is so obsessed with real estate.

645
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,934
-I know it's tough, but--
-Seung-hee.

646
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:44,147
I'll do whatever I can
to figure out this issue.

647
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,107
But…

648
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,234
I can't keep doing this.

649
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:52,030
-Ki-young.
-Living here

650
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,740
is just too much for me.

651
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:55,450
I'm not happy here.

652
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,930
CERTIFICATE OF ADMISSION
SCHOOL OF LAW, JIN SEUNG-HO

653
00:50:22,894 --> 00:50:23,895
What?

654
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,900
What's wrong?

655
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:33,238
What is it?

656
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:36,908
Mom.

657
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,870
Can you put a photo of me here too?

658
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,538
As if.

659
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,378
Hey, give that back.

660
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:50,172
-What's wrong with you?
-It's been over 20 years.

661
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:52,007
How long are you going to keep this up?

662
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,842
You've never lost a child!

663
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:57,971
Twenty years feels like a day
and a billion years at the same time!

664
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,160
My goodness…

665
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:26,625
Seung-ho isn't your only child.

666
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,668
I'm your child too.

667
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,508
Oh, no.

668
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,967
No…

669
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,261
What is it?

670
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,066
It's nothing.

671
00:52:08,124 --> 00:52:10,043
Living here

672
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,753
is just too much for me.

673
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,296
I'm not happy here.

674
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,804
Seung-ho…

675
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:33,191
Seung-ho.

676
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,319
I'm sorry, Seung-ho.

677
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,196
Mommy is sorry.

678
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:46,288
I'm sorry, Seung-ho.

679
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:54,129
Mommy is sorry.

680
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,592
…that Korea is no longer drug-free

681
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,595
-is seemingly proving to be true recently.
-Yes.

682
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:05,223
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party recently lost his son.

683
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,558
When the body was found,

684
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,436
they found that he was in possession
of methamphetamine.

685
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,356
Yes, one gram of methamphetamine
was found in his pocket.

686
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,902
A gram of methamphetamine is…
Have you seen an insulin syringe?

687
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:19,821
-Yes.
-It's enough to fill one syringe.

688
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,907
-Kim Jae-eun?
-Usually, methamphetamine

689
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,825
is considered a very hard drug.

690
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,201
It's your fault.

691
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:27,454
It's all your fault!

692
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,749
As you can see from this case,

693
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,001
it's no longer just marijuana.

694
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,544
Methamphetamine abuse

695
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,838
has been on an exponential rise.

696
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,508
-My poor son…
-Where did things start to go wrong?

697

JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

698
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,564
Come in.

699

Soo-bin.

700
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,944
Are you going to work?

701
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,362
No.

702
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:43,613
Soo-bin.

703
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,532
Let's go see Ji-hoon.

704
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,327
-Let's get on with our meeting.
-Okay.

705
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,870
INCOMING CALL

706
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,249
Excuse me.

707
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,585
-Kim Bit-na speaking.
-Can you hand out the copies?

708
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:58,545
Here.

709
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:00,171
Sorry?

710
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,340
Yes, hello.

00:55:14,227 --> 00:55:17,605
This bill proposed and represented
by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do

714
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,275
is framing innocent people
as potential economic criminals

715
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:24,112
just for having politicians
in their families.

716
00:55:26,031 --> 00:55:30,618
First, you make accusations about me
and my family without any evidence.

717
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,747
And now this?

718
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:38,084
What's lacking is your conscience,
not the evidence.

719
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:41,046
Watch yourself, Assemblyman Nam!

720
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:44,215
Were you really unaware that
your sister-in-law bought land last year

721
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,635
that was recently announced
for development by the MOLIT?

722
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,972
Assemblyman Nam.

723
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:53,808
Do you know every little economic activity

724
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,519
conducted by every single relative?

725
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,730
I would say a sister-in-law
is close family.

726
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:03,735
In that case,
you must have been well aware

727
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:06,488
of your son's economic activities

728
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,617
since he's your direct family.

729
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,787
I'm talking about the meth!

730
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,587
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong.

731
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,006
You've crossed the line.

732
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,132
How so?

733
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:29,260
This is just a fact supported by evidence!

734
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,807
Marijuana would be bad enough, but meth?

735
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,434
He was a junkie.

736
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,103
Watch your words!

737
00:56:38,603 --> 00:56:40,480
Assemblymen,

738
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:42,690
please refrain from digressing--

739
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,734
What I'm saying is,

740
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:51,282
don't try to pass a bill like this
and insult politicians and their families!

741
00:57:05,588 --> 00:57:08,633
Since there isn't anyone
that can continue the debate in his place,

742
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,385
we have to move on to the voting.

743
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,637
But since Assemblyman Kang
has left the room,

744
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,682
we don't have a quorum
for a vote at the moment.

745
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,518
Therefore, we'll have to take a vote

746
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,271
on another day when the situation allows.

747
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,067
Next bill.

748
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:29,779
I'd like to present agendas from 78 to 91

749
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,324
in the remit of
the Health and Welfare Committee

750
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,660
under a single discussion.

751
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,787
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

752
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:41,416
Lee's son-in-law in Youngsan
has reached out to Ms. Kim.

753
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,712
He wants to talk in person,
so he's on his way to Seoul.

754
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,673
-I'll meet him.
-Agenda 80.

755
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:51,050
Framework Act on Social Security.

756
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,552
The amendments made are…

757
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:57,390
NAM JOONG-DO, YOUNGSAN

758
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,354
KANG CLAIMS THERE IS NO GROUNDS
TO IN-LAW'S SPECULATION CONTROVERSY

759
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:09,194
DEATH OF NAM JOONG-DO'S SON
SLOWS DOWN INVESTIGATION ON KANG

760
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,116
KANG DISMISSED NAM'S COMMENTS
TO "HAVE NO GROUNDS"

761
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,584
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM AND HIS WIFE, KIM,
AT THE WAKE

762
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,810
I'll be outside, Soo-bin.

763
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,354
Make sure to lock up behind you.

764
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,064
Mr. Choi Ki-young?

765
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,108
Hello.

766
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,027
I'm Nam Joong-do.

767
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:56,699
Hi.

768
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,162
Long time no see.

769
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,291
KIM JAE-EUN

770
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,209
Kim Jae-eun.

771
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:09,337
Or should I say…

772
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:11,589
Kim Hye-joo?

773
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,966
Nice to meet you.

774
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,185
You murderer.

775
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:58,928
TROLLEY

776
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,096
She swallowed some pills.

777
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,306
Come to Youngsan.

778
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,558
-We should continue our little chat.
-Youngsan?

779
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:05,893
Don't come into my room
without permission.

780
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:09,397
When a quiet person causes a problem,
it tends to be a huge one.

781
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,857
Has it spread widely?

782
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:12,525
It won't be easy.

783
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,902
I'm worried about her husband.
He's a politician.

784
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,196
You're an assemblyman
with an election coming up.

785
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,324
You have to stay professional.

786
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:24,287
