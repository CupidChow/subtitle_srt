1
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,480
She's here.

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:04,397
Ms. Kim Hye-joo.

3
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,566
Did you really kill someone 20 years ago?

4
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,109
-Tell us!
-Please answer us.

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:10,487
-Is this true?
-Were you involved in someone's death?

6
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,364
Kim Jae-eun.

7
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:14,949
Yes?

8
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,997
You killed him. You murderer.

9
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,334
Get out of here.
How dare you show up here?

10
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:27,378
Get out. Get out of here now!

11
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,631
My child died because of you.

12
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,428
Murderer.

13
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,162
THE NIGHTMARE

14
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:25,770
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

15
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:28,982
Goodness.

16
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,234
-Hello.
-Hi, Ms. Kim.

17
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,073
-Go ahead and order.
-Okay.

18
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,534
-Thank you, ma'am.
-You're welcome.

19
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,661
We'll have six cups
of hot americano to go.

20
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,288
Okay, six cups of americano.

21
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,082
Can you change one of them
to a non-coffee drink?

22
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,376
My husband doesn't drink coffee.

23
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,754
He actually does these days.

24
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,215
Really?

25
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:55,592
Then forget about that.

26
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,219
No. Please change one of them to tea.

27
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,430
-Five coffees and one tea.
-Sure.

28
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,686
So what we were doing was…

29
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:08,980
You know the mill lady, right?

30
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:10,273
Of course you do.

31
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:12,567
We were just visiting her
regarding the bill.

32
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,694
Assemblyman Nam is
coming to the district office

33
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:17,155
after attending the hearing
at the Sinyang-gu office.

34
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,657
I see.

35
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,413
And…

36
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,874
Things must have been hard for you.

37
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,918
Sorry?

38
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,794
Right.

39
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,463
About that…

40
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,926
I never got to thank you
for helping out with my son's funeral.

41
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:38,968
Thank you so much.

42
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:42,513
No, Ms. Kim. I was talking
about the incident in Youngsan.

43
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,975
The suicide.

44
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:49,854
Right.

45
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,982
Thank you for making such a big decision.

46
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,111
Senior Secretary Kim Bit-na

47
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:00,573
spent all afternoon yesterday
writing up your statement.

48
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,826
She really put her heart and soul into it.

49
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,371
I see. Thank you.

50
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,793
Wait, did you say yesterday afternoon?

51
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,378
Yes.

52
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,754
Yesterday afternoon.

53
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:19,300
Let's disclose it
before Assemblyman Kang does.

54
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,223
Will Ms. Kim be okay with that?

55
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,433
This will cause a huge stir.

56
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:30,436
She had seen this coming
and previously agreed.

57
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,147
We've just been waiting
for the right time.

58
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,234
Please write up a statement.

59
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,656
I won't publicize your story

60
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,076
until you give your consent.

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,334
We will do our absolute best.

62
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:55,545
Yes. We'll work hard.

63
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,089
Thank you.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,093
Honey.

65
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,845
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

66
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,347
I heard you were here.

67
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,935
I'll bring the drinks.

68
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,146
Let me help you.

69
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,024
Were you out buying paper?

70
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,900
Yes.

71
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,906
-Honey.
-Yes?

72
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,660
They just told me something.

73
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,747
The decision to disclose
the Youngsan incident…

74
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,876
Did you already make up your mind
yesterday afternoon

75
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,919
before asking me about it last night?

76
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,677
Is that true?

77
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,557
Yes, it is.

78
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,316
You two go ahead.

79
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,318
-I'll stay here for a bit.
-Okay.

80
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,486
Thank you for the drinks.

81
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:04,822
Right. Here's your tea, sir.

82
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,032
Thank you.

83
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,575
We'll be going then.

84
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,798
I'll be honest.

85
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,549
It's true.

86
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,802
I had already made up my mind.

87
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,056
Like I told you yesterday,

88
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,517
Assemblyman Kang agreed
to keep it a secret,

89
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,813
but it's a matter of time
before Ms. Jin or her mother discloses it.

90
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,733
Even if you're innocent,

91
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,194
you'll still be dragged through the mud.

92
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:47,615
That's why I wanted to get a head start.

93
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:52,328
We were just preparing in advance.
That's all.

94
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,586
"That's all"?

95
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,507
How could you say that?

96
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,801
You should've asked me first.

97
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,177
I did ask you.

98
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,055
Sure, but it was after you had
already made up your mind.

99
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,015
If it was already decided,

100
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,310
why did you even bother
to ask for my permission?

101
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,107
What if I said no?

102
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,319
Would you have still gone through with it?

103
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,487
No.

104
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,657
I could have if I had wanted to,

105
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,953
but I asked you because I respect you.

106
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,833
I thought you were going
to give me your permission.

107
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:53,598
I don't even know what to say right now.

108
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,270
Do you even know
how difficult it was for me

109
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,065
to make that decision yesterday?

110
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,194
I'm sorry.

111
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,488
It was wrong of me.

112
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,242
I don't know when they'd make a move,
so I wanted to be ready.

113
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,913
And I got ahead of myself.

114
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,748
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,578
Hello, sir.

116
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,747
-Hello.
-Hello.

117
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,415
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

118
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,419
You're glowing after being on a date.

119
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,296
Does it show?

120
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,551
I have a tight schedule today.
Shall we begin?

121
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,219
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

122
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,471
Sir, would you like some tea?

123
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,390
I'll have a cup of coffee, please.

124
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:32,822
What?

125
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,282
What did you say, Soon-hong?

126
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,450
He mentioned Mr. Park?

127
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,578
I'm telling you.

128
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,164
Mr. Park of Yangcheon-ri, Youngsan,
is great at his job.

129
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,586
How does he know him?

130
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,838
How would I know that?

131
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,965
What should we do?

132
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:55,511
I'll take care of this,

133
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,055
so you should lie low.

134
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,974
Lying low won't resolve this.

135
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,977
What if we end up in big trouble?

136
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,354
If this blows up,

137
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,941
I'll be the one
in the biggest trouble, not you.

138
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,985
The general election is around the corner.

139
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,987
I'll be in trouble too.

140
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:15,698
I trusted that you'd take care of this,

141
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,867
but you're telling me
that he knows Mr. Park.

142
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,537
Then we should meet up
and come up with a plan.

143
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:25,583
How are you going to keep
that assemblyman's mouth shut?

144
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,045
Just stay out of it!
You don't know anything.

145
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,381
Don't you know

146
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,469
that Nam Joong-do's wife
was the one who killed Seung-ho?

147
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:39,347
Soon-hong.

148
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,265
What did you--

149
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,225
Nam Joong-do's wife is the one

150
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,729
who's responsible for Seung-ho's death.

151
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,608
Do you mean

152
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,735
Kim Jae-eun?

153
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,257
Hello, is this Ji-hoon's uncle?

154
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,050
I'm Ji-hoon's…

155
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,847
Yes.

156
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:04,682
Have you been well?

157
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:06,350
Is your mother doing well?

158
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,314
I'd like to send you a parcel,

159
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:16,944
and I want to make sure
I have the right address.

160
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,282
JICHEONG-DONG POST OFFICE

161
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,022
He went to the Seoul headquarters?

162
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,315
Yes.

163
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,941
Were you supposed to meet him?

164
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,028
No, I just stopped by.

165
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,821
We filled out the form.

166
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,823
One minute, please.

167
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,200
Thank you.

168
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,785
Then let me introduce our facilities.

169
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,995
This way, please.

170
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,916
Hello, I'm interested
in taking some golf lessons.

171
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,375
I see.

172
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:16,170
Then let me show them around.

173
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,379
-This way.
-Let's go.

174
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:18,797
Let's go.

175
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,555
Our system lets you
immediately monitor your swings.

176
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,016
You can also practice putting
in an environment

177
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,768
similar to a real golf course.

178
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:33,646
We have plenty of slots
so you can come in anytime

179
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,606
for practice or lessons.

180
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,750
Hey, Ki-young.

181
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,793
Hey, Hye-joo.

182
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,545
Have you been well?

183
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,880
I'm on my way to Seoul.

184
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,049
Can you make

185
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,885
some time for me?

186
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,220
Right now?

187
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,099
Sure.

188
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:21,277
I'm off to the district office.

189
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,613
You're meeting Mr. Choi there, right?

190
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:26,907
Yes.

191
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,119
If we meet here,
Assemblyman Kang might see us.

192
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:31,871
Right.

193
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:36,959
You know,

194
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,128
to be honest.

195
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,590
I'm a bit concerned about Mr. Choi.

196
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,300
Why?

197
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,218
He's definitely doing the right thing

198
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,762
by handing us the evidence
for the land speculation.

199
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,143
But in a way, he's betraying
his wife and her family.

200
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,687
Think about it.
Once Ms. Jin finds out about this,

201
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,898
she'll feel extremely betrayed.

202
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,776
Seeing how Mr. Choi asked us
to keep this a secret,

203
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,778
I don't think he wants a divorce.

204
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,365
If I imagine this happened
between me and my husband,

205
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,911
I would feel uneasy about it
even if it's the right thing to do.

206
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:17,416
There's no perfect secret
that can be kept forever.

207
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,502
I'm sure there is.

208
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:22,922
Sorry?

209
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,760
This "perfect secret"
you're talking about.

210
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,013
I'm sure there is one.

211
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,222
Of course.

212
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,393
We'll keep Mr. Choi's secret at all costs.

213
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,104
Right.

214
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,649
-I'll be off then.
-Okay.

215
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:42,816
See you later.

216
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,161
I'm sorry.

217
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,540
About Seung-ho…

218
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,628
Could you apologize to them?

219
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,508
You may not have done anything wrong,

220
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:11,720
but you understand the pain
of losing a family member.

221
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,558
I realized what I said that day

222
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,727
must have hurt you deeply.

223
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:20,646
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,027
Seung-hee means so much to me,

225
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,905
and I was being emotional.

226
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:35,536
I actually only decided
to help your husband

227
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,705
for her sake.

228
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,416
I want her

229
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,461
to see her mother for who she truly is.

230
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:48,549
I think it would be best for her.

231
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,343
That's why I decided to do this.

232
00:16:56,515 --> 00:17:00,561
But wouldn't she feel hurt
if she ever finds out?

233
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,148
Probably.

234
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,986
But I had no choice.

235
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,071
I'm worn out,

236
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,033
but she's even more exhausted than me.

237
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:16,910
I want Seung-hee

238
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,788
to break free from her mother's grip

239
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,083
and find happiness.

240
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,213
That's why I took a risk.

241
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,300
By the time this is over,

242
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,343
she'll have changed in one way or another.

243
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,555
Whichever way that may be,

244
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,892
she'll be better off.

245
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,190
I trust you.

246
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,985
Everything will work out, Ki-young.

247
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,156
Thanks.

248
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,997
I mean…

249
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,586
Why aren't there any real estate agencies?

250
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,755
I need to ask for directions.

251
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,176
Drive safely.

252
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,511
-Okay.
-Bye.

253
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,058
What?

254
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,352
This all just

255
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,604
brings back some memories.

256
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,690
I really liked you back then.

257
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,113
Actually, I liked you too.

258
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:36,532
Wait,

259
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,492
so why did you turn me down?

260
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,328
Because of Seung-hee.

261
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,540
She was head over heels for you.

262
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,666
Right.

263
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,626
She really was.

264
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,214
Wait.

265
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,383
Why is he here?

266
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,853
What is he doing here?

267
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:12,109
Kim Jae-eun.

268
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:14,987
Right.

269
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,823
Thank you for helping my husband

270
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,243
expose the Youngsan land speculation.

271
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,495
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you.

272
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:24,705
Hey!

273
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,416
-Ms. Lee.
-You!

274
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,838
Are you the one who ratted out
Mr. Park to Nam Joong-do?

275
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:37,843
How could you stab me
in the back like this?

276
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:39,344
After all I've done for you?

277
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,015
You.

278
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,975
Kim Jae-eun.

279
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,979
-Ms. Lee, please don't do this.
-Hey!

280
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,648
Did you think you could
hide from me forever

281
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,234
after killing my son?

282
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,444
You bitch!

283
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,737
Please stop.

284
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:01,992
How could you side with her and betray me?

285
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,076
It's not like that.

286
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,704
You're lying through your teeth!
I heard everything!

287
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,748
Hye-joo, go inside right now. Go.

288
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,753
Were you excited to screw me over

289
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,297
with the girl who killed my son?

290
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,840
I said it wasn't like that!

291
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,389
Mark my words.

292
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,142
I won't let you two

293
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,729
get away with this.

294
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,707
Hye-joo, I'm sorry. I should go.

295
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,380
Where is it?

296
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:40,549
Mom, I'm home.

297
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,263
Mom…

298
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,974
Where did she go?

299
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,021
-Hey, Mom. Where are--
-Seung-hee.

300
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,814
Get a divorce this instant--

301
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,898
Hello?

302
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:58,400
Mom.

303
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,735
Mom!

304
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:11,538
Ms. Lee.

305
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,468
Hey.

306
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,556
Give me back my phone.

307
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:30,474
Soo-bin.

308
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,434
What's the hurry?

309
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,644
We haven't seen each other in ages.

310
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,564
Please. Give me back my phone.

311
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,027
Fine.

312
00:22:43,653 --> 00:22:45,489
Did you bring the money?

313
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,032
After I get my phone back.

314
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,371
All right.

315
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:57,959
Here. Take it.

316
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,087
Thanks.

317
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,717
Is there something important
on that phone?

318
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,763
You could have gotten
a new one with a million won.

319
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,016
I'm used to my old phone.

320
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,560
SEND

321
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,520
1,000,000 WON SENT

322
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,271
I sent it.

323
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,982
1,000,000 WON RECEIVED

324
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:21,900
Thanks.

325
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,112
Right.

326
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,115
I met Ji-hoon's mom.

327
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,871
Ji-hoon's mom?

328
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:35,914
How?

329
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,166
Well…

330
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,086

332
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:46,800
Soo-bin, this is Ji-hoon's mom.

333
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,052
Please call me when you see this.

334
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,888

LEAVE CHATROOM

336
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,603
I got a call from an unknown number.

337
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,481
So I picked up, thinking it was you.

338
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,109
But it was Ji-hoon's mom.

339
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,945
By the way,

340
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,282
I heard you stayed at Ji-hoon's place.

341
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,244
Why there?

342
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,205
Were you even that close?

343
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,543
You didn't tell him
that I was pregnant, did you?

344
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,628
What am I, crazy?

345
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,089
It's nothing to be proud of.

346
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,805
His family is rich.

347
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,975
His dad is a reputable assemblyman.

348
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,643
That's why I went there.

349
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,564
I thought I could
get something out of them.

350
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,113
So?

351
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,531
Were you able to?

352
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,285
No.

353
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,662
They barely have any money.

354
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,748
Right?

355
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,170
Anyway, she seemed quite upset

356
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,589
that you disappeared without saying a word

357
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,050
after she cared for you out of pity.

358
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,886
Don't worry.

359
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,555
I didn't tell her that we were in touch.

360
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,642
But then again,
she didn't seem interested.

361
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,311
Did she

362
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,605
really say that?

363
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,106
Yes.

364
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,525
Her husband is an assemblyman after all.

365
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,361
Why do you think she treated you well?

366
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,697
She was using you
to improve her husband's image.

367
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,366
The election is around the corner.

368
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,955
Right. Here.

369
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,917
She asked me to give it to you.

370
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,670
It's the stuff you left.

371
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:48,880
Wait.

372
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,134
Soo-bin left this at our place.

373
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,178
If you see her,
could you return it to her?

374
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,180
She probably needs it.

375
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:58,890
Okay.

376
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,769
Thank you.

377
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,984
She didn't want you
to come back to pick it up.

378
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,780
I guess she doesn't want
to see you ever again.

379
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,503
CONTACTS
HUSBAND

380
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,300
The person you are trying to reach is…

381
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,176
CHOI KI-YOUNG (YOUNGSAN)

382
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,303
He's not picking up.

383
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,933
CHOI KI-YOUNG (YOUNGSAN)

384
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:48,231
Shall we go?

385
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,399
Yes, sir.

386
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,364
HYE-JOO

387
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,493
Is it him?

388
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,828
What? No.

389
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,290
HYE-JOO

390
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,876
Hi, honey.

391
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,756
You met Ms. Lee Yoo-sin?

392
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:14,966
When?

393
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:15,884
Just now.

394
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,012
She knows that I'm your wife

395
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,890
and that you're meeting with Ki-young.

396
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,186
I called to warn you

397
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,105
in case this could cause a problem.

398
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,776
I see.

399
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,029
You must've been scared.

400
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,702
I'm okay.

401
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,662
I'll take care of this.

402
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,081
Don't worry.

403
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:47,916
You trust me, right?

404
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:50,835
Yes.

405
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,879
Where are you?

406
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,590
In that case, get yourself home.

407
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,385
Call me right away if she comes again.

408
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,470
Okay.

409
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,889
Also,

410
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,642
about earlier…

411
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,354
I'm sorry.

412
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,441
Go home.

413
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,193
Bye.

414
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:22,158
Lee Yoo-sin found out about everything.

415
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:23,743
Not a problem.

416
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,580
We can speed things up.

417
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:05,201
Thank you.

418
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,289
That one's for you.

419
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,250
No, thanks.

420
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,210
You can drink mine.

421
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,962
What?

422
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,548
Do you think I drugged it?

423
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,808
Hey.

424
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,274
Come on, I'm not that low.

425
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,943
It's safe. Drink up.

426
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,240
Cheers.

427
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,925
Hey.

428
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:02,884
Yes?

429
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,012
Let's break up.

430
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,140
Okay.

431
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,689

00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,116
Goodness.

434
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,326
Hello.

435
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:31,871
Hello.

436
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:32,914
AHN PSYCHIATRIC CLINIC

437
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,835
I didn't recognize you the other day.

438
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,504
It had been so long.

439
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,964
Ms. Kim Soo-bin.

440
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,049
You must have been very worried.

441
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:45,677
The girl had such severe stomach pain.

442
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:50,598
Look.

443
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,853
Like I asked you that day,

444
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,647
please keep that day's visit

445
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:01,317
a secret between us.

446
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,321
Yes, of course.

447
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,907
Thank you.

448
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,083
Hello.

449
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,543
So…

450
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,546
Is there any way you could
speed up selling my restaurant?

451
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,758
I'd really appreciate it.

452
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,011
Okay.

453
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,096
Goodbye.

454
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,820
Did she get an abortion?

455
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,198
Well…

456
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,159
It's better safe than sorry.

457
00:32:39,832 --> 00:32:40,875
Hey, Ye-eun.

458
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,878
Can you do me a favor?

459
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,676
Hey, it's the lady from TV!

460
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,845
My parents always curse at her.

461
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,473
Hey.

462
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,188
What do your parents say about me?

463
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:05,650
They say you're greedy
and that you get nothing done.

464
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,488
My sister and I were
fighting over food the other day

465
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,031
and knocked over our bowls.

466
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,449
Ever since then,

467
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:16,160
my mom gives us food on separate trays.

468
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,747
You should stop being greedy
and use a tray instead.

469
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,544
Okay.

470
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:27,380
I'm sorry.

471
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,048
Excuse us.

472
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,508
Let's go.

473
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,676
Follow me.

474
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,605
LEGISLATION AND JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
MEETING ROOM

475
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,940
You have to follow the law!

476
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,316
What is the meaning of this?

477
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,444
-Sir.
-What do you think this committee is?

478
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,528
-I agree.
-Sir.

479
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,280
-Please let us speak!
-Attention.

480
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,574
-Sir!
-Attention!

481
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:57,744
I ask the members of the committee

482
00:33:57,827 --> 00:34:01,122
to raise their hands
and ask for the right to speak

483
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,832
before taking the floor.

484
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,293
I request your cooperation
during this meeting.

485
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,878
Sir.

486
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:10,423
I just find this completely ridiculous.

487
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:13,301
-Ridiculous? How could you say that?
-Wait!

488
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:14,761
-Once again…
-That's enough!

489
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:16,512
-I'd like to…
-Good grief.

490
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,097
ask all of you

491
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:21,059
to cooperate with me here.

492
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,978
Keep your mouth shut, Lee Soo-min!

493
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,564
Show some respect!

494
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,400
Assemblyman Kang.

495
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,360
You owe her an apology.

496
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,321
I apologize.

497
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,198
Unbelievable.

498
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,866
Sir.

499
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,451
We are against this.

500
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,829
Assemblyman Kang.

501
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,416
If you have questions about the bill,

502
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,418
discuss it with us and ask questions.

503
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:51,130
Stop picking a fight
with the Daehan Party.

504
00:34:52,757 --> 00:34:54,092
"Picking a fight"?

505
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:55,676
Goodness.

506
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,221
You failed to convince us.

507
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:01,057
You should admit to your faults.

508
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,475
Good grief.

509
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,727
How could you accuse me
of picking a fight?

510
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,729
My goodness.

511
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,608
-It would be easier to talk to my dog.
-I agree.

512
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,819
Did you just compare me to a dog?

513
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,330
Dear Assemblyman Kang.

514
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,833
This is the National Assembly.

515
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,670
The language you use
when you're drinking at a bar

516
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:33,089
has no place here
in the National Assembly.

517
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,094
You should know better.

518
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:45,726
Please apologize for your remark.

519
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,237
I apologize.

520
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,123
How may I help you?

521
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,959
I want to get my card reissued.

522
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,878
Sure.

523
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,968
Would you like the receipt?

524
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,345
BALANCE: 1.3 MILLION WON

525
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,555
I have 1.3 million?

526
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,933
I need two million won.

527
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,019
Tell me your account number.

BACK

531
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,449
What's going on?

532
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:47,246
Why would I give you money
when you crashed into my car?

533
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,497
Do you not want to?

534
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,918
Should I call in some reporters then?

535
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,629
And tell them about your call girls?

536
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,841
Fine.

537
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,969
-Give me your account number.
-Now we're talking.

538
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,599
-Kim Soo-bin.
-What?

539
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,229
Have it wired to your account.

540
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,522
-To mine?
-Yes.

541
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,524
-Cheers!
-Drink up!

542
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,944
Hey, careful.

543
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,320
You're spilling it.

544
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,572
Soo-bin, give me your debit card.

545
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:24,408
-My card?
-Yes.

546
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,118
I want to withdraw the cash.

547
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,957
Someone's been busy.

Mom!

551
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:55,356
Mom, are you okay?

552
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:58,359
Did she get a CT scan?

553
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,111
Isn't a cerebral contusion dangerous?

554
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,779
What did they say? Does she need surgery?

555
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,198
No. Thankfully,
the injuries aren't serious.

556
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,742
She just needs to stay here
and rest up for a few days.

557
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,246
They said she'll be awake soon,
so don't worry.

558
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,123
Thank goodness.

559
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,043
I just don't get it.

560
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,712
She can't even drive.

561
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,046
Why would she drive to Seoul?

562
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,593
If something happens to her as well,

563
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,429
I won't be able to go on.

564
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,309
With Dad and Seung-ho gone,

565
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,269
she's the only family I have left.

566
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,023
Don't cry.

567
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,233
She'll be fine.

568
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,693
It's okay.

569
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,362
It's okay.

570
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:55,541
We have now reviewed
all the items on the agenda.

571
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,376
Thank you, everyone.

572
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,879
This meeting is dismissed.

573
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,799
-Good work.
-Good work.

574
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,259
Good work.

575
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,224
-Good work.
-Let's go.

576
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,855
Sir, your car is out front.

577
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,398
-Assemblyman Nam.
-Okay.

578
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,444
Can we talk over tea
or a meal sometime soon?

579
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,653
Sure.

580
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,572
By the way,

581
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,241
about the criminal law amendment
you're planning to propose…

582
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,660
-Yes?
-I also signed the motion,

583
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,955
but it's not likely to pass
the committee's review.

584
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,124
You have a plan, right?

585
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,959
Yes, I'm preparing one.

586
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,962
Are you going to bring it up
at our next meeting?

587
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,506
Probably.

588
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,675
-I'll be in touch with you…
-Hyeong-tae.

589
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,052
Yes, sir.

590
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:52,139
Look into this new bill
that Nam Joong-do is planning to propose.

591
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,391
Yes, sir.

592
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,363
I just don't understand Assemblyman Kang.

593
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:14,328
What?

594
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,041
Considering that you're proposing
the bill at the next meeting,

595
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:22,002
perhaps you should have held back today.

596
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,465
That would have been ideal.

597
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,220
But I tried to speak as gently as I could.

598
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:38,227
Seeing how Choi Ki-young
still hasn't gotten back to me--

599
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,688
CHOI KI-YOUNG (YOUNGSAN)

600
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,900
Speak of the devil.

601
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:47,945
Hello, Mr. Choi.

602
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,447
Hello, sir.

603
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,657
We were supposed to meet today.

604
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,367
I'm sorry I couldn't call sooner.

605
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,744
Something came up.

606
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,082
I heard you and your mother-in-law
met my wife today.

607
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,376
Yes.

608
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,669
That's why I'm calling.

609
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,422
I'm having second thoughts

610
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,384
about handing over the evidence.

611
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,224
May I ask what changed your mind?

612
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:23,272
My mother-in-law had a car accident
after seeing Hye-joo.

613
00:41:26,692 --> 00:41:28,736
Please don't tell Hye-joo…

614
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,654
I mean, your wife about this.

615
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,240
I'm sure she's already quite shaken up.

616
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,161
I understand.

617
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,913
I hope Ms. Lee gets better soon.

618
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,081
I'll call you again.

619
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,917
Okay. Thank you.

620
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:49,465
He's not going to hand it over.

621
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,968
One minute, sir.

622
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,313
Hello, Reporter Gil Na-hui.

623
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:06,607
Sorry for calling so late.
Have you been well?

624
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,943
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

625
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:13,781
Don't you have a correspondent
at the Sinyang Police Station?

626
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,202
There was a car accident today
in Jicheong-dong, Sinyang-gu.

627
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,372
I'd like to know
where the victim is hospitalized.

628
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,262
Were you on the phone with Ms. Kim?

629
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,304
Yes.

630
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,141
She said don't worry about work
and take good care of Ms. Lee.

631
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,102
I see.

632
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:47,565
I'm so glad you got here early.

633
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,234
You must have come here
straight from the headquarters.

634
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,111
Thank you.

635
00:42:53,696 --> 00:42:54,822
Sure.

636
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:08,252
Mr. Choi is having second thoughts
about handing over the evidence.

637
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,504
Then what should we do?

638
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,965
Seung-hee's mother knows who I am.

639
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,093
Let's go on TV.

640
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:18,095
TV?

641
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,139
Let's go on TV
and tell everyone what happened.

642
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,226
No way.

643
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,687
I can't do that.

644
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,231
We have no time.

645
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:33,360
TV is the most effective platform
to disclose what happened.

646
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,156
But whatever I say will sound less sincere

647
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,867
if you're not there with me.

648
00:43:40,492 --> 00:43:42,244
After all, I'm still a third party.

649
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,873
Since there was no investigation,

650
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:49,585
there's no proof that you didn't lie.

651
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:52,796
In order for the public to believe us,

652
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,257
you have to be there yourself.

653
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,931
I'll be right by your side.

654
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,185
So don't be too scared.

655
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,025
I'm sorry, honey.

656
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,693
I can't do it.

657
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,613
-Honey--
-I can't!

658
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:20,532
I'm too scared.

659
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:23,911
I'm scared of what might happen
after the incident comes to light.

660
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:27,706
And you want me to talk about it on TV?

661
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,500
Honey.

662
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,960
I really can't do that.

663
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,549
Can't you just issue a press release?

664
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:38,634
As I said,

665
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,638
we must show our sincerity
since we have no solid proof.

666
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,557
And to do that,
you need to appear in public.

667
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,398
Don't tell me

668
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,486
you already made up your mind again
before asking me to do this.

669
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,951
-Did you really?
-Hye-joo.

670
00:45:04,034 --> 00:45:06,703
You didn't mention anything
about going on TV yesterday!

671
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:08,747
Things suddenly took a turn today.

672
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:12,584
I didn't plan for this.

673
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:13,961
Don't fight.

674
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:17,840
Yoon-seo.

675
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:21,385
Why do you guys keep fighting these days?

676
00:45:23,011 --> 00:45:25,848
Yoon-seo, we weren't fighting.

677
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:31,353
Honey.

678
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,968
You should go on TV.

679
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,513
What happened back then

680
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,057
wasn't your fault.

681
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,144
So go on TV

682
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,313
and speak up for yourself.

683
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,065
Then Dad will make sure

684
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,026
that the bill gets passed.

685
00:46:21,778 --> 00:46:22,696
Right, Dad?

686
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:24,198
You will do that, right?

687
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,913
Even if it gets passed,

688
00:46:30,996 --> 00:46:33,415
it won't affect your case, right?

689
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:38,420
But if you muster up the courage
and appear on TV

690
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:43,425
and if Dad pushes the bill
through the National Assembly,

691
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,637
it'll help anyone who's going through

692
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,639
the same thing as you did.

693
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:55,854
I understand what you're worried about.

694
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,648
But…

695
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:02,319
it's inevitable for the greater good.

696
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,331
Mom.

697
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:18,961
Not only do you have Dad,
but you have me as well.

698
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,382
So Mom,

699
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,801
stay strong.

700
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:31,974
I love you.

701
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,180
She didn't want you
to come back to pick it up.

702
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,474
I guess she doesn't want
to see you ever again.

703
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:16,518
-Mom.
-Yes?

704
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:18,812
You're being so nice
to your daughter-in-law lately.

705
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,315
You used to bad-mouth her. I'm jealous.

706
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,650
It's not because I like her.

707
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,528
It's because she's pregnant
with my grandchild.

708
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,740
I hope she doesn't have
another miscarriage.

709
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,409
I want a grandchild.

710
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,838
SLEEPING ROOM

711
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,974
SECURITY DEPOSIT 5 MILLION WON
MONTHLY RENT 250,000 WON

712
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,940
CUSTOMER SUPPORT ASSISTANT
2.3 MILLION WON PER MONTH

713
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,692
PART-TIME TELEMARKETER
3 MILLION WON PER MONTH

714
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,486
COSMETICS DELIVERY MANAGER
2 MILLION WON PER MONTH

715
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:32,678
Hello.

716
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,555
What brings you here?

717
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:38,350
Is Ms. Lee doing okay?

718
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,186
Yes.

719
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,187
That's a relief.

720
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:45,774
I was worried
that she might still be unconscious.

721
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,318
I mean…

722
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:54,199
She found out
you were going to hand us the evidence

723
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,493
but hasn't done anything about it.

724
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,161
So I assumed she was unconscious.

725
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,998
I'll cut to the chase.

726
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,376
I heard you were having second thoughts

727
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,545
about handing us the evidence.

728
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:11,758
Is it because
you don't want to shock your wife

729
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,511
while her mother is injured?

730
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:21,685
So it would be really bad

731
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:24,563
if I were to tell Ms. Jin myself…

732
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,192
about this whole arrangement.

733
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,408
I'll be waiting for your call.

734
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:39,202
I'm quite the impatient type,

735
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:41,747
so I can't wait for too long.

736
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,216
Tell me about it.

737
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:56,178
Why did that kid
go into the Han River while drunk?

738
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,179
Seriously.

739
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:59,681
Have you ever imagined
attending the funeral

740
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,933
of a friend's child at our age?

741
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:05,353
-Never.
-They must be devastated.

742
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,283
What are you doing?

743
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:22,037
What do you think you're doing?

744
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,997
Gosh. What did I do?

745
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,707
I saw everything.

746
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,959
Miss, he was groping you, right?

747
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,462
I didn't grope anyone.

748
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,589
Stop being so ridiculous.

749
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,592
Are you okay?

750
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:40,222
That man touched you without your consent.

751
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:42,390
Am I right?

752
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:48,605
By any chance, did Ji-hoon
force you in any way without your consent?

753
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:56,947
I can take care of myself.

754
00:51:57,864 --> 00:51:58,907
Sorry?

755
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,621
Look.

756
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:07,958
Touch me again,

757
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:10,961
and I will kill you.

758
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:26,768
Give me some time

759
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,438
to think about going on TV.

760
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,485
Okay, I will.

761
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:39,447
But please understand if I decide not to.

762
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,200
Okay.

763
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:51,334
Honey.

764
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,921
About what you said earlier.

765
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,258
I really hadn't

766
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,178
made up my mind before asking you.

767
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:06,016
Okay.

768
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,227
I'll try to believe you.

769
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,592
ALBUM

770
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,431
MOVE TO TRASH

771
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:59,778
We just spoke
with Assemblyman Lee Chi-hwan.

772
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:01,613
For Part Two,

773
00:54:01,696 --> 00:54:05,033
we have Chairwoman Woo Jin-seok
and Assemblyman Nam Joong-do

774
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,493
from the Daehan Party with us.

775
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,619
Hello.

776
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,955
-Hello.
-Hello.

777
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:13,583
The general election is
only six months away.

778
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,670
Following his wife's recent hit-and-run,

779
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:19,756
Assemblyman Ko Ji-seop has left the party.

780
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,008
Some are questioning
if the Daehan Party is

781
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,135
doing enough to keep
their members in order.

782
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:28,098
They are criticizing
the party's lack of discipline

783
00:54:28,682 --> 00:54:30,600
with the elections around the corner.

784
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:33,269
Chairwoman Woo,

785
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,604
what are your thoughts on this?

786
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,024
Our party had no intention

787
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:40,652
of defending Assemblyman Ko
regarding what happened.

788
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,363
That's why, even after he left our party,

789
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:46,116
I urged him to resign from office.

790
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,160
And as for keeping our members in order,

791
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:52,998
the chief advisor who was
recently caught soliciting sex

792
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:56,209
works for an assemblyman
of the Nation and People's Party.

793
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,420
But both the party

794
00:54:58,503 --> 00:55:00,880
and the assemblyman
for whom the advisor worked

795
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,757
have swept this under the rug

796
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,551
without any disciplinary action.

797
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:06,886
I see.

798
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,347
So in the upcoming general election…

799
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,643
I'm looking at our real-time comments,

800
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,187
and people are saying

801
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:21,192
that you're being a hypocrite,
Assemblyman Nam.

802
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,865
I know this is uncomfortable,
but would you like to say something?

803
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:28,783
Sure.

804
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,455
I would like to apologize once again

805
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:35,957
for all the disgraceful incidents

806
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:40,628
that have occurred within my family.

807
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,758
It will never happen again.

808
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,677
For the reformation of Korean politics,

809
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,263
we will start by thoroughly
observing our own members

810
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,391
with a zero-tolerance policy
for lying and hypocrisy.

811
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:58,229
That is the resolve of the Daehan Party
for this upcoming general election.

812
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,023
I see.

813
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,193
Your term ends right after
the general election next year, correct?

814
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:05,195
Yes. Next May.

815
00:56:11,117 --> 00:56:11,993
Goodbye, ma'am.

816
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,282
You came together today.

817
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,506
NAM JI-HOON

818
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:28,528
HUSBAND

819
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:37,579
POOREUN EUNHA MEMORIAL PARK

820
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,373
Hey.

821
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,916
What's up?

822
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,834
Honey.

823
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:44,836
This may shock you, but…

824
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,213
What's going on?

825
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,678
What?

826
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,096
What did you say?

827
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:57,474
Ji-hoon…

828
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,815
committed sexual assault.

829
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:10,862
So I'll be holding
a press conference soon.

830
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,155
Honey, wait--

831
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,949
Hold on. What do you mean?

832
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:17,410
Ji-hoon did what to whom?

833
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:41,434
I was…

834
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:44,187
sexually assaulted.

835
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,968
TROLLEY

836
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:16,594
Your son was a hindrance
when he was alive.

837
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,304
Has he become a political tool now?

838
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,558
-How could you do this?
-You just crossed the line.

839
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,142
Tell him to leave the party!

840
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,477
Should I write a post online?

841
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,312
She's playing us right now.

842
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,564
You don't believe me, do you?

843
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,024
Break your promise again, and it's over.

844
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:32,026
-You didn't use Ji-hoon, did you?
-Are you insane?

845
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,486
Nam Joong-do, you piece of shit!

846
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,155
Whoever wins the public's support
will be the one telling the truth.

847
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:41,119
