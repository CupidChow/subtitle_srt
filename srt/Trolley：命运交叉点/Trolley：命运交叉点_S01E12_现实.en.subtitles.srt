00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,346
HUSBAND

3
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,107
Hey.

4
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,734
What's up?

5
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:50,860
Honey.

6
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,155
What's going on?

7
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,199
This may shock you, but…

8
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:00,703
Ji-hoon…

9
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,795
committed sexual assault.

10
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,092
What did you say?

11
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,387
Ji-hoon did what?

12
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,599
Honey, wait--

13
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,309
Hold on.

14
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,312
What do you mean?

15
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,356
Ji-hoon did what to whom?

16
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:36,114
Honey, I don't understand
what you're saying right now.

17
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,618
Honey.

18
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:45,415
Kim Soo-bin.

19
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,919
Kim Soo-bin blackmailed me.

20
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,088
She claims she was raped

21
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,883
and that she'll expose it.

22
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,679
So I'll be holding a press conference…

23
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,598
in an hour.

24
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,017
Before Kim Soo-bin goes public with it.

25
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,156
No, honey, give me some time
before the press conference. Please.

26
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,491
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,828
No, wait. Honey!

28
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,081
CALL ENDED

29
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,148
First, Ms. Namgoong Sol,

30
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,651
then Ms. Kim's old incident,
and now his son.

31
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,986
It's one sex crime after another.

32
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,614
Jamsil Baseball Stadium
holds up to 25,000 people.

33
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,200
And with 30,000 sexual offense
cases reported annually,

34
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,953
that's over 80 cases a day.

35
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,579
It's a common occurrence.

36
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,712
I'll hold a press conference at 11 a.m.

37
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:31,312
The person you are trying to reach is…

38
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,695
Honey, please give me some time.

39
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,239
Pick up your phone.

40
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,824
Please.

41
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,048
I have to call her. Kim Soo-bin.

42
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,758
KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

43
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,139
The phone is turned off…

44
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:11,936
Oh, no.

45
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,913
HYE-JOO

NAM JOONG-DO

48
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,707
-Ms. Kim.
-Hello.

49
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:15,750
Where is…

50
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,465
I am…

51
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,260
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do

52
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,597
of Sinyang, Seoul.

53
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,809
Today, I came to know that

54
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:34,977
my son, who passed last month,

55
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,563
had a girlfriend

56
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,733
prior to his death…

57
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,489
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO PRESS CONFERENCE

58
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:48,950
…whom he sexually assaulted.

59
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,372
Hence, I apologize
from the bottom of my heart

60
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,333
to the victim and the citizens.

61
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,211
BELATED DISCOVERY OF
DECEASED SON'S SEXUAL ASSAULT

62
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,564
APOLOGIES TO THE VICTIM AND CITIZENS

63
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,947
REALITY

64
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,657
Also…

65
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,333
allow me to share

66
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:43,004
the details of the bill I wish to propose.

67
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,929
I am proposing

68
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,016
an amendment to the Criminal Act

69
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,561
that allows investigations to continue

70
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,982
even if the assailant is deceased
from suicide or otherwise.

71
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,821
You must all remember Ji…

72
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:11,115
Ms. Kim is at the office.

73
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,659
…to distribute an intimate video
of his ex-girlfriend,

74
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,871
causing her to take her own life.

75
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,874
He then committed suicide

76
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:23,544
when his arrest warrant was issued.

77
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,964
This amendment I am proposing

78
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,383
will be named after the victim,

79
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:33,971
the beloved granddaughter
of Ms. Cho Gwi-soon here,

80
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,517
and it will be called

81
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,853
Namgoong Sol's Law.

82
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:50,196
Under the current law,
when the assailant of a sex crime dies,

83
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,949
the investigation can no longer continue,

84
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:57,328
which deprives the victim
of a chance to reveal the truth.

85
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,372
Therefore,

86
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,625
I propose an amendment to the Criminal Act

87
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,378
that allows investigations to continue

88
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,381
by retaining the right of arraignment

89
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,510
even when the sex offenders are deceased
due to suicide or otherwise.

90
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,097
The place is well-kept.
Thank you for showing it.

91
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,348
I'll give you a call.

92
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,599
Please do.

93
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,935
-Let's go.
-Okay.

94
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:23,020
-You know…
-Yes?

95
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,898
The place I told you about…

96
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,988
Come to the National Assembly right away.

97
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,080
Hello, sir.

98
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:52,216
NAM JOONG-DO

99
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,167
I asked…

100
00:10:27,418 --> 00:10:30,254
I asked you to wait, honey.

101
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,675
I just needed a bit of time.

102
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,428
How could you do this?

103
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,973
How could you go ahead
with something like this

104
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,975
without talking to me first?

105
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,688
Soo-bin told me
that wasn't the case, honey.

106
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,358
When?

107
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,112
I asked her on the day
she first came to our place.

108
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,868
Did Soo-bin really tell you…

109
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,830
that Ji-hoon did that to her?

110
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,957
Did she? When?

111
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:10,836
She was here this morning

112
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,214
and threatened…

113
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,509
to disclose it.

114
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,685
Ja-young is giving Ms. Cho a ride home.

115
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,979
The phones will start
ringing off the hook--

116
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,112
Please respond the way I told you.

117
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:37,780
-Yes.
-Yes.

118
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,659
Hello?

119
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,413
-Hello, sir.
-Assemblyman Nam Joong-do's office.

120
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,668
Hey, Yeong-su.

121
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,430
Kim Soo-bin showed up this morning.

122
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:05,057
Should I write a post online?

123
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,269
She said Ji-hoon raped her
and got her pregnant.

124
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,981
She wanted to expose it.

125
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,109
That makes no sense.

126
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,156
Why would she have come to us then?
There's just no way.

127
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,241
And why would she deny it when I asked?

128
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:25,953
Who knows?

129
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,373
We know nothing about her past.

130
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:32,751
Do you believe her?

131
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:34,712
How?

132
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:39,717
You believed her enough
to hold a press conference.

133
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:42,928
She showed me her OBGYN records.

134
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,223
The doctor referred her

135
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,809
to a sexual assault victim support center.

136
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,604
She even has records
of her counseling sessions.

137
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,274
And think of everything Ji-hoon had done.

138
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,944
This isn't too far-fetched.

139
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,951
What did she ask for?

140
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:13,334
She must have blackmailed you
because she wanted something in return.

141
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,544
Was it money? How much?

142
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,089
Fifty million won.

143
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,302
It looks like I need
at least 50 million to find a place.

144
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,473
Honey.

145
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,019
If you had told me on the phone,

146
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:35,272
I would have found a way
to get 100 million, let alone 50.

147
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,649
Because I…

148
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,656
DON'T WASTE MY TAX MONEY
AND JUST EXECUTE HIM

149
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:45,074
BRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY

150
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,617
DISGUSTING CRIMINAL

151
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,036
I GUESS THIS KID DOESN'T HAVE
DADDY COVERING HIS ASS

152
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,496
MAKE SURE HE ROTS BEHIND BARS!

153
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,214
How could you do this?

154
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,553
It was hard for me too.

155
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:10,516
But I couldn't let her blackmail me.

156
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,060
No secret lasts forever.

157
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:17,523
When you've done something wrong,
the best way to be forgiven is

158
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,568
to own up to it and ask for forgiveness.

159
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,486
It was for Ji-hoon's sake.

160
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,156
That's why I decided to come clean.

161
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,328
Taking a preemptive measure
was the only way.

162
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,414
Please understand.

163
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,959
A preemptive measure?

164
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,712
Is that really all?

165
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,464
You're not

166
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,093
using Ji-hoon for your bill, are you?

167
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,262
What?

168
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:51,223
You decided to publicize my story
before asking me.

169
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,727
Did you set everything up
before letting me know today too?

170
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,478
Because you knew I wouldn't approve.

171
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,105
-Honey.
-Isn't that the case?

172
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,775
If you only confessed
because you'd been blackmailed,

173
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,527
why did you bring up the bill?

174
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,195
And when did you bring Ms. Cho?

175
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,238
Hye-joo.

176
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,115
That really isn't the case.

177
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,284
Do you think I'd use my son
for my political…

178
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,591
I guess I already
lost your trust yesterday.

179
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,052
It's all my fault.

180
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,431
I was going to propose
the bill soon anyway.

181
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,392
So if I had to disclose Ji-hoon's crime,

182
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,896
I wanted to divert
the attention away from him.

183
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:44,151
-We don't have any comments besides…
-Please refer to the statement we sent.

184
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,819
NAM PROPOSES NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW

185
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,447
If I hadn't mentioned the bill,
the news would only be

186
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,659
talking about Ji-hoon now.

187
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,875
This is too much for me to handle.

188
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,632
So this is how politics works.

189
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,595
You once asked me this.

190
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,264
Do you regret…

191
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,354
getting married to someone
who wants to be in politics?

192
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,690
Do you regret it?

193
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,234
I don't regret it.

194
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:26,944
Never.

195
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,491
But I do regret it now.

196
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,705
It's like I don't know you at all.

197
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,587
Hye-joo.

198
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,598
He must be insane.

199
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,726
Where did he get the idea
to call in reporters

200
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:00,644
and confess his son's sex crime?

201
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,148
But it's much better
than having the Nation and People's Party

202
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,399
expose it first.

203
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,901
Not when it's a sex crime.

204
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,319
What about the party's image?

205
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:10,946
Tell him to leave the party!

206
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,448
That's unnecessary.

207
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,243
Many people are applauding
his honest confession.

208
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,287
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party

209
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,831
held a press conference today
and confessed

210
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,833
-the sexual assault
-Watch your step.

211
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,878
committed by his deceased son,
which caused a stir.

212
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,254
Namgoong Sol's Law…

213
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,422
Ms. Kim Hye-joo.

214
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:32,384
Were you aware of your son's sex crime?

215
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,678
-Don't film her.
-Why are you here?

216
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:35,763
Stop it.

217
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:38,182
Assemblyman Nam used
the medical student case

218
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,850
to cover up his son's drug usage.

219
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:42,644
-Today, he proposed a controversial bill.
-Watch the stairs.

220
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,980
He seems to keep covering up
his son's wrongdoings

221
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,149
using other people's misfortunes.

222
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,776
Any comments on this?

223
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,527
Hye-joo, don't answer. It's okay.

224
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,490
Your son was a hindrance
when he was alive.

225
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,241
Has he become a political tool now?

226
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,659
Look here!

227
00:17:57,743 --> 00:17:59,203
-Are you--
-Ma'am.

228
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,332
You just crossed the line.

229
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,794
Have a little respect and courtesy.

230
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:11,381
Just because you're covering politics
doesn't mean it's okay to be inhuman.

231
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,595
Let's go, Hye-joo.

232
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:17,554
Come on.

233
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,933
Call me if you have anything to tell us.

234
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:21,892
Get out of the way.

235
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,031
Hye-joo.

236
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,327
Let's go home for now.

237
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,539
Yeo-jin.

238
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,628
People didn't believe me either back then.

239
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,463
Are you saying

240
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,341
Seung-ho molested you?

241
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,261
Stop lying.

242
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,055
Do you expect me to believe that?

243
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,225
They called me a liar.

244
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,311
It felt so unfair and harsh.

245
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,399
But now I'm thinking…

246
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,362
that Ji-hoon might have done bad things,

247
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:18,157
but he wouldn't have
done something so terrible.

248
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,118
I hear there's proof,

249
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,744
but I still can't believe Soo-bin.

250
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:26,456
I just wish she was lying.

251
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,294
But…

252
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,547
I, of all people,

253
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:38,385
shouldn't be doubting her, right?

254
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,277
YOON-SEO'S TEACHER

255
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,366
-I see.
-Sir.

256
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,827
-I appreciate your support.
-Please don't swear at…

257
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,789
Your press conference will be

258
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,459
the headline of
every news channel tonight.

259
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,127
CHOI JUN-WON, MBS REPORTER

260
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,255
Also, heated debates are going on

261
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,258
regarding Namgoong Sol's Law
on many online forums.

262
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:24,848
Anything about Ji-hoon?

263
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:25,807
There's a lot.

264
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,564
I canceled all of your schedule today.

265
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:35,609
You should go see Ms. Kim
before it gets late.

266
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,991
…loses its right of arraignment,
and the case is closed.

267
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:46,370
This morning, Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party

268
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,747
held a press conference
and disclosed a sex crime

269
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:51,416
that his deceased son committed…

270
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,502
-Sir, can you turn off the radio?
-before death.

271
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,921
-Sorry? Sure.
-Even after the sex offender dies…

272
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,090
Thank you.

273
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,606
50,000 WON TO COUNSELING CENTER
FOR SEXUAL VIOLENCE VICTIMS

274
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,774
50,000 WON TO
WOMEN AND YOUTH SHELTER

275
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,867

PRIVATE WARD
LEE ***-SIN

277
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:39,381
Seung-hee.

278
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:41,842
You should get something to eat.

279
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,386
You haven't eaten anything all day.

280
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,638
I'm fine.

281
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,475
The doctor said Mom will wake up soon.

282
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,352
But still.

283
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,813
I'll stay with her,

284
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,440
so go grab a bite.

285
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,900
I'll call you when she wakes up.

286
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,392
You!

287
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,772
Are you the one who ratted out
Mr. Park to Nam Joong-do?

288
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:39,399
Mark my words.

289
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,985
I won't let you two

290
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,572
get away with this.

291
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,001
That's about his son who died, right?

292
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,586
Yes.

293
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,923
And Nam Joong-do came out
and said it himself.

294
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,219
Your neighborhood's going to get noisy.

295
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:09,346
I know.

296
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:11,515
I voted for him last time.

297
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:15,018
NAM JOONG-DO TO PUSH "NAMGOONG SOL'S LAW"
AN AMENDMENT TO THE CRIMINAL ACT

298
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,115
Seung-ho…

299
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,872
Seung-ho.

300
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,253
It's all right.

301
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:46,133
Nobody believes

302
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,761
Jae-eun.

303
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,390
I will…

304
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,269
take your secret with me

305
00:23:58,436 --> 00:23:59,729
to the grave.

306
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,718
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL

307
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,844
Nam Yoon-seo.

308
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,804
Kwon Da-som.

309
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:35,182
Aren't you going to tell us
why you fought?

310
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:40,937
Yoon-seo.

311
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,814
Why did you two fight?

312
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,407
Nam Ji-hoon.

313
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,453
Because of Nam Ji-hoon.

314
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,748
-He raped her.
-Raped?

315
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,209
What? He raped her? Impossible.

316
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,793
Her brother did drugs too.

317
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:06,087
No, he didn't.

318
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,091
And we don't know if he really raped her.
Don't jump to conclusions.

319
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,429
I mean, your dad says it's true.

320
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:17,265
Rape? Don't you think that's disgusting?

321
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,392
-Hey, Jang Hyeon-seo!
-Yes.

322
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,811
It's the worst.

323
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,399
-What?
-I'll say it again.

324
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,527
Sex offenders should drop dead.

325
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:31,821
Hey, Da-som.

326
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,208
Mom.

327
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,253
Did he…

328
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,673
really do that?

329
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,927
No, right?

330
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:55,553
It can't be.

331
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,140
Goodness.

332
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:01,434
I'm sorry I'm late.

333
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:04,062
I was with a patient
and wasn't able to check my phone.

334
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,273
Da-som.

335
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:08,733
Did you and Yoon-seo fight? Why?

336
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:12,904
Yoon-seo.

337
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,620
What's wrong? What is it?

338
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:29,212
Let's talk about this after your classes.

339
00:26:30,005 --> 00:26:31,715
Submit an apology letter too.

340
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:33,758
-Okay.
-Okay.

341
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,320
Hye-joo.

342
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:57,907
I'm sorry. One second.

343
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,869
Hello?

344
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,330
Yes. You mean Ms. Kim Si-nae?

345
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,957
How much has her cervix dilated?

346
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,010
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

347
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,348
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

348
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,768
Ms. Kim must be quite shaken up.
Please look after her.

349
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:56,383
DAON WOMEN'S CLINIC

350
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,392
-Hye-joo.
-Yes?

351
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,770
Right, we're here already.

352
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,649
I'm sorry I can't take you home.
I have a patient in labor.

353
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,943
No, it's all right. Thank you.

354
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,320
You look awful right now.

355
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,198
Come up with me
and get an IV and some rest.

356
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,366
I'm fine.

357
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,786
-I'll be going. See you later.
-Bye.

358
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,622
-Oh, my.
-I'm sorry, Ji-soo. One second.

359
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,624
It's okay. Take your time.

360
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,380
Ms. Kim Soo-bin.

361
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,802
-Hye-joo.
-Yes?

362
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,596
Who's that in the picture?

363
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,312
This?

364
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:52,939
Who…

365
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,649
is that?

366
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,655
She's Ji-hoon's…

367
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:08,079
-Bye then.
-Okay. Bye.

368
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,499
See you.

369
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,644
I just parked. I'll be right up.

370
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:34,647
By the way,

371
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,526
the patient we had on an IV
for stomach pain earlier…

372
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:40,737
Has she left?

373
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,530
DAON WOMEN'S CLINIC

374
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,032
Soo-bin.

375
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,075
Soo-bin!

376
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,369
Soo-bin, did Ji-hoon really do that?

377
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,122
Is this true? Did Ji-hoon do that?

378
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,544
Say something.

379
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,004
Is this true?

380
00:29:58,588 --> 00:29:59,589
Soo-bin!

381
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,925
People are looking.

382
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,301
Let's talk somewhere else.

383
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,437
Soo-bin.

384
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:18,149
When I asked you before,

385
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,570
you told me that wasn't the case, right?

386
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,489
So…

387
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:25,990
So why?

388
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,284
Did he really…

389
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,995
Did Ji-hoon really

390
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:33,873
do that to you?

391
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,719
No.

392
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,557
No, right?

393
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:52,809
He didn't, right?

394
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:56,271
Ji-hoon didn't do that.
You're telling the truth, right?

395
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,365
Then you're…

396
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,285
You're okay, right?

397
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,245
That didn't happen, right?

398
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:15,540
You're really okay, right?

399
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,462
What a relief.

400
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,423
Thank goodness.

401
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,717
Thank you, Soo-bin.

402
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:28,177
So that's not

403
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:31,931
how you got pregnant, right?

404
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:33,516
Right?

405
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,563
Then why did you do that, Soo-bin?

406
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,774
Why did you do that?

407
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,402
If you needed money,
you should have just asked for it.

408
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:48,489
Why did you have to frame Ji-hoon? Why?

409
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,409
And why did you blackmail
Ji-hoon's dad with a lie?

410
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,078
Why would you do that?

411
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,333
What?

412
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,752
Blackmail?

413
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,049
He said I blackmailed him?

414
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,719
You didn't?

415
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,306
He said you threatened
to go public with it.

416
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:18,519
I didn't blackmail him.

417
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,314
What?

418
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,400
Then…

419
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,277
Then are you saying he lied…

420
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,029
He…

421
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,281
You don't believe me, do you?

422
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,330
I understand.

423
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,625
I'm not your family or anything.

424
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,378
I'm just a kid you knew for a while.

425
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:46,714
But…

426
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,051
I really didn't

427
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,261
blackmail him.

428
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,516
You don't have to believe anything else,

429
00:32:58,059 --> 00:32:59,352
but I wouldn't ever

430
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,146
stoop that low.

431
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,678
He said you threatened
to go public with it.

432
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,932
I didn't blackmail him.

433
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,519
Yes, I'm blackmailing you right now.

434
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,494
I met…

435
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,623
Soo-bin earlier.

436
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,876
How?

437
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,299
I ran into her in the afternoon.

438
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,135
And she

439
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,262
told me…

440
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,517
Ji-hoon didn't do that.

441
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,062
And…

442
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,066
she also said
she never threatened to go public.

443
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,445
Is this true?

444
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,616
Honey.

445
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,493
That makes no sense.

446
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,870
Do you believe what Kim Soo-bin said?

447
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,123
She's playing us right now.

448
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,041
It's not that I believe her.

449
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,919
There's no reason for her
to play us like this.

450
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:33,214
-Especially with something like this.
-Her medical records said so.

451
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,550
Fine.

452
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,426
Let's say she's telling the truth.

453
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:40,596
If she didn't blackmail me
with Ji-hoon's matter,

454
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,141
why has she been quiet
since the press conference?

455
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,560
Are you telling me

456
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,399
that I lied to you and the entire nation?

457
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,988
Do you really think I would

458
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,700
accuse my son of being a scumbag
just to change the law?

459
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,535
Is that who your husband is?

460
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,137
I've never…

461
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,057
doubted you once.

462
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,896
But you can't trust me.

463
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,319
You don't need to explain anything to me.

464
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,573
There may be no proof or witnesses,

465
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,410
but I still believe you.

466
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,290
Because it's you.

467
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,628
I…

468
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,130
never imagined…

469
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,008
you would trust someone else

470
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,013
more than me.

471
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,475
Especially not a girl like her.

472
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,258
What else did she say?

473
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,052
Tell me everything she said.

474
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,223
Let me hear
what other lies she came up with.

475
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,481
What?

476
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,691
Nam Joong-do!

477
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,443
Nam Joong-do!

478
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,072
Nam Joong-do, you piece of shit!

479
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,533
I don't need these.

480
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,786
-How could you do this to Ji-hoon?
-Please let go of him.

481
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,246
Do you not care about your kid

482
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,248
now that you're wearing that badge?

483
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,502
Su-hyeon sacrificed her life
to give birth to Ji-hoon.

484
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,671
You're supposed to be his father

485
00:38:18,754 --> 00:38:21,048
and you publicly ruined his reputation.

486
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,426
How can you call yourself his father?

487
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:25,511
He may have done something really bad

488
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,513
but he doesn't deserve this!

489
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,766
Please don't do this.

490
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,643
Stay out of this!

491
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,811
Honey, are you okay?

492
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,897
Leave her out of this.

493
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:41,152
Did you just take
that woman's side in front of me

494
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,945
now that Su-hyeon is dead and gone?

495
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,031
-"That woman"?
-Su-hyeon died

496
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,701
without getting any treatment
to save your son.

497
00:38:49,201 --> 00:38:50,745
She gave her life to save Ji-hoon.

498
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,039
Do you know what people are saying now?

499
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:57,209
That they should dig up his grave
and put an ankle monitor on him!

500
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,507
When you were getting remarried,

501
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:06,135
I told you to send Ji-hoon to us.

502
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,720
But what did you say?

503
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:09,013
That you'd raise him well.

504
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:11,349
So I trusted that woman with him.

505
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,767
Look where that got us!

506
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,353
If he didn't feel so unwelcome and lonely,

507
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:18,189
he wouldn't have become so bad!

508
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,192
Goodness.

509
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,819
Goodness, Su-hyeon.

510
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,531
Poor Su-hyeon.

511
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:31,035
She must be turning in her grave!

512
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:39,919
It's all my fault.

513
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,838
Ji-hoon.

514
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:45,216
What's going on with you?

515
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,343
Are your studies burdening you?

516
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,387
Or is someone harassing you?

517
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,848
You can tell me anything.

518
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,310
What can you do about it?

519
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,605
Everything sucks.

WHAT'S WITH MY TEEN?

527
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:01,250
Joong-do did his best for Ji-hoon.

528
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,837
If anyone's at fault, it would be me.

529
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,465
So please don't…

530
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,095
I will accept

531
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,098
any criticism for what I did today.

532
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,018
But please direct it only at me.

533
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,271
She loved Ji-hoon more than anybody else.

534
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,732
She's Ji-hoon's mom.

535
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,315
Thank you

536
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,735
and I'm sorry for this afternoon.

537
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,603
When I accused you

538
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,109
of using Ji-hoon earlier today…

539
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,823
I was being unfair. I'm sorry.

540
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,537
You're his dad.

541
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,640
I'm sorry.

542
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,847
You're okay, right?

543
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:46,684
That didn't happen, right?

544
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,019
You're really okay, right?

545
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,729
What a relief.

546
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:52,856
Thank goodness.

547
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,067
Thank you, Soo-bin.

548
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,569
Did Ji-hoon…

549
00:45:00,447 --> 00:45:04,868
force you in any way without your consent?

550
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:33,021
JEONGSUN MEDICAL CENTER

551
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:35,607
Are you done?

552
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:36,692
Yes.

553
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:43,407
Goodness.

554
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,119
I'll put these outside.

555
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:04,094
Ms. Lee, can we talk for a moment?

556
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,013
Goodness.

557
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:08,891
Goodness.

558
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,058
My head hurts.

559
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,229
Goodness, my head.

560
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:16,398
Jeez.

561
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:19,526
…he would make sure this amendment passes.

562
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,530
Assemblyman Nam
also promised to do his best

563
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,741
to destigmatize sex crime victims.

564
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,786
Under current law,
when sex offenders kill themselves…

565
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:35,709
You have seven interviews
on Namgoong Sol's Law from 13:00 today.

566
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,504
And you have five tomorrow.

567
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:41,215
Sir.

568
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,384
You aren't wearing your badge.

569
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,138
Right,

570
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,097
I didn't notice.

571
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:55,395
It has been an eventful couple of days.

572
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:50,701
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

573
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,125
Right, the short ribs.

574
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,341
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

575
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,843
He must have been in a hurry.

576
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,931
And I'm grateful that someone
who's busy as Assemblyman Nam

577
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:17,019
made time to come see her before sundown.

578
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:20,314
But didn't he stop by late at night--

579
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,690
No, he didn't.

580
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:25,777
How could I forget someone
wearing an assemblyman's badge?

581
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,740
I need to go out for a bit.

582
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,074
There's a wake I have to attend.

583
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,743
But isn't it too late right now?

584
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:34,870
I have a tight schedule tomorrow.

585
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:37,039
It's better to go now.

586
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,224
NAM JI-HOON

587
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,197
We took several risks,

588
00:49:11,907 --> 00:49:14,910
but things seem to be going
the way you intended.

589
00:49:19,873 --> 00:49:20,791
Goodbye.

590
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,019
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG SOON-HONG

591
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,897
Hello, Assemblyman Kang.

592
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,691
You're calling quite early.

593
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:50,612
Sorry?

594
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:54,783
When Ms. Kim Soo-bin came in
and inquired about getting an abortion,

595
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,869
I wrote in her chart that she got pregnant

596
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:59,579
as a result of a sexual assault.

597
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:03,709
She said the assailant was her boyfriend.

598
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:05,085
Right?

599
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:11,174
I happened to book
the press conference hall

600
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:14,386
for 11 a.m. today.

601
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:17,806
I'll yield it to you.

602
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,392
Why don't you use it

603
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:24,146
to announce that
the Youngsan land speculation

604
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:26,690
was nothing but a misunderstanding?

605
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,569
If you don't want to,

606
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,071
I could just use it

607
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:35,574
to talk about your son.

608
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,088
INCOMING CALL

609
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,591
This is Nam Joong-do.

610
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,069
I wrote in her chart that she got pregnant

611
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,654
as a result of a sexual assault.

612
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,492
She said the assailant was her boyfriend.

613
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,787
I only said that to the doctor

614
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,666
because I heard I couldn't get an abortion
unless I was a victim of a sex crime.

615
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,837
I didn't know they changed the law.

616
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:31,755
Either way,

617
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,299
that's not how I got pregnant.

618
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,592
Then who's the father?

619
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,553
You said it wasn't sexual assault.

620
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,305
Is Ji-hoon really the father?

621
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:45,769
No.

622
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,688
It's my ex-boyfriend.

623
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,443
What I'm saying is,

624
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,570
those records are

625
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,322
completely wrong.

626
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,995
Ji-hoon has nothing to do
with my pregnancy.

627
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:13,713
Are you insane?

628
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,424
You're going to hold
a press conference and say

629
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,717
that Ji-hoon raped me?

630
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,262
You said you needed a place to stay.

631
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,596
I'll handle the rest.

632
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,520
Ms. Kim will be hurt.

633
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,814
She has nothing to do with you now.

634
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,233
She was only good to you

635
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,403
because she thought
you were pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby.

636
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,037
Okay.

637
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,042
When are you going to pay me?

638
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,131
I apologize from the bottom of my heart

639
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,884
to the victim and the citizens.

640
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:02,637
In addition, I accused
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong

641
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:05,473
of the Nation and People's Party
last month

642
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:08,143
of engaging in
land speculation in Youngsan.

643
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,150
I promise to get to the bottom of it

644
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,320
and reveal the whole truth of it soon.

645
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,155
What the…

646
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,574
That bastard.

647
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,326
What…

648
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,828
This wasn't part of the plan.

649
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,543
I'll feel guilty for what I did

650
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,964
to Hye-joo and Ji-hoon
for the rest of my life.

651
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:43,970
But I had no other choice.

652
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,641
For the greater good…

653
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,769
and for this world.

654
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,453
Listen up.

655
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,456
Break your promise again,

656
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,375
and you'll lose everything
including this place.

657
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,628
Understand?

658
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:22,842
Okay.

659
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,598
Kim Soo-bin will

660
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,433
no longer be a problem.

661
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,559
However…

662
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,065
if Ms. Kim finds out…

663
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,781
That won't happen.

664
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,867
IN APPRECIATION OF BAE GYEONG-GUK

665
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:51,246
Assemblyman Nam?

666
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,331
I think he was

667
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,709
the first to arrive at the wake.

668
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,168
Yes.

669
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,962
He came around dinnertime

670
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,965
but he didn't even stay for dinner
because he was busy.

671
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,344
My wife…

672
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,642
never doubts me.

673
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:16,730
NAM JI-HOON

674
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:33,538
Jin Seung-ho's case will get out
today or tomorrow.

675
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,290
Be prepared.

676
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,959
Jin Seung-hee won't sit idle

677
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,670
after my press conference.

678
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,590
Even with the land issue aside,

679
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,760
she'll think that Namgoong Sol's Law
is targeted at her brother.

680
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:50,764
Yes, sir.

681
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,642
There's no way to prove the truth anyway.

682
00:55:57,062 --> 00:55:58,063
Which means…

683
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,483
whoever wins the public's support

684
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:05,820
will be the one telling the truth.

685
00:56:11,367 --> 00:56:12,535
Right.

686
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,830
I think Assemblyman Nam was

687
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:19,626
the first guest after you.

688
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:23,630
NAM JOONG-DO, HEO JI-HYE, KIM MYEONG-JA…

689
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:25,256
Look.

690
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,802
His name is written at the very beginning.

691
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,807
NAM JOONG-DO

692
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:36,226
-There's a wake I have to attend.
-Whose wake?

693
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,230
Taeyang Shopping Center's leader's
mother-in-law passed away.

694
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,649
But isn't it too late right now?

695
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,734
I have a tight schedule tomorrow.

696
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,653
It's better to go now.

697
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,537
Hello. Thank you.

698
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,789
Thank you, Assemblyman Nam.

699
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:58,832
HALL 5, NAMGOONG SOL

700
00:56:58,915 --> 00:56:59,916
Just a moment.

701
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,512
Who are…

702
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:23,565
NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

703
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:27,360
He came with his badge on that day.

704
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,654
I clearly remember seeing it.

705
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,366
The moment he stepped
into the funeral hall,

706
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,827
I recognized him

707
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,871
thanks to his golden badge.

708
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,749
I may forget everything else,

709
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:46,296
but I'll never forget
seeing his badge on that day

710
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,965
until the day I die.

711
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,903
The night Ji-hoon died,

712
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:18,244
Mr. Nam was the last person he met.

713
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,497
I'll make sure

714
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,457
that you'll never be in politics again.

715
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,303
What about you, sir?

716
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:36,554
Did you meet with him?

717
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:38,306
No.

718
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,946
TROLLEY

719
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:36,948
On the night of Ji-hoon's accident.

720
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:40,743
-Did you meet him?
-Assemblyman Nam kind of scared me.

721
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:43,705
I wrote all about it online.
It'll be over soon.

722
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:47,083
-On what condition?
-Oppose Namgoong Sol's Law.

723
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:49,836
Stop hanging around Ms. Kim
and just cooperate.

724
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,671
I have no choice for the greater good.

725
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,965
I can't trust anybody right now.

726
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:59,345
