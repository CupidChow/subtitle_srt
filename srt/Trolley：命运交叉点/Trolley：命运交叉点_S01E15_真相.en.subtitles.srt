1
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,178
Hello.

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:56,264
I am Kim Hye-joo,

3
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,850
the wife of Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party.

4
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:13,865
Tell me everything
that you've lied to me about.

5
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,492
Don't leave anything out.

6
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,994
And I mean anything.

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,664
And I'm not forgiving you for any of it.

8
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,460
There's nothing else.

9
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:28,922
Are you sure?

10
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,765
Twenty years ago,

11
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,810
I was molested

12
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,812
by a boy I went to school with.

13
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:49,442
I reported it to the police,

14
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:54,364
but the assailant
immediately took his own life,

15
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,241
and the case was closed

16
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:00,328
without further investigation
as there was no one to indict.

17
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,498
"Molested"? This is ridiculous.

18
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,252
As a result, I lost my chance
to reveal the truth of the incident.

19
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,590
I ended up having to leave my hometown
as I was falsely accused of lying…

20
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,385
and driving the boy to his death.

21
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:17,971
She came to our house

22
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:20,807
and demanded settlement money
for her alleged molestation.

23
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:26,563
The claim that I lied about being molested
for money is completely untrue.

24
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:30,900
I see. I would like to ask
Assemblyman Nam a question.

25
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,820
You proposed an amendment
to the Criminal Act

26
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,322
that you named "Namgoong Sol's Law".

27
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,576
But ironically enough,

28
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,830
your son was an assailant of a sex crime
who died shortly after his offense,

29
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:46,082
bringing his investigation

30
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,418
to an end.

31
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,128
Am I right?

32
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,338
Yes, that's correct.

33
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,845
Yes.

34
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,722
It's true.

35
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,433
The anchor will bring up Ji-hoon.

36
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:06,436
She'll point out
that I proposed Namgoong Sol's Law

37
00:03:07,645 --> 00:03:09,564
when my own son is a sex offender.

38
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,358
But Ji-hoon is innocent.

39
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,070
And do you have to
mention that bill today?

40
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,490
Talking about Ji-hoon

41
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,202
will be the most effective way
to appeal my sincerity

42
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,579
to the public.

43
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,875
I'll make sure the bill gets passed

44
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,586
so that no one will suffer like you did.

45
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,088
Isn't that what you want as well?

46
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:37,759
Even though

47
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,471
he put me through much emotional pain,

48
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,807
I can swear that I never wished
for him to take his own life.

49
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,103
Not even for a moment.

50
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,773
When he took his own life,

51
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:54,192
it turned my life completely upside down.

52
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:57,695
Even if Namgoong Sol's Law gets passed,

53
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,823
my case will not be revisited.

54
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,618
However,

55
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,872
I mustered up all the courage I had
to come out here today

56
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:12,794
in hopes that there won't be
any more victims like me.

57
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,548
For a very long time, I thought

58
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:21,052
that I shouldn't have reported him
to the police back then.

59
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,139
I was filled with regret.

60
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:31,020
But thanks to my husband,

61
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,941
I am now convinced
that I would do the same thing

62
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:39,487
even if I were to go back in time.

63
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:42,615
I will…

64
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,118
never…

65
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,204
run away again.

66
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,933
THE TRUTH

67
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,275
I'm going to see a lawyer tomorrow.

68
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,193
We can sort out our divorce through them.

69
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,113
Don't take off your ring.

70
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,702
You and Namgoong Sol's Law
have just become

71
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,078
the center of attention.

72
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,289
So not just yet.

73
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,251
How can you be so shameless?

74
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,337
The bill needs to pass
before the election.

75
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,589
If it doesn't,

76
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,966
it'll be discarded when my term is over.

77
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:44,927
We can't get divorced until then.

78
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:47,972
Shall we go, sir?

79
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,265
One minute.

80
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,353
We need a moment to talk.

81
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,453
THIS IS OCY REPORTER LEE JEONG-JI.
ARE YOU AVAILABLE FOR AN INTERVIEW?

82
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:16,876
REPORTER KWON IL-RYUL, QTBC
REPORTER LEE YONG-I, YTE

83
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,506
YEO-JIN

84
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,768
YEO-JIN

85
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,771
What is it?

86
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,652
Yes, that's me.

87
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,239
Jeongsun Medical Center?

88
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,911
What?

89
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,412
Suicide?

90
00:06:58,668 --> 00:06:59,544
Yeo-jin.

91
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:03,798
Yeo-jin.

92
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,633
Yeo-jin.

93
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,344
Yeo-jin.

94
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,471
Yeo-jin.

95
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,683
Are you Ms. Hyeon Yeo-jin's guardians?

96
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,143
-Yes.
-Yes.

97
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,519
How is she?

98
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,521
She was brought here in time,

99
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,565
so her life's not in danger.

100
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,068
What happened?

101
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,029
She overdosed on sleeping pills
and fainted at her restaurant.

102
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,034
A regular was passing by
when they found her unconscious.

103
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,912
So what now?

104
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:38,458
She needs to be hospitalized
until she wakes up.

105
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,044
But we only have
private wards available now,

106
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,880
so she'll stay in the emergency room.

107
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,923
Take her to a private ward.

108
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,341
Pardon?

109
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,342
Please do that.

110
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,678
Okay. One minute, please.

111
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,930
I'll be going now.

112
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:53,931
Thank you.

113
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,897
I'll stay here. You can go.

114
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,566
-What?
-Honey.

115
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,401
Isn't that our district's assemblyman?

116
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,695
You're right.

117
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,322
It's Nam Joong-do.

118
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,531
-Right?
-Yes.

119
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,992
I just saw him on the news.

120
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,035
-You did?
-Yes.

121
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,164
Do you want to shack up with her?

122
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,168
Do it after we're divorced.
For now, just leave.

123
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,506
Okay.

124
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,175
I'll call you.

125
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,095
Don't let Yoon-seo know.

126
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:35,640
About any of this.

127
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,308
Ever.

128
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:41,896
Okay.

129
00:08:57,411 --> 00:09:00,957
But ironically enough,

130
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,002
your son was an assailant of a sex crime
who died shortly after his offense,

131
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:09,882
bringing his investigation to an end.

132
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:11,717
Am I right?

133
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,386
Yes, that's correct.

134
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:18,849
INTERVIEW WITH ASSEMBLYMAN
NAM JOONG-DO'S WIFE

135
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,934
Yes.

136
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,186
It's true.

137
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,026
You're going on the news with him today?

138
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,697
How can you do that
after finding out about his affair?

139
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,244
This is the only way right now

140
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:42,039
to reveal the truth to the world.

141
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,207
But still.

142
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:06,480
I watched it.

143
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,276
The dashcam footage of Ji-hoon.

144
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,613
I don't blame you.

145
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,034
I'm sorry for doubting you.

146
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,831
And I'm sorry for letting you down.

147
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,962
It's fine, sir.

148
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:08,334
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

149
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,758
Congratulations, Ji-hoon.

150
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:18,177
I didn't think you'd make it.

151
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,261
I can't miss this.

152
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,889
Guess what, Dad?
Mom is taking us out for jjajangmyeon.

153
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:24,100
It's your lucky day.

154
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,185
What happened?
I thought you couldn't come.

155
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,561
Can you have lunch with us?

156
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:29,563
No, I have to get back. I just dropped by.

157
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,664
YOON-SEO

158
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,882
Hey, Yoon-seo.

159
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,342
Are you back from your classes?

160
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,844
Yes, I just got home.

161
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,430
Mom, I saw the news.

162
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,557
Everyone's rooting for you now.

163
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,017
I'm so relieved.

164
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,979
By the way, where's Auntie Yeo-jin?

165
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,313
She isn't home.

166
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:15,276
She's out of town?

167
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,402
Yes.

168
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:20,573
So make sure to lock up, okay?

169
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,824
I'm sorry

170
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:26,370
for thinking you were lying the other day.

171
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,458
Mom.

172
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,376
Stay strong.

173
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,837
I love you.

174
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,131
Thanks, Yoon-seo.

175
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:40,843
You know I love you very much, right?

176
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,011
Good night.

177
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,692
POWER OFF

178
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,991
Kim Jae-eun is lying.

179
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,328
I want you to interview
her and me together.

180
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,519
-The National Assembly is observing
-Signatures are being gathered

181
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,438
-the public's response to the bill.
-throughout Seoul in support of the bill.

182
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,399
-Daehan Sex Crime Victim Support Center…
-Heated debates are going on…

183
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,778
Thank you for supporting
Namgoong Sol's Law.

184
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,322
I will relay your message
to Assemblyman Nam.

185
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:44,740
Thank you.

186
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:45,741
Bit-na.

187
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,160
This was Gangnam Station this morning.

188
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,205
Petitions are being signed
all over the city.

189
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:52,623
-Oh, my.
-Hey.

190
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,126
The donations for Assemblyman Nam
just reached the annual limit.

191
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,254
-We got 60 million won just today.
-What?

192
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,547
No way.

193
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,923
I can't believe it.

194
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,722
Thank you for interviewing with us, sir.

195
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,641
Thank you. Take care.

196
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:11,934
See you another time.

197
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,145
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

198
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,691
Hello, sir.

199
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,360
Reporter Shin Jae-hui
from Daeho Daily, right?

200
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,987
-Yes, that's me.
-Nice to meet you.

201
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,738
Please come on in.

202
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:25,698
This way, please.

203
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:30,828
The public sentiment is
in support of Namgoong Sol's Law.

204
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,955
Shouldn't we show support as well?

205
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,375
No. It was an arbitrary decision
by Assemblyman Nam

206
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,086
made without any discussion
with the party at all.

207
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,172
We don't even know if the bill
will pass the committee's review

208
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,425
with the juridical issues it entails.

209
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,427
We need a cause if we're going to

210
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,220
support it as a party.

211
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:50,639
Public sentiment is
the only cause we need.

212
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:54,560
He completely excluded the party
from his decision.

213
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,520
That's just a lack of discipline.

214
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,773
You left these clothes
in the car yesterday.

215
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:01,901
Thank you.

216
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,947
You must feel uncomfortable
being with her.

217
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,450
I'll stay with her.

218
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,160
You can talk when she wakes up.

219
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,621
You should go home for now.

220
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,207
Were you aware of their relationship?

221
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:22,838
Yes.

222
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:29,637
I had forgotten.

223
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,846
For you, Woo-jae…

224
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,935
I mean, Mr. Jang,
my husband always comes first.

225
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,396
How long have you known?

226
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,441
Was I the only one in the dark?

227
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,115
I'll stay here.

228
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,547
Nam Joong-do is
our district's assemblyman.

229
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,717
Hey, I saw him
in the emergency room yesterday.

230
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,719
-Really?
-Yes.

231
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,264
This is the only big hospital in the
neighborhood after all.

232
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,849
I wonder why he was here though.

233
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,559
No idea.

234
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,400
Your dad was amazing on TV yesterday.

235
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,860
Your mom has cleared her name too.

236
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,112
This is so great.

237
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,156
But her brother is still a sex offender.

238
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,325
I'd be too humiliated to come to school.

239
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,037
Hey, shouldn't you drop out?

240
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:40,499
Hey, that's enough.
It's not like she did anything wrong.

241
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,252
Do you want to be called
to the disciplinary committee?

242
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:46,296
Why are you always bringing up
the committee? You snitch.

243
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,257
That's right.

244
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,136
Nam Joong-do's son molested me
dozens of times.

245
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,638
But Nam Joong-do made it

246
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,725
sound like it was just once.

247
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,646
Jeez. He deserved to die.

248
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,233
Right. I heard his son was a meth addict.

249
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:08,736
Did he force it on you too, by any chance?

250
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,239
Of course he did.

251
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:16,118
He tried to make me use it too.

252
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,119
You're lying.

253
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,166
Ms. Kim, this isn't right.

254
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,837
MS. KIM

255
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,178
The phone is turned off.
You will be redirected to voicemail.

256
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,992
JICHEONG JEIL REAL ESTATE

257
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,123
The lady from the other day
wants to buy your restaurant.

258
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,249
Please give me a call.

259
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,629
I'll call the doctor.

260
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,048
No, Hye-joo.

261
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,009
I'm okay.

262
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,347
The realtor called.

263
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:05,018
Were you going to sell
the restaurant and flee

264
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,645
before I found out about you two?

265
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,274
Did you take the pills
because you got caught?

266
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:17,197
You know how much I suffered
because of what happened in the past.

267
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,866
How could you do this?

268
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,869
Did you hate me that much?

269
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:26,039
Did you want to make me suffer
even after you died?

270
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,793
I am

271
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,130
really mad at you,

272
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:34,923
but I never wanted you to die.

273
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,511
Don't you feel bad about it at all?

274
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,890
You couldn't do this if you do!

275
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,308
I'm sorry, Hye-joo.

276
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,106
I lied.

277
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,904
What else have you not told me?

278
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:01,366
I thought I was saving you
from bigger pain.

279
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,828
Cut the crap.

280
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,581
Just cut to the chase.

281
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,542
Nam Joong-do…

282
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,131
He…

283
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,635
raped me.

284
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,026
You're out of your mind.

285
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:47,204
JI-HOON'S GRADUATION

286
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,019
Don't come any closer.

287
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,647
I'm going to call the police.

288
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,031
I'm sorry.

289
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:25,993
I made a mistake.

290
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:30,789
Please forgive me.

291
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:32,291
"A mistake"?

292
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,168
You call that a mistake?

293
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,838
How can you call yourself human?

294
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,465
How could you…

295
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,384
How could you do that to me?

296
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,012
Please forgive me this once.

297
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,264
It will never happen again. I promise.

298
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:49,266
So…

299
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,478
please forget about…

300
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,565
what happened last night.

301
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,818
I truly regret it.

302
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,990
I will become a better assemblyman

303
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,534
and make up for what I've done.

304
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,746
Do you even hear yourself?

305
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,291
If Hye-joo finds out,

306
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,502
she won't be able to handle it.

307
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,172
Please, Yeo-jin.

308
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:27,971
How could you use Hye-joo as an excuse?

309
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,110
Yeo-jin.

310
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,655
Are you still feeling unwell?

311
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:51,703
I'll leave your medicine outside the door.

312
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,580
Take it and get better soon, okay?

313
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,559
COLD MEDICINE

314
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,277
Yeo-jin, are you sleeping?

315
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,908
I'm about to go to bed.

316
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:33,411
You've been sick for so long.

317
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,289
I made a doctor's appointment
for tomorrow. Let's go together.

318
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:38,625
Okay.

319
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:43,088
And I made some seaweed soup.

320
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:46,007
Tomorrow is Chae-eun's birthday.

321
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,098
Please give this to Chae-eun.

322
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:54,432
From Ji-hoon's mom.

323
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,941
Let's go together tomorrow.

324
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,237
Okay.

325
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,447
Good night.

326
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,199
Rest up.

327
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,139
That's the day I decided

328
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,184
to forget everything

329
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,520
and move on.

330
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,548
Yeo-jin, you're up.

331
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,592
Give me a second, honey. I'm almost done.

332
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,635
Take your time.

333
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:15,722
Are you going to work?

334
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,642
Yes.

335
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,729
Honey.

336
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:23,855
But…

337
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,900
-Don't forget this.
-Thanks.

338
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,819
-it wasn't easy.
-Won't you be cold, dressed like that?

339
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,699
You've been coming in
for five years already.

340
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,576
But if you don't tell me anything,

341
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,495
I can't help you.

342
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,207
I'm sorry.

343
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,835
I just need some sleeping pills.

344
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,681
Then why did you say
that it was an affair?

345
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,809
I thought the truth would

346
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,354
hurt you even more.

347
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,941
That's why I lied.

348
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,945
You wouldn't look any further

349
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:15,490
if you thought it was an affair.

350
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,538
What about that conversation

351
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,585
that Ji-hoon and Soo-bin
overheard that day?

352
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,926
It's a misunderstanding.

353
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:39,222
-A misunderstanding?
-I tried my best to forget about it

354
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,516
for the past five years.

355
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,227
But…

356
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:48,690
I still couldn't set foot into his study.

357
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,860
Just seeing the door ajar

358
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,280
suffocated me.

359
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,244
But that afternoon…

360
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,248
-Yeo-jin.
-Yes?

361
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,459
Have you seen any envelopes in my study?

362
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,047
I don't know. I never go in there.

363
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,508
You don't?

364
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,218
I thought you cleaned the study.

365
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,511
How can you…

366
00:27:20,638 --> 00:27:22,682
How can you even think
I could go in there?

367
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,768
-Why are you suddenly so upset?
-"Suddenly"?

368
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,227
Does this seem sudden to you?

369
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,521
I've never forgotten it for a moment.

370
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,109
Right. I'm sorry.

371
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,072
But I apologized for that.

372
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,492
I made a mistake.

373
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,576
Don't call it a mistake.

374
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:45,830
It wasn't a mistake.

375
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,083
Will you keep it down?

376
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,084
Why?

377
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,544
Are you afraid that Hye-joo will find out?

378
00:27:58,718 --> 00:27:59,719
Fine.

379
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,389
It may have been a mistake to you.

380
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:05,225
But I've been confused
and tormented ever since.

381
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:12,023
I can barely look Hye-joo in the eye.

382
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,821
Everything will be fine if you keep quiet.

383
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,406
-So--
-That's enough.

384
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,242
I don't want to talk about it anymore.

385
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,334
When he mentioned the study
so nonchalantly,

386
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,379
I couldn't hold back my anger.

387
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,762
And Ji-hoon must've gotten the wrong idea.

388
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,279
I still couldn't set foot into his study.

389
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,407
Just seeing the door ajar

390
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,701
suffocated me.

391
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,125
The study?

392
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:15,044
I don't want to misplace anything
in there by mistake.

393
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,546
I see.

394
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,922
Sure, I'll clean it.

395
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,341
Thanks.

396
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,856
Yeo-jin.

397
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:37,233
What's wrong?

398
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,986
Can you close the door?

399
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,780
Right.

400
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,989
Okay.

401
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,991
There's a cold breeze coming in, right?

402
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,160
Gosh.

403
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,762
Come in.

404
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,770
Let's talk inside. Yoon-seo is upstairs.

405
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,965
I thought

406
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,802
you were just coming down with the flu.

407
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,890
I thought you'd feel better…

408
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,644
after a good night's sleep.

409
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,315
But

410
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,818
you've been in pain…

411
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,364
all this time.

412
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,578
And I had no idea.

413
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,626
I'm sorry, Yeo-jin.

414
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,295
Yeo-jin.

415
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,464
I'm so sorry, Yeo-jin.

416
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:07,800
I'm sorry.

417
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,843
I'm…

418
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,140
I'm sorry.

419
00:32:14,974 --> 00:32:16,184
I'm…

420
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,187
I had no idea. I'm sorry, Yeo-jin.

421
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,647
I'm so sorry.

422
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,695
You are probably the one person
in the National Assembly

423
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,199
who cares the most about
the less privileged.

424
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,328
As I've been following
your activities over the years,

425
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:37,288
I wasn't surprised at all

426
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:40,249
to find out that you're the one
who proposed Namgoong Sol's Law.

427
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:41,960
Thank you.

428
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,339
Was her name Chae-eun?

429
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:49,509
The girl who was murdered by her father.

430
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,388
I covered your story
when you filed that appeal

431
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,557
to punish filicide as an aggravated crime.

432
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,726
I see.

433
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,354
You proposed the same bill
during your last term as well, right?

434
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,690
Although it didn't go through.

435
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,858
He proposed it this term too.

436
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,443
It's pending at the committee.

437
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,611
I see.

438
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:09,612
I knew it.

439
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:12,407
Chae-eun's mother and the other victims

440
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,909
must feel reassured to have you.

441
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,078
Thank you.

442
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,541
I don't think

443
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,543
I can report him.

444
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:24,919
Why not?

445
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,754
Let's go to the police together.

446
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:29,090
It's already been five years.

447
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,967
There's no evidence.

448
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,347
I'm sure we can find a way.

449
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,936
I know how hard it is to be called a liar.

450
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,565
I've seen it.

451
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,234
I was right by your side.

452
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:52,530
I…

453
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,616
just don't want to do that.

454
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,703
Plus…

455
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,168
he did help me with Chae-eun's case.

456
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,754
I'll just

457
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,341
keep living like I have so far.

458
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,562
Assemblyman Nam stated
that he had evidence

459
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,774
of Assemblyman Kang providing
his in-laws with sensitive information

460
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,776
about the MOLIT's land development plans.

461
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,778
He plans to report it to the police.

462
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,323
As soon as Lee,
Kang's sister-in-law, purchased the land,

463
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,867
-the development plans were announced,
-Seung-hee.

464
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,787
-causing the price to skyrocket.
-Seung-hee. Where did she go?

465
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,996
Seung-hee!

466
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,465
Seung-hee.

467
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:01,349
I heard everything about your husband.

468
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,272
Do another interview.

469
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,442
Say that you lied yesterday

470
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,569
and that you framed Seung-ho.

471
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,531
If you don't,

472
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:21,577
I'll go public with
what your husband did to that woman.

473
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,959
Hold on.

474
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,170
The owner of this place
is related to that case.

475
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,965
-No way. Are you serious?
-Yes.

476
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,383
The kid who killed himself

477
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:37,677
after molesting that assemblyman's wife
when she was young?

478
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,721
That was the owner's son.

479
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:44,725
And that man, Nam Joong-do,
is the victim's husband.

480
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,895
He seems determined to take revenge.

481
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,156
It was a mistake.

482
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,452
It was an accident.

483
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,957
It was one mistake.

484
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,971
How could you call that a mistake?

485
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,809
You can't do something
like that by mistake.

486
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,854
Wake up! You didn't just have an affair.

487
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:33,733
How?

488
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,694
I mean…

489
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,779
Why did you do it?

490
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,326
That day, I--

491
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,410
No.

492
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,413
Don't say anything.

493
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:51,125
I don't want to hear your excuses
and I have no reason to.

494
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,376
Just stop talking.

495
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,676
I'm sorry.

496
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,388
It's all my fault.

497
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:10,102
How could you do something so heinous…

498
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,732
and preach Namgoong Sol's Law?

499
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,236
Did you never feel guilty about it?

500
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:23,616
Did you completely erase the incident
from your memory?

501
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,825
No.

502
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,079
That was the reason
I was so obsessed with the bill.

503
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,709
It was the guilt driving me at first,
but after hearing your story,

504
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,836
I became determined to push it.

505
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,756
I thought passing this law

506
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,508
would be my atonement.

507
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,804
I've truly repented
and tried my best to live righteously.

508
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,349
You know how I lived
for the past few years.

509
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,018
Don't ever say that you lived righteously.

510
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,814
You betrayed Yeo-jin, me,

511
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,569
and the trust of all the people
who voted for you.

512
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:04,031
And you're sitting there
telling me you lived righteously?

513
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,830
Turn yourself in.

514
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,874
If you don't, I'll disclose everything.

515
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,626
I'm sorry, but I can't.

516
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:17,753
What did you say?

517
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,215
Namgoong Sol's Law is gaining support.

518
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,759
It might really get passed.

519
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,012
I'm the one who proposed it.

520
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,556
If I turn myself in right now,

521
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,100
that'll be the end of the law--

522
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,560
Enough already!

523
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:36,147
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing about that!

524
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,532
What about Yoon-seo?

525
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,621
What will happen to her if this gets out?

526
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:57,126
Will she be able to go to school?

527
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,047
Will you be okay with that?

528
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,259
How dare you even say her name?

529
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,909
Do you know what I asked Soo-bin
when she first came to our house

530
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,911
and said she was carrying Ji-hoon's baby?

531
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,622
By any chance,

532
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:40,544
did Ji-hoon force you in any way
without your consent?

533
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,754
Did he force himself on me?

534
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:45,883
No, it wasn't like that.

535
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,554
I felt terrible afterward.

536
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,599
I'm his mom,

537
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,936
and I had suspected him
of doing such a thing.

538
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,777
But I've never doubted you.

539
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,823
Because never in my wildest dreams
did I think you'd do something like this.

540
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,950
That's how much I trusted you.

541
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,124
Do you know why Ji-hoon made the mistake

542
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,334
of believing you were having an affair?

543
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,673
It's because

544
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,301
he also trusted you.

545
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,100
He never imagined
that you would do something like this!

546
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,561
That's why he thought
it was just an affair!

547
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,385
SONMAT NOODLES

548
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:14,597
The owner of this restaurant
tried to kill herself? Why?

549
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,514
I don't know.

550
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:18,517
But there were ambulances
and everything here last night.

551
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,940
-Excuse me.
-Goodness.

552
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,901
-Gosh, you scared me.
-The owner lady…

553
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:27,860
Yes?

554
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,488
Did she really try to kill herself?

555
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,073
Yes, but I don't know

556
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,534
what happened
after she was taken to the hospital.

557
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:36,619
Why?

558
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,122
Do you know which hospital?

559
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,875
Probably Jeongsun Medical Center.

560
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:45,002
It's the closest hospital.

561
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,962
Wait, so who are you?

562
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:51,217
CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

563
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,099
You knew?

564
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,024
-Yes, sir.
-When did you find out?

565
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,192
Never mind that.

566
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,444
How much did you know?

567
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,661
Everything, sir.

568
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:32,007
At first, I thought you were
just having an affair.

569
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,427
You're cheating on Mom with Aunt Yeo-jin!

570
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,720
I'm going to tell Mom.

571
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,805
That's not true!

572
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,183
Why won't you let your mom live in peace?

573
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:44,186
Plus, do you really think
she'd believe you?

574
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:50,568
Back then, I thought it would be fine
as long as I kept my mouth shut.

575
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,653
Because Ji-hoon was

576
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,490
no longer around to disclose it.

577
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,202
But that was a miscalculation on my part.

578
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,830
I'll be going now.

579
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,959
Assemblyman Nam…

580
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,964
sexually assaulted me.

581
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:15,509
Sorry?

582
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,221
What did you just say?

583
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,601
Five years ago,

584
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,438
I was raped…

585
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,944
by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

586
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,491
But if I knew anything about you,

587
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,578
it was that you never make
the same mistake twice.

588
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,082
Don't…

589
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:49,918
do anything.

590
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,963
If people find out about this,

591
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,091
you won't be able
to handle the consequences.

592
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,802
The media will dig into it persistently,

593
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,513
and it'll be the talk of the town.

594
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,018
But most of all,
Ms. Kim will be utterly shocked.

595
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:12,733
In the end, you'll be left alone.

596
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:17,237
I'm saying this for your own good.

597
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,994
I advise you…

598
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,665
to forget about this.

599
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,881
I thought everything would be fine
if I quietly handled it myself.

600
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:39,718
I believed it would be better
if you stayed in politics.

601
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,638
For me…

602
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,518
and for this world.

603
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,067
After what happened,

604
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,862
I worked like a dog…

605
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,366
to make this world a better place.

606
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,204
I believed that was my way of atonement.

607
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,835
Do you think Ms. Kim will
stay quiet about this?

608
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:21,093
I'll just have to believe that she will.

609
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,615
No.

610
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,533
Please don't get up.

611
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:51,957
Hello.

612
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,294
This is the first time we meet formally.

613
00:45:55,961 --> 00:46:00,048
So what brings you here at this hour?

614
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,181
Five years ago,

615
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,517
my husband, Assemblyman Nam,

616
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,938
sexually assaulted a woman.

617
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,819
Yes.

618
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,197
Okay.

619
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:31,622
Ms. Kim is speaking in private
with Chairwoman Woo at the moment.

620
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:41,298
I would go to the police,

621
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,260
but I'm worried that
it won't be properly investigated,

622
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,096
or that I'll end up
getting even more hurt.

623
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,767
Most importantly, the victim is scared.

624
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,230
She's afraid of the consequences
of this going public.

625
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,816
I don't know what to do.

626
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,363
That's why I'm here.

627
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:08,325
After all, you're the one who chose him.

628
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,922
If I were you…

629
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,637
I'd keep quiet about it.

630
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:47,864
I didn't think

631
00:47:49,074 --> 00:47:50,576
Namgoong Sol's Law would pass

632
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:53,120
due to many juridical issues.

633
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:56,582
But with such enthusiastic
support from the public,

634
00:47:57,165 --> 00:47:59,042
even if it doesn't pass,

635
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,713
I believe it could bring about
some meaningful changes.

636
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,257
However,

637
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,344
if people find out
that the very person who proposed the bill

638
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,263
is guilty of sexual assault,

639
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,351
isn't it obvious
what would become of the bill?

640
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:20,856
Ms. Kim.

641
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:23,775
Didn't you want the bill to pass as well?

642
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,201
He tells me

643
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,621
that he has repented

644
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,665
and worked hard for the good of the world.

645
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,002
And he asks me to put the bill first.

646
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:45,505
But I'm very confused.

647
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,468
To think that his efforts

648
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:52,220
really have been genuine and sincere,

649
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,223
it feels wrong and disgusting.

650
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:58,602
But to think that he's been
putting on an act all along…

651
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,230
I'd be so disheartened and miserable.

652
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,777
I'm so lost.

653
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,363
At this point,

654
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,407
I'm starting to doubt
whether it even matters

655
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,868
if his intention
for pushing this bill is sincere.

656
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:22,876
You see,

657
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,881
I have no intention
of defending his crime.

658
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:29,383
However,

659
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,343
let me tell you this

660
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,930
as someone who's in politics
for the people and the society.

661
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:39,559
If Assemblyman Nam remains in politics,

662
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,270
the world will change for the better

663
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:45,524
with Namgoong Sol's law and more.

664
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:46,608
It will probably

665
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,486
put this world closer

666
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:53,156
to your image of an ideal world.

667
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,202
But some may believe

668
00:49:57,786 --> 00:50:01,581
that we must sacrifice
Namgoong Sol's Law among others

669
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:06,211
and shed light on
what Assemblyman Nam has done

670
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:09,214
for this world to become a better place.

671
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,676
So…

672
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:18,432
as for which option will
change this world for the better,

673
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,477
it's up to you to decide.

674
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,365
So please,

675
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,743
Yeo-jin.

676
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,245
Please keep quiet about this.

677
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:44,875
I'll

678
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,127
retire from politics as soon
as the bill passes.

679
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,964
So please.

680
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,300
I beg of you.

681
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,430
Your silence will

682
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,558
change the world for the better.

683
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,436
I promise.

684
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,854
So please help me.

685
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,356
I beg of you.

686
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,154
Piece of shit.

687
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:28,960
1 ITEM SELECTED

688
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:30,378
DELETE VIDEO

689
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,466
It's not synced to a cloud drive.

690
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:36,927
So that's it.

691
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:38,845
It doesn't matter.

692
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,681
I heard everything.

693
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,851
Who will believe you
when you have no proof?

694
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,606
I guess we'll find out

695
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,399
whether they'll believe me or not.

696
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:56,613
Here.

697
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,324
This is your last warning.

698
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:30,689
Excuse me.

699
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:33,733
Aren't you Assemblyman Nam's wife?

700
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,595
Ms. Hyeon.

701
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,056
I heard everything.

702
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,477
About what Mr. Nam did to you.

703
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:16,318
Call the police right now.

704
00:53:21,197 --> 00:53:23,575
Why won't you answer me?

705
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,661
If you don't do it, I will.

706
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:28,580
Soo-bin.

707
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,042
What do you think you're doing?

708
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,251
Don't do this to her.

709
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,420
She won't take it to the police.

710
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:37,088
You can't force her to do that.

711
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,173
I'm not.

712
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,009
I'm telling her to reveal the truth.

713
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:42,844
Soo-bin.

714
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:46,222
No one's suffering more than her.

715
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:51,895
I was devastated when my incident
became public against my will

716
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,146
and I still am.

717
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,148
So please.

718
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:57,442
Don't do this to her.

719
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:58,401
Also,

720
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,863
don't tell anyone about this.

721
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,781
Please.

722
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,963
When you appeared on the news yesterday,

723
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,967
you lied that Ji-hoon was a sex offender.

724
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:27,097
Because of you,

725
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:32,018
people are now spreading rumors
saying he was a serial sex offender.

726
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,482
You turned him into a sex offender.

727
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:42,445
Why are you turning a blind eye
to the real sex offender?

728
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,123
If this comes to light,

729
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,709
that'll be the end of Namgoong Sol's Law.

730
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,298
I went through something similar
when I was young.

731
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:06,469
I don't feel bad that he's dead.

732
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:09,097
I actually think he deserved it.

733
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,182
However,

734
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:13,768
people criticized me

735
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:17,397
for telling a lie
and causing a person to die.

736
00:55:18,857 --> 00:55:19,858
I hope

737
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:22,569
that bill will be passed

738
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,113
so that there won't be any more victims

739
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,198
like us.

740
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,580
Countless people are desperately waiting
for Namgoong Sol's Law,

741
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:37,459
and I don't want
there to be any more victims.

742
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,253
So…

743
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,798
I believe keeping this a secret

744
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,719
will ultimately be
the better decision for this world.

745
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,437
You know what it's like

746
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,358
to be falsely branded as a liar
and to suffer because of it.

747
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,238
And now…

748
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,075
you say you want to reveal the truth,

749
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,996
but you're turning a blind eye
to another truth.

750
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,710
Are you really okay with that?

751
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:04,856
Yoon-seo.

752
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,900
Yes?

753
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,785
I'm…

754
00:58:24,626 --> 00:58:25,585
I'm…

755
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:37,597
I AM KIM HYE-JOO,
THE WIFE OF ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO…

756
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:50,735
I am Kim Hye-joo.

757
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:56,908
My son…

758
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:02,705
did not sexually assault anyone.

759
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,000
I…

760
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,419
NAM'S WIFE KIM HYE-JOO'S PRESS CONFERENCE

761
00:59:08,503 --> 00:59:11,047
lied despite knowing the truth.

762
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,216
And…

763
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,678
my husband…

764
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:34,153
sexually assaulted a woman five years ago.

765
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:13,151
