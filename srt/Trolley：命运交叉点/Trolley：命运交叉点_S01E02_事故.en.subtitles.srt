1
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,221
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you.

2
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,098
What did you say?

3
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,018
I'm pregnant.

4
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,147
-Excuse me?
-I'm…

5
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,067
pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby.

6
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,324
You're…

7
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:18,495
pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby?

8
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,497
Yes.

9
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,545
The police found a gram of methamphetamine

10
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:29,756
in the pocket of Assemblyman Nam's son

11
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,509
whose body was found 15 days ago.

12
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,970
According to Sinyang Police Station,

13
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,889
they found a small resealable bag

14
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,683
containing one gram of methamphetamine

15
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:42,393
as well as a burner phone.

16
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,479
To investigate the details of his death…

17
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:03,206
Oh, right.

18
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:10,547
Here.

19
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,217
No, you don't have to show me this.

20
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,263
And I also have this.

21
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,645
The pregnancy test kit can be inaccurate,

22
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,981
so I had a blood test
at the hospital yesterday.

23
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,902
This number means I'm five weeks pregnant,

24
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,821
so I got pregnant three weeks ago.

25
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,158
That's about ten days after
Ji-hoon's release,

26
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,536
and three or four days
before his accident.

27
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,249
I can't really pinpoint the exact date.

28
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:50,128
I said I'll take the sonogram next time.

29
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,094
And this is just my normal belly.

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,776
I should probably show you
a photo we took together,

31
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,946
but I lost my phone yesterday…

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,619
so I'll just tell you in words.

33
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,872
Ji-hoon and I really dated.

34
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,376
We met through mutual friends.

35
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,212
You recently got him
a studio apartment, right?

36
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,506
Unit 507, Ujeong Apartment. Split-level.

37
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,675
We stayed there together.

38
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,442
Did Ji-hoon know

39
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,986
that you were pregnant, Soo-bin?

40
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,864
No.

41
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,867
I only found out yesterday.

42
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,501
Were you at the funeral hall?

43
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,088
Yes, of course.

44
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,590
Sinyang Funeral Home. That huge hall.

45
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,970
I was a bit out of it on that day,

46
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,974
but I don't recall
seeing any of Ji-hoon's friends.

47
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,559
Nobody else came?

48
00:04:29,185 --> 00:04:30,603
I can't believe them.

49
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:35,316
Don't worry about them.
They were probably all too shocked.

50
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:39,946
I went alone,
but I didn't sign the guest book.

51
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,739
It didn't feel right.

52
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,994
There were a lot of visitors.

53
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,080
I stood in line with strangers
and lit incense.

54
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,834
It's fine if you can't remember.

55
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,925
But I haven't been to his columbarium.

56
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,303
I don't know where it is.

57
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,307
Please take me with you next time.

58
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,604
I want to say goodbye to him.

59
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,777
Sure. Thank you.

60
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:27,368
So…

61
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,164
do your parents know about this situation?

62
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,708
No.

63
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,877
I don't have any parents.

64
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,503
Just like you.

65
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,968
Ji-hoon told me.

66
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,845
I didn't do any digging.

67
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,309
Speaking of which…

68
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,230
could you let me stay here?

69
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,364
THE ACCIDENT

70
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,578
Come on, please.

71
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,165
Can you call me? It's urgent.

72
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:23,382
ASSEMBLYMEN'S OFFICE

73
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,436
YEO-JIN

74
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,786
Would you like something to drink?

75
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,746
I have coffee…

76
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,082
Am I allowed to have coffee?

77
00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:00,962
I'm not sure.
Some people have one cup a day.

78
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,091
Then I'll take juice or tea.

79
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,968
Just to be safe.

80
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:09,512
Sure.

81
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,713
GREAT ASSEMBLYMAN AWARD

82
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:44,964
Assemblyman Kang.

83
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,216
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG SOON-HONG

84
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:55,433
Goodness, look how incompetent he is.

85
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,978
He let his son's narcotics case
get exposed in the news?

86
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:03,399
"One must keep his home in peace
to reign the world in peace."

87
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,279
How can he manage state affairs

88
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,240
when he can't even bring up
his son properly?

89
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,328
-Hyeong-tae.
-Yes, sir.

90
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,706
Put on the National Assembly TV.

91
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,128
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of the Daehan Party

92
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,381
must take responsibility for covering up
his eldest son's drug possession,

93
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,050
the suspicion of abuse

94
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,136
for the special favor he called in
for an investigation

95
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:35,181
at Sinyang Police Station,
and step down from his office.

96
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,642
A simple runaway case
involving his daughter

97
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,977
led to an emergency dispatch

98
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,063
of 30 violent crime unit detectives.

99
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:45,316
This is obviously an abuse of position
and power in his electoral district

100
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,860
by Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

101
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:51,030
To our people, Assemblyman Nam Joong-do…

102
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,536
There's a lot of malicious comments
calling him a junkie.

103
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,828
We have no excuses.

104
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,038
I mean, methamphetamine?

105
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,209
I know I shouldn't speak ill of the dead,

106
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,420
but this is awful.
How are we going to patch this up?

107
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,674
Honestly, if it didn't end here,

108
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:11,217
he might have done something worse.

109
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,929
The Nation and People's Party
is probably thrilled right now.

110
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,016
They're conflating this
and his missing daughter's investigation.

111
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,435
Who would sit around and wait

112
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,063
when you can't reach
your teenage daughter all night?

113
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:25,606
We pay taxes and have police stations

114
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:28,359
so that they can help us
when our kids go missing.

115
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:29,735
And how could they do this…

116
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,447
to someone who just lost his son?

117
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,199
They're just awful.

118
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,537
We're in Yeouido.
You know how it is in politics.

119
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:50,923
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO

120
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:04,145
NEW MESSAGES
MISSED CALLS

121
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,698
Hello, Chief.

122
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:29,003
Is there something you want to say to me?

123
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,591
Well, by any chance…

124
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,468
Yes?

125
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,929
Did Ji-hoon…

126
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,946
Hello.

127
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,116
Nice to meet you.

128
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,083
You lost your phone,

129
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,752
so you don't have any photos of him
or text messages?

130
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,963
Then how are we supposed to believe

131
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,591
that you and Ji-hoon were
in a relationship?

132
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:20,054
I already explained everything to her.

133
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,057
Do you want me to make a drawing
of his apartment unit?

134
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:26,060
That's information
that all his other friends could have.

135
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,561
I lived there with him.

136
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:33,109
Ji-hoon got into this incident
fifteen days after his release.

137
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:36,570
I think it's an exaggeration

138
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:40,491
to say you lived with him
after spending 15 days together.

139
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,412
Fifteen days aren't that short.

140
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:47,289
We did everything we possibly could.

141
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,421
You may not have met your parents
after their divorce,

142
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:54,547
but you have their numbers, right?

143
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,756
No.

144
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,508
I don't even know where they live.

145
00:11:57,591 --> 00:11:59,635
Do you have any other guardians?

146
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,762
There aren't any.

147
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm an adult. I'm not a teenager.

148
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,061
I don't even know your age.

149
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,564
How old are you? What about school?

150
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,857
I was born in 2001.

151
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,193
The same as Ji-hoon. I'm 22.

152
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,070
I dropped out of Seongseol High.

153
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,323
And I wasn't expelled.

154
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,825
I just didn't want to go.

155
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,292
Will you

156
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:33,335
have the baby?

157
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,049
I don't know. What should I do?

158
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,802
My goodness.

159
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,804
Hye-joo.

160
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,306
Did you hear that?

161
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,016
You did, right?

162
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:48,642
Unbelievable.

163
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,112
His blood tested negative
for blood tests for illegal drugs,

164
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:04,241
but his blood alcohol level was
at a level of acute alcohol intoxication.

165
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:07,244
-I see.
-I tried not to let the news get out

166
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,538
about your son's drug possession, but…

167
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,167
It's okay.

169
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:16,420
I didn't expect it to be hidden forever.

170
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,590
But Assemblyman Nam.

171
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,676
Narcotics made a series
of arrests recently,

172
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,514
and they discovered a connection
to your son's burner phone.

173
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,142
And according to a confession,
one of the drop-off points

174
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,145
includes a restroom
on the bank of the Han River.

175
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,774
And your son was caught on the camera…

176
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,158
at the entrance of the restroom.

177
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,235
You haven't heard from Joong-do yet?

178
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,738
No, I left him a message,
but he hasn't called. He must be busy.

179
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,949
So I haven't called again.

180
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,702
Right. He'll be home later anyway.

181
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,128
Yeo-jin, excuse me.

182
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,965
Hey, Yoon-seo.

183
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:47,011
Right, okay.

184
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,314
Who's Yoon-seo?

185
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:02,610
I'm guessing Ji-hoon never told you
about his younger sister.

186
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,363
I see.

187
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,165
I don't know why
they found it in his pocket,

188
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,584
but I'm sure that it wasn't his.

189
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,461
Everything is okay with Dad too,

190
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:23,339
so focus on your class,
and come straight home afterward.

191
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:24,340
Okay?

192
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,550
Come straight home.

NEWS

194
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,604
NAM PRESSED TO RESIGN
DUE TO SCANDAL SURROUNDING HIS CHILDREN

195
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,197
I'm pleased that
we were able to build new roads

196
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,698
for Seonghan District 2

197
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:52,076
as part of the public redevelopment plan.

198
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,955
The residents here
have suffered long enough

199
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,625
because of the deteriorating
roads and buildings.

200
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,918
-Yes.
-He's right.

201
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,296
The project was delayed
because it lacked business potential.

202
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,383
Let me pour you a glass.

203
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,052
Assemblyman Nam, allow me to pour you one.

204
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,304
-Goodness.
-There's no need for formalities.

205
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,223
Goodness, thank you.

206
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,893
Thank you for joining us for a meeting
despite the circumstances.

207
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,062
Of course, I should be here. Thank you.

208
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,772
Cheer up, Assemblyman Nam.

209
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,649
Thank you.

210
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:24,733
Sure thing.

211
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,943
He can really drink.

212
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,987
-Let me pour you one.
-Thank you.

213
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,572
RESERVATIONS
ROOM 1, JICHEONG HIGH, 41ST CLASS

214
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,824
It must have been tough.

215
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,493
You could use a drink.

216
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,453
Thanks for coming.

217
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:40,332
Work is important,
but come out and meet us too.

218
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,209
-Sure.
-Cheers.

219
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:44,837
-To Jicheong High!
-Jicheong High!

220
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,634
You've got to meet people.

221
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,261
STOP LYING. WE KNOW IT WAS METH.
R.I.P. MR. JUNKIE

222
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,721
Everything will be fine.

223
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,181
-To Jicheong High!
-Jicheong High!

224
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,351
We're meeting again next time.

225
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,853
Of course.

226
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,479
-Joong-do.
-See you later.

227
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,648
Let's grab a drink soon.

228
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:06,442
-Okay, I'll be in touch.
-Okay.

229
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,485
-Please drive safely.
-Sure.

230
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,695
Let's go.

231
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,449
Please get the car ready.

232
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,248
Are you all right, sir?

233
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm fine.

234
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:57,993
Ms. Kim.

235
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,789
She's coming.

236
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,336
Hello.

237
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,962
-Hello.
-Hello.

238
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,800
Assemblyman Nam had
a little too much to drink today.

239
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,052
He rarely does that.

240
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,262
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

241
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,014
Let me escort him inside.

242
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,015
Actually, Woo-jae…

243
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,779
So?

244
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,031
What does she want?

245
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,785
She wants a place to stay.
She has nowhere to go.

246
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:47,167
What about the baby? What's her plan?

247
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,754
She doesn't know yet.

248
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,549
She doesn't know?

249
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,344
She must be a bit confused about it all.

250
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,721
She's young

251
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,349
and her pregnancy was out of the blue.

252
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,477
And…

253
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,355
Ji-hoon isn't around either.

254
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,195
But honey.

255
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,574
As for the baby,

256
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,910
whatever she decides to do with her baby,

257
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,581
we don't have any right
to tell her what to do.

258
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:26,623
You know that, right?

259
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,876
I know.

260
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,127
I do…

261
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:34,590
but even so, she barged in and asked you
to let her stay without any plans?

262
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,843
I told you. She has no money
and nowhere to go.

263
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,179
If we let her stay for a few days,

264
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,681
she'll figure out what to do.

265
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,395
I'll tell her she can stay for--

266
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,688
No, send her elsewhere.

267
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:52,232
Can you look into it?

268
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,027
Elsewhere? Why?

269
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:56,987
I don't want her.

270
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,532
-You don't want her?
-No, I don't.

271
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,701
I don't want her in our home.

272
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,703
Wait.

273
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,415
I mean, honey.

274
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,920
She's pregnant with Ji-hoon's child

275
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:14,546
and she had nowhere to go.

276
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,008
And you want me to send her away
just because you don't want her?

277
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,595
Why do you want to let her stay so badly?

278
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:30,562
She just reminds me of myself.

279
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,984
She has no parents, no money,
and nowhere to go.

280
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,653
YOUNGSAN TO GANGNAM

281
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,696
It reminds me of myself…

282
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,824
What took you so long?

283
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,577
-…when I first came to Seoul.
-Goodness.

284
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,126
I know how it feels to be alone

285
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,963
with nobody to depend on.

286
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:59,466
How can I tell her to go elsewhere
when I have a perfectly fine home?

287
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:09,142
And I was just her age
when I had Yoon-seo.

288
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,144
At least I had you then.

289
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,564
But she's completely alone.

290
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:18,944
Do you believe her?

291
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,822
That Ji-hoon is the father?

292
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:24,992
Honey.

293
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,911
How can you believe her? Can she prove it?

294
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,122
No, right?

295
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,416
So how can you believe her?

296
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,212
What about you?

297
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:41,591
How do you know Yoon-seo is your daughter?

298
00:21:58,692 --> 00:21:59,860
Hello.

299
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,403
Nice to meet you.

300
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,698
Honey.

301
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,670
Is Ji-hoon really the father?

302
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:20,964
Honey.

303
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,763
Don't lie to me. Is it true?

304
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,974
Yes.

305
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:35,645
Honey, let's talk tomorrow.
You had too much to drink.

306
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,607
Do you want to know
when, where, and how we did it?

307
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,526
Or whether he was any good?

308
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,450
I guess you don't want to believe it.

309
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,243
Fine.

310
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:51,703
I understand.

311
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,540
I'll get an abortion.

312
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,753
-Wait…
-I heard it's not illegal anymore.

313
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,465
It'll look great on the news too.

314
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,384
I had a kid with an assemblyman's son,

315
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:08,386
but they kicked me out of their house.

316
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,181
Interesting, right?

317
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:17,270
Hey.

318
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:19,731
Yoon-seo.

319
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,733
-Watch what you say.
-Yoon-seo.

320
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,361
My dad isn't someone
you can talk to like that.

321
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,322
And the same goes for Nam Ji-hoon.

322
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,783
-No matter how big of a scumbag he was--
-Scumbag?

323
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,202
Hey.

324
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,335
I never thought he was a scumbag.

325
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,339
That's why I'm in this mess.

326
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:46,675
This mess?

327
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,554
Yes, you got into this mess
because you live like that.

328
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,264
-That's enough, Yoon-seo.
-You're right.

329
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,226
And that's why Nam Ji-hoon
ended up like that.

330
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,228
-Soo-bin.
-What?

331
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,313
Hey, are you done?

332
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,816
-Yoon-seo, what's with you?
-Let go of me, Mom!

333
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,943
-You crazy bitch.
-That's enough, Yoon-seo.

334
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,529
Do you even hear yourself?
You got him into drugs, didn't you?

335
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,322
-It was yours, isn't it?
-Drugs?

336
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,907
-Yoon-seo.
-Yes, drugs!

337
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,535
They found meth on Ji-hoon.
Wasn't it yours?

338
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,703
It wasn't me.

339
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:15,704
It really wasn't me.

340
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,039
I don't know anything about that.

341
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,000
-Stop pretending!
-Nam Yoon-seo!

342
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,502
I told you to stop.

343
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,921
You should also watch it.

344
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,132
Dad.

345
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,050
She's just a crazy bitch.

346
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:30,802
So just kick her out now.

347
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,888
Yoon-seo, cut it out and go upstairs.

348
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,432
-Yeo-jin, can you take her?
-Yoon-seo, let's go up--

349
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:39,019
-No, I'm not going up.
-That's enough! The adults are talking!

350
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:39,936
Why?

351
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,105
Why do I have to stay out of it?

352
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,566
I'm a part of this family too.
I'm Ji-hoon's sister!

353
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,776
-Nam Yoon-seo!
-To be frank,

354
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,197
I used to wish
that he would die all the time.

355
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,241
He always ended up on the news
and got in Dad's way

356
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,492
and broke your heart.

357
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,286
So I wished…

358
00:24:57,495 --> 00:25:00,457
that he would just die all the time.

359
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:02,584
But…

360
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:06,046
But I didn't think he actually would.

361
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,891
You said that he was a scumbag yourself.

362
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,022
Yes, and you're pregnant
with a scumbag's kid.

363
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,649
-Congratulations.
-Nam Yoon-seo!

364
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:27,359
That's enough, Nam Yoon-seo!

365
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,445
Why?

366
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,364
Why are you yelling at me?

367
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:49,798
That's enough.

368
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,343
It doesn't matter if what you say is true.

369
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,137
This is Ji-hoon's home,
and they're his family.

370
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,683
Are you here to blackmail them?

371
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,476
You're not.

372
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:04,312
But if you keep running your mouth
like you are right now,

373
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,273
that's what you'd be doing.

374
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,276
But that's not you.

375
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:12,570
You got pregnant while dating him,

376
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,739
and Ji-hoon got into
an unfortunate accident.

377
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,575
That's why you came to his parents' house.

378
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,537
You didn't have any ulterior motives.

379
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:22,163
Right?

380
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,937
You can stay in Ji-hoon's room for now.

381
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,774
This is the bathroom.

382
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,900
And his room is…

383
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,534
this way. Follow me.

384
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,382
Yes?

385
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,264
Here.

386
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,144
I'm not sure if these clothes will fit.

387
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,985
My room is right across from you,
so let me know if you need anything.

388
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,404
Okay.

389
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,450
Get some rest, then.

390
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,458
Actually, there's something
I meant to ask you.

391
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,753
Sure.

392
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,339
By any chance, did Ji-hoon…

393
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:01,471
force you in any way without your consent?

394
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,397
Did he force himself on me?

395
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:14,818
No, it wasn't like that.

396
00:28:17,237 --> 00:28:19,406
Ji-hoon wasn't that low.

397
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:22,450
If he had, I would be at a police station.

398
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,914
Right.

399
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,292
Okay, then. Get some rest.

400
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,307
Please head inside.
I'm going to have a smoke.

401
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,435
May I have one too?

402
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,279
I didn't know you smoked.

403
00:29:43,072 --> 00:29:44,699
I quit on the day of the ruling.

404
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:49,037
It felt so unfair
that I wanted to live long.

405
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,930
It's been a while since we saw
each other over Ji-hoon's case.

406
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,432
It was so hectic
that I didn't even get to say hi.

407
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:12,435
-Have you been well?
-Yes, I'm all right.

408
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,064
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

409
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:21,027
What should we do with her?

410
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,363
She doesn't know
if she'll have the baby or not.

411
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,409
If she wants an abortion,

412
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:31,996
we just have to make sure
we didn't pressure her, and that's it.

413
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,708
Don't look for a hospital
or pay for her fees.

414
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,502
We can't have anything to do with it.

415
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,420
Okay.

416
00:30:39,504 --> 00:30:41,172
But what if she wants to keep it?

417
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,842
That's not bad news for Assemblyman Nam.

418
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,762
It could be used
to appeal to the pro-life side.

419
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,390
As you know,

420
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,602
you never know which side's votes
you'll need in politics.

421
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,564
If we need their votes, we'll use that.

422
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:01,901
And if she gives birth,
leaves the baby here,

423
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,778
and Ms. Kim ends up raising him,

424
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,073
that will be an even better story.

425
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,284
It will be a touching story.

426
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:16,249
It seems like you're all ready
for the general election.

427
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,625
The general election?

428
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,543
I guess so.

429
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:21,462
This general election,
and the one after this…

430
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:23,631
I should be prepared.

431
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,138
I'll take it. I'll throw it out at home.

432
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,598
It's all right. Right here.

433
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,475
I can put it in here.

434
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,103
You carry that around too?

435
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:47,947
The moment any evidence is left behind,
I'll become a lawbreaker.

436
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,825
I can't hold Assemblyman Nam back

437
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:53,286
from doing great work in the future.

438
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,789
I'm saying all kinds of nonsense today.

439
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,833
I'll get going.

440
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,668
-Goodbye, then.
-Get home safely.

441
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:09,552
You should make that your last cigarette.

442
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,597
You should live a long life.

443
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,723
Goodbye.

444
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,420
Too many things are
happening to us lately.

445
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,343
I saw the news earlier.

446
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,638
They say you received special favor
in the investigation.

447
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,766
You don't need to worry about it.

448
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,144
That will blow over soon.

449
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,730
It's not a big deal.

450
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,571
Right.

451
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,242
Take that girl to a hospital
and get her tested for drugs.

452
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,035
Drugs?

453
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,247
Drug testing is mandatory for teachers,
and a lot of hospitals do it.

454
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,917
Call and find a hospital
that reports same-day results.

455
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,294
Do we really have to go that far?

456
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,882
You saw how alarmed she was
when Yoon-seo mentioned drugs.

457
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:31,801
It wasn't her.

458
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,223
Think rationally.

459
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,059
You'll want to believe she's a good girl,

460
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,728
but it's only because our situation is…

461
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,065
so shitty.

462
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,861
You just don't want things
to get any worse.

463
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,238
Think about this rationally.

464
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,615
She's a total stranger we've never met.

465
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,702
And you want to let
a complete stranger sleep here.

466
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,956
You and I were total strangers at first.

467
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,875
Everyone is a stranger at first.

468
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:05,501
She's not just a stranger!

469
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,337
She's one of Ji-hoon's friends.

470
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,674
Did you forget what he was like?

471
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,968
He sunk so low as to buy drugs!

472
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,429
Thankfully, he hadn't used them yet,

473
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,097
but don't you think he would have

474
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,225
if it wasn't for the accident?

475
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:25,897
And even if Ji-hoon
didn't get the drugs from her,

476
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,066
how do we know that she isn't a junkie?

477
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:31,736
She's pregnant right now, honey.

478
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,488
Try visiting a prison.

479
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,491
There are tons of pregnant drug offenders.

480
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:51,839
That's just who our son was.

481
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,051
Someone with meth in their pocket.

482
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:58,638
At the very least,
he associated with others like that.

483
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,723
That's the fact.

484
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,561
Just face the truth like it is,

485
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,190
although I'm sure
you didn't think of him like that.

486
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:20,993
You should go to bed.

487
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,552
By any chance, did Ji-hoon…

488
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:42,890
force you in any way without your consent?

489
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:50,898
No, it wasn't like that.

490
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,486
Ji-hoon wasn't that low.

491
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,992
Although I'm sure
you didn't think of him like that.

492
00:36:53,753 --> 00:36:56,714
How do you know Yoon-seo is your daughter?

493
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,508
Because it's you.

494
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,179
Because I trust you.

495
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,224
But you see,

496
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,560
I don't trust anyone else
but you, Hye-joo.

497
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,419
-Hello.
-Did you get a good night's sleep?

498
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,046
-Yes.
-Assemblyman Nam Joong-do.

499
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,340
Reporter Jung Gyeong-eun of SBC.

500
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:46,592
What do you have to say
about the allegations of you

501
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,302
-receiving favor from the Sinyang Police?
-Hey.

502
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,970
You need to schedule an interview.

503
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,568
-Stop filming.
-When did you

504
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,570
first learn of your son's drug possession?

505
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,781
If you had known, did you cover it up?

506
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:12,493
Then this seems relevant
to the special favor you received.

507
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,287
-Well, that's…
-That's not it!

508
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,291
-Honey.
-You're wrong.

509
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,209
Are you his wife?

510
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:21,961
What do you mean?

511
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:25,005
-Honey.
-Are you denying the possession

512
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,049
or the favor from the police station?

513
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,093
You can ask me. Honey, don't answer that.

514
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:31,429
Don't film her! Ms. Kim, please go inside.

515
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,764
I did it.

516
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,225
He didn't want to,

517
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,935
but I asked the police

518
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,895
-to get more detectives out there.
-Honey.

519
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,273
It's true. Why won't you say it?

520
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,445
-Ji-hoon is dead.
-Honey.

521
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,864
I don't care what people say.
He's our precious son.

522
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,283
What do you want to hear from us?

523
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,994
-Honey. Go inside.
-Are you admitting to receiving a favor?

524
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,036
You'll wake Yoon-seo.

525
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,706
-Now.
-Honey.

526
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,250
Do you admit to the allegation
of the special favor?

527
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,794
-That's enough!
-Give me an answer!

528
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,422
-That's enough. Stop filming.
-I'm sorry.

529
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:09,175
I'll answer that formally later.

530
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,426
-I'm sorry.
-Let's go.

531
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:56,931
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

532
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,829
PERILLA OIL (UNROASTED)

533
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,128
Do I know you?

534
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,006
Right. You came by the mill yesterday.

535
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,509
-Following the allegations of…
-When will she come by?

536
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,886
We visited his home for a statement…

537
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:38,806
-I don't even know her name…
-…but did not get a clear explanation.

538
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,975
-Reporter Jung Gyeong-eun will take over.
-…or her phone number.

539
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,518
After SBC's exclusive report

540
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:46,355
on the two suspicions
regarding his children…

541
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,023
-You can ask me.
-SBC wanted to know

542
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,567
-his position regarding the allegations.
-Honey, don't answer that.

543
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,902
-Gosh, Assemblyman Nam.
-What do you want to hear from us?

544
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,571
Assemblyman Nam and his wife, Kim…

545
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,365
-Goodness.
-…both were busy denying the charges.

546
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,785
-Assemblyman Nam's wife…
-She was his wife.

547
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:02,079
-…had made the following statement…
-My goodness.

548
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:22,850
Have some breakfast.

549
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,768
Hye-joo wants to stay in bed.

550
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:26,770
She has a headache, so keep quiet.

551
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,357
-Okay.
-Wash the dishes when you're done.

552

CLEAN, HONEST, AND COMPETENT WORKER
NAM JOONG-DO

553
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:07,936
Not long ago, in Sinyang-gu, Seoul,
Assemblyman Nam Joong-do's district,

554
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,814
a woman in her twenties took her own life

555
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,276
after her boyfriend threatened
to distribute an intimate video.

556
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:17,529
Regarding the death
of Assemblyman Nam's son,

557
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,200
there were 256 news articles reported
in a single day.

558
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,578
However, there were
only three news reports about the suicide

559
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,455
-of this woman--
-Nonsense!

560
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:30,709
Ma'am, you can't jump in.

561
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,461
-What's wrong?
-How dare you say that?

562
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,173
Sorry? Who are you, ma'am?

563
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,510
I am the grandmother of that dead girl!

564
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:40,803
I'm sorry?

565
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:43,889
The girl who took her own life!

566
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:47,101
I'm her grandmother!

567
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,022
Right, ma'am.

568
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,899
It must have been hard for you.

569
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:56,693
Could you do an interview with me?

570
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,905
The accidental death
of an assemblyman's son is

571
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,324
all over the news, but--

572
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,535
Don't talk
about Assemblyman Nam like that!

573
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,457
He paid respect
at my granddaughter's funeral hall.

574
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,669
Assemblyman Nam paid a visit?

575
00:45:15,712 --> 00:45:18,090
He must have visited
to cover up the controversy

576
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:21,218
-surrounding his special treatment.
-Cover what up?

577
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,180
The assemblyman visited
my granddaughter's funeral

578
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,892
even before he knew of his son's death!

579
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,645
Before that? Are you sure?

580
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,731
I may be old, but I can remember that!

581
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:38,277
He came on the first day
the funeral hall was open.

582
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,989
And his wife came by too!

583
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,575
His wife too?

584
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,827
My goodness.

585
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,330
How can you dare to say
something so atrocious

586
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,833
about parents
who have lost their precious child?

587
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,295
How can you even call yourself human?

588
00:45:57,796 --> 00:45:59,840
-Ma'am. Please, I'm sorry.
-Goodness.

589
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,009
-Help her.
-Goodness.

590
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,386
-Ma'am, please.
-How can you do this?

591
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,471
Yes.

592
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:08,682
Okay.

593
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,685
All right.

594
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:17,441
CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

595
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,736
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO VISITS
FUNERAL IN SINYANG-GU

596
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:29,661
How can you even call yourself human?

597
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,747
-Goodness.
-They're taking this too far.

598
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,167
-You should report on facts!
-No one even showed up

599
00:46:35,250 --> 00:46:37,377
to my granddaughter's funeral.

600
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,921
She didn't even check the facts.

601
00:46:39,713 --> 00:46:42,925
But Assemblyman Nam and his wife came,

602
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,471
so I felt less lonely and reassured.

603
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:51,099
In over 70 years of my life…

604
00:46:51,183 --> 00:46:54,269
-Come in.
-…I've never seen an assemblyman like him.

605
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,231
Sir, I purchased a new badge.

606
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,316
Thanks.

607
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,071

CHIEF ADVISOR JANG WOO-JAE

609
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,673
Hey, do you need to use the bathroom?
Come in.

610
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,676
No, I was just wondering
what you were doing.

611
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:09,678
I see.

612
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,389
Do you need help?

613
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,765
No, it's fine.

614
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:34,995
DA-SOM

615
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:37,164
How was your visit? Cheer up.

616
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:40,250
Thanks. I'll call you later.

617
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,585
Hye-joo.

618
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:44,921
ASSEMBLYMAN NAM JOONG-DO'S STATEMENT

619
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,923
As for my son's purchase of illegal drugs…

620
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,968
I admit it's true.

621
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,096
And I'd like to say I'm sorry
about the special favor

622
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,432
I received while looking for
my missing daughter.

623
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,101
When I heard that she went missing,

624
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,771
I had the toughest night of my life.

625
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:04,316
When I couldn't find her
even after 12 hours,

626
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,902
I failed to make the right choice

627
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,112
and became an emotional parent.

628
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:11,907
I apologize.

629
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,537
But I am not sitting here today

630
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,207
just to make an apology.

631
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:32,260
-Come on.
-What's he doing?

632
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,179
Assemblyman Nam?

633
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,815
I plead with you to take note of

634
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,318
the prevalence of digital sexual violence.

635
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:52,322
A few days ago,
in Sinyang-gu, where I live,

636
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,991
a woman in her 20s took her own life

637
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,787
because her ex-boyfriend
threatened that he'd distribute

638
00:49:58,870 --> 00:50:00,330
an intimate video of them.

639
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,376
Despite this tragic incident,

640
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:06,586
the prosecution refused
to arrest the perpetrator

641
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:08,547
because he's a medical student
at a prestigious university,

642
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,882
-and is unlikely to flee.
-Thank you.

643
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,469
The prosecution rate
of digital sexual violence is

644
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,471
exceedingly low compared to other crimes.

645
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,557
Even when it is prosecuted,

646
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,434
most are merely fined or put on probation

647
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:23,186
because it's their first offense
or they showed remorse.

648
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,273
Only three percent were arrested.

649
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,817
Only three percent.

650
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:31,903
That is why

651
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,158
I am here to make a promise
before the citizens of Korea.

652
00:50:36,908 --> 00:50:38,326
I will reorganize

653
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,996
and strengthen the legislation

654
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:43,999
so that digital sexual violence
can be properly punished.

655
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,877
I promise you.

656
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:52,007
Assemblyman Nam.

657
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:56,428
This may be a sensitive question,

658
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,305
but I began to wonder

659
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,349
if you are using someone else's tragedy

660
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,020
to cover up the controversy
over the special treatment

661
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,271
that you received.

662
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,362
I am here today

663
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,866
to apologize
for all controversies surrounding me,

664
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,952
and also to use my position

665
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,247
as an assemblyman
for the underprivileged in our society.

666
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,253
I've been under public scrutiny
because of recent controversies,

667
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,881
so I thought I might use this opportunity

668
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:38,178
to speak directly
to our citizens watching at home.

669
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:43,058
Thank you.

670
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,893
I believe

671
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,522
this is the last present
my late son has given me.

672
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,900
An opportunity to settle the controversies

673
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,319
that my son and I have created.

674
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,321
But above all else,

675
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,492
I believe that this is
what I need to do as an assemblyman

676
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,329
who the people of this country voted for.

677
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:10,836
That is why

678
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:15,882
I will resolve the low indictment rate
of digital sexual violence

679
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,928
and ensure that all perpetrators
are properly punished

680
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:22,347
through reinforced legislation.

681
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:25,100
I promise you.

682
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,394
Also…

683
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:30,105
I hope no parents in Korea

684
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:33,942
will ever experience
the heartbreak of losing a child,

685
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:37,654
as the young woman's family…

686
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,449
and I have

687
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:44,286
experienced.

688
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:48,290
I see.

689
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:51,209
I truly hope your personal tragedy becomes

690
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:55,463
the seed to building a hopeful future
for our society.

691
00:52:56,756 --> 00:53:01,303
That was Assemblyman Nam Joong-do
of Daehan Party.

692
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,345
Thank you.

693
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,515
Assemblyman Nam shared his position

694
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,225
on the controversy of his son's…

695
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:10,770
I never imagined an assemblyman would

696
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:15,150
come by and visit the funeral
for ordinary people like us.

697
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:18,570
His wife was the first to arrive,

698
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,282
but she refused to register
in the visitor's book.

699
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:24,326
I didn't even know who she was.

700
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,785
YBS reported--

701
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,789
Public sentiment is rapidly shifting.

702
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,083
Looks like it.

703
00:53:34,502 --> 00:53:37,339
Assemblyman Nam is
more talented than I expected.

704
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:11,873
How did you know about that funeral?

705
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,964
NAMGOONG SOL, 22, THREATENED
BY HER MED SCHOOL BOYFRIEND…

706
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,467
I found out about Ms. Namgoong's case
as I headed to work that day.

707
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,969
ARREST WARRANT DECLINED,
BLACKMAIL LED TO SUICIDE

708
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,141
I was leaving the funeral
of Mr. Bae's mother-in-law.

709
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,810
Thank you, Assemblyman Nam.

710
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:34,938
I saw her name

711
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,566
-at the hall next door.
-Just a moment.

712
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:53,790
I see.

713
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,710
How did you know about it?

714
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,462
I didn't know you visited her.

715
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:02,048
I found out by coincidence.

716
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,969
I visited her earlier that day
because I was worried.

717
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:12,434
On my way home,
I thought it would be great

718
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,019
if you had visited her there,

719
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,687
but I didn't bother to tell you.

720
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,399
Thank you for visiting her.

721
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,406
It was a coincidence
that my visit was reported.

722
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,950
Even you didn't know I was there.

723
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:33,079
It was a series of
two amazing coincidences.

724
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:35,373
But I exploited that.

725
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:39,794
It keeps weighing on me.

726
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:45,008
-I…
-I know.

727
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,720
I know how you feel right now.

728
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,682
But you did the right thing.

729
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,728
I don't know anything about politics

730
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:58,688
or how things work in your world.

731
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:02,984
But as you said, that's one of the things
an assemblyman can do, right?

732
00:56:07,739 --> 00:56:08,740
Honey.

733
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,828
I have never once doubted
your sincerity to this day.

734
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:17,457
Before I knew you as an assemblyman,

735
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:23,671
I knew you as my husband that I trusted,

736
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,717
loved, and married.

737
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:34,891
Thank you.

738
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:46,903
I love you.

739
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,420
I researched more information

740
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,382
on the transportation infrastructure
of district one.

741
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,008
Let's see.

742
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,136
Oh, right.

743
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:14,139
The reapplication of the warrant
against the med school student is today.

744
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:16,015
Yes.

745
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,643
They expedited the process
after your news appearance

746
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:19,894
shifted public sentiment.

747
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,064
Good.

748
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,152
When informed of a breakup,

749
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,529
Ji, a medical student
at a prestigious university,

750
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,990
threatened to distribute
a private video of his ex-girlfriend

751
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,033
and ultimately led her
to take her own life.

752
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:36,494
Sinyang Police Station of Seoul decided

753
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,788
-to reapply for an arrest warrant…
-God, Buddha.

754
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:41,416
-…for the suspect, Ji.
-Thank you.

755
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:44,711
-Thank you.
-As the story spread online,

756
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,588
it outraged citizens
who began to criticize

757
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:48,923
-the prosecution's response…
-Thank you.

758
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:51,968
Is this Mr. Ji Seung-kyu's home?

759
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,347
We're with the police.

760
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:58,016
We came to execute his arrest warrant

761
00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,477
for blackmailing
and filming without consent.

762
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,437
-Is Mr. Ji Seung-kyu inside?
-Wait.

763
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,689
Honey.

764
00:58:06,107 --> 00:58:08,943
Why are you suddenly doing this?

765
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,904
You said he wouldn't be detained!

766
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,573
This was officially issued by the court.

767
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:17,952
Honey!

768
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:23,374
-No!
-Help!

769
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,169
-No!
-Do something!

770
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:30,048
Please come this way.

771
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:32,091
-It's all right.
-No.

772
00:58:32,884 --> 00:58:34,385
-Oh, no.
-No.

773
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,346
It's all right.

774
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,233
SEORYEONG UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICINE
JI SEUNG-KYU

775
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,945
I WOULD KILL MYSELF IF I WERE HIM

776
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,571
JI SEUNG-KYU THE SEX CRIMINAL? EXPOSED.

777
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,156
KILL YOURSELF JI SEUNG-KYU.
DIE!

778
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:56,574
DIE, CRIMINAL SCUM.
MED SCHOOL STUDENT? NO WAY.

779
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,660
-There are things…
-Mr. Ji Seung-kyu!

780
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,328
-…that nobody…
-Mr. Ji Seung-kyu!

781
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:02,789
even dreams of ever happening.

782
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:09,212
Although nobody meant for it to happen…

783
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:12,632
JICHEONG MIDDLE SCHOOL GRADUATION CEREMONY

784
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,969
at times, it happens without fail.

785
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,184
We call this…

786
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,107
an accident.

787
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:35,822
MURDERER
NAM JOONG-DO

788
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:59,554
TROLLEY

789
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:03,099
He called him out publicly
and he committed suicide?

790
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:05,393
I'm truly concerned about Assemblyman Nam.

791
01:00:05,476 --> 01:00:07,145
You should humor her for the time being.

792
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:09,230
You have to focus on the general election.

793
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,774
Who will you tell them I am?

794
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,818
Just tell them I'm some kid you know.

795
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:17,030
Why would she wait for me
when I ran off for three years

796
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,406
saying that I couldn't stand her?

797
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,451
Did Ji-hoon tell you
anything else about me?

798
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,286
That you're not his birth mother.

799
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:24,287
Nam Joong-do, you bastard!

800
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:28,207
You killed our son!

801
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:33,171
