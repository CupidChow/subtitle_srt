1
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,384
A woman in her twenties took her own life

2
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:54,387
because her ex-boyfriend
threatened that he'd distribute

3
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,680
an intimate video of them.

4
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,266
The prosecution refused
to arrest the perpetrator

5
00:00:58,349 --> 00:00:59,934
because he's a medical student
at a prestigious university.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,604
I will reorganize
and strengthen the legislation

7
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,731
so that digital sexual violence
can be properly punished.

8
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:05,690
I promise you.

9
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,026
I don't know anything about politics

10
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,320
or how things work in your world.

11
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,572
But as you said, that's one of the things

12
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:14,532
-an assemblyman can do, right?
-Thank you.

13
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,410
Ji, a medical student
and the assailant of Namgoong,

14
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,245
committed suicide by jumping
out of his apartment today.

15
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,873
Someone died because of me.

16
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,625
This is just too hard.

17
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,293
You're not to blame, honey.

18
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,504
You didn't know this would happen.

19
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,965
Unless a major case of sex crime occurs

20
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,343
that brings about a great public uproar,

21
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,387
it won't be easy to push ahead with a bill

22
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:37,972
in merely six months.

23
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,891
She doesn't know yet.

24
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,351
That bastard uploaded the video

25
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:43,436
right before he jumped.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,313
The suicide of a suspect

27
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,524
shouldn't get in the way
of destigmatizing the victims.

28
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,235
Therefore, I would like to propose
an amendment to the sex crime law

29
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,070
that allows investigations to continue

30
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:57,117
even when the suspect is deceased
due to suicide or otherwise.

31
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,619
I am going to convince the public
and gain their support.

32
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,330
But first, there is something
I'd like to tell you.

33
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,833
It's about my wife.

34
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:07,252
That med student is obviously a criminal,

35
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,213
but his family is
still here living in pain.

36
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:13,550
If something else bad happens,
how will the rest of them live?

37
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,427
I wish you'd stop using the media
to make a bigger issue out of this.

38
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,138
I'm going to propose an amendment

39
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:22,016
that allows investigations to continue
even after a sex criminal dies.

40
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,603
I need the support of my beloved wife.
It's the most important thing to me.

41
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,356
The girl everyone considered
to be the innocent victim

42
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:31,526
turned out to be a sex worker.

43
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:35,530
It's only natural
that people see her in a different light.

44
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,991
We need Namgoong Sol
to propose the amendment, don't we?

45
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,159
How did you miss this?

46
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,369
Nothing is going as planned!

47
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:44,247
That's why this is the best time
to tell him to stop digging

48
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,291
around the real estate speculation.

49
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,126
What? Posted what?

50
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:51,462
Hey, Yoon-seo. Isn't this your dad?

51
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:55,133
If you were using Sol to your advantage,

52
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,552
I will not let you get away with this.

53
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:59,053
I'm sorry, honey.

54
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,847
I had no idea what you were going through,

55
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,932
and I…

56
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,560
I love you. Don't ever doubt that.

57
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,020
I've never doubted you.

58
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,809
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

59
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:55,818
KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

60
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:57,987
SOO-BIN, THIS IS JI-HOON'S MOM.
PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL.

61
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,831
THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY

62
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,376
Is there something on my jacket?

63
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,211
No.

64
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,046
Here you go.

65
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,256
Thanks.

66
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,636
Take it easy until your injury is healed.

67
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,179
I'm fine now.

68
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,391
Your car will be delivered in a few days.

69
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,559
Are you sure you're okay with a used car?

70
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,812
I wanted to buy you a new car.

71
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,773
No, a used car is fine.

72
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:37,068
Besides, buying it through
Ms. Choi's father is even better.

73
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,072
Okay.

74
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,032
I'm leaving now.

75
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:48,663
Have a great day.

76
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,094
I don't want to go.

77
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,230
-Bye now.
-Bye.

78
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,665
DOUBT

79
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:38,087
DEOKSUNG MILL

80
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,133
Good morning.

81
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,887
Sometimes I feel like you know me
better than my wife does.

82
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,847
Yes, I should.

83
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,017
But I don't think you know me well enough.

84
00:05:52,101 --> 00:05:54,270
No, I didn't expect you would be here.

85
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,610
Goodness.

86
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:03,821
Well…

87
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,324
Come in and have breakfast.

88
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,548
-Here.
-Thank you.

89
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:28,763
Thank you.

90
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,522
Ms. Cho.

91
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:42,568
I haven't forgiven you completely.

92
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,532
But

93
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:49,992
in the work you do, Assemblyman Nam,

94
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,496
make use of this old woman
as much as you want.

95
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:58,876
Your granddaughter is the victim,

96
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,214
but she came under criticism
following the assailant's suicide.

97
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:10,096
That's why Assemblyman Nam is
trying to change the law.

98
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,559
Please don't be angry with him, Ms. Cho.

99
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,565
In return,

100
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:25,069
please fix that darned law.

101
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,323
Please fix it
so that even if a criminal dies,

102
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,952
the whole world will know
what they've done

103
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,829
and they can be punished.

104
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,500
I will do that.

105
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,211
I promise you.

106
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:48,301
After the video of Assemblyman Nam
getting beaten up went viral,

107
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,929
criticism against the medical student
is rising online.

108
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,725
But not enough to overshadow news of
Namgoong Sol's history as a sex worker.

109
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,520
Is it acceptable to illegally film
and distribute sex videos

110
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,522
as long as the victim is a sex worker?

111
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:02,690
That's ridiculous.

112
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,738
The timing would have been worse
if the bill had already been proposed.

113
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,823
You're right.

114
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:15,036
Then we'll need to find another case
that we can use to our advantage, right?

115
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,705
A sex crime
where the assailant killed themselves.

116
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,292
We may already have one.

117
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,428
My goodness.

118
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,597
-Hello.
-Hello.

119
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,100
Am I interrupting?

120
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,200
LEE CHAE-EUN

121
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,375
Hye-joo.

122
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,502
Will you wait for me outside?

123
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,339
Okay, I will.

124
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:27,858
-Oh, my. I'm sorry.
-Goodness. Are you okay?

125
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:30,528
-Yes, thank you.
-Sure.

126
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,291
LEE CHAE-EUN (OTHER MATERIALS)

127
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,428
Excuse me.

128
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:02,310
Are you Chae-eun's…

129
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,146
Who are you?

130
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,567
I said, who are you?

131
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,029
Look.

132
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,156
You should leave.

133
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,491
How dare you come here?

134
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,618
Leave. Now.

135
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,870
Who in the world are you?

136
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,204
How dare you come here?

137
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,417
-You have no right to be here!
-Yeo-jin!

138
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,336
-Yeo-jin.
-Let go and we'll talk.

139
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,837
Let go of me!

140
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,797
Seven years in prison doesn't cut it.

141
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,716
You should rot in prison for life.

142
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,010
Yeo-jin!

143
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,428
Just kill me.

144
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,180
Kill me.

145
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,099
Why can't you?

146
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,644
You tried to kill me then!

147
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,399
I fell asleep next to Chae-eun,

148
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,194
but I woke up in the hospital.

149
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,782
And I was told that my daughter…

150
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,243
was killed by her own dad.

151
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,913
But what?

152
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:05,331
Family suicide?

153
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,416
How is that suicide?

154
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,876
That was murder!

155
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,712
You're a murderer
who killed your own child!

156
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,008
You need to die too.

157
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,136
You killed your own child.

158
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,389
Are you too scared to die yourself?

159
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,849
-Then I'll kill you!
-Yeo-jin, please.

160
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:24,975
Fine, kill me!

161
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:27,478
Go ahead, kill me!

162
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,106
Please, Yeo-jin. Just go.

163
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,023
Hurry.

164
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,818
-Hye-joo, let go.
-Yeo-jin, please stop.

165
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,069
-Yeo-jin, please.
-Fine.

166
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:39,073
-Please.
-Fine, then we can die together.

167
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:40,282
Let's die together!

168
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,909
That's enough!

169
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,577
Who in the world are you to…

170
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,080
Her family.

171
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:48,791
What?

172
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,876
I'm her family.

173
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,464
What family?

174
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,716
I'm Lawyer Nam Joong-do's wife.

175
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,301
Lawyer?

176
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,220
Leave.

177
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,390
Did you not hear me? Leave!

178
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,560
Leave and don't ever come back.
Do you understand?

179
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,819
It's okay, Yeo-jin.

180
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,863
It's okay.

181
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,781
I didn't know your wife

182
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,826
had such a history with my wife's family.

183
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,832
It's a small world, isn't it?

184
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:36,213
So you want to make a deal

185
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,509
with your in-law's land speculation

186
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,305
and my wife's incident?

187
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,435
I just don't think it's worth
your precious time

188
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,898
to be concerned about
a piece of land out in the countryside.

189
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,615
Please give this to Chae-eun.

190
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,367
Who in the world are you?

191
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,202
I'm her family.

192
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,005
What? A million won?

193
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,965
I bought you that phone.

194
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,385
So if you need it,
you can buy it back from me.

195
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:00,733
Hey. Why aren't you coming in?

196
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,736
Are you looking for Ms. Hyeon?

197
00:15:03,819 --> 00:15:04,862
She's not here today.

198
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,156
Why not?

199
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,618
The so-called father killed his child

200
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,244
and also tried to kill his wife,

201
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,288
but he only got seven years in prison.

202
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:16,206
Isn't that ridiculous?

203
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,417
-A life sentence--
-Yeong-seon, I'd like to pay.

204
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,793
Okay.

205
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:21,170
Gosh, that was good.

206
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,671
-Did you enjoy it?
-Yes, here.

207
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,883
Do you have cash?

208
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,092
The machine is down.

209
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,677
-Again?
-Yes.

210
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,846
That never happens with Yeo-jin,

211
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,932
but it happens often with you.

212
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:34,975
Here.

213
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,477
The machine must know it's me.

214
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,394
Goodness.

215
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,521
-Bye.
-Okay, bye.

216
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,082
I'm going to head to the restaurant.

217
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,041
Don't wait for me.

218
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,584
You said you'd take the day off.

219
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,711
I need to keep myself busy.

220
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,547
Okay then.

221
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,967
-See you later.
-Okay.

222
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,433
Hye-joo.

223
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,229
I'm sorry.

224
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:22,523
Yeo-jin.

225
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,200
To me,

226
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,577
you're family.

227
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,789
So don't say you're sorry

228
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,625
or that you want to die.

229
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,838
Just stay by my side for a long time.

230
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:47,297
Okay?

231
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,307
Where was I?

232
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,979
Thank you for the food.

233
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:03,856
Goodbye.

234
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,274
Hey.

235
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:09,778
-Sorry?
-You need to pay.

236
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,655
Right.

237
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,198
I will.

238
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,286
We only provide free food
for children and expectant mothers.

239
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,206
Goodness, Yeo-jin.

240
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,667
I thought you took the day off.

241
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:32,926
How much do you want?

242
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,554
What?

243
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:37,181
Isn't that why you're here?

244
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,773
I need two million won.

245
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,153
Tell me your account number.

246
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,405
She left your house?

247
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,282
Hey, keep it down.

248
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,201
Right, sorry.

249
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,746
What about the baby? She's pregnant.

250
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,624
No idea. That's her problem.

251
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,002
But it's your nephew or niece.

252
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,254
What are you talking about?

253
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,383
Your brother's child
is your nephew or niece.

254
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,262
Anyway,

255
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,224
you can't tell anyone about this.

256
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,517
It's a secret.

257
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,227
Okay.

258
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,945
Hey, Yoon-seo.

259
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,406
You know that student who killed himself
after your dad exposed him?

260
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,075
Turns out his girlfriend was a prostitute.

261
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,245
And she accused him of illegal filming?

262
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,746
Unbelievable.

263
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,331
It doesn't matter what she did.

264
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:46,542
Non-consensual video sharing is a crime.

265
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,876
So is prostitution.

266
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:52,005
Your dad more or less
defended prostitution by taking her side.

267
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,174
How is that defending prostitution?

268
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,512
And it's not like she had an affair.

269
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:00,180
What? What do you mean?

270
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,641
Prostitution is illegal,
but adultery isn't.

271
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,226
Prostitution is a crime too.

272
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,311
Buying sex is the worst.

273
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,021
Adultery is worse.

274
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,357
It involves feelings

275
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,109
and you're betraying your family.

276
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,695
So it's utterly disgusting.

277
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,448
Right? Isn't it?

278
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:19,491
Right.

279
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,666
I sent it to you.

280
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,625
Okay.

281
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,379
You don't have to come here next time.

282
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,132
Just text me.

283
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,978
By the way…

284
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,566
why did you make seaweed soup for me?

285
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,364
To feign kindness?

286
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,494
Or so that I'd turn a blind eye?

287
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,338
Right.

288
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,131
About your kitchen staff.

289
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,092
When you're away, she pretends
the credit card machine is broken

290
00:20:19,176 --> 00:20:20,594
and pockets the cash.

291
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,891
That's what it feels like to be betrayed

292
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,602
by someone you trust.

293
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,527
Hey, are you leaving?

294
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,364
Bye.

295
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,290
My husband was here this morning?

296
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,584
Yes.

297
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,170
At daybreak.

298
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,340
I see.

299
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,386
Last night,

300
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,974
I was quite angry at first.

301
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,939
But how could they treat
Assemblyman Nam that way

302
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,693
when their son is the one
who committed a crime?

303
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:24,324
That's why I told him to use me

304
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,786
to amend that law.

305
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,665
I promised to help however I can.

306
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,793
But Ms. Cho.

307
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,754
Once you step in,

308
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:42,384
people may criticize
you and your granddaughter.

309
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,387
I know.

310
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:49,683
But it's all right.

311
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,020
After losing my Sol,

312
00:21:53,603 --> 00:21:56,064
the last thing I want to do

313
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,692
is sit around doing nothing.

314
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,197
If there is a way to punish that criminal

315
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:07,284
who ran away from his sins
by taking his life,

316
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,828
I'll do anything.

317
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,915
Anything at all.

318
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,303
Look at this.

319
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,348
They're criticizing our son again.

320
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:31,808
I didn't post that article.

321
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,518
Then who was it?

322
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,103
I…

323
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,648
You were the only person I told

324
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,275
about how my son met that girl!

325
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,073
To be honest, I was going to write a post.

326
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,744
I knew that she'd be criticized
if people found out she was a prostitute,

327
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:54,206
and that it would also reflect badly
on Nam Joong-do.

328
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,086
But…

329
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,260
A SEX WORKER…

330
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,978
DISCARD DRAFT?

331
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,230
…I didn't.

332
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,359
I knew people would start
criticizing your son again,

333
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,112
and it'd make things even harder for you.

334
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,114
So I decided not to.

335
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,285
I know how that feels
better than anyone else.

336
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,333
It really wasn't me.

337
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,335
Please believe me.

338
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:54,307
SEUNG-KYU'S DINING TABLE

339
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:57,310
I'll run some errands
and then take the bus home.

340
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:58,603
You should go home first.

341
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,273
Where are you going?

342
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:05,527
Don't tell me you're going to see Jae-eun.

343
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:09,281
I am.

344
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,659
I'll find her and call her a murderer
in front of everyone.

345
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,579
-Seung-hee.
-Why not? Can't I do that?

346
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:19,166
My family is suffering because of her lie.

347
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:22,669
I can't let her live a good life,
not even over my dead body.

348
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,303
Ki-young.

349
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,975
I'm your family.

350
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:41,855
Are you sure you're not the one
who posted that?

351
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:43,899
Ki-young.

352
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:49,779
It wasn't me.

353
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:58,205
Why can't you trust me?

354
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,341
Let's…

355
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:12,552
go to Australia, Seung-hee.

356
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,060
Let's leave everything behind

357
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:22,354
and go.

358
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:34,074
I'm sorry.

359
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,036
I can't leave my mom here alone.

360
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:26,501
KIM SOO-BIN (OLD)

361
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:27,585
NAM JOONG-DO

362
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:31,756
That concludes our briefing session
for the residents on the reconstruction

363
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,384
of the Jicheong 2-dong
Administrative Welfare Center.

364
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:38,221
-Great work.
-Assemblyman Nam!

365
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:39,472
-Good work.
-Great work.

366
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,474
-Great work.
-Thank you.

367
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,642
-See you.
-Goodbye.

368
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,812
-We should grab a drink sometime.
-We should.

369
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:47,022
When?

370
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:48,857
Great work.

371
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,902
Hello, Assemblyman Nam.

372
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,822
Hello, President Bae Gyeong-guk
of Taeyang Arcade Co-op.

373
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,324
-Goodness.
-Are you well?

374
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,075
Yes, of course.

375
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,286
The reconstruction of this center

376
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,288
was a long-cherished wish
for us residents.

377
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,665
Thank you very much.

378
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,708
I promised you,

379
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,127
but it took much longer
than I thought. I'm sorry.

380
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,879
Don't say that.

381
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,174
You must have had a tough time
after what happened to your family.

382
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:15,842
Thank you very much.

383
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:22,223
I was very grateful when you came
to my mother-in-law's funeral.

384
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,142
After she was buried,

385
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,728
your son's funeral
was held in the same funeral home,

386
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,564
and I felt very sorry for you.

387
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,276
Stay strong, Assemblyman Nam.

388
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,694
Thank you.

389
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,410
-Great work, sir.
-Thank you.

390
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,180
Hello?

391
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:04,391
Is that you, Soo-bin?

392
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,145
Who are you?

393
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,357
Ji-hoon's friend?

394
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,404
Hello.

395
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,950
You must be Ji-hoon's mother.

396
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,869
Yes.

397
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,247
Take a seat.

398
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:31,751
Well…

399
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:36,339
I was studying abroad
and was dealing with some important work.

400
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:40,176
That's why I only returned to Korea
after Ji-hoon's funeral.

401
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:43,304
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,974
It's okay.

403
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,934
Anyway,

404
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:51,062
how come Soo-bin's phone was with you?

405
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,606
She asked me to hold on to it for her

406
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,192
when I met her after coming back to Korea.

407
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,862
But she's been out of reach since.

408
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,698
I see.

409
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,368
By the way,

410
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:08,663
you know Soo-bin and Ji-hoon dated, right?

411
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,707
Yes.

412
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:17,630
I'm not really sure
if I should tell you this,

413
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,884
but I heard…

414
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:25,013
Soo-bin got pregnant with Ji-hoon's child.

415
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,266
I know.

416
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,102
Did Soo-bin tell you?

417
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,021
Yes.

418
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,483
She told me so that day,

419
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,486
then she completely went off the grid.

420
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,488
It was right after Ji-hoon's accident,

421
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:45,533
so I was quite worried
she'd make the wrong choice.

422
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,453
I'm relieved
that she was staying with you.

423
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,416
I wonder where she is now.

424
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,090
It's kind of awkward
for me to ask you this.

425
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:06,429
By any chance, did you notice
any money or valuables missing

426
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,474
after she left?

427
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,559
Sorry?

428
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,231
The thing about Soo-bin is,

429
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,608
she has sticky fingers

430
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,360
and she isn't exactly a good girl.

431
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,656
I used to hang out with the wrong crowd
and it was all because of her.

432
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,325
Then I came to my senses and went abroad.

433
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:32,455
That's why I tried so hard
to talk Ji-hoon out of dating her.

434
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,473
Thank you for your time.

435
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:51,558
Don't mention it.

436
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:56,729
And can you tell Soo-bin to call me
when you get a hold of her?

437
00:30:56,813 --> 00:31:00,358
Sure, but no matter what I say,

438
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,694
she might not call you.

439
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:09,200
But you never know, so just tell her.

440
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,828
Okay, I will.

441
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,665
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

442
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,257
So it was Nam Ji-hoon's kid.

443
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,177
How interesting.

444
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,408
The thing about Soo-bin is,
she has sticky fingers

445
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,619
and she isn't exactly a good girl.

446
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,433
REAL ESTATE OFFICE

447
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,769
I don't need any premium
for the restaurant.

448
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,646
I just want to sell it quickly.

449
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:21,731
And by any chance,

450
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,652
do you know any real estate offices
in other areas?

451
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,237
Are you opening a new restaurant?
Which area?

452
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,659
Just somewhere far from here.

453
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:36,621
And I'm not opening a restaurant.
I'm looking for a place to live.

454
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:45,004
Kim Soo-bin will come back
even if we don't look for her.

455
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,340
That's what the likes of her do.

456
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,176
She'll come back
and blackmail you for money.

457
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,679
Blackmail me?

458
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,390
Yes, with her pregnancy.

459
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:00,603
By any chance,

460
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,856
does she have anything else on you?

461
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,819
Like what?

462
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:12,782
Right.

463
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,325
Anyway,

464
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:18,287
even if she reveals her pregnancy online,

465
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,915
we can package it as a heartwarming story.

466
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,042
Especially so…

467
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,671
since Ji-hoon is no longer around.

468
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:31,718
So there's nothing to worry about

469
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,928
unless something else gets out.

470
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,640
Like what?

471
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,267
Well…

472
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,227
drugs…

473
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,107
and possibly other things.

474
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,282
Ji-hoon was in possession
of methamphetamine,

475
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:58,119
but the investigation came to a stop
when he passed away.

476
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,455
So we still don't know

477
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,415
why he was in possession of that.

478
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,751
Right.

479
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:07,336
I had forgotten for a moment

480
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,256
that my son was like that.

481
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,809
CHOI KI-YOUNG (YOUNGSAN)

482
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,814
This is Nam Joong-do.

483
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,109
Hello, Mr. Choi.

484
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:35,239
I'd like to share evidence
for the land speculation

485
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,325
of my mother-in-law
and Mr. Kang Soon-hong.

486
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,391
I'm sorry.

487
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,436
I can't leave my mom here alone.

488
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,217
Goodness, Assemblyman Nam.

489
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,386
Are you going back to work at this hour?

490
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,639
I need to meet someone urgently.

491
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:45,059
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong.

492
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,861
I happened to overhear

493
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,488
Assemblyman Nam's
youngest secretary saying

494
00:35:57,572 --> 00:36:00,825
the video from the hospital
went viral just in time.

495
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:05,079
It was quite naive of him
to think it was uploaded

496
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,914
by an actual civilian.

497
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,959
It's not that he's naive.

498
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,920
It just shows how much he trusts
the assemblyman he works for.

499
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,008
Do you also trust Assemblyman Nam?

500
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,888
You managed to use the one word
that least suits politics.

501
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:27,643
-Then what made you bring him on board
-However, the murder of one's children

502
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,979
-eight years ago?
-is not aggravated

503
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,064
and is punished relatively lightly.

504
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,483
So back in 2006,

505
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,944
I filed a constitutional appeal

506
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,322
so that filicide would become
an aggravated crime.

507
00:36:39,405 --> 00:36:41,532
They should be punished equally heavily.

508
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,952
I hope the law changes
after this constitutional appeal.

509
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,789
Do you remember
that constitutional appeal he filed?

510
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,544
Yes, but in the end,
he didn't achieve anything.

511
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:56,088
Except for a little commotion.

512
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,217
Do you really think
he got nothing out of it?

513
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:00,718
Pardon?

514
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:05,681
Didn't you just ask me
what I saw in Assemblyman Nam?

515
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:09,435
…constitutional appeal demanding
heavier punishment for filicide

516
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,355
attracted much attention
and support from the public.

517
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,522
SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN

518
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:16,025
In 2 months, over 500,000 citizens signed

519
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,403
a petition to amend the Constitution.

520
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,662
Mr. Park of Yangcheon-ri, Youngsan,
is great at his job.

521
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,000
But with the general election coming up,

522
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,213
I'm afraid we'll end up
in a mutual no-win situation.

523
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,383
Well…

524
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,427
I guess you're right.

525
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,349
Assemblyman Nam,

526
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,227
you're such a straightforward man.

527
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,120
Hey.

528
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,247
You found a million won already?

529
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,249
Impressive.

530
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,003
Sure.

531
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,505
Yes.

532
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,800
Then I'll see you
at Jae-ik's bar at two o'clock.

533
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,219
Okay.

534
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,279
NAM JI-HOON:
DON'T EVER SAY YOU WANT TO BREAK UP

535
00:38:43,362 --> 00:38:44,488
Ji-hoon!

536
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,949
Have you seen Soo-bin today?

537
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,951
Soo-bin?

538
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,412
No.

539
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,832
She's been out of reach all day.

540
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,958
What's she up to?

541
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:00,004
This is Assemblyman Nam Joong-do's place.

542
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,591
Are you the father of her child?

543
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,092
PREGNANCY WEEK

544
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,386
I said, are you
the father of Soo-bin's child?

545
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:08,429
PATIENT: KIM SOO-BIN

546
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:17,605
So Ji-hoon got her pregnant,
got dumped by her, then kicked the bucket?

547
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:22,360
If he were alive, I would've killed him.

548
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,124
Ji-hoon's friend?

549
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,169
You met with his friend?

550
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,880
Yes.

551
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,006
How did you find him?

552
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,717
Well, I got a call.

553
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,552
He called you?

554
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,721
What did you talk about?

555
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,557
About Ji-hoon.

556
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,270
Don't ever meet or talk to him again.

557
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:00,940
I'm worried about you.

558
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,319
Why would you worry?
He's Ji-hoon's friend.

559
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,285
That's precisely why I'm worried.

560
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,208
Honey, the drugs Ji-hoon had on him…

561
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,087
I think they were Soo-bin's.

562
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,216
But she tested negative for drugs.

563
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,260
Dealers seldom use drugs.

564
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,095
They just sell them.

565
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,681
So honey,

566
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:38,686
forget about Soo-bin.

567
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,315
I know she grew on you,

568
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,985
but you shouldn't get involved with her.

569
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:49,029
I'm worried that you'll be hurt again.

570
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,616
And as you said,

571
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:56,495
we can't do anything
about her decision with the baby,

572
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,248
so let's forget it all.

573
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,338
Let's face it.

574
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,926
Ji-hoon made the choice he did…

575
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:13,804
because of her.

576
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,434
That fact alone makes it impossible…

577
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,730
for me to accept her.

578
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,858
Right.

579
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:30,446
Honey, when I see that text message,
it breaks my heart too.

580
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:33,324
But Ji-hoon's sui…

581
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,037
But Ji-hoon's…

582
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:42,082
incident wasn't Soo-bin's fault.

583
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,251
Rationally, you're right.

584
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,922
But that's not how I feel
because this involves my son.

585
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,425
In my heart,

586
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,929
Soo-bin is the one who killed him.

587
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:01,310
Don't get me wrong.

588
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,853
What I just said

589
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:06,565
is unrelated to what happened
to you in the past.

590
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,695
I know.

591
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,161
But honey, I hope…

592
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,750
Soo-bin never finds out

593
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:30,089
about the text message she didn't get.

594
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,301
No one wanted
this unfortunate accident to happen.

595
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,972
I don't want her to live her life
thinking it was her fault, just as I did.

596
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:44,144
So honey, if she ever calls,

597
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,357
don't tell her about the text message.

598
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:49,984
I ask of you.

599
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:58,867
I understand you resent her
for what happened, but still.

600
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:02,913
Okay.

601
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,501
But she's not going to contact me anyway.

602
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,630
Thank you.

603
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,349
But honey.

604
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:24,476
Yes?

605
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,814
Jin Seung-hee's uncle,
Assemblyman Kang Soon-hong,

606
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,317
found out that you're my wife.

607
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:36,071
-What?
-But I made him keep his mouth shut

608
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,907
thanks to Mr. Choi Ki-young's tip-off.

609
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:53,505
Honey.

610
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,259
Why don't we…

611
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:00,596
publicize your incident first?

612
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,391
Why? He's keeping his mouth shut.

613
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,226
I don't trust Mr. Choi Ki-young.

614
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,148
The evidence he gave me today was solid,

615
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,441
but I don't trust him.

616
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,612
He might be scheming with
Assemblyman Kang to stab me in the back.

617
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,782
Ki-young isn't like that.

618
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:21,450
You don't know that.

619
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,453
Even if Mr. Choi is on our side,

620
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:27,706
he's family with Ms. Jin Seung-hee
and her mother.

621
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:33,462
So your story is bound to get out someday.

622
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,550
Before they break the story,

623
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,679
we need to share it first
and get ahead of it.

624
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:59,029
You don't know what I'm afraid of.

625
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:04,410
You don't know how painful it is
to be blamed for someone's death.

626
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,702
Of course I do.

627
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,455
People say…

628
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,209
I killed that medical student.

629
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:28,767
I won't publicize your story

630
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,729
until you give your consent.

631
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,066
If you really can't go through with it,

632
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:39,236
we won't be the one releasing it.

633
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:41,947
But please know…

634
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,577
that your story will help greatly
in passing the amendment

635
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,914
I told you about.

636
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,971
I'm going to go out for a walk.

637
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:07,097
Honey.

638
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,433
It's chilly at night.

639
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,894
Don't stay out for too long.

640
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:44,176
SONMAT NOODLES

641
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:57,856
Woo-jae.

642
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,983
Hello, Ms. Kim.

643
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,109
Hi.

644
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,282
What brings you here?

645
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,450
Well…

646
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,290
Today's Chae-eun's death anniversary.

647
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:18,961
So I thought I'd stop by on my way home.

648
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,382
I'm sorry I came empty-handed.

649
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,592
I'll get something. You can stay.

650
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,886
No, it's okay. Don't get anything.

651
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,764
I was going to go home after this.

652
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:34,101
Okay. Then take your time.

653
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,862
I heard you played a big part

654
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,240
in getting the story on the news

655
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,450
after the constitutional appeal was filed.

656
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,578
Well…

657
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,040
It was all Assemblyman Nam.
All I did was help.

658
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,918
If he hadn't asked for help,

659
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,337
I wouldn't have even
thought of covering it.

660
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,049
Come to think of it,

661
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:09,595
if I hadn't seen him work so hard then,

662
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:13,974
maybe I wouldn't be
slaving away in Yeouido now.

663
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,983
Woo-jae.

664
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,320
I mean, Mr. Jang.

665
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:29,865
It kind of amazes me
how much trust you have

666
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:31,783
in my husband.

667
00:48:32,909 --> 00:48:36,830
You even quit your stable job
to join my husband.

668
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,627
Of course, my husband is a good man,

669
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,588
but you two were strangers.

670
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:49,468
It's not that

671
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,513
I think he is a perfect man.

672
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,850
At times, he makes foolish mistakes,

673
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,935
which makes him human.

674
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:01,480
With that being said,

675
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:06,276
he never makes the same mistake twice.

676
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:11,698
While I was working as a reporter,

677
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,743
there were times when I thought

678
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,079
I needed to do something
more than simply share

679
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,705
the truth with the world.

680
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,708
And that's when Assemblyman Nam
asked for help.

681
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,087
As I watched him work,

682
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,424
I realized what I should do
and what I wanted to do

683
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:31,885
in the future.

684
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:32,969
LAWYER NAM JOONG-DO

685
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,596
I was fortunate enough

686
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,266
to meet someone who had the same vision

687
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,227
for the world as I did.

688
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:44,981
Of course, Assemblyman Nam
and I were strangers.

689
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:49,277
But so were you and him at first.

690
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,865
And the same goes for you guys too.

691
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,201
You were once strangers,

692
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,662
but you're family now.

693
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,164
You care about and trust each other

694
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:04,543
more than anybody.

695
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:11,925
HUSBAND

696
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,844
One second. Excuse me.

697
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,061
Hello?

698
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,021
Where are you? I'll pick you up.

699
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,274
It's okay, I'm with Yeo-jin.

700
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,067
Don't worry. I'll be home soon.

701
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,653
What about Yoon-seo?

702
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,030
Not yet?

703
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,117
Okay.

704
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,202
Bye.

705
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,134
You came to tell me something, right?

706
00:50:58,472 --> 00:51:01,391
Don't do anything.

707
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,358
I came by for her death anniversary.

708
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,160
Are you leaving?

709
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,870
Yes, please excuse me.

710
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,831
All right. Goodbye, then.

711
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:58,198
-Yoon-seo, you're home.
-Dad.

712
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:02,911
Here you go.

713
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:09,835
Do you want one?

714
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,670
I shouldn't. I brushed my teeth.

715
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,630
Come on. Try one.

716
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,090
Open up.

717
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,596
-By the way, Dad.
-Yes?

718
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,807
Why did that girl suddenly leave?

719
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,147
What if she tells everyone
that she's pregnant with Ji-hoon's baby?

720
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,359
It'll affect you, won't it?

721
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:36,987
Yoon-seo.

722
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,824
Have I ever made you worry?

723
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,077
No.

724
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,038
Then you can trust me,

725
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:50,208
study hard, and do your own thing.

726
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,085
Okay?

727
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,963
Okay.

728
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,591
-Anyway, Dad.
-Yes?

729
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,635
You just sounded like a total boomer.

730
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,762
Man, I don't want to be a boomer.

731
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:06,600
Then instead of studying hard,
study adequately.

732
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:07,976
-Deal?
-Deal.

733
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,438
Dad.

734
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,399
I love you, Yoon-seo.

735
00:53:14,983 --> 00:53:15,817
I love you too.

736
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:53,813
YOON-SEO'S HUNDREDTH DAY

737
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,219
Yoon-seo.

738
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,850
I don't have too many photos of Ji-hoon.

739
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,062
Do you have any?

740
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:37,148
Photos? Why?

741
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,329
Are you happy
now that you made all of us sad?

742
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,266
As Joong-do said,

743
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:14,019
it may be only a matter of time
before it gets out.

744
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:16,771
But…

745
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:20,316
I'm scared.

746
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:21,735
Why?

747
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,154
Because it might turn into a dirty fight?

748
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,452
I think you should still trust Joong-do.

749
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,248
I do.

750
00:55:36,875 --> 00:55:38,376
That's why I'm scared.

751
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,881
Of course I'm afraid
of all the finger-pointing I'll get…

752
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:46,676
That med student is obviously a criminal,
but what about his mom?

753
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:50,013
His family is still here living in pain.

754
00:55:50,096 --> 00:55:53,224
If something else bad happens,
how will the rest of them live?

755
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:56,936
My mother-in-law is mentally unstable,

756
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,606
so Seung-hee always feels restless.

757
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,736
But what if something bad
happens to his family?

758
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,079
What do you think
is the right thing to do?

759
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:18,500
Even if his family and I have to suffer,

760
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,544
can it be justified
as long as the amendment can pass?

761
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:25,548
Because it's for the greater good?

762
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,773
That incident in Youngsan.

763
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:47,779
You can disclose it.

764
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:56,287
I'm only giving my consent
because it'll help the amendment pass.

765
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:01,835
But please make sure
I don't have to appear in public.

766
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,671
Can you promise me that?

767
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:19,727
I promise.

768
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,690
Thank you for making a tough decision.

769
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,986
I'm sorry for putting you
through a hard time.

770
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,506
Trust me.

771
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,844
No matter what happens,

772
00:57:54,387 --> 00:57:55,680
I will protect you.

773
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:00,268
I do trust you.

774
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,521
I don't doubt you.

775
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:08,276
I love you.

776
00:58:58,409 --> 00:58:59,369
-She's here.
-She's here.

777
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,787
Ms. Kim Hye-joo.

778
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,956
Did you really kill someone 20 years ago?

779
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,499
-Tell us!
-Please answer us.

780
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,168
-Is this true?
-Were you involved in someone's death?

781
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,378
Tell us the truth!

782
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,754
Kim Jae-eun.

783
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:11,297
Yes?

784
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,387
You killed him. You murderer.

785
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,265
Get out. How dare you come here?

786
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:23,560
Get out of here this instant!

787
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,145
My child died because of you.

788
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,107
You murderer!

789
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,075
-Do you admit it?
-Are you involved in the murder?

790
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:40,159
Trust me.

791
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,330
No matter what happens…

792
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,002
I will protect you.

793
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:13,943
LAWYER NAM JOONG-DO

794
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,571
TROLLEY

795
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:19,616
I called to warn you
in case this could cause a problem.

796
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:20,950
You must've been scared.

797
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,746
Don't you know that Nam Joong-do's wife
was the one who killed Seung-ho?

798
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:27,624
That's why I wanted to get a head start.

799
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,126
You should've asked me first.

800
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,836
Let's go on TV
and tell everyone what happened.

801
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,588
You didn't mention
anything about going on TV!

802
01:00:33,671 --> 01:00:35,340
I'll be holding a press conference soon.

803
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:40,970
