3
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:23,370
I wish we had made it to Matsumoto today.

4
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,940
Me too.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,430
Nothing we can do about gas running low.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,143
We have to keep it for the mountain road.

7
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:33,990
So, what now?

8
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,940
Let's see...

9
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:40,040
Tomorrow morning, we'll go as far as possible, then we'll ditch the car.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,673
I hope we find a functional gas station.

11
00:00:42,673 --> 00:00:44,073
Yes.

12
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:49,050
Still, I'm glad you're a guy, Meguru.

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,850
It really loosens my nerves.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,790
Don't worry. He's knocked out.

15
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:01,120
What a heavy sleeper.

16
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,883
Understandably so. He's exhausted by all the drama.

17
00:01:07,467 --> 00:01:11,470
Right, then. Dinner's served.

18
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,600
They should have been back a while ago....

19
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,550
Hey, Yuma.

20
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,850
I'm starving...

21
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,200
Where are Ritsu and Meguru?

22
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,080
Outside.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,923
Together?

24
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:49,663
Yes, they're gathering firewood.

25
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,030
Shit.

26
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,350
They're not around.

27
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,390
How far did they go?

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,870
I'll go look over there.

29
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,590
Yuma, wait!

30
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,280
Could you knock it off?

31
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,120
No, tell me the truth.

32
00:02:17,947 --> 00:02:20,050
I already said I know nothing.

33
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,080
That's impossible.

34
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,190
Why?

35
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,450
Why didn't you answer...

36
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,870
my sister's calls that day?

37
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,390
You were the last person...

38
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,560
she ever reached out to.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,070
If you had answered her...

40
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,690
If you had run to her aid,

41
00:02:49,638 --> 00:02:52,568
my sister might not have died.

42
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,100
Please.

43
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,810
Please, tell me.

I want to know the truth.

45

She didn't even leave a suicide note behind.

46
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,350
Why did my sister die?

47
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,870
What was eating at her?

00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,490
I...

49
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,920
wouldn't know.

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,130
I'm sure it's your fault.

51
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,090
You were dating her, right?

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,920
No way.

53
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,250
Hey, Yuma!

54
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,070
Tell me she's lying.

55
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,780

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,330
No.

57
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,100
We were not dating.

58
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,820
I swear Madoka and I weren't a thing.

59
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,000
Then let me ask you this.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,400
Why didn't you tell me you were friends with Maataso?

61
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,253
Let me guess.

62
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:08,023
Is it because you feel guilty for some reason?

63
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,930

Look.

65

Unlike you, I'm just a run-of-the-mill fan.

66

I couldn't do a damn thing for her.

67
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:33,600
My only option was to find out about her death afterwards.

He's still conscious.

82
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,270
He's probably got a concussion.

83
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:06,193
This is all because I pushed him away !

84
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,110
His leg looks pretty bad.

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,300
Look.

You're overreacting.

108
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,330
- I would just have been going early.
- I care.

I told myself I wouldn't make any mistakes.

And yet...

117
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,290
I can only say that because we have no future.

It's fine. I swear.

Medicine...?

140
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:50,630
I went round several hospitals, but all of them were devastated.

141
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,370
It was a sorry sight.

142
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,150
Then where did you go?

143
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,950
A small clinic.

144
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,060
The director was kind enough to share.

145
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,830
Was it around here?

146
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,910
No. In Gotenba.
[T/N: 1.5 hour from where they started their journey]

- Yes.

148
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,790
And our gas?

149
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:13,180

150
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,060
From Gotemba?

151
00:14:16,633 --> 00:14:19,153
That's about 20 or 30 kilometers away.

152
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:23,350
Here. They gave me a crutch too.

153
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,000
I asked them how to make a sling,

154
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,830
so we'll fix you later, OK?

You stink of sweat.

Hey, I need to ask for another favour.

159
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,970
Which one?

160
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,360
Could you tell Meguru...

Madoka was a normal girl.

167
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,882
When we co-starred on a show,

168
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:11,420
I found out she liked to play video games.

169
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,430
So, I invited her over.

170
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,520
I made a pass on her like I usually did,

171
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,150
but she was...

172
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,030
dating a girl from her band.

00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,323
Huh?

174
00:16:25,323 --> 00:16:26,943
Who?

175
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,650
Unfortunately...

176
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:35,190
soon after they began dating,

177
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:39,150
her partner got a boyfriend.

178
00:16:40,657 --> 00:16:42,540
She was left in tatters.

179
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:47,227
Hold on, then the infamous drunken performance on the live TV show was because...

180
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,980
Exactly. She was heartbroken.

181
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:55,940
I see.

182
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,047
That was her turning point.

183
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:05,812
When something inside Madoka snapped.

184
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:15,670
Kagami Madoka, a member of the idol band Micro Macro, is receiving slander online

185
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:19,967
after her drunken performance on a live television show last week.

186
00:17:19,967 --> 00:17:23,703
Her agency has sent police reports...

187
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,780
This is terrible.

188
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,250
Strangers shit-talk me online every day,

189
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,370
and I can't even succeed in my passions.

190
00:17:39,367 --> 00:17:43,960
Really, what did I even like about that bitch?

191
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,050
I don't know anymore.

192
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,320
Rikkun,

193
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,260
have you ever wanted to die?

194
00:18:09,467 --> 00:18:13,070
Hey now. That's not something to say so lightly.

195
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:18,500
Look, I'm just asking if you have or haven't.

196
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:20,960
I haven't.

197
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,680
Right.

198
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:27,620
You're always de-stressing yourself with sex after all.

199
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,920
Lucky you.

200
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,930
Madoka...

201
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,370
Are you really alright?

202
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:42,640
What, did you take me seriously?

203
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,023
I haven't either.

204
00:18:45,023 --> 00:18:46,753
I'm too scared to try.

205
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,810
I see.

206
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,817
Thank god.

207
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,010
But...

208
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,052
If I...

209
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:14,370
If I had a button... right here,

210
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,336
that would let me die at a press,

211
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,730
I'd press it.

212
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,430
Just kidding.

213
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,610
- Seriously, I'm kidding.
- She was a completely normal girl.

214
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,730
She felt loneliness, hurt,

215
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,980
and was impulsive, like any other.

216
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,440
[Madoka]

217
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,640
[Missed call]

218
00:20:07,567 --> 00:20:09,510
[Sorry. Bye.]

219
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,130
I didn't fully grasp her message...

220
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:16,540
until she was found dead.

221
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,390
What good does my story do?

222
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,480
I need to ask.

223
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,940
Why didn't you answer her calls?

224
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,180
She tried over and over, didn't she?

225
00:20:42,697 --> 00:20:44,597
You want to know why?

226
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:52,416
It's because I was doing it with some girl I had met at a drinking party that day, and didn't notice.

227
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,620
Aren't I human scum?

228
00:21:01,467 --> 00:21:04,050
Although our reasons were different,

229
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,360
I would have joined Madoka in pressing that death button long ago.

230
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:15,180
Even successful people have plenty of fucked up stuff going on.

231
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,510
Seriously, life isn't worth shit.

232
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,850
The world's ending?

233
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,530
That just means I finally get my happily ever after.

234
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,570
Shut up.

235
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:44,210
We only have four days left to live.

236
00:21:46,027 --> 00:21:48,240
Yuma...

237
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,720
Meguru doesn't deserve this.

238
00:21:51,533 --> 00:21:56,712
She needs time to grieve for her sister.

239
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:09,120
Go away, you damn meteor!

240
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,280
Blow up in space!

241
00:22:14,163 --> 00:22:15,633
What?

242
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:18,330
Let's send our energy upwards.

243
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:21,740
Come on, Meguru. Masumi, you too.

244
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,210
Go away, you damn meteor!

245
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:30,090
A miracle? It's not happening.

246
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:41,573
Don't be such a downer, you ass.

247
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:44,780
Yuma!

248
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,560
The word "miracle" exists...

249
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,890
because miracles might happen.

250
00:22:57,647 --> 00:23:01,880
Lend me your strength!

251
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,700
Go away, you damn meteor! Go away!

252
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,200
Stop right there!

253
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,440
Go away, you damn meteor!

254
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,800
Go away!

255
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,360
Stop right there!

256
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,560
Go away, you damn meteor!

257
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,820
The stars are beautiful.

258
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,860
What's happier?

259
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,670
Dying while believing in a miracle,

260
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,140
or while not believing in it?

261
00:23:52,707 --> 00:23:57,440
The night sky only continued to twinkle quietly,

262
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,280
and dreadfully on.

263
00:24:03,167 --> 00:24:05,670
Go die, you damn idiot!

264
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,530
Sorry.

265
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,240
For now, let's focus on getting to Matsumoto.

266
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,773
What a sight to see before dying.

267
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:17,883
Not like there's any use regretting now.

268
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,460
What's that?
