1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:05,720
If I had a drug that'd let you die without pain, wouldn't you want it?

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:10,460
It's all yours, as long as you help me out.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,060
With what?

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,770
Disposing of a corpse.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,250
Disposing of a corpse...?

6
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,980
- I'm in no mood for jokes.
- I'm not joking.

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,150
It's at my place right now.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:37,260
So you used that drug to...?

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,600
Well, yes and no.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,380
All I did was give it to someone who wanted to die.

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,450
That's assisted suicide.

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,050
But guess what?

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,140
Drug or not, it doesn't matter anymore.

14
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,970
I mean, look.

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:04,050
They were going to die anyway.

16
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,090
When did you give them the drug?

17
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,510
The day before yesterday.

18
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,140
Wait a minute.

19
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,300
What is this drug?

20
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:34,950
Here.

21
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:39,880
Apparently, it's used for euthanasia in some foreign countries.

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,480
Hold on.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,950
What were you going to do with it?

24
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,690
Hey.

25
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,140
That's a secret.

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,950
Hey, wait up!

27
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,520
Moving a corpse is surprisingly difficult.

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,890
Here.

29
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,430
Alright, let's go.

30
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,250
I guess electricity still works.

31
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,950
Thanks for having me.

32
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,450
Come on in.

33
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,800
Managing a company, living in a condo...

34
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,730
What a stereotype.

35
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,680

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,900
What?

37
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,350
See?

38
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,740
Huh...?

39
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:48,110
No way...

40
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:53,560
- You gave this drug to a boy ?
- Look, I didn't think he was so young.

41
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,620
Then you should have talked him out of it!

42
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,360
But he seemed so serious about it.

43
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,080
Huh?

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,770
That's strange.

45
00:04:13,265 --> 00:04:14,965
What now?

46
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,700
I didn't eat instant noodles.

47
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,600
Huh?

48
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,810
Meaning...?

49
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,569

52
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:36,650
What the hell's going on, man? That drug didn't work at all.

53
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:39,770
- You're a damn liar.
- Alright, slow down.

54
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,120
Ritsu!

55
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,750
No way.

56
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,580
That's impossible.

57
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:47,620
His heart definitely wasn't beating this morning.

58
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:51,090
Well, he looks chipper to me.

59
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,550
Besides, I've got a bigger problem. You didn't take the drug, did you?

60
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,370
Our deal was to die together.

61
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,600
You're such a bastard.

62
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,080
Hey! You've got to be kidding me!

63
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,720
Okay, for now, let's calm down.

64
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,560
So, uh...

65
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,120
- Glad you're alive.
- I'm not. I seriously wanted to end it.

66
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,367
Hey, kid...

67
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:26,125
Yes?

68
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,095
What made you consider suicide in the first place?

69
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,170
You see...

70
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,620
on my first day of high school,

71
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:54,473
I fell head over heels for this girl.

72
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,200
She looked just like my favorite idol, and was super cute.

73
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,180
Over time, we began to get along,

74
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,660
but when I confessed...

75
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,110
You got rejected?

76
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,730
No, you don't get it.

77
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:19,270
That's when the trouble began.

78
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,580
How so?

79
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,560
It turns out

80
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,350
she was the girl of some scary upperclassman.

81
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:48,030
He beat me up, stole my money,

82
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,440
made me shoplift...

83
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,950
Eventually,

84
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,040
my buddies heard the bad rumors,

85
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,140
and began ignoring me.

86
00:08:08,902 --> 00:08:13,132
I started to question my reason for existing.

87
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,680
But then came the real tipping point.

88
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,500
Out of nowhere, my favorite idol...

89
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,390
committed suicide.

90
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,810
Nothing felt like it mattered anymore.

91
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,760
So you turned to death.

92
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,680
Seriously, that's all?

93
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,790

Oh.

97
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:27,240
Give or take a couple of years,

98
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,920
your surroundings will change.

99
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,050
After all, you're still young.

100
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,330
Isn't it a waste to die when you've got a whole life to live?

101
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:46,540
Don't focus on the one girl. You might well find someone else.

102
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,184
And you're still a virgin, right?

103
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,510
Why not give life a go, at least until graduation?

104
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,263
Life doesn't end at high school.

105
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,140

108
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,800
I think I'll give it another go.

00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:21,080
We'll be back with the emergency rations I have stashed.

172
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:24,290
Aren't any convenience stores open?

173
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:26,950
They've been looted already.

174
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,480
I see.

175
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:44,910
Man, what a throwback.

176
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,780
I didn't think you'd still be living here.

177
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,600
Well, I am.

178
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,640
Seriously, nothing has changed.

179
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:07,560
By the way, what was your job before this?

180
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,080
I was a clerk.

181
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:11,060
Pretty cool.

182
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:16,060
Not really. It wasn't full-time, and the pay was low too.

183
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,030
But it's easy work.

184
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,000
Besides, ultimately, saving up money was pointless.

185
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,770
Fair point.

186
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,210
Ah, fond memories.

187
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,570
Your neighbours would always complain about how noisy we were

188
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,610
while going at it on this very bed.

189
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:37,700
I'm surprised you remember something so trivial.

190
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,770
Well, your voice was on the loud side.

191
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,610
Does that still hold true?

192
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,520
Shut your damn mouth.

193
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:49,810
Hey,

194
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,520
come sit here.

195
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,380
Sorry?

196
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,240
Come on, don't be shy.

197
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,290
Hey.

198
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,930
What now?

199
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,360
Do you want to do it, for old times sake?

200
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:34,227
You're out of your mind.

201
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,800
I know we had our rough times, but who cares anymore?

202
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,360
The world's going to shit anyway.

203
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,500
That's no reason to...

204
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:52,870
Feeling good will take your mind off it all.

205
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,960
I remember your mole here.

206
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,270
What sort of sex have you been having?

207
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,740
Tell me, Masumi.

208
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,970
Our fling may have been a page in the book of your youth,

209
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,800
but I was left traumatized!

210
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,910
I'm still deeply scarred by the whole experience.

211
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,300
Don't you get it?

212
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,790
To me, sex was a form of trust.

213
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,630
You betrayed that.

214
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,960
Crushed it to pieces.

215
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,910
Don't tell me you haven't had sex with anyone since...?

216
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,940
I'm sure a fuckboy like you would never understand.

217
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:25,793
Let's not get hung up over that.

218
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,380
We only have seven days left to live.

219
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:39,120
During our last week alive, I promise

220
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,970
I won't have sex with anyone but you.

221
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,150
Deal?

222
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,130
I said I'm sorry.

223
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:11,510
I won't come on to you anymore, okay?

224
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,750
I'm not even surprised.

225
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,650
Of course this pathological fuckboy

226
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:28,120
can promise his eternal love to me in the final week of his life.

227
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,140
Yuma?

228
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,570
Oh.

229
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,420
He passed out as soon as he finished eating.

230
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:51,130
And that's why you can't serve alcohol to minors.

231
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,900
But it would have been such a pity if he had died without tasting it.

232
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,380
I guess you have a point.

233
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,680
A power outage?

234
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,340
That must be the backup power kicking in.

235
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,430
Yes, this is the logical outcome.

236
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,530
One week left?

237
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,520
Will we be able to survive?

238
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:51,640
We'll just have to find a way.

239
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:57,800
Let's sleep. We've got an early start tomorrow.

240
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,990
I only have one bed.

241
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,710
Don't you dare touch me.

242
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,960
I know.

243
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,340
Everything smells like Ritsu.

244
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:35,470
Honestly, if he touched me now,

245
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,160
I'd get a hard on, no question.

246
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,020
♫ Our shadows come close, as if reminiscing ♫

247
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,970
♫ I stopped, unable to touch your cheek ♫

248
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:49,120
He's right.

249
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,320
Spending my last days fooling around might make for a nice memory.

250
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,580
♫ I'll no longer regret those days long past ♫

251
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,340
And yet...

252
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,650
During our last week alive,

253
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,010
I promise I won't have sex with anyone but you.

254
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,150
♫ For I'll always remember them ♫

255
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,150
What an absolutely

256
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,430
wretched fool I am.

257
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,920
♫ Do not disappear, do not waver ♫

258
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,140
Masumi?

259
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,480
♫ Burn as we might, heartrending as it may be ♫

260
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,290
♫ Yet being with you ♫

261
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:34,600
♫ This very moment is my everything ♫

262
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,540
Are you asleep?

263
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:55,350
You're gay?

264
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,770
Sure, that's gross, but I'm jealous.

265
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,230
Masumi...

266
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,870
Help me...

267
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,420
Sorry. I can't come along.
[This drama is a work of fiction]

268
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:12,650
No one can blame you.
