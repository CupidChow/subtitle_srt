Agreed.

172
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:49,480
You'll be fine! I promise.

173
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,070
This place is tingling with negative ions.

174
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:56,910
I haven't heard anyone say "negative ion" in a while.

175
00:15:57,558 --> 00:15:59,570
Really?

176
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:02,880
I mean, it's all pseudoscience, right?

177
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,030
Hey, no need to be a hard-ass.

178
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:09,440
I'm just trying to say this place feels refreshing.

179
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,020
My bad.

180
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:18,912
This is all so weird.

181
00:16:21,327 --> 00:16:23,330
Weird how?

182
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:26,660
Just look at me. I'm sitting in a river, in my boxers.

183
00:16:27,721 --> 00:16:31,970
It would have been absurd to me ten days ago.

184
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,100
For one, I never even wanted to partake in outdoor activities.

185
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:39,040
You have a point there.

186
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:43,800
Every day, I had a routine of going to and from work.

187
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,120
My days off were spent drinking at home,

188
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,750
watching stupid videos,

189
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,590
and playing mobile games.

190
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,870
Who knew the great outdoors could be so beautiful?

191
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:11,980
And it wasn't even that far from home.

192
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:21,157
I should have ventured out a bit more.

193
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,060
Masumi.

194
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,130
That's exactly why...

195
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,700
I'm grateful for what you did.

196
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,590
Yuma and Meguru...

197
00:17:49,357 --> 00:17:53,778
are both people I would never have met if I hadn't accompanied you.

198
00:17:59,137 --> 00:18:05,446
After all, I never expanded my social circle after graduating.

199
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,959
So...

200
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,957
I sort of feel like I've wasted my life.

201
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,040
If I had had the courage,

202
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:30,815
I could have seen so much more, you know?

203
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,260
Not like there's any use having regrets now.

204
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,435
Ritsu, could you help me up?

205
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,600
What a sight to see before dying.

206
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,910
This might not be the end.

207
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,551
I...

208
00:19:30,437 --> 00:19:34,823
still want to explore the world with you.

209
00:19:38,057 --> 00:19:42,325
I still have plenty things I want to see...

210
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:47,280
and do.

211
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,590
So I have a request.

212
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,720
Would you please...

213
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:04,950
fall in love with me again?

214
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:41,670
Damn, you look terrible.

215
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,100
Didn't you say...

216
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:53,910
you could easily tell who's in love with you?

217
00:21:23,683 --> 00:21:25,319
Wasn't that refreshing?

218
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,189
Sure was.

219
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,220
Isn't that...

220
00:21:35,257 --> 00:21:40,300
Oh... I guess they're like "that"?

221
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,850
For real?

222
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,480
Let's just pretend we didn't see that, okay?

223
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,806
Y-Yes.

- Madoka is...
- Mother!

234
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,942
- Madoka is...
- Hold on!

235
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:58,222
I can't blame their reaction.

236
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,920
Neither can I.

237
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,320
Thank you for bringing Meguru home.

238
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,833
Of course.

239
