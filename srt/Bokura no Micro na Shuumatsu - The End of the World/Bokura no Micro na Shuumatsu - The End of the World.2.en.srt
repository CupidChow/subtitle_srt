1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:05,490
I think this is another specialty of mine.

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,050
I can easily tell who's in love with me.

3
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:39,630
You know how to have sex with men?

4
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,160
Yes.

5
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:55,720
Holy shit...

6
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,620
You're soaked.

7
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,200
What the hell?

8
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:18,300
This feels so good...

9
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,490
Masumi...

10
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,400
Can I put it in?

11
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,900
Sure.

12
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,880
Feels good?

13
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,800
Ritsu.

14
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,310
Yes?

15
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,310
You've had sex with men before, haven't you?

16
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:43,520
I have.

17
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,990
I'm actually bi.

18
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,890
Oh.

19
00:02:57,990 --> 00:03:03,190
If I had to guess, this wasn't your first time either.

20
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,550
No. Just once though.

21
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,680
It was with some guy I matched up with.

22
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,610
I didn't care who it was, I just wanted to try having sex with men.

23
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:23,090
How did that go?

24
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,940
Well...

25
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,530
It gave me experience, if anything.

26
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,610
I see.

27
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,660
Ritsu...

28
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:01,870
Can we stay like this a while longer?

29
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,540
Sure.

30
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,710
I never knew how different it'd feel

31
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,040
having sex with someone I loved.

[The End Of The World With You]

[Episode 2: Reuniting with Lost Love]

34
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,080
Something's up?

35
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,540
What, don't tell me you fell in love.

36
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,940
Huh?

37
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:53,010
No, of course not.

38
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:56,520
Man, you're such an open book.

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,950
- My bad.
- So? Who's the girl? Is she cute?

40
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,320
Not exactly cute, but...

41
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,700
popular.

42
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,670
That's bad, isn't it?

43
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:16,730
Popular chicks get all the guys. You'll be tossed out, easy.

44
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,200
Tossed out?

45
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,210
No offense, but she's out of your league. Choose another girl.

46
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,850
OK?

47
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,280
This ends our lecture for today.

48
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,430
We'll finish this up in the next class.

49
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,670
Finally done.

50
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,330
What's next, Ritsu?

51
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:45,640
Do you want to stop by somewhere?

52
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,780
How about it?

53
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,440
Are you hungry?

54
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,670
Masumi!

55
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,160
Where are you going?

56
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,600
I promised to write an article with him today.

57
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,980
But you just invited us for drinks.

58
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,600
Sorry.

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Another time, OK?

60
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,990
My bad.

61
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:14,100
Didn't you have plans with them?

62
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,320
It's fine.

63
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,510
Ritsu...!

64
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,250
I love you, Ritsu!

65
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,930
Ritsu!

66
00:06:46,807 --> 00:06:50,227
You're so lewd, Masumi.

67
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:05,470
We went at it like monkeys.

68
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,980
Can you blame us? We were only twenty.

69
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:29,450
It's morning already...

70
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:36,620
We're lazy, aren't we?

71
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,700
Could I have a sip?

72
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,120
I didn't think we'd be this compatible.

73
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,060
Really?

74
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,370
You're fun to be around with,

75
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:36,990
and I've been having a blast.

76
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:46,000
I feel like... you're special.

77
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,850
Ritsu...

78
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:02,230
I really love you, Masumi.

79
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,090
People can change.

80
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:13,980
- Huh?
- What?

81
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,830
- Is that even allowed?
- My feelings...

82
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,910
- Sounds fun, but...
- Want any?

83
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,210
Sure.

84
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,910
made it to Ritsu's heart.

85
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,492
Yes, that's delicious.

86
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,230
All this was thanks to the power of love.

[T/N : A week of holidays from April 29th]

88
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,520
I'm glad we got plenty of freshmen to join us this year.

89
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,800
Yes, thanks for appointing me as secretary.

90
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:11,320
How about sushi?

91
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,910
Sounds good!

92
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,100
Can we rest up somewhere first?

93
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,910
"Rest up"?

94
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:24,480
That's Kusakabe and... one of our freshies, right?

95
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,010
Man, Mr. Popular's a quick one.

96
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,590
Nishina?

97
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,230
Hey, Nishina!

98
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,340
All that's left is to finalize our manuscript.

99
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,850
I'll pour us some coffee.

100
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,410
Thank you.

101
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,640
Ritsu.

102
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,280
Yes?

103
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,390
You... went to a hotel with one of the freshmen, didn't you?

104
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,720
Huh?

105
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,280
Oh...

106
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,950
Sorry.

107
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,060
Guess you saw us.

108
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,560
That was rude of me.

109
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,450
My bad.

110
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:44,200
Huh? "Rude"?

111
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,930
Like I said, I'm sorry.

112
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,670
You bastard...

113
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:54,580
Is your only problem that "I found out"?

114
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,980
If anything, this wasn't the first time.

115
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,180
Besides, you never asked.

116
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,440
So I never answered.

117
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,930
Normally...

118
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:10,190
your partner would never doubt you.

119
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,070
- Really, now.
- Yes, really.

120
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,240
I thought you'd understand this side of me, Masumi.

121
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,950
Looks like I was being presumptuous.

122
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,360
Seriously...?

123
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:36,150
You know, I really do love you.

124
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:40,610
But the truth is I sleep with others as well.

125
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,620
If you can't accept that, let's call it quits.

126
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,300
What?

127
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,930
Then are you saying

128
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,300
we were essentially...

129
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:03,500
only fuck buddies?

130
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:09,530
If I had to categorize it? Yes.

131
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:13,380
Though I wouldn't think too hard about it.

132
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:22,750
Look, nothing's going to change between us.

133
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,200
Alright?

134
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,430
Anyway, that's the end of that.

135
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,260
Now let's finish up this article.

136
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,470
Please, go home.

137
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,560
- Masumi.
- Just leave!

138
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,860
Bye then.

139
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,060
No way...

140
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,540
No damn way!

141
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,250
Fuck...

142
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,640
Fuck!

143
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,880
Fucking hell!

144
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,080
I thought I could change him.

145
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:03,140
That we were meant to be.

146
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,910
I honestly thought I was special.

147
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:16,320
How delusional I was.

148
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:25,490
And so, let's have our summer vacation at the beach!

149
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,600
- And BBQ!
- Right!

150
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,030
Let's add that to our plans.

151
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:31,210
Oh, Ritsu!

152
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,620
- Hey.
- Hi!

153
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,100
We're planning our summer.

154
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,220
Do you want in?

155
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,380
- Let's talk outside today.
- Huh?

156
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,090
Outside? Where?

157
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:55,030
- Hey, wait up!
- Wait!

158
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,840
Ritsu!

159
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:06,780
[I miss you.]

160
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,950
- What next?
- Hmm... I wonder.

161
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,850
Any preferences?

162
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,960
How about Japanese sake?

163
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,110
- Sure.
- Cool. I know a nice store near by.

164
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,830
Really?

165
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:53,510
Give it a damn rest.

166
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:58,080
Stop stalking me from the station every day.

167
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,660
Your constant emails aren't appreciated either.

168
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,850
I can't help it. It bothers me.

169
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,200
What?

170
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:15,620
I can't stop thinking about who you're sleeping with now.

171
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,390
I'm going crazy over how much it bothers me!

172
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:32,040
If you don't quit it, I'll tell our whole club you're gay.

173
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,570
What?

174
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,460
As for me, I'm bi, and have no intention of hiding it.

175
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:42,150
But you'd prefer to keep it under wraps, right?

176
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,940
When did you take that?

177
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,910
As soon as we began having sex.

178
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,520
It was my fail-safe for situations like this.

179
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,020
Don't bother me anymore.

180
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,280
Bye.

181
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,770
I had never met him since that day.

182
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,310
Up next, more news about the incoming meteor.

183
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,890
And yet...

184
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:40,940
The massive meteor is projected to strike Northern Australia in nine days.

185
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,580
According to the latest information from the U.S. Department of Defense,

186
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,450
the impact will obliterate the Southern Hemisphere in an instant.

187
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,370
A few days before the destruction of this world,

188
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,080
I was reunited with the one man...

189
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,670
Ritsu...

190
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,480
Masumi?

191
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:02,210
I most certainly didn't want to meet.

192
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:04,240
Masumi!

193
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,350
It's really you!

194
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:10,640
You haven't changed at all.

195
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,080
I could tell it was you in an instant.

196
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,910
How long has it been?

197
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:24,260
[September 16th, 2023 / 5:30 PM]

198
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,360
Since we graduated.

199
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:30,000
So that's... a decade, huh?

200
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,450
How have you been? Well?

201
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:43,810
Right...

202
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:45,610
Who would be well now?

203
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:50,950
Why are you here?

204
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:57,650
To tell you the truth, I've had a book long overdue.

205
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,030
I always regretted not returning it.

206
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,900
A bit late for that.

207
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,590
Desperate times make people think, you know?

208
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,760
You have to squeeze in a good deed for a ticket to heaven.

209
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,570
You believe in heaven?

210
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,420
Surprised?

211
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,590
We can't exactly talk here. How about we step out?

212
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:32,780
And why do I owe you a conversation?

213
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,390
Now that's cold.

214
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,140
You just reunited with a friend...

215
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,640
We're not friends!

216
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:44,200
Then, the gases released into the atmosphere during the planetary impact will bring a nuclear winter to Earth.

217
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,540
The atmosphere will become less transparent and sunlight will be blocked,

218
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,450
Without the ability to photosynthesize, plants will die, and the animals that feed on plants...

219
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,950
Come on.

220
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,700
Let's go.

221
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,970
It is expected to cause such an environmental destruction that no one can survive.

222
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,980
Spending the end holed up in a library sounds just like you.

223
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,500
Is there no one special you want to see?

224
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,850
Not really.

225
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,160
I see.

226
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,450
What about you?

227
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,410
I'm sure you have plenty.

228
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:31,500
Just the other day, I heard you and that actress had it going.

229
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,450
You were all over the news, Mr. CEO.

230
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,470
We've cut ties long ago.

231
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,720
Same old you.

232
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:47,100
Seriously, I don't have a single soul contacting me.

233
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:52,000
That's karma for you.

234
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,000
You're ruthless.

235
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,500
As always.

236
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,970
Seeing that speck

237
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,260
reminds me that Earth is actually ending.

238
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,760
♫ Our shadows come close, as if reminiscing ♫

239
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,350
I'd say fate brought us here.

240
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,720
Why don't we spend our last days together?

241
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,380
No way.

242
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,640
That was quick.

243
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,260
Have you forgotten

244
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:40,340
everything you've done to me?

245
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:47,470
♫ For I'll always remember them ♫

246
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:52,500
I consider our time together...

247
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,850
to be good memories.

248
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,000
♫ Yet being with you - ♫

249
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,830
Well, I don't.

250
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,750
Cold.

251
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,500
See you never.

252
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,530
If I had a drug that would let you die without pain, wouldn't you want it?

253
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,190
I'm sure death by meteor terrifies you.

254
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,680
Well, guess what? I've got just the drug.

255
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,270
Seriously?

256
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:41,670
It's all yours as long as you help me out.

257
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,300
With what?

258
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,870
Disposing of a corpse.

259
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,700
Disposing of a corpse...?

260
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,190
- It's at my place right now.
- You gave this drug to a boy ?

261
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,410
Apparently, it's used for euthanasia in some foreign country.

262
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:11,710
Here.

263
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,200
That's strange...

264
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,280
His heart wasn't beating this morning.

265
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,940
What's going on?

266
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,940
Feeling good

267
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,900
will take your mind off it all.
