No. Plane tickets are expensive this time of year.

Are you there, Masumi?

170
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,590
I'm sorry...

171
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,920
for all I've done.

172
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,670
I'm sorry for hitting you,

173
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,120
and asking you for money, time and time again.

174
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,300
I...

175
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,850
truly regret what I've done.

176
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,490
Masumi...?

177
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,700
Masumi, you're a kind child.

178
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,730
You'll always come help me...

179
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,750
Right?

180
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,850
Please... Masumi...

181
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,420
Come help me.

182
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,090
I'm begging you.

183
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,360
Masumi...

184
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,820
[No service]

185
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,500
What's wrong?

186
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:31,480
My mother...

187
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,450
What about her?

188
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:37,658
She sprained her back, and can't move.

189
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,770
She was begging me for help.

190
00:16:48,498 --> 00:16:49,868
Hey.

191
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,100
Sorry, I can't come along.

192
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm going to see how she's doing.

193
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,263
I don't blame you.

194
00:17:00,263 --> 00:17:02,170
You should.

195
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,900
Is she far?

196
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,400
In Chiba.

197
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,650
How are you going to get there?

198
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,433
By riding that bicycle.

199
00:17:08,433 --> 00:17:11,472
One day's enough to get to Chiba.

200
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:16,661
Don't.

201
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,500
Didn't you cut ties with your shitty mother?

202
00:17:25,667 --> 00:17:28,767
No, man. His mom is family.

203
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:31,117
Are you going to abandon your mom?

204
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,760
Masumi.

205
00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:41,820
Yuma's right.

206
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,567
I'm leaving.

207
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,107
Sorry.

208
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,080
Then I quit.

209
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,610
I'm going back home to relax.

210
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,833
What the hell?

211
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,543
You promised you'd take me back to Hamamatsu!

212
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,134
Breaking that promise doesn't hurt me.

213
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,940
If Masumi's not going, then neither am I.

214
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,830
It's too much of a hassle.

215
00:18:16,433 --> 00:18:20,140
Hey, make the trip. You promised him.

216
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,013
It doesn't matter.

217
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:28,110
We're both doing what we want,

218
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,070
with the little time we have left, right?

219
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,970
Doing what we want?

220
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,410
So, what will it be, Masumi?

221
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:31,060
Look, the sunset's beautiful.

222
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,120
How about we take a break, and stop by the ocean?

223
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,330
Sounds good.

224
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:07,329
Do you think this driftwood has washed up here because of the meteorite in Mexico?

225
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,860
Sorry.

226
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,730
Did you want to go to your mother?

227
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,200
Of course not.

228
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,680
I gave it some thought,

229
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,950
and still didn't want to go.

230
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:24,640
Though my mother never treasured me,

231
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,830
it's downright cruel to meet this sort of end.

232
00:21:44,533 --> 00:21:49,430
♪ The red dragonfly of the sunset end ♪

233
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:54,110
♪ Flew to and fro ♪

234
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,030

♪ But was the basket of harvest ♪

239
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,600
The coldness of my heart

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,873
♪ merely an illusion? ♪

241
00:22:13,873 --> 00:22:16,013
filled me with despair.

242
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,680
Masumi.

243
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,930
It's my fault you didn't go.

244
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,930
No one can blame you.

245
00:22:51,590 --> 00:23:01,820
♫ I stopped, unable to touch your cheek. ♫

246
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,690
♫ I'll no longer regret ♫

247
00:23:05,690 --> 00:23:11,360
♫  those days long past ♫

248
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:15,070
Masumi!

249
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:19,100
Come here! Let the ocean cheer you up!

250
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:24,310
♫ Do not disappear, do not waver ♫

251
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:29,030
♫ Let’s burn as we might, heartrending as it may be ♫

252
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,303
Do you want to go?

253
00:23:30,303 --> 00:23:33,840
♫ Yet being with you ♫

254
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,980
♫ This very moment is my everything ♫

255
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,760
Hey! That's dangerous!

256
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,440
I'll be fine! Hurry up!

257
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,803
Just be careful.

258
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:45,713
Masumi, join us!

259
00:23:46,687 --> 00:23:48,090
Come on!

260
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:51,840
Was the ocean by Shonan always this beautiful?

261
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,483
I wonder. Right?

262
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:59,300
Hurry up,

263
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,267
get over here! Run!

264
00:24:02,527 --> 00:24:05,570
Maataso... You're alive!

265
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,900
I'll be counting on you.

266
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,240
Life's a bit easier knowing it will end this week.

267
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,400
Maybe he's a miracle boy.

268
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,300
Go to hell!

269
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,790
What if Yuma caused all this?
