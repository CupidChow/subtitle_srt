Yes.

173
00:16:04,431 --> 00:16:07,410
My company wasn't doing so well,

174
00:16:07,410 --> 00:16:12,140
and as their sponsor, I was to take the blame, debt and all.

175
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,933
I see.

176
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:18,520
Either way, my future looked bleak.

177
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,820
Of course I would want to die.

178
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,670
But now?

179
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,780
Now I feel like I would make it work out.

180
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:52,680
Remember how we reunited at the library?

181
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,313
Of course I do.

182
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:59,186
You came to return an overdue book. What a coincidence, huh?

183
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,776
Sorry, that was a lie.

184
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,520
I was actually waiting for you.

185
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,720
Huh?

186
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,500
What do you mean?

187
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,240
Back in college, you told me about your ideal way of going out.

188
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:26,530
You said if Earth were to end tomorrow, you'd pass time by reading in the library.

189
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:33,390
Did I?

190
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,450
You don't remember?

191
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:40,700
Because I do.

192
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,320
I remember all our little moments together, Masumi.

193
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:50,350
And although it was a baseless assumption,

194
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,080
you were actually there.

195
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:00,730
For that alone, I'll thank our friend Mr. Meteor.

196
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:11,630
I'm really glad...

197
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,680
I got to reunite with you.

198
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,230
I'm sure life will throw us hell...

199
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:54,260
even if we survive.

200
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,750
Still...

201
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,920
I want to live on,

202
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,220
if it means a future with you.

203
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,330
It didn't feel like the first time in ten years.

204
00:19:53,227 --> 00:19:55,050
Right there...

205
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,190
Shit...!

206
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:12,465
You haven't changed one bit, Masumi.

207
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,610
Ritsu...

208
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,660
I would never have imagined ten days ago...

209
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,280
that I'd be messing around with you again.

210
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:04,640
♫ Our shadows come close, as if reminiscing ♫

211
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:14,930
♫ I stopped, unable to touch your cheek ♫

212
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:24,360
♫ I'll no longer regret those days long past ♫

213
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:32,170
♫ For I'll always remember them ♫

214
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,860
Masumi.

215
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,150
What is it?

216
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:44,600
Thank you...

217
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,350
for sticking with me until the end.

218
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:55,230
♫ This very moment, is my everything ♫

219
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,010
Of course.

220
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:13,658
I guess miracles...

221
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,500
do exist.

222
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:35,040
The End Of The World With You

223
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,990
Channel Manager: drboo

224
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,000
Thanks to the Segmentation team:
kitty100 (CS), izii and padmalayag

225
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,020
Thanks to our Editors:
yunoilwoo (TE) and taijitu_09 (FE)

226
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,030
Thanks to all our Other Language Moderators and their teams

227
00:23:05,555 --> 00:23:07,325
What time is it?

228
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:10,230
5:28 AM.

229
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:20,850
That's... the estimated impact time.

230
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,410
Yes.

231
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,690
What's going to happen to everything?

232
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,450
Either way, I guess neither of us want to die.

233
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,310
I'm opening it.

234
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:11,010
Alright.
