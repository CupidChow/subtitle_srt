Sorry, I'm on my way.

00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,337
Yes.

In that case, call me Masumi.

171
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,640
Masumi, you study literature, right?

Yes.

Lucky you.

174

If I had my way, I'd also be a literature major.

175
00:12:55,330 --> 00:13:01,210
But my parents said they wouldn't pay for anything that'd be useless for my future.

Still, I'm thankful they even sent me to college.

I'm from Chiba.

We've got nothing but oceans.

Yes, it definitely is.

Exactly.

I envy the long trip to Kyushu, though.

Ritsu and I began to frequently hang out together.

 (T/N: This is a parody of the movie "Truck Yarou" starring Bunta Sugawara.)

Don't you have a girlfriend?

You're always hanging around with me, so I wondered...

Thanks.

Maintaining a relationship becomes very troublesome.

209

I like studying, and want to have time for myself.

You do.

You can't blame me for assuming you do, given your cute face.

Are you joking? If so, then quit it.

I'm being honest here.

217
00:15:23,222 --> 00:15:27,364
You're unpopular only because of your gloomy attitude.

218

I don't appreciate this backhanded compliment.

No. I'm your average, unpopular virgin.
