I'm begging you,

2
00:00:05,690 --> 00:00:07,750
Masumi.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,440
It's my fault you didn't go.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,510
No one can blame you.

Our private generator provides electricity,

7
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,500
so we get the customers.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,920
The exit is that way if you don't agree.

9

Thankfully, money is the simplest solution.

Here.

12
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,260
Thank you, sir.

13
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,610
Our room's huge!

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,950
And nice too.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,000
I guess people prepare for the worst.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,910
- Honestly, I'm glad he did.
- Agreed.

17
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:12,730
- Stop!
- Just follow me.

18
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,050
- Let me go!
- Seriously?

19
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,830
- Don't touch me.
- Get in.

- Stop.
- This isn't what I agreed to.

[Episode 5: Newfound Doubt Amidst the Chaos]

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,160
Thank you for saving me.

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,870
My name is Kagami Meguru.

55
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,390
Madoka was my elder sister.

56
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,510
I... see.

57
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,530
So she also had a sister.

58
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,070
Anyone cares to explain?

59
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,870
Maataso...

60
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,490
Her elder sister was my favourite idol

61
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,230
who committed suicide.

62
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,430
Right, the one who made the headlines.

63
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,390
Her band was pretty famous.

64
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,990
Wait a second, you knew Maataso, Ritsu?

65
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,710
Oh... yes.

66
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,590
We co-starred in several shows.

67
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,650
Sorry, I'm only her sister.

68
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,130
Anyway, what brought you here, Meguru?

69
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,350
I was attending university in Tokyo

70
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,510
when all this occurred.

71
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,190
I resorted to hitch-hiking so I could reunite with my family.

72
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,830
Where do they live?

73
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,480
Matsumoto.

74
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,120
I see. That's still pretty far.

75
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,950
Men are scary, aren't they?

76
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,830
This is actually the third time something similar has happened.

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,770
Maybe it's because of how you're dressed?

78
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,210
This kind of outfit gets the cars to stop.

79
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,700
I can't argue with that.

80
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,990
What's the matter?

81
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,390
I have another favour to ask.

82
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,890
Let's hear it.

83
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:45,610
May I... stay in this room tonight?

84
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,620
Huh?

85
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,860
Is that... a no?

86
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,250
Of course you can!

87
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,770
Let's take her to Matsumoto!

88
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,150
Are you sure? Hamamatsu's the other way.

89
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:08,200
- Of course I'm sure! Masumi, you fool!
- Fool...?

90
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,460
Hey, you.

91
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,790
Yes?

92
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,460
You're still a high schooler, right?

93
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,430
I was...

94
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,430
a big fan of your sister.

95
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,160
Really.

96
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,990
But she... you know.

97
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:38,420
Then my crush rejected me,

98
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,290
and I felt like everything was over.

99
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,970
Next thing I know, the world's ending too.

100
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,470
I began questioning why I was even born.

101
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:55,390
But…

102
00:06:58,150 --> 00:06:59,850
But?

103
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:05,430
I think fate willed us to meet.

104
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,350
So I will take you home.

105
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,680
It's my calling!

106
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:16,970
It's the very reason I was born!

107
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,830
What about you two?

108
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,010
If Yuma is willing, we'll take you anywhere.

109
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,280
Yes.

110
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,520
I see.

111
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,030
Thank you, Yuma.

112
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,620
I'll be counting on you.

113
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,210
Hey!

114
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,400
Yuma? Can you hear me?

115
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,100
- Yuma! Wake up!
- Are you alright?

116
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,460
Yuma!

117
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,070
Is he okay?

118
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,580
Yes, he's fine. This is normal for youngsters.

119
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,130
- Is it?!
- Yes, it is.

120
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:52,570
Hey! Yuma!

121
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,130
- He's an interesting kid.
- Hey! Are you alright?

122
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,700
- Sure, but he's a real hassle.
- Yuma!

123
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,320
Go get some water!

124
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,410
On it.

125
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,310
Can you drink water? Yuma!

126
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,030
- Yuma.
- Yuma!

127
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,590
- Let's get you some water, okay? Yuma!
- Yuma.

128
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,330
Water. Can you drink water?

129
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,540
His arm won't go down...

130
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,810
- Yuma!
- Hey, Yuma!

131
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,830
Will he be okay?

132
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,200
Yes, he's fine.

133
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,430
But...

134
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,740
- Yuma?
- Yuma!

135
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,860
- Are you alright, buddy? Yuma!
- Yuma!

136
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,490
Yuma!

137
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,480
Why are the both of us on the floor?

138
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,870
Stop complaining.

139
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,670
Just sleep, OK?

140
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,330
Ritsu.

141
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,710
You were

142
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:12,730
dating Kagami Madoka, weren't you?

143
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,560
Is your man's intuition telling you so?

144
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,790
Sure.

145
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,350
No, we weren't.

146
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,350
Then you were friends with benefits.

147
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,760
No.

148
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,810
Not with her.

149
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,710
Is that so?

150
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,810
Still, I didn't think we'd meet her lookalike sister.

151
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,930
I guess fate isn't just a figment of Yuma's imagination.

152
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:12,770
Maybe he's a miracle boy.

153
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,250
Then I wish he'd stop the meteor while he's at it.

154
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,150
Do you really?

155
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,310
Weren't you going to take

156
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,300
the drug you gave Yuma?

157
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,200
Yes, I guess so.

158
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,490
Life's a bit easier

159
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,090
knowing it will end this week.

160
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,980
Why?

161
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,950
Don't ask the hard questions.

162
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,900
What happened to you?

163
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,570
Sorry. Can we save this for tomorrow?

164
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:26,010
I'm worn out.

165
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,640
Ritsu.

166
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,720
We still have five days.

167
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,850
If you're curious,

168
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:38,890
stick with me until the very end.

169
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,220
What the hell...

170
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:50,890
At this point, how could I not?

171
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,710
S-Sorry!

172
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,850
What's wrong?

173
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,590
Morning.

174
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,170
What's with you two?

175
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:18,520
Masumi, you saw it, didn't you?

176
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,600
Huh?

177
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:42,560
How much longer until Matsumoto?

178
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:45,650
Three hours, give or take.

179
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,620
Isn't that great, Meguru?

180
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,390
Yes, thank you.

181
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,840
Hell yes! Let's get pumped!

182
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:02,530
Come on, Masumi! Let's hear it!

183
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,830
Matsumoto!

184
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:10,150
Wait! Bathroom break!

185
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,180
You're drinking too much water.

186
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,930
I have to piss!

187
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,130
What a troublemaker...

188
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:36,840
So... could you start by telling us why you dress like a girl?

189
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:46,760
For one, I don't want to necessarily become a girl.

190
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,380
The truth is...

191
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,550
Here.

192
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:03,530
My hobby is uploading erotic selfies on social media.

193
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,040
Seriously?

194
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,280
I just never had the courage to step outdoors dressed like a girl.

195
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,540
That's why I decided to try it out before dying.

196
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,140
I see.

197
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:26,050
I'm sorry for tricking you guys.

198
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,430
I don't really mind.

199
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,010
Yuma might be shocked though.

200
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:36,480
Could you not tell him?

201
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,230
Why?

202
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:41,680
Well, you know.

203
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,000
Have you seen how his eyes sparkle at me?

204
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:54,880
That's the face of a virgin who would get off on my sister.

205
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,130
A young boy is forced to meet doomsday.

206
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:09,890
- I'd rather not crush his dreams too.
- Sorry!

207
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,610
Fair point.

208
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:17,920
Let's let him dream on.

209
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,290
I'm relieved!

210
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,790
- You're good?
- Never better.

211
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,860
It's so hot...

212
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Hey, how about some AC? I'm going to get a heatstroke.

213
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,480
No can do. We need the gas to get to Matsumoto.

214
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,240
Excuse me, do you still have water, guys?

215
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,770
Huh?

216
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,600
Shit,

217
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,890
we're down to one bottle.

218
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,670
That's bad news.

219
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,320
Water! We've got water! You won't find it anywhere else.

220
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,070
Look, he's got some!

221
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,310
I'm telling you, I got water!

222
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,610
We have the money.

223
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:18,350
Money won't be worth shit.

224
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,150
I'm trading for food and batteries.

225
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,170
Do you need either? Earth's ending in a few days.

226
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:28,090
This meteor won't destroy Earth.

227
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,840
It's bringing an ice age. Everyone around here is stockpiling.

228
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,560
Really?

229
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:38,470
Why don't you guys pray for rain instead?

230
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,750
Are things going alright?

231
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:46,550
Who's this? She's with you?

232
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:48,720
Yes.

233
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,750
What a cutie.

234
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,920
Wait a second. You look like that idol I know.

235
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,920
Back off, old man!

236
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,580
I know.

237
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,320
I'll give you a bottle,

238
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,630
so could you jerk me in exchange?

239
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:16,710
What?!

240
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,620
I'm pent up, OK?

241
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:23,770
I'll even throw in an entire carton if we go all the way. How about it?

242
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:25,210
Knock it off!

243
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,340
Don't humour him. Let's go.

244
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,650
No, I don't mind.

245
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,810
It's really no big deal.

246
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:34,290
Huh?

247
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,940
She gets it! Alright, let's go.

248
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:41,850
You're being irrational.

249
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,840
Did you forget?

250
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,550
I'm a guy.

251
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:50,120
Jerking one dick is no big deal.

252
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,600
Just because you're a guy doesn't make it okay!

253
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,390
You're down, yes? Then let's go.

254
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,710
Hey, wait! I said, wait!

255
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,580
No fucking way you're taking her!

256
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,870
Huh?

257
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,630
Unforgivable.

258
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,870
Is that thunder?

259
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,550
I'll never let this slide.

260
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:26,010
You're a perverted piece of shit!

261
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,780
What the hell's up with him?

262
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,150
You're trying to defile Meguru.

263
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,990
Go to fucking hell!

264
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,250
Everything's on fire! Shit, shit!

265
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,900
Hey! Don't just stare! Help me!

266
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,200
Let's run!

267
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,920
Help me, damn it!

268
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,330
Ouch! It's hot!

269
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,450
- Let's catch the rain.
- Yeah.

270
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,450
Masumi, could you get our empty bottles?

271
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,090
Alright.

272
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,870
Ritsu.

273
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,970
Here.

274
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,550
Thanks.

275
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,740
Sorry about earlier.

276
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,940
No, I'm sorry as well.

277
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Meguru.

278
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:20,300
♫ Our shadows come close, as if reminiscing ♫

279
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,880
Don't say you're alright with that sort of stuff.

280
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,480
Or that it's no big deal.

281
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:42,630
♫ I'll no longer regret those days long past ♫

282
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,630
Because it's a sad thought.

283
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,280
I'm sorry.

284
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,630
♫ Burn as we might, heartrending as it may be ♫

285
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,350
♫ Yet being with you  ♫

286
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,690
- Listen.
- Yes?

287
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,850
Don't make fun of me when I say this, okay?

288
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,500
Okay.

289
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,660
What if this downpour and that lightning from earlier

290
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:25,840
were all caused by Yuma?

291
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,750
Why did my sister die?

292
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:45,480
If I was given another chance, I told myself I wouldn't make any mistakes.

293
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,980
Masumi!

294
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,220
We only have four days left to live.

295
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:59,090
There's no point in lamenting the past nor hoping for a future anymore.
