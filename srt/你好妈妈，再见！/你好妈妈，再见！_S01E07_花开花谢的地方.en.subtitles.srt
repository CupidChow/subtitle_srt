1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,420
THE YEAR 2013

2
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:48,381
-I want to go to Hong Kong!
-Don't be ridiculous.

3
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,800
You're just thinking of going shopping,
aren't you?

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,135
How about Iceland?

5
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,804
The auroras looked really awesome on TV.

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,930
-Really?
-Yes.

7
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,850
-Auroras...
-Iceland is good. Or maybe the Himalayas.

8
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:02,645
The Himalayas? Don't be absurd.
Go by yourself. I'd ruin all my clothes.

9
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,440
Hey. When you face Mother Nature,

10
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,360
you will realize
what an insignificant being you are.

11
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,821
That trip will allow us to look back
on ourselves.

12
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,239
-Turn your head.
-Okay.

13
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,578
Can't you apply lotion yourself?

14
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,456
He'll get dry patches on his face
without his wife.

15
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,083
All right, then...

16
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:28,004
Let's choose one out of Iceland,
the Himalayas, and Mongolia.

17
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,214
-Okay.
-Okay.

18
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:32,592
No way. I don't want to. Go there
for your 70th birthday or something.

19
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:36,096
And why choose where to go
for our 60th birthdays already?

20
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,847
Who knows how long we'll be friends?

21
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,225
We'll be friends
as long as you don't cause any trouble.

22
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,061
-That's right.
-My first pick is Iceland for sure.

23
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:46,314
-Okay, let's go with that.
-Hey, Geun-sang. Why are you sitting?

24
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,983
-You said you'd make our meals.
-I did. That's it.

25
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,364
No way. Is this really it?

26
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,621
Move aside. You're blocking the fire.

27
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,209
Hyeon-jeong, move.

28
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,503
You're blocking the fire. Move.

29
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,630
It has to look like someone took my photo.

30
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,760
Should we kill this jerk?

31
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,138
-What is it?
-He didn't bring any rice or ramyeon.

32
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,472
-What?
-Really?

33
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,474
You can make noodles when you get home.

34
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,601
Camping is all about the vibe.

35
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,894
You didn't bring meat, either?

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,271
-I'm starving!
-No.

37
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,939
-You mean it?
-Yes.

38
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,399
-For real?
-Yes.

39
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:33,278
-How could you? Are you mad?
-That hurts!

40
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,654
How could you?

41
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,906
What should we do with you?

42
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,617
-You jerk.
-It took us hours to get here.

43
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:41,286
I didn't come here to starve!

44
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,745
My goodness.

45
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,622
Do you think I came here to starve?

46
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,291
-You didn't even bring ramyeon?
-How?

47
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,293
-How could you do this to us?
-I'm sorry.

48
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:50,753
Among the countless people in the world,

49
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:54,340
we build relationships
with certain people and settle down.

50
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,927
I was also blooming like a flower

51
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:01,222
among the people I was surrounded with.

52
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,235
Hey, go get some water for Dad.

53
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,738
-Go bring some water.
-My goodness.

54
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,493
I CAN'T SEE, SO I REALLY CAN'T WALK THERE

55
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,045
Here.

56
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,179
-Right.
-Looking much younger...

57
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,555
Looking so different...

58
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,015
Hey, Yu-ri!

59
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,183
-Hi!
-Hey!

60
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:47,143
-Yu-ri!
-It's been so long! How were you?

61
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,312
Hey, it's been such a long time.

62
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,606
-Why were you so late?
-I know, sorry.

63
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:55,652
I was going to come with Gang-hwa,
but he really couldn't get off work.

64
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,153
I was waiting for him.

65
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,656
We can just eat first.
He'll come and pay for our meals later.

66
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,074
-Really?
-Oh, my gosh!

67
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:04,118
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

68
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,411
So tell us.

69
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:07,872
Well, we were just talking...

70
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,667
-I don't know.
-What do you mean, you don't know?

71
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,686
I thought my flower had bloomed
firmly and strongly,

72
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:31,771
but it disappeared

73
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,856
too quickly.

74
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:04,804
EPISODE 7:
WHERE FLOWER BLOOMS AND FALLS

75
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,943
Can I do it?

76
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:25,843
You're keeping a distance from Gang-hwa
because of Min-jeong.

77
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:30,139
You can't do anything
because Gang-hwa is with Min-jeong.

78
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,101
Hyeon-jeong.

79
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,727
Yes?

80
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,938
I don't belong there anymore.

81
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,024
It's where Min-jeong

82
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,485
should be.

83
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,201
Min-jeong...

84
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,787
is preparing for a divorce.

85
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,290
She wants to divorce Gang-hwa.

86
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,709
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,629
She's not that kind of person.
There's no way.

88
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,424
I didn't believe it at first, either.
But...

89
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,009
I think it's true.

90
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:12,140
Yu-ri, don't think about anything else.

91
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,058
Just think about yourself.

92
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,476
What's the reason?

93
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,855
Gang-hwa can't get divorced.

94
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,731
That should never happen.

95
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:23,609
Why?

96
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,029
-Why can't that happen?
-Well...

97
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,573
Just because...

98
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:30,700
It just can't happen.

99
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:35,913
Yu-ri.

100
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,081
Look at me.

101
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,627
Yu-ri, look at me.

102
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,965
What are you hiding?

103
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,181
It's so strange.
I'm sure she's hiding something.

104
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:58,060
She knew about her drinking limit too.
How does she know so much about Min-jeong?

105
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,854
It's as if she's known her.

106
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,743
Are you feeling anxious?

107
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,246
If it weren't for Dr. Jang,
you would've been fired right away.

108
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,125
Did you win the lottery or something?
How can you be so reckless?

109
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,837
You're not a psychiatrist, dermatologist,
plastic surgeon, or orthopedist.

110
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,631
You're just a thoracic surgeon.

111
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,466
How will you make a living

112
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:30,343
outside the university hospital?
My goodness.

113
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,220
You're driving me nuts.

114
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,141
Geun-sang.

115
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,727
What is it? You can tell me anything.

116
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,562
You're giving me a headache.

117
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,565
Just go home.

118
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,236
You're so loud.

119
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,572
You talk so much.

120
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:58,079
Hey. Stop drinking.
Is drinking going to solve everything?

121
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,040
Ask that to the other person
sitting next to you.

122
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,042
Oh, my gosh!

123
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,336
How long have you been sitting there?

124
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,880
-What about the shop?
-I closed it for today.

125
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,341
Why? You were so precise
about closing hours.

126
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,429
Hey, Cho Gang-hwa.

127
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,683
Yes? What is it? Tell me.

128
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,602
You little... Take those out.

129
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,355
Do you know what Min-jeong...

130
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,070
Never mind.
I shouldn't say anything about it.

131
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,616
-You little...
-Don't add to his problems.

132
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,785
He's already going through a lot.

133
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,288
Oh, whatever. I don't know.

134
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,042
Take her home.
Her face will freeze from the cold.

135
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,170
Hey, can't you take her instead?

136
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,922
Okay, fine. Go.

137
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,509
My gosh.

138
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,428
Those two are so annoying.

139
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,222
I told you not to strain yourself.

140
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,230
I told you not to strain
or suppress yourself.

141
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,357
That's not the real you.

142
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,818
Then what is

143
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,987
the real me like?

144
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,161
Go home.
You'll really freeze in this weather.

145
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,997
That punk.

146
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:24,832
That little...

147
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:28,336
What did you mean? "Strain yourself"?

148
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:34,592
The person next to him is lonely
because he's straining himself.

149
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,219
Did Min-jeong say she's lonely?
Why? He's so good to her.

150
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,680
Hey, who do you like more?
Yu-ri or Min-jeong?

151
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,141
That's ridiculous. Is it like,
"Choose Mom or Dad"?

152
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,102
I choose Yu-ri. Definitely.

153
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,127
LOOKING FOR PICK-UP HELPER
SEO-WOO'S MOM

154
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,089
Helping out at the kitchen won't be easy,

155
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,258
but you want to be
Seo-woo's pick-up helper too?

156
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,761
Yes.

157
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,056
The kitchen work ends
before the kindergarten ends,

158
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,849
so I can stay there and get her home.

159
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:33,359
I don't know about anything else,
but I'm sure it'll be better

160
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,362
for me to do it than anyone else.

161
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,200
How can I know that?
We don't really know each other.

162
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,414
Right.

163
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,375
We don't.

164
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,809
Did you do something wrong behind my back?

165
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,769
Pardon?

166
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,313
Last night at the restaurant,
and now again...

167
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,649
you keep avoiding my eyes.

168
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,111
As if you're feeling guilty
about something.

169
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,489
Oh, did I do that?

170
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,283
I'm not sure.

171
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:23,993
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:30,750
I mean...

173
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,420
about your forehead.

174
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:37,923
I headbutted you.

175
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,303
I remember what I did.

176
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,891
Oh, it's fine.

177
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,398
It sounded pretty bad,
but my forehead is really firm

178
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,484
so that blow didn't cause much pain.

179
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:02,156
You look worse than me.
You have two injuries.

180
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,908
It must really hurt.

181
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:38,818
Seo-woo.

182
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,821
Do you like that kitchen lady?

183
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,198
Yes. I like the pretty lady.

184
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,911
You never smiled like that to me.

185
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,121
I feel kind of sad.

186
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,126
But I like you more.

187
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:42,131
You dried your hair in the bathroom again.

188
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,925
Yes. I'd drop hair on the floor
if I dry it outside.

189
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,721
I said I don't need vegetable juice.
It'll just be a bother to you.

190
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,227
Seo-woo, are you up? Should we go wash up?

191
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,688
No, it's fine. I'll do it.

192
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,525
All right, let's go wash up.

193
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:22,338
Gang-hwa.
I have something to talk about.

194
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,340
Is there something going on?

195
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,852
I heard that Seo-woo is a bit different
from other kids,

196
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,229
and that I should get her tested.
So I did.

197
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,606
CHO SEO-WOO

198
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:43,442
ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT
UNDERDEVELOPED

199
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,779
It seems like she's having some problems.

200
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,577
It's okay, Min-jeong. These places
always make things seem serious.

201
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:54,870
You don't need to worry.

202
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:58,499
Kids all develop differently.
Some can be slower than others.

203
00:15:58,582 --> 00:15:59,875
Don't worry about it.

204
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,090
All right.

205
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,351
And I think I'll get busy soon,

206
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,395
I'm thinking
of getting a pick-up helper again.

207
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,939
Right. That would be more convenient.

208
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,234
The new kitchen assistant
at Seo-woo's kindergarten...

209
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,860
What do you think of her?

210
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,199
-Who?
-The kitchen assistant, the young lady.

211
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,618
She said she wants to do it.

212
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,206
Oh, really?

213
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,294
So did you say she could do it?

214
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,171
I told her I'd think about it.

215
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,675
What do you think?

216
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:52,386
Well...

217
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,305
Well, what about you?

218
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,433
I'll think about it.

219
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,101
Oh, all right.

220
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,687
Do as you like.

221
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,753
I couldn't get any sleep
because of those darned ghosts.

222
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,384
You don't have much time left.
You can't afford to sleep.

223
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,097
We might have to wait a long time
if we take time thinking,

224
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:39,308
so we're just going to ask
our favor first.

225
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,102
Why are you hiding there like that?

226
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,313
-Well...
-We're on our way out.

227
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,358
Do you know

228
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:51,195
that everyone's been silent
since your visit?

229
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,956
How can I choose just one favor to ask?

230
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,460
Those ghosts already have a hard time
deciding on anything.

231
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,129
And you said
you'd only accept one favor each.

232
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,923
This is like torture for them.

233
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:13,926
It's him.

234
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,638
What? Wasn't he unemployed?

235
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,932
Our son's a pilot!

236
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:23,393
Look at him in his uniform.
Doesn't he look great?

237
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:24,686
Let's go.

238
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:46,542
Is he raising a pig?

239
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,336
I'm not doing this. I can't!

240
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,922
-No! Wait!
-You said you would.

241
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,841
Don't you have a conscience?

242
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,969
You want me to clean a place
that's dirtier than a pigpen?

243
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,513
I said I'd do you a favor,
not do manual labor.

244
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:00,806
You must be crazy.

245
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,351
That was way too harsh!

246
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,353
-What's with you?
-How could you

247
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:09,690
call someone else's kid a pig?

248
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,444
Why are you suddenly crying?

249
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,905
-How could she call him a pig?
-My son...

250
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:20,701
How could she call him a pig?
Unbelievable!

251
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:24,454
Hey, when did I call him a pig?
That was just a metaphor.

252
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,331
-How could you...
-How could you?

253
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,792
How could you say such a thing?

254
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,382
-Hello.
-Hello.

255
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,802
Hi, Seo-woo. Oh, I'll take that.

256
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,097
All right, let's take off your shoes.

257
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:45,017
Seo-woo, why don't you say hi
to the kitchen lady too?

258
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,561
-Hello.
-Hello.

259
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,563
Oh, hello to you too.

260
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:54,109
Did the young kitchen assistant
not come to work today?

261
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,361
She took half the day off today.

262
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,864
Is there something you need?

263
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:02,534
No, it's nothing. I'll be off then.
Seo-woo, I'll see you later.

264
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:06,205
Bye.

265
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,504
Dad.

266
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,589
KIM PAN-SEOK

267
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,216
Mom and I are here.

268
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,634
Have you been well?

269
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:23,722
Your other daughter has to work,
so she'll come later.

270
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:30,020
Why did you come here again?
You must have lots of stuff to do.

271
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,943
And why did you bring so much?
It must have been heavy.

272
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,527
My goodness.

273
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,947
Are you that happy?

274
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:44,993
Poor people show that they're poor,
whatever they do.

275
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,703
Hello, sir.

276
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,707
What? Did they really bring that
for the memorial?

277
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:54,002
That dry, cheap-looking fruit?

278
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,676
Even my dog wouldn't touch that.

279
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:04,846
Right. But it's the heart that counts.

280
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:07,140
My gosh.

281
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,728
Look. You being right next to me
is ruining my image.

282
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,274
Get rid of those pieces of paper in there.

283
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,150
Those ten-thousand-won bills.

284
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,568
It's so tacky.

285
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,157
Do they want you to earn lots of money
after your death

286
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,159
since you couldn't when you were alive?

287
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,496
What a nice family you have.

288
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,873
I guess they want me
to enjoy spending money now

289
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,500
since I was poor during my life.

290
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,297
You killed an innocent man,

291
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,632
but you're going to enjoy your afterlife?

292
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,427
No, of course not, sir. I'm sorry.

293
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,889
My goodness. That old man is at it again.

294
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,475
If they died at the same time,

295
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,644
their fates are more entwined
than those of spouses.

296
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,480
But he's always bullying him.

297
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,943
He still thinks he's his driver
even after they're dead.

298
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,487
Well, he died when that man was driving.

299
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:03,989
APPRECIATION PLAQUE

300
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,782
So I can understand how he feels.

301
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:10,037
BAEK SAM-DONG

302
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,913
-Okay, come again next time.
-All right.

303
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,416
-Be careful of water.
-Okay.

304
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,422
Darn it, you baby ghost.
You really can't see anything?

305
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,757
I can't.

306
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,718
Am I supposed to see the future
or something?

307
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:29,639
No. If you see them, you should see
a kind of color. Like an aura.

308
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,642
If it's purple,
it's depression or poverty.

309
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:36,146
If it's red, then it's always
the husband cheating on them.

310
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,565
You can tell right away.

311
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,736
Damn it. This baby ghost
just ruined my work today.

312
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,906
Damn it. Look at this. This is all I got.

313
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:48,075
Darn it.

314
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,328
Don't touch that!

315
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:53,830
You didn't even earn enough to eat that!

316
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,123
Spit that back out!

317
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,167
Excuse me?

318
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,669
Welcome.

319
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:04,674
-Look properly. Come on.
-I can't see anything.

320
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:08,845
The doctor?

321
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,808
Next time you come here,
make sure to wear that watch.

322
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,017
Yes!

323
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,519
You're right!

324
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,979
How did you know I wear a white gown?

325
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,856
I was sent to get treatment
for my depression,

326
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,274
and he was the doctor.

327
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,071
You wear a white gown,
and your specialty is the mind.

328
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,534
Psychiatry, like depression?

329
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:32,452
Yes, you're right.

330
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,873
You're right.

331
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,085
You're really good.

332
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,045
Ma'am.

333
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,548
My friend...

334
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,758
You must pay the fee first.

335
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,678
You must pay your respects
to the spirit here.

336
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,097
Who?

337
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,517
-Who's there?
-Doctor, it's me.

338
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,146
Only I can see him.
Don't try to see him, or he'll haunt you.

339
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:00,939
Haunt me?

340
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,740
That's right. Keep going.

341
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,000
All right, what do you want to know?

342
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:26,047
My dead friend came back to life.

343
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:28,967
-What?
-She died five years ago,

344
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,262
and her ashes were put
at the cinerarium here, but she's alive.

345
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:34,097
Is that possible?

346
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,642
Cha Yu-ri. He's talking about her.

347
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:56,077
That is possible.
That happens occasionally.

348
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:58,413
This is possible? Occasionally?

349
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,249
Coming back from the dead
happens occasionally?

350
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:06,087
Of course. Everyone has a friend
who came back to life.

351
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,839
-You said you have one.
-What?

352
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,217
-Yes.
-I have a friend like that.

353
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,262
-So everyone has that kind of friend.
-You're right. But you know what?

354
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,476
You shouldn't go to other shamans

355
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,895
and talk about something like this
with them.

356
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:22,812
Okay.

357
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,397
That's lame.

358
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,862
No. Stop it. Don't be lame.

359
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,370
That troublemaker, Yu-ri.
I'll die before my time because of her.

360
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,749
Is he really a doctor?
He's not sharp at all.

361
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,293
What was...

362
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,882
What was his name? Bong? Bin?
Where did he go this time?

363
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:06,189
What is all this?

364
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:11,820
I mean, no housekeeper can last a week.
They all quit.

365
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,656
-They are not patient at all.
-A week?

366
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,992
I would have quit after the first day.

367
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,913
This looks like it's been here for ages.
But this didn't go bad.

368
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,499
-I don't see any bugs here, either.
-Of course, not.

369
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:27,460
-Don't you know who we are?
-Come on.

370
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:37,762
You guys are unbelievable.

371
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,515
He'll clean this up
when there are bugs all over it.

372
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:44,019
No way. My son has atopic dermatitis.
Insects will ruin his skin.

373
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,939
But still. I'm glad that
I can still do something for my son.

374
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,318
I don't need 49 days like you.

375
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,403
Just one.

376
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:57,324
I just want to be human just for one day.

377
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,412
When my son was growing up,
there wasn't anything I could do for him.

378
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,290
It would make me so happy
if I could cook him a meal.

379
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,168
My son, Pil-seung,

380
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:11,338
has never had a home-cooked meal
that everyone had before.

381
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,674
He wouldn't know since he had never
had it once for more than 20 years.

382
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,137
To others, it's always there
like the air we breathe in.

383
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,516
Only my son couldn't have it.

384
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:37,238
THE YEAR 1999

385
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,075
Seriously.
Your teacher only complimented you.

386
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,577
Well done. My daughter is great.
I'm so proud of you.

387
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,247
-Oh, Dad.
-What?

388
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:49,709
Did you know my mom
is the prettiest mom at my school?

389
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,087
Of course, she is the prettiest one.

390
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:55,090
You know what she did?
She took out all of her outfits

391
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,385
and tried on multiple outfits
for the parent-teacher conference.

392
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:02,013
She changed her outfit thousands of times.

393
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,183
Pil-seung's school will be over soon.
Let's hurry.

394
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:08,645
My goodness.
Your mother is kind of cute today.

395
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,236
There's Pil-seung.

396
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,405
I told him to wait there.

397
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,116
Look at him standing there.
He's not even moving an inch.

398
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,075
He's a good boy.

399
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:27,122
Let's go.

400
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,404
Mom.

401
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,090
Go.

402
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,427
My baby.

403
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,475
Go.

404
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,961
Why are you looking at me like that?

405
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,340
I don't want your pity.
We're in the same boat.

406
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,552
Right. Every ghost has a sad story.

407
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:06,721
But you know what?

408
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,933
You can touch your daughter.

409
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,728
I'm envious of that.

410
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,028
Except for that,
I'm not envious of anything.

411
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,863
If I have to choose

412
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:28,701
between getting reincarnated for 49 days
as a human before going up

413
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,996
and watching my son for the rest
of his life, I'll choose the latter.

414
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,918
I'm going to watch my son
getting married and becoming a father.

415
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:39,128
I'll watch him for the rest of his life.

416
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:50,265
Stop chatting.
Aren't you going to clean his house?

417
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,449
Dr. Cho.

418
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,786
-Yes?
-You'll choke yourself.

419
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,288
What's wrong with you today?

420
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,126
He doesn't seem normal today either.

421
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,795
Hey, guys.

422
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,338
Everyone,

423
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,840
has anyone

424
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,886
that you know of
come back to life from the dead?

425
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,470
-What?
-What?

426
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,264
Like Jesus?

427
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,767
What are you doing, you crazy bastard?

428
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,853
No, I heard it occasionally happens.

429
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,771
Apparently, it happens occasionally.

430
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,231
Who said that?

431
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,609
Stop it, you crazy bastard.

432
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,446
A shaman.

433
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,698
A really spiritual shaman.

434
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:53,494
I went to another shaman because
my go-to shaman's energy got weak.

435
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,204
But that shaman

436
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,291
almost made me wet my pants.

437
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,752
She knows everything. Do you want to go?

438
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,004
-My father is a pastor.
-Right.

439
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,380
What about you guys?

440
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,798
-I'm leaving.
-Me too.

441
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,885
Bye.

442
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,887
Go ahead.

443
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:14,307
Gosh, they don't know anything. Goodness.

444
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,310
She's really spiritual.
Hey, do you want to go?

445
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,020
Yu-ri wants to be
Seo-woo's pick-up helper.

446
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,105
Okay. Really?

447
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,901
Really? Really...

448
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:27,904
The pick-up helper?

449
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:31,574
Hey, the pick-up helper has to
get Seo-woo from the kindergarten

450
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,077
and stay at your house
until you or Min-jeong gets home.

451
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,829
She wants to do that? Stay at the house
where you and Min-jeong live?

452
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:37,789
Yes.

453
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,040
Yu-ri...

454
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,416
She's...

455
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:43,002
Then, she should let you
tell the truth to Min-jeong.

456
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:46,297
But she's putting people around her
through a great deal of trouble.

457
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,008
-She can do everything, but this.
-You got that right.

458
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,805
I'm sure she misses Seo-woo.
I know she wants to see Seo-woo.

459
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,766
Then, she can watch Seo-woo
at the kindergarten.

460
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,893
Why would she? For what?

461
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,228
A local ghost?

462
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,729
There's a local ghost in that house?

463
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,022
Yes.

464
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:06,234
When I was a ghost,
I kicked him out a few times.

465
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,527
I think he's still there.

466
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:10,947
You want to be her pick-up helper?
To scare away the ghost?

467
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:13,658
I got rid of all the ghosts
at the kindergarten.

468
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:17,578
But I can't enter his house now.
This is my only way.

469
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,666
You're right.
She spends most of her time at home.

470
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,961
If there's a ghost at her house,
your effort will go to nothing.

471
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:28,506
You know what? Hold on.
I've been listening. And as a man,

472
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,801
I put myself in his shoes
and thought this through, you know.

473
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:35,263
My gosh, but what you're doing
to your husband is out of the line.

474
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,515
Listen. He's remarried.

475
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:41,060
All of a sudden, his ex-wife shows up
and is forcing herself into his home.

476
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,312
If I were him, I would have lost it.

477
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:47,400
I know that.
That's why I gave this a lot of thought.

478
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:50,862
What can I do?
I'm the only one who can protect Seo-woo.

479
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:52,030
Stop talking nonsense.

480
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,240
Forget it.
You're in no place to worry about others.

481
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,409
-Your daughter might become a shaman.
-I agree.

482
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,244
You're right. You have a point.

483
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,497
What?

484
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,083
Hello?

485
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:08,212
It was my day off. I read my flight
schedule wrong and went to work.

486
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,464
Yes.

487
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,134
Hold on. Let me call you back.

488
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,346
What's wrong with my house?

489
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,682
Why is it clean?

490
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,368
Damn it. Those darn ghosts.
I'm done helping you when I get out.

491
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:48,878
Uncle, we're here. I brought my mom here.

492
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,296
You've been well, right?

493
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:51,506
Yes.

494
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,134
Goodness. You're here to see me, Sis.

495
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,971
I know you're not well.
Why did you come all the way here?

496
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,139
Gosh.

497
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,433
Goodness.

498
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,310
Look at that boy.

499
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:08,815
You're not supposed to jump here.
All right.

500
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,566
It's all right. That's fine.

501
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,070
Gosh. Jin-gyeong, you grew a lot.

502
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,363
That's enough.

503
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,159
Did you rent out this cinerarium?

504
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:24,205
I'm sorry, sir. My older sister
came to see me again.

505
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,415
Only your family comes here to visit you.

506
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,585
You bought the cheapest slot here,
but you get the most visitors.

507
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:33,422
They should limit the number of visitors
depending on the slots you got.

508
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,800
Don't you agree? Isn't that right?

509
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:39,554
That's a load of rubbish.

510
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,555
What?

511
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:43,432
What did that old hag say?

512
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,768
What? "Old hag"?

513
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,985
Did you just call me an old hag,
you old geezer?

514
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,491
People with nothing to show for
are always bad-tempered, you know.

515
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,828
You're an old hag.
How else should I call you?

516
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,580
What? You--

517
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:07,081
Hey!

518
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:14,297
What did you just say to my friend?

519
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,549
Why are you butting in, you hag?

520
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,800
"Hag"?

521
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,311
Look here.

522
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:31,814
You're so young that chewing you
into pieces won't be any use.

523
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:35,193
What have you been eating
to give you such a big ego like this?

524
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,029
Should I carve out your eye
and flick it with my finger?

525
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,573
Or should I stretch your intestines
and jump rope with them?

526
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:44,452
You're still wet behind your ears
like a whining baby.

527
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,370
Hey.

528
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,123
If we counted the number of times
we used the bathroom,

529
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,167
my number is way higher than yours.

530
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,376
You stinking jerk.

531
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:59,133
Hey, do you know who you're talking to?
Do you?

532
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,801
You're a ghost.

533
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:04,096
Do you think you're still a chairman
of a conglomerate when you're dead?

534
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,308
Can you spend a dime of the money
you piled up?

535
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,268
We're all walking the same path.

536
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,730
What? I revived the economy of Korea.

537
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,233
The whole world acknowledged
my achievement.

538
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:19,904
But this guy only passed on
his debts to his kids.

539
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:22,240
What? We're all walking the same path?

540
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:26,077
Of course, not.
My life is nothing compared to yours.

541
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,370
Please calm down.

542
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:33,125
How dare you judge someone else's life?

543
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,794
I'll be blunt.

544
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:38,589
Who can guarantee that King Sejong lived
a more fruitful life than Mr. Kim here?

545
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,385
Who can judge that Mr. Kim left
behind less achievements than Mansour?

546
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,638
You must be your own judge of life.

547
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,348
Forget about the world or whatnot.

548
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,935
What's the point of getting acknowledged
by the world and the others?

549
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:53,354
Mr. Kim, square your shoulders.

550
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,609
Do you know how much money
I left behind in this world?

551
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,944
How many assets I have?

552
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,612
A trillion won?

553
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,490
That's right.
I have several trillion won.

554
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:08,327
Goodness. Is that so, Mr. Chairman?
I did not know that.

555
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,372
In that case, why don't you go back
to your spacious altar?

556
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,041
Why don't you hop into that?

557
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:17,211
What's the point of having so much money?

558
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,841
What? Wait. Where are you going?
We're in the middle of an argument.

559
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,968
Come back here! Come back!

560
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,178
-Sir, calm down.
-Come back!

561
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,639
-Sir, please calm down.
-Come back!

562
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,558
-Calm down.
-Come back here.

563
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:36,689
BURIAL PAYMENT OVERDUE NOTICE
FAMILY CANNOT BE REACHED

564
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,451
The receiver cannot be reached.

565
00:38:49,785 --> 00:38:52,246
Ma'am, were you able to reach her?

566
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,789
She's not answering her phone.

567
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,750
She just started working here.

568
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,210
I can't believe she skipped her shift
without notice.

569
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,756
Goodness.

570
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:10,014
BIG AUNT

571
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:24,278
Isn't it good?

572
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:27,323
My gosh, this is the real deal.

573
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,790
Seeing you enjoying this food

574
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,459
is breaking my heart.

575
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,669
What? What's wrong with you?

576
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:45,383
He may look like an independent grown-up,
but he must resent us a lot.

577
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,845
We left him in this big world
all by himself.

578
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,266
My poor baby.

579
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:08,823
That prick. I bet he can see us. He does.

580
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,617
You little brat.
Don't call your brother that!

581
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:16,163
Gosh, I'm so full. That was a great meal.

582
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,624
I can't breathe.

583
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:20,584
Son, clean up
if you're done with your meal.

584
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,253
Clean up first. Where are you going?

585
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:23,712
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

586
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,673
-Where are you going?
-No. Not there.

587
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,342
-Don't go in there. No.
-You can't go in there.

588
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,344
Hey, where are you going? You're naked.

589
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,889
What? Why did he take off his clothes?

590
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,768
Let's shower.

591
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,404
He's going to shower. Let's leave
when he goes into the bathroom.

592
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,634
Son, I know why you're looking
at the mirror. You take after me.

593
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:12,470
Why don't you go in?

594
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,639
-You're not making this easy on her.
-He's about to go in.

595
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,516
Here he goes.

596
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:19,894
Yu-ri, come out. Come on out.

597
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,854
Now! Come out now!

598
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,565
Now. Hurry and leave.

599
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,317
Go back in!

600
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,569
-Go back in. He said to go back in. Hurry.
-What? Why?

601
00:41:28,652 --> 00:41:30,529
-Hurry. Go back in.
-My gosh.

602
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,156
What's going on?

603
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,867
What? Why? What is it this time?

604
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,369
My gosh, you startled me.
You might scare a ghost to death!

605
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,746
This is dirty. Why is it here?

606
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,373
Why do you think it's there?
It's because you put it there.

607
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,792
My gosh, that's disgusting.

608
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,294
Okay. It's clean.

609
00:41:49,381 --> 00:41:51,842
What is it? Just go and wash up.

610
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:59,558
Mom! Dad!

611
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,228
-What is it? What?
-What?

612
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,232
Look at this. Look.

613
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,337
Son, this isn't right. Okay?
Put it down. No, don't do it.

614
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:29,505
This is bad.

615
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,841
Son, that can be dangerous. Put it down.

616
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:34,468
What are you doing?

617
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:38,472
What? What is it? What's going on?

618
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,483
-No, no.
-Please don't. Don't do it.

619
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:51,068
Grab the door! Do it!

620
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,611
-Damn it.
-Grab it!

621
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,154
-Grab it tight!
-Do it!

622
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,800
What are you doing here?

623
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,689
It's okay, Min-jeong.
You don't need to worry.

624
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,900
This is nothing. Don't worry about it.

625
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,335
Why is everything my fault?

626
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,962
You try taking care of the house
and watch the kid too.

627
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,297
I'm hanging up.

628
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:56,508
My husband says the same thing.

629
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,053
They should try taking care of the kids.

630
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,098
I get that he's disappointed.
But is that the best he could do?

631
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,601
Will they lose a tongue
if they say it's okay?

632
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,810
I know!

633
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,229
My gosh, I'm upset too.

634
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:10,981
Right?

635
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:12,441
Pardon?

636
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,319
Yes.

637
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,741
A paternity leave? Why?

638
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:21,950
Well, just because.

639
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,995
My wife has a lot on her plate.
I wanted to help out at home.

640
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:28,707
Wouldn't having a dad at home
better than a pick-up helper?

641
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,877
No one takes time off while being reviewed
for disciplinary action.

642
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,879
That just means they are resigning.

643
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,924
Resigning? Right.
There won't be any other way, right?

644
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,133
-Yes.
-Yes.

645
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,176
What?

646
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,221
Because you want to be the pick-up helper?

647
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,808
My gosh, you're so simple-minded.

648
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,893
You should all go home.

649
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:59,363
If you came here to do the house chores,
you should leave when you finished.

650
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:01,490
Why did you go in there, ma'am?

651
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:04,493
Don't call me ma'am.

652
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,870
Okay, lady.

653
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,291
What a small world.

654
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:14,461
How did you end up cleaning my house
out of all the houses?

655
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:17,005
And you keep getting a nosebleed.

656
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,341
It's all your fault!

657
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,803
I cooked a meal for you,
but you beat me up in return.

658
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:27,474
Right. She should have said
she was a housekeeper from the get-go.

659
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:29,935
Why did you make her hide?

660
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,938
Who would have thought
that he would believe that?

661
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,732
-We didn't.
-We didn't.

662
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,108
Right. We didn't.

663
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:38,861
I'm sorry, Yu-ri. It hurts, right?

664
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,279
I'm sorry.

665
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,534
What is it? What are you looking at?
Is something there? That, again?

666
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:47,619
Anyway, I'm leaving since I did my work.

667
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,955
-Hey.
-Where are you going?

668
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:53,500
You should clean up! You're disgusting.

669
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,878
-Excuse me.
-What? What do you want?

670
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,505
Well, you know...

671
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:01,925
Are you coming back?

672
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:07,723
I'll tell the guy to pay you handsomely.

673
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:09,850
I guess you like my food.

674
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,437
I didn't cook that.

675
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,606
Add honey.

676
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:16,857
-Honey?
-Yes. Honey.

677
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,735
One more drizzle.

678
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,322
Pil-seung loved my salad with honey.

679
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:25,032
More, more. More!

680
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,993
More finely. He doesn't like onions.

681
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,246
Be gentle. Mix thoroughly.

682
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:33,207
You need to be gentle with that.

683
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,626
Now! Flip it now!

684
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:36,794
Hurry!

685
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,173
Son.

686
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,010
What? Did you buy it then?
Is there a store that sells rice pancakes?

687
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,471
I looked everywhere, but there was none.

688
00:46:47,596 --> 00:46:49,598
Anyway, I have nothing to say to you.

689
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,935
I'm glad that you liked it.

690
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,605
Wait. Hey.

691
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,692
Well, it wasn't that good, anyway.

692
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,407
Goodness. Seriously.

693
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:12,329
Stop following me.

694
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:16,291
Or I'll tell your son that the food he ate
was cooked by his own mother.

695
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:17,376
Hey, no!

696
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,503
-He'd be really scared if he knows. Never!
-No.

697
00:47:19,586 --> 00:47:21,129
-We're leaving now.
-You're crazy.

698
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:22,339
-We'll go.
-We're leaving.

699
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,841
-We're leaving. Bye.
-Bye.

700
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,008
-Let's go.
-We're going.

701
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:27,344
My goodness. They are so irritating.

702
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:37,062
Seriously.

703
00:47:38,605 --> 00:47:41,817
You guys are crazy about your son.
Why do you only stay at his house?

704
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,236
I would follow him to work
and everywhere he goes.

705
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:48,031
My son is a pilot. He drives planes.

706
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,742
-So what?
-What if we follow him there

707
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,662
and end up going up for real?

708
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:56,582
It's dangerous to go
beyond the stratosphere. It's our rule.

709
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:59,668
He could have been anything he wanted,
but he became a pilot.

710
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,336
It's scary for ghosts, you know?

711
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,256
Exactly. Since he got good grades,
he should've been

712
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,966
-a doctor, a judge, or a lawyer.
-Right.

713
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,426
Can't he work on the ground?

714
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,636
Exactly. That's what I'm talking about.

715
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,430
-Gosh, they are such cowards.
-Exactly.

716
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:26,236
SINCE MY BELOVED FAMILY
ISN'T IN THIS WORLD,

717
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:29,156
I WILL FLY UP TO THEM

718
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,164
That's so funny.

719
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:07,152
Where were you? You won't pick...

720
00:49:07,235 --> 00:49:10,364
-What's with your nose? Did you get hurt?
-Oh, no.

721
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,492
I had to meet someone.

722
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,172
Coming.

723
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,806
What have you been doing to this hour
without eating anything?

724
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,307
Right.

725
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,268
Someone asked me for a favor,
so I helped them out.

726
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,770
Why did you get a bloody nose?

727
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:46,984
This? I must've been tired lately.
I'm fine.

728
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,611
If you were so tired that
you got a bloody nose, why did you...

729
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,703
Never mind. Eat up.

730
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:00,622
Why aren't you eating?

731
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:03,583
I'll eat. You can eat up.

732
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:07,754
She's a pick-up helper?

733
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:08,880
Yes.

734
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,675
Gang-hwa is completely out of it.

735
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,639
What's wrong with her?

736
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,350
You know, Hyeon-jeong,

737
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,812
I'm thrilled
that Yu-ri came back to life. I...

738
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,314
I'm all choked up with excitement.

739
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:30,902
But she should tell everything
and find a way around this.

740
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,947
Even if they pull their hair out
claiming to be Seo-woo's mom,

741
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:35,782
Min-jeong should know the facts too.

742
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:40,537
Yu-ri isn't looking to work things out
with Gang-hwa again,

743
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,665
nor is she trying to be Seo-woo's mom.

744
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,000
What?

745
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,419
Then why does she want to be
a pick-up helper?

746
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:53,759
-Gang-hwa.
-Yes?

747
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:59,222
You don't have to mind me so much.
Don't worry about me and go do your thing.

748
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:04,019
I've been awfully busy every single day.
So you don't have to do this.

749
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,314
For how long?

750
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:11,443
What?

751
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,112
For how long should I do nothing?

752
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:24,956
Don't you miss your mom and your daughter?

753
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,501
You miss your mother and Seo-woo.

754
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:30,545
Why do you always see them in secret? Why?

755
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:33,840
Let's tell everything to Mother
and to Min-jeong too.

756
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,968
Everyone will be shocked
if we tell them everything.

757
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,137
They'll be in huge shock. But Yu-ri,

758
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,976
I'm sure there's a way. Okay?

759
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:54,402
You heard that I wanted to work
as a pick-up helper, didn't you?

760
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,241
Yes.

761
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,871
I guess she wants to be by her child.

762
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,668
Can't you

763
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,753
just let her do it?

764
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:13,088
Hyeon-jeong.

765
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,757
If she becomes a pick-up helper,

766
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,343
Gang-hwa will die of stress.
Think about it.

767
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:21,012
He's living with his wife.
Yu-ri can't be there.

768
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,682
What kind of lunatic would say yes
to that? No way.

769
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,225
Can I do it?

770
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,394
Work as a pick-up helper?

771
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,732
I really have to do this.

772
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:44,411
I'm so sorry, Seo-woo.

773
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:46,788
Please stop crying.

774
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,874
Mommy is sorry.

775
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,503
Mommy is sorry.

776
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,067
Okay. Go ahead.

777
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:24,701
You can do it.

778
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:33,752
Hey, now that I think about it,
this is pretty awful.

779
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,755
Are you only concerned about your friend?
What about Yu-ri?

780
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,757
Did I do that? Why did I do that?

781
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,510
I mean, you know,

782
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:45,096
I'm a biological male,

783
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,141
so I can connect more easily
with Gang-hwa. That's all.

784
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:49,100
Yu-ri...

785
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:51,269
Of course, I feel bad about her.

786
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,190
Hey, it's Aunt. It's Aunt.

787
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,734
From Sang-dong?

788
00:53:58,693 --> 00:53:59,694
Aunt.

789
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,780
Why won't you pick up your phone?

790
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,990
Hey, I've been really busy

791
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,326
running around trying to catch
a virgin ghost.

792
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,911
What is it?

793
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,122
Ms. Mi-dong? No idea.

794
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,376
Not all shamans know one another.

795
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:16,086
-Why? Is she good?
-She's excellent.

796
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:18,588
She even guessed that
I was a neuropsychiatrist.

797
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:22,467
She is good. No one would think
you're a neuropsychiatrist.

798
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,802
A patient, maybe.

799
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,179
Anyway, where does she live?

800
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,098
Peace Temple?

801
00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:36,231
MS. MI-DONG

802
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,109
Anyway, I told you to stop seeing shamans.

803
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:41,319
You have the perfect energy
for ghosts to possess.

804
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,280
Tell them to come and possess me.

805
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:45,824
Hyeon-jeong is stronger than all of them.
Tell them to come!

806
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,993
If a female ghost comes,
she'll pull out her hair,

807
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,953
and if it's a male ghost,
she'll marry him off.

808
00:54:50,036 --> 00:54:51,913
-Hey, you.
-Look at her.

809
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,833
Why are ghosts sitting around
not taking her away?

810
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,042
Do you want to die?

811
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,379
I'm all out of energy,
so I've been freezing to death.

812
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,256
Don't tell your mom
and send me 100,000 won...

813
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,633
-Never mind, make it 200,000 won. Okay?
-Wait.

814
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,761
Aunt, send me your bank account later.

815
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,974
Ms. Mi-dong.

816
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,351
So this woman

817
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,770
is a better shaman than I am?

818
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:20,025
Here's an update on MI Corporation,
a company causing all kinds of scandals

819
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:24,529
ever since Chairman Baek Sam-dong's death.
Chairman Baek's children and his siblings

820
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:28,325
abused and slandered each other verbally
during their general meeting.

821
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:30,535
Once again,
the problem was the dividend of stocks

822
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:34,080
-which Chairman Baek had left.
-That mess of a family is at it again.

823
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:36,082
Who cares how much money
he left his family?

824
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,835
-His kids and siblings are at war.
-Another huge war broke out

825
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,379
-over sharing the dividend.
-He lived his life in vain.

826
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:44,382
Exactly. Even if I had all of his money,

827
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,302
I wouldn't want to die
after living a life like that.

828
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,472
What did you say, jerk?

829
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,766
You lowlife.

830
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,519
Goodness.

831
00:55:57,645 --> 00:55:59,064
-Let's go.
-There were incidents

832
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:02,817
such as his first son's power trip,
his second son's recruitment corruption,

833
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:06,279
and his youngest daughter's violence
against her employees.

834
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,782
His family received criticisms
from the entire nation

835
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,909
while undergoing
the prosecution investigation.

836
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,453
Tomorrow, his first son,
Vice-chairman Baek Jin-hyeon will

837
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,538
undergo a trial for his charges.

838
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:20,251
BURIAL PAYMENT OVERDUE NOTICE
FAMILY CANNOT BE REACHED

839
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,853
It's raining.

840
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:42,565
Yes, my house is nearby, so it's great.

841
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,026
Thanks for your concern.

842
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,529
I'll buy you a meal
after I get reinstated.

843
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:48,863
Okay.

844
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,203
What? It's raining?

845
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,124
I don't have an umbrella.

846
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:23,189
Oh, this is rain with fine dust,
so you shouldn't be exposed to it.

847
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,192
I see.

848
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,111
Let's walk together.

849
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:33,283
Right, I...

850
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:38,246
I was going this way,
and this umbrella is bigger than it looks.

851
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:42,417
Do you want to use it together?

852
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,882
Then will you share it with me?

853
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,679
Man, it just looks like a shower.

854
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,098
Should I buy an umbrella?

855
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,321
Min-jeong, you're on the phone.
You didn't take an umbrella.

856
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,614
Should I come and pick you up?

857
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:32,759
What is this? What...
What are you doing?

858
00:58:33,218 --> 00:58:34,594
How far are you going?

859
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,930
What? I'm headed to...

860
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,932
-Aren't you going to that apartment?
-Yes.

861
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,725
May I go with you to that point?

862
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,228
It's obviously a shower,
so it's a waste to get an umbrella.

863
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:44,812
Don't you think so?

864
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:51,569
Right, you don't want to waste your money.
So do you live there in my neighborhood?

865
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,155
No, I'll find someone else
once I get there.

866
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,783
I'll transfer and transfer
until I get home.

867
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:58,618
"Transfer."

868
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,205
Okay, then. Let's go.

869
00:59:02,288 --> 00:59:03,164
Let's go.

870
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,351
Do you always feel self-conscious
around others?

871
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,437
No way. I don't get self-conscious.

872
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,941
No way. You've always
looked self-conscious from the start.

873
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,901
I only do that to you...

874
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:39,075
Do other mothers at the kindergarten say

875
00:59:39,492 --> 00:59:41,828
how I'm so full of myself,
calling me Put-off?

876
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:43,580
You know that?

877
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:45,164
That I'm full of myself?

878
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:50,920
No, your nickname, Put-off.

879
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:56,217
Of course, I know.
I'm Put-off because I'm such a put-off.

880
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:58,177
How immature.

881
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,432
It's okay. I don't care about such things.

882
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:06,769
People are awfully mean.

883
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,187
Aren't they?

884
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,648
I thought you didn't care.

885
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:14,152
Yes, it doesn't get on my nerves.

886
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:18,865
You keep lying to yourself.

887
01:00:18,948 --> 01:00:21,784
Of course, it's concerning
when people insult you.

888
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:25,872
Everyone stands up for themselves.
We don't pretend like we're okay.

889
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,750
-Really?
-Of course.

890
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,669
Even deities get angry
when they're slandered.

891
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:34,672
Should we face them and end this together?

892
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,424
No, I don't want to.

893
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,969
You're way too nice.

894
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,807
You're the first one to say I'm nice.

895
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,394
You don't seem to have good discernment.

896
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:54,192
My gosh. This is the first time
I was attacked after giving a compliment.

897
01:00:56,402 --> 01:01:00,490
Anyway, my shoulder has been
getting wet for a while.

898
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:04,035
This side of my shoulder
is getting wet too.

899
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:08,456
You said it's bigger than it looks,
but it's tiny. Let me have a bit more...

900
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:09,749
This is mine.

901
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,043
Gosh, I take back that I said you're nice.

902
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,504
If you take it back,
I'll have a little more...

903
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:17,465
Can't you see that
my shoulder is soaking wet?

904
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,683
THE YEAR 2013

905
01:02:08,808 --> 01:02:09,976
Do you want to die?

906
01:02:12,645 --> 01:02:14,897
No one in this world would want to die.

907
01:02:16,441 --> 01:02:17,525
You're joking, right?

908
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:21,070
I told you time and time again
to make sure you pack it.

909
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,448
No, I...

910
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,952
You better not say you were
too busy watching that drama to hear me.

911
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:33,291
As you know very well,

912
01:02:33,374 --> 01:02:35,835
yesterday was the last episode
of "Reply 1994."

913
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,297
I needed to know
who Na-jeong's husband was.

914
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,594
I mean, it was the day before our camp.

915
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:47,180
We had a lot to prepare, right?

916
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,057
Why did they air
their last episode yesterday?

917
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,726
That drama was wrong.

918
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,603
-Right?
-Darn it.

919
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:57,398
Hey, you idiot.

920
01:02:57,815 --> 01:02:59,734
I can't believe what he's saying.

921
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,820
He'll probably die on the streets
without his wife.

922
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,697
Do you have any leftover hand warmers?

923
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:08,117
Does it look like I do?
He only brought things to show off.

924
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,828
He didn't bring any hand warmers.
It's so cold.

925
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,955
Stop taking pictures.

926
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,505
It's freezing.
How can we sleep without any hand warmers?

927
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,175
We have hand warmers.
I'm right here. A human hand warmer.

928
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:29,597
All right, come here.
It won't be cold if we stick together.

929
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,391
-Come here. Come right here.
-My gosh.

930
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,435
-Goodness. Here.
-Oh no.

931
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:38,940
Gosh, it's so warm. It's warm.
It's not cold at all.

932
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,399
I'm cold and hungry.

933
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:43,152
You're cold and hungry?
You're like a homeless woman.

934
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,323
Go to sleep, my little homeless

935
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,325
Go to sleep

936
01:04:11,347 --> 01:04:14,559
There is no flower in this world
that blooms without a meaning.

937
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:16,811
In that place where I bloomed and fell,

938
01:04:16,894 --> 01:04:19,480
other flowers of mine were starting
to bloom.

939
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:50,803
You told her to do it?
What are you going to do now?

940
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:52,638
-Should I work in Sri Lanka?
-Call her.

941
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,849
-She won't come.
-You're right. It's because I'm here.

942
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:56,350
Why not? Does she want a divorce?

943
01:04:56,434 --> 01:04:59,645
The dead child is too concerned
for her mother to leave this world.

944
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,732
She thinks her current mother
is her real mother. What if she finds out?

945
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,358
I miss her so much!

946
01:05:04,942 --> 01:05:06,819
Your life is not only yours

947
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,030
but also your parents'.

948
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:10,823
Yu-ri.

949
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,199
Even I feel this frustrated!

950
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:13,951
Seo-woo is sick because of me.

951
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:16,537
I just need her to be healthy.
