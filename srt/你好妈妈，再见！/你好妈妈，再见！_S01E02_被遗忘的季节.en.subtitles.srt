1
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,436
Not in a million years.

2
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,105
Why would I raise your child?

3
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,236
Gang-hwa has to work,

4
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,989
and his parents can't babysit
from the States.

5
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:15,116
Don't take his side.

6
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,287
Just live with what you've got.

7
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,998
There are daycares and babysitters.

8
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,293
Stop whining and raise your own kid.

9
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,390
What?

10
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,645
Will you leave the kid with us
and try to join my daughter again?

11
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,781
I can't live.

12
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,201
Not even a day, Mother.

13
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,583
I...

14
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,130
I can hardly breathe.

15
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,683
Keep yourself busy.

16
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:25,019
Work and look after the kid.
Keep repeating that.

17
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,772
Just live for a day like that.

18
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,066
When it's tomorrow,
live that day like that as well.

19
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,527
You'll live
if you keep living like that every day.

20
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,948
You'll survive.

21
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,377
She's right.

22
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,589
She's worried

23
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,342
that you'd try
to take your own life again.

24
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,555
You need Seo-woo.

25
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,308
You won't survive otherwise.

26
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,792
Okay.

27
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,008
All right.

28
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,969
It's all done.

29
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,262
We're all done.

30
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,722
We're done. Let's see.

31
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,559
Good girl.

32
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:54,335
Everyone passes through
a tunnel of darkness in life.

33
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,339
A long tunnel that makes you think

34
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,800
that you may never see light again.

35
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,121
-Are you happy?
-Yes!

36
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:13,956
-Do you want to dance?
-Okay.

37
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:15,583
Go ahead.

38
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,669
But as there are no tunnels without exits,

39
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:22,048
there is no eternal love

40
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,260
or eternal pain in the world.

41
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,521
EPISODE 2:
FORGOTTEN SEASON

42
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:17,765
What's wrong?

43
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:18,933
What?

44
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,644
What are you looking at?

45
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,521
Oh...

46
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,481
It's nothing.

47
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,796
What?

48
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,090
What's going on?

49
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,509
It's cold!

50
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,931
Why is this cold?

51
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,684
Why does it melt?

52
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,985
-What?
-What's wrong with her?

53
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,111
Is she crazy?

54
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:13,696
What's wrong with her?

55
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,039
Can you see?

56
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,541
Can you see me?

57
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,918
What are you staring at?

58
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,337
Do you want to die?

59
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,683
She can see me.

60
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,101
They can see me.

61
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,728
They can really see me.

62
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,359
Wait,

63
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,944
did I just become a human?

64
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,548
But why?

65
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:16,217
All of a sudden?

66
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,679
There has to be a reason.

67
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,650
By the way, why do I feel so tired?

68
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:39,031
Guys, can you see me? You see me, right?

69
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:42,118
Unbelievable. Excuse me. Do you see me?

70
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,369
Do you really?

71
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,622
This is unbelievable.

72
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:49,667
It's cold.

73
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,753
The snow is so cold.

74
00:11:57,425 --> 00:12:00,136
Hey, pretty lady.
Stop by our karaoke room.

75
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
If you do, I'll give you extra minutes.

76
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,764
I can hold it.

77
00:12:03,848 --> 00:12:05,349
I'm holding it!

78
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,103
This is a little--

79
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,980
-I can see myself!
-What?

80
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,066
What was that?

81
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,445
Oh, it's cold!

82
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,033
It's snowing a lot.

83
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,328
The wind is so refreshing.

84
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,401
I'm hungry.

85
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,531
I'm cold.

86
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,952
I haven't felt like this for so long.

87
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,121
I'm cold and hungry.

88
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,867
You'll catch a cold.

89
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,078
Ms. Mi-dong.

90
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,423
Get sassy? Me?

91
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,010
-With who?
-Who do you think?

92
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,348
What?

93
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,144
No. I never...

94
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,357
Why not? Why can't I do that?

95
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,067
Who do you think you are?

96
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,570
Who gave you the right to do that?

97
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,989
Wasn't killing me enough?

98
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,491
Why do you have to
make Seo-woo see ghosts?

99
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,951
Why?

100
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,247
If I knew this would happen,
I would've gone up there already!

101
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,374
You said I could stay!

102
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,126
You said I could!

103
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:40,212
Why not? Why can't I stay?

104
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,798
You call yourself a deity?

105
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,300
Does that mean you can do anything?

106
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,885
How can you be a deity?

107
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,262
You jerk!

108
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,015
What...

109
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,893
What on earth did you do
to make this happen?

110
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,436
You're nothing but a common ghost.

111
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,856
There has been a small problem.

112
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,484
Did I become human again because of that?

113
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:09,325
-What's wrong?
-The deities have such an unusual taste.

114
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,911
"You're the first woman
to ever stand up to me."

115
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,079
"This is new. Here's a reward."
Is this what happened?

116
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,749
"A reward"? In your dreams.

117
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,334
-Judgment.
-"Judgment"?

118
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,376
Yes.

119
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,212
Before a ghost reincarnates,
it gets judged

120
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,298
for 49 days up there.
You know that, right?

121
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,301
Yes. Depending on the judgment,
you either reincarnate

122
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,844
as a human or a dog or an insect.

123
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:32,681
That's right.
You're getting judged here instead.

124
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,682
Here?

125
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,184
How?

126
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,435
You have 49 days.

127
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:39,730
If you return to your place
within 49 days,

128
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,732
you can continue to stay alive.

129
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,110
I don't know what you'll be reborn as
if you don't.

130
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,530
What do you mean by "your place"?

131
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:49,782
The place

132
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,825
where you should have been
if you didn't die.

133
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,620
Your husband's wife. Your daughter's mom.

134
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,249
That's crazy.

135
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,002
How would I get that place back?

136
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,420
He married again.

137
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,255
I know.

138
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:09,593
I'm trying hard to figure out
what their intention is.

139
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,097
No, I won't do it.

140
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,682
I said I'd go up there.

141
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,642
We decided that I'd go up.

142
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,521
If you were going to go up,
why did you make a fuss like that?

143
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,483
It's no use crying over spilled milk.
You can't go up for 49 days.

144
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,194
What...

145
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,404
He can't just...

146
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,615
This isn't a reward.

147
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,867
I can't do this to them.

148
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,036
Goodness. I know.

149
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:53,345
JW LAW FIRM
DIVORCE ATTORNEY

150
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,520
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

151
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:05,733
OH MIN-JEONG

152
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,295
I told you not to jump
off the sofa, Seo-woo.

153
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,838
Come here.

154
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:29,840
All right.

155
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,493
Yu-ri!

156
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,787
Yu-ri.

157
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:04,958
Yu-ri!

158
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,935
I can't do this.

159
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,145
Mom has a weak heart.

160
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,403
But still...

161
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,575
That's funny.

162
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,870
What do you call a pig that does karate?

163
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,664
A pig doing karate?

164
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:46,125
What is it called? Piglet?

165
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,251
No way.

166
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:48,877
It's pork chop.

167
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:49,962
What?

168
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,464
Do kids these days find
things like that funny?

169
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,174
-Why not?
-Then

170
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:57,594
what do you call a cow without legs?

171
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,596
-A cow without legs?
-Yes.

172
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,099
-What is it?
-Ground beef.

173
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,978
Gosh. My goodness.

174
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,771
Don't say that to other people.

175
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:09,690
-My gosh.
-What's wrong?

176
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,108
-Why?
-What's the matter?

177
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:12,776
-What is it?
-Come here.

178
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:14,653
Gosh, what is wrong?

179
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,446
-Stop it.
-Why?

180
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,865
Is something there?

181
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,242
Why are you being like this? Popo?

182
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,411
-Popo.
-What is it?

183
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,663
What's wrong?

184
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,292
Please. Please, Popo. Go away.

185
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,753
-What's wrong, Popo?
-What's going on?

186
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,047
-What's the matter?
-Why?

187
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,466
It's okay. What's wrong?

188
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,552
-Why?
-I bet there's a cat. It's cold. Let's go.

189
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,554
-Let's go.
-Let's go, Popo.

190
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,598
Nothing's here. Let's go home.

191
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,266
-Let's go.
-Good.

192
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:45,684
Just go.

193
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,228
-There's nothing.
-Come over here.

194
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,105
-Let's go home.
-Come here.

195
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:53,317
-Let's go.
-Let's go eat.

196
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,444
Let's go in.

197
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:21,053
There's no place for you
in the real world now.

198
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,555
Those who are alive will move on anyway.

199
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,766
Only those who are stupid
live with regrets.

200
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,184
But those who are alive don't.

201
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,936
She's right about that.

202
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,021
You've already been forgotten by him.

203
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,357
Following him around
will only hurt your feelings.

204
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,318
That's because he can't see me.

205
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,694
And I can.

206
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,863
Nothing changes when he can see you.

207
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,490
Even if you get to live again,

208
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,992
he wouldn't welcome you with open arms.

209
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,911
He has a new girlfriend now.

210
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,371
Gosh.

211
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:55,337
Everyone can tell
that you are a new ghost here.

212
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,674
Why do you have so many regrets?

213
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,135
All ghosts have regrets.
Those without regrets are deities.

214
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:04,972
I guess you're right.

215
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:09,685
Fine. Granny is right about that.

216
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,769
Wait.

217
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,233
Why do you keep calling me Granny?

218
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,776
You will turn a hundred soon.

219
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,695
You will soon be the same age as my mom.

220
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,363
I'm already upset that I died old.

221
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,532
Don't act like a young lady.

222
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:28,787
It's already upsetting that I died young.
Can't you just let it go?

223
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,040
-That's nonsense.
-My gosh.

224
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,586
By the way, I haven't seen
Yu-ri since yesterday.

225
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,924
I'm sure that silly thing is doing

226
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,926
something silly somewhere.

227
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,977
MISAENG

228
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,148
I can't believe her.

229
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:59,401
I kept telling her she would get robbed
if she keeps the key there.

230
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,819
She never listens.

231
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,335
Look at this. You can't see them properly
because they all are overlapped.

232
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,962
I've always wanted to place them neatly.

233
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,565
You have 49 days.

234
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:41,985
If you return to your place
within 49 days,

235
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,945
you can continue to stay alive.

236
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,489
The place

237
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,033
where you should have been
if you didn't die.

238
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,254
This isn't a reward.

239
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,839
It's a punishment.

240
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,969
I miss you, Seo-woo.

241
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,116
It's missing.

242
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,868
Oh, dear.

243
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,789
I guess a rat sneaked in last night.

244
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,584
A rat? Did you just
call your husband a rat?

245
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,252
How dare you...

246
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:24,296
It's not me.

247
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,589
Do you think I'm a kid?

248
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,632
Why would I steal your money again?

249
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,552
-You're on your way to your office?
-Yes, I am.

250
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,928
Yes, honey.

251
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:33,805
A 10,000 won bill?

252
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,057
What can I do only with 10,000 won?

253
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,642
I can't even buy a chicken with it.

254
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,733
I'm sorry, Hyeon-jeong.
I'll make sure to pay you back.

255
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,447
It's so good.

256
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,994
Slow down, lady. You might choke on it.

257
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,247
Are you possessed
by a starved ghost or what?

258
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:02,000
Ma'am. A starved ghost

259
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,002
doesn't always possess other people.

260
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:05,503
What?

261
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,342
Hello.

262
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,470
How much is this coffee?

263
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,679
It's 1,000 won.

264
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,941
Have a nice day.

265
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,905
How much is this tteokbokki?

266
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,948
It's 3,000 won.

267
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,575
What about the spicy fish cake?

268
00:25:36,117 --> 00:25:38,411
-It's 1,000 won.
-What about the non-spicy one?

269
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,496
It's 500 won.

270
00:25:39,621 --> 00:25:42,290
I see. Bye.

271
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,055
Gosh, that was so close.

272
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,284
You keep on smoking at your age.

273
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,994
That's why you're not getting better.

274
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:22,038
-Doctor Cho?
-Yes?

275
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:23,540
The chart...

276
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,710
The chart says...

277
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,086
His age?

278
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,171
Smoking?

279
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,299
Well...

280
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:36,094
Is there a smoker in your family?

281
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,847
I guess there's a different person
with the same name.

282
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,645
No. Never mind.

283
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,579
Are you out of it?

284
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,790
Or do you have a carbohydrate addiction?

285
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,208
What?

286
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:10,712
Wait, what is this?

287
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,381
Gosh.

288
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,301
Why? You can eat it all.

289
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,053
Let's see if your stomach bursts or not.

290
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,054
Shut it.

291
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,430
The spoon.

292
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:23,975
-What? Oh, excuse me.
-Get to your sense.

293
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,521
What's wrong with him?

294
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,068
"Men's fashion."

295
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,070
"A good-looking guy."

296
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,615
"That's me."

297
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,744
You never let your phone
out of your hands.

298
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,537
Isn't it a social media addiction?

299
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,081
It's worse than an addiction.

300
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:47,916
He has a whopping 100,000 followers.

301
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:49,626
-Gosh.
-He's more famous than celebrities.

302
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,752
-A hundred thousand?
-Sure.

303
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,797
I can't even get a hundred followers
with all my acquaintances.

304
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,299
Does he post materials about neurosurgery?

305
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,302
What's wrong with you?

306
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,637
-Sweetheart.
-Yes?

307
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,555
Who would want to read it?

308
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,766
You're supposed to post things

309
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,477
that your followers would want to see.
It's not your journal.

310
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,686
What do you post?

311
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,939
-OOTD.
-"OOTD"? What is it?

312
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,400
"Outfit of the day."
What I'm wearing today.

313
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,735
Why would people want to see
what you're wearing today?

314
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,362
Because I make them want to see it.

315
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,447
Stuff like clothes or shoes
they want to buy.

316
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,367
I show all kinds
of limited special edition products.

317
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,202
With what? With my good figure.

318
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,454
That's how I got 100,000 followers.

319
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,873
It will just discourage people
from buying them.

320
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,583
You're elevating the nation's reputation.

321
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,460
If you studied with such passion,
you would've

322
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,129
gotten appointed professor already.

323
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,132
Just eat your meal.

324
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,431
Doctor Cho?

325
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,229
Doctor Cho, she's calling you.

326
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,106
-What?
-She's calling you.

327
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,190
Who?

328
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,483
Is something wrong?

329
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,444
You've been making mistakes
since this morning.

330
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,028
This morning? What mistake?

331
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,405
You don't have to know.

332
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,990
He lost his identification card.

333
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:04,451
And he told a young boy to quit smoking

334
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,453
because he's old.

335
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,540
To a little boy?

336
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,499
Are you insane?

337
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,501
I'm crazy. Are you happy now?

338
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,049
Listen.

339
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,220
I'm sure there are
people who look awfully alike,

340
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,847
who look like twins, right?

341
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,183
There can be people who look alike.

342
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,726
But they mostly don't look identical

343
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,394
unless they are real twins.

344
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,854
-She's right.
-Why?

345
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,982
It's very mean of you to say that.
They can look alike.

346
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,150
Why is it so hard?

347
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,694
You can't think that way.
They can look alike...

348
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,737
Isn't that right?

349
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,535
I'm sorry. Finish your meal.

350
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,414
-Hey.
-What's wrong with him?

351
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:52,957
-I don't know.
-What?

352
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,210
What if they look alike?

353
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:57,420
What are you going to do about it?

354
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,131
Why?

355
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,219
All right then.

356
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,432
Have you ever seen a doppelgänger?

357
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,100
What?

358
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,145
Seriously, is it a question, buddy?

359
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,314
You're right.

360
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,650
It's not even a question.

361
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,612
-What was that? What's wrong with him?
-What?

362
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,990
Can anyone of you tell me
what's going on? No one?

363
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,951
You crazy...

364
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:31,621
Even a psychiatrist can't cure a lunatic.

365
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,469
What are you doing?

366
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,971
Pull yourself together.

367
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,682
Gosh, this is crazy.

368
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,183
I'm sorry.

369
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,284
Oh, right.

370
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,714
Don't let other ghosts catch you.

371
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,426
If you see them, ignore them.

372
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:30,263
If they find out you've become a human,
things will get complicated. Understand?

373
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,364
Oh, dear.

374
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,164
Did you guys eat?

375
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:21,833
With me?

376
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:24,627
Isn't it funny?

377
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,671
You don't seem good.

378
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,048
Doctor Jang just came by
and gave a good scolding.

379
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,343
Gosh, Doctor Jang should've
done it to that jerk.

380
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,554
Why would he pester
innocent people like us?

381
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,348
What if Doctor Cho gets fired?

382
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,142
He's a cardiothoracic surgeon,

383
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:41,060
but he performs only out-patient services.

384
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,521
Isn't he feeling better now?

385
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,189
It's not what it looks like.

386
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,607
He's still heartbroken.

387
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,984
He's hurt.

388
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,319
Doctor Jang.

389
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,487
It's a lie.

390
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,990
-Lie.
-My gosh.

391
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,283
He's sick too.

392
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,161
They all are sick.

393
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,831
My gosh. Darn it.

394
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,209
-What are you doing?
-Damn.

395
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,294
Gosh.

396
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,670
Are you really sick?

397
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,216
Gosh.

398
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:13,593
Darn.

399
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:17,138
What is it?

400
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:18,931
-Damn it.
-What is this?

401
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,267
Hey, give me that.

402
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,227
Give it.

403
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:24,353
What is this?

404
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,484
What is it? Why did you take it out?

405
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,777
Just because.

406
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,445
Just because, why?

407
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,282
I just saw someone who looked
like Yu-ri on the street yesterday.

408
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,578
Is it what it was all about?

409
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,163
All that doppelgänger stuff?

410
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:44,415
Forget it.
Why can't I take it out just to see it?

411
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:47,126
Is it sealed or what?
This isn't the One Ring.

412
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,128
It's you who sealed it.

413
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,838
You've pretended it never happened.

414
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,132
-But why all of a sudden?
-She looked like her.

415
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,472
She looked the same
as if Yu-ri came back alive.

416
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,142
That's why. Okay?

417
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,811
Just get out.

418
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:08,189
Go and post your OODT or something.

419
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,566
You might lose your followers.

420
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,735
Post your photos,
messages, and everything.

421
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,449
-Darn it.
-My goodness.

422
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,592
It's for Doctor Cho,
a cardiothoracic surgeon.

423
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,302
Who shall I say it is from?

424
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,054
Well...

425
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,932
I just found it on the street.

426
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,433
I'm just a passerby.

427
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,229
He's making me nervous.

428
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,483
They might look alike.
But it's not like she's back alive.

429
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,076
What's going on?

430
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,537
Hang on.

431
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:09,333
Oh my!

432
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,378
Gosh, I'm startled.

433
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,047
I'm a little surprised.

434
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,425
I'm just surprised.

435
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,926
I should pull myself together.

436
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,012
I should go take a pill.

437
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,860
I should never get caught
by that blabbermouth.

438
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,784
Don't let other ghosts catch you.

439
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,957
Yu-ri.

440
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,836
What's going on?

441
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,548
I'm sure it's Yu-ri.

442
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,508
But she's not a ghost.

443
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,639
Gosh, it's hot today.

444
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:05,973
Who are you?

445
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,184
-Yu-ri.
-Yu-ri.

446
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:10,394
Do you not know me? You know me.

447
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,854
-Yu-ri.
-Yu-ri.

448
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,148
Yu-ri. Yu-ri?

449
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,525
-Yu-ri?
-Damn it!

450
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:17,610
Where is she going?

451
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,986
Mom, she can see us.

452
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,446
My gosh.

453
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:24,825
Hey!

454
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,579
Didn't the whole family die together?

455
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,122
Why aren't they going up?

456
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,416
Pil-seung's family?

457
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,502
They can't leave because of their son.

458
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,095
Come here.

459
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,390
My gosh.

460
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:50,476
Son?

461
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,979
Yes. They died in a car accident

462
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,897
with their nine year old son left alone.

463
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,191
They promised to go up
once he becomes an adult.

464
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,318
But they still think he's a kid.

465
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,870
Gosh, he's just a little boy.

466
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,373
It's a meeting.
I bet they're having a meeting.

467
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,417
In here?

468
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,252
If it's an important meeting,

469
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,337
-they can do it in a place like this.
-Sure.

470
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,880
Let me go in there.

471
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,560
He's doing all kinds of things.
He's not a kid.

472
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,812
-It's a meeting, right?
-It's a meeting.

473
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,648
And the family is quite exceptional.

474
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,484
Once they pounce on something,

475
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,862
they never let it go.

476
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:48,409
Is someone coming?

477
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,828
Hurry. She's over there.

478
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,705
Catch her!

479
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:55,041
Why did I run
into that family of all ghosts?

480
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,003
What's with her? How did she become human?

481
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,463
Why is she so fast?

482
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,090
But she can't be faster than a ghost.

483
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,593
She's fast. She really is.

484
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,722
There she is.

485
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,015
Catch her!

486
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,894
We can catch her. Hurry.

487
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,442
Run and catch her!

488
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,246
-Did you see her?
-No, I didn't.

489
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,957
-Did you see her?
-No.

490
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,001
-Why did you not see her?
-Let's just go.

491
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:43,422
Gosh, they are so persistent.

492
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,599
She brought it to the hospital.

493
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,268
It's so nice of her.

494
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,645
I'm so grateful.

495
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,522
But why is it backward?

496
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,759
IDIOT

497
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,143
It's not coming off.

498
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:39,228
PERMANENT PEN

499
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:41,313
My gosh.

500
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:50,156
What do I do?

501
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,503
About the patient in Room 201.

502
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,590
Didn't she come here
to get surgery from you?

503
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,342
I heard she chose this hospital
after doing a lot of research.

504
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:13,095
-Who?
-The patient in Room 201.

505
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,681
-Who brought this?
-I don't know that.

506
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,683
Doctor Cho, you should go.

507
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,226
We really need him.

508
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,188
He's not going to do it.
He only covers out-patients.

509
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:24,148
The patient might die if we wait.

510
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:25,065
What?

511
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,817
An emergency patient with cardiac rupture.

512
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,360
There's no doctor available now.

513
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,613
Call the operating rooms
to see who finishes earliest.

514
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,199
I already. The one that ends earliest
is five hours later.

515
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,492
Send him to another hospital.

516
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:35,618
He might die on the way.

517
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,620
We need you. Please help.

518
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,756
-No.
-Doctor Cho, he might die.

519
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,759
Otherwise, he might die.

520
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,927
I said no.

521
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,470
Send him over.

522
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,972
I can do this.
Why aren't you letting me do it?

523
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,891
I can save him, Doctor.

524
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,226
Doctor Cho.

525
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,240
He's never done it before.

526
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,699
Not even once.

527
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,868
What if something goes wrong?

528
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,995
-My point.
-What?

529
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,747
Who? What's going on?

530
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,957
What's so interesting?

531
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,625
About the cardiothoracic department.

532
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,710
Doctor Cho is performing a surgery soon.

533
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,962
You're lying.

534
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,923
It's true. He's doing it
for the first time in four years.

535
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:32,716
-Everyone's curious.
-Seriously?

536
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,886
The chest is open.
You can start immediately.

537
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,070
What are you doing?

538
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,781
What?

539
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,284
I'm coming in.

540
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:19,555
There's a lot of bleeding.
BP is under control.

541
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,557
Okay.

542
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:12,941
Yu-ri.

543
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,319
Yu-ri, wake up.

544
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,821
Yu-ri.

545
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,996
Yu-ri, wake up.

546
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,457
Yu-ri, please wake up.

547
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,708
Cha Yu-ri!

548
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,880
Yu-ri!

549
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:37,758
Yu-ri, wake up.

550
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,385
Wake up.

551
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,719
What are you doing?

552
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,513
Let's go home. Come on.

553
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,932
-Gang-hwa.
-Get off me.

554
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,684
Pull yourself together, you fool!

555
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,935
Gang-hwa. Hey.

556
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,020
Come on, pull yourself together.

557
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,734
Yu-ri, no.

558
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,779
Yu-ri, what do I do?

559
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,572
Yu-ri.

560
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,491
Yu-ri.

561
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,747
Yu-ri!

562
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:14,920
What do I do now?

563
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,696
What am I supposed to do?

564
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,074
We're just worried, that's all.

565
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,160
Please don't take it personally.

566
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:49,329
It's just that after hearing everything,
something doesn't feel right.

567
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,956
The thing with the freezer too.

568
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:52,291
Right.

569
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,377
Mi-so says she has caught Seo-woo
talking to herself

570
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,212
many times.

571
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,590
I know. One day, they were playing house.

572
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,675
Chi-in said he wanted to play
as the daddy,

573
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:03,218
and Seo-woo said,

574
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:05,095
"This kid is the daddy,"
pointing into the air.

575
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,555
Right.

576
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,098
You see?

577
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,892
We have kids too.

578
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,603
We couldn't just sit back.

579
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:18,275
On top of that, Seo-woo can't talk
as much as the other kids either.

580
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,987
You must be very concerned.

581
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,531
My niece is in therapy too.

582
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,617
I'll give you the number.
You should try it.

583
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,035
-You should.
-You should.

584
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:34,374
Are you all going to put your kids
in English kindergartens?

585
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,001
Yes, of course.

586
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:38,212
Why? Do you know a good one?

587
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:39,922
Now you're talking.

588
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,341
We should all exchange information

589
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,260
-and hang out--
-Do you all have so much time?

590
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,804
How come you're so interested
in someone else's child?

591
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,351
I know what's best for Seo-woo.

592
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:54,603
Will you just

593
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:57,272
mind your own business?

594
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,782
What did she just say?

595
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,700
She knows what's best for her kid?

596
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,120
Isn't she bothered
by her kid's behavior at all?

597
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,795
It seems like she knew what was going on.

598
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,798
Right? Do you know what I think?

599
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,135
I think she married Seo-woo's dad
for his money.

600
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:30,305
He's a successful doctor
at a big hospital.

601
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,474
Doesn't it make sense?

602
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,018
-You're right. That must be it.
-Right?

603
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,187
She sounded so cool though.

604
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,356
-Hey!
-Hey!

605
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:41,567
"Will you just mind your own business?"

606
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,151
What's with you?

607
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,528
Do I sound just like her?

608
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:45,612
-You don't!
-You don't!

609
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:46,989
Hello.

610
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:51,076
I'm sorry. I got caught up in something.

611
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,120
I'll be right there.

612
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,293
PICK-UP HELPER

613
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,838
It's Seo-woo's mom.

614
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,841
Please pick up Seo-woo today.

615
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,434
Let's start.

616
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:18,353
The one who gets here first wins.

617
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,440
-Who wants to go first?
-Okay.

618
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,567
Here we go.

619
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,360
-You can go first.
-Stop it!

620
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:27,404
-Look at this.
-Hey!

621
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,866
There she is.

622
00:48:31,491 --> 00:48:33,160
-It's so pretty.
-What's that?

623
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:35,037
Let's try again.

624
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,580
Watch out!

625
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,999
She's running again. She must be fine now.

626
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:46,131
Follow me.

627
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:03,982
It's that boy again.

628
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,984
Hey!

629
00:51:06,813 --> 00:51:07,814
Hi.

630
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,776
Hey, Seo-woo.

631
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,436
There you are, Seo-woo.

632
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:50,690
Who are you?

633
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,821
Are you the pick-up helper?

634
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,115
Seo-woo, your aunt is here.

635
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,910
Mom said you could go home
with Auntie today.

636
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:04,538
You can take her.

637
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:06,581
Sorry?

638
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,305
Do you call yourself a doctor?

639
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,184
How could you leave your patient
during a laparotomy?

640
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,902
Throw away your license.

641
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:37,612
Throw it away, you moron!

642
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,199
I've been too easy on you, haven't I?

643
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,910
Are you trying to screw me over?
Is that it?

644
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:47,205
If I hadn't finished early,
that patient would be dead now.

645
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,457
You almost killed a person today!

646
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,547
Doctor please, calm down.
I need to talk to you.

647
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:57,132
Don't tell me to calm down!

648
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,427
I'm sorry.
Please come with me for a second.

649
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:14,024
IDIOT

650
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,408
Claustrophobia?

651
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,160
But the thing is,

652
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,955
it's not an ordinary case.

653
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,083
He only reacts to certain places.

654
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,544
You mean operating rooms?

655
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:35,587
Yes.

656
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,299
A cardiothoracic surgeon
afraid of operating rooms?

657
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:42,677
That's right.

658
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,809
I can't believe you.

659
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:52,395
Why are you telling me this now?

660
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:55,941
For four damn years,
you've been blaming his hand tremors.

661
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,400
If you'd told me,

662
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,694
I would've had him treated or something.

663
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:00,737
Doctor Jang,

664
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:03,615
he refuses treatment.

665
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,824
What?

666
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,203
I've tried just about everything
to put him on medication,

667
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:11,331
but he's just too stubborn.
He doesn't want treatment, period.

668
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,624
So why not?

669
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,465
I have no idea.

670
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,516
He looks fine,
so everyone assumes he's over it.

671
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:33,979
But maybe he's not.

672
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:42,445
"I AM HAPPY" BY YOON HANG-GI

673
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,283
I am happy

674
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:49,577
I am really happy

675
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:55,583
PEACE

What is Yu-ri drawing?

681
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:56,019
Come on.

682
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,229
You're going to be a mom soon.

683
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,106
Don't you think this is too childish?

684
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:02,650
I'll tell Yeol-mu everything
when she's born.

685
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:04,819
I've been telling you since yesterday.

686
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,404
Fine, I'm sorry.

687
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,449
I'll definitely get strawberries tomorrow.

688
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,409
I'll get all the strawberries

689
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,578
at every supermarket in the neighborhood.

690
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:14,704
Forget it.

691
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,209
You should wipe out
all the strawberries in the world.

692
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,252
It's the end of strawberries!

693
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,922
Come on. What are you doing?

694
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:26,174
Yeol-mu wants strawberries.

695
00:56:26,257 --> 00:56:29,219
Really? Yeol-mu, just wait until tomorrow,

696
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:30,678
okay?

697
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,680
Oh, my.

Look how pretty you are,

00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:05,565
Seo-woo.

702
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,692
You're so pretty.

703
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,655
Seo-woo, you don't know who I am, do you?

704
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,656
I do.

705
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:16,618
You do?

706
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,038
Who am I?

707
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:21,206
I don't know.

708
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,125
That's okay.

709
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,169
That's okay.

710
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:43,811
Let's go home now.

711
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:52,487
What is it, Seo-woo? We have to go home.

712
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,292
You want to play over there?

713
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,849
Hi, Min-jeong. Can I call you back--

714
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,017
Honey.

715
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:25,603
What should we do?

716
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:26,980
What?

717
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,106
Is there something wrong?

718
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:29,315
What happened?

719
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:30,525
Seo-woo...

720
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,945
Seo-woo is missing.

721
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:35,947
What?

722
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,991
Seo-woo!

723
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:40,201

00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,038

00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,168
Seo-woo!

00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,255
Seo-woo!

728
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,303
Excuse me, have you seen
a little girl around here?

729
00:59:58,386 --> 00:59:59,596
-No, I haven't.
-No.

730
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,431
-You haven't?
-No.

731
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,435
Seo-woo!

732
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:11,983
Seo-woo!

733
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,737
Seo-woo!

734
01:00:21,576 --> 01:00:22,744
Seo-woo!

735
01:00:24,996 --> 01:00:26,122
Yu-ri?

736
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,375
Yes, he must have seen someone
who looks like her.

737
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,712
I thought he was over it now.

738
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,924
Even if he is,

739
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,761
he couldn't help but to be reminded
of her now and then.

740
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,974
Whenever I see someone who looks
even a bit like Yu-ri on the street,

741
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,976
my heart skips a beat.

742
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:51,481
He said he almost thought
Yu-ri came back alive.

743
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:53,316
What should we do with him?

744
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:55,610
He thought Yu-ri came back alive?

745
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:58,363
How great would that be?

746
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,907
What are you talking about?

747
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,868
If she comes back alive now, then what?

748
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:06,996
Hey.

749
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,998
I know it's impossible anyway,

750
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:11,167
but why do you talk like
that shouldn't happen?

751
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:13,252
Of course not. Think about it.

752
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,462
In this situation?

753
01:01:14,629 --> 01:01:16,047
It'd be a disaster for Min-jeong.

754
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:19,884
How can it be a disaster? It's a blessing
if a dead person came back to life.

755
01:01:35,149 --> 01:01:36,275
Is it fun?

756
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,615
Seo-woo, you're so good at this.

757
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,120
You're going so high up.

758
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:49,163
Do you want me to push you harder?

759
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:51,791
All right. Here we go,

760
01:01:52,166 --> 01:01:54,794
one last time. Hold on, okay?

761
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:02,301
Seo-woo!

762
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,305
Seo-woo. Oh, no.

763
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:08,599
Are you okay?

764
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:11,227
My goodness.

765
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,020
Does it hurt?

766
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:16,190
You're bleeding. Oh, no.

767
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:17,984
You're bleeding.

768
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,862
You're bleeding. Does it hurt a lot?

769
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,697
I'm sorry.

770
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:24,699
Mommy is sorry.

771
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,745
Mommy is so sorry.

772
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:36,878
I'm so sorry, Seo-woo.

773
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,357
Help.

774
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,027
Please save my baby.

775
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,737
Help.

776
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:04,197
I'm so sorry.

777
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,908
Please stop crying.

778
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:08,826
Mommy is sorry.

779
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,541
Seo-woo!

780
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,710
Seo-woo.

781
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,727
Don't you know
what Gang-hwa has been through?

782
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,813
It'd be unfair
if he has to go through it all again.

783
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:20,857
What's unfair is Yu-ri's death.

784
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:26,821
She never even got to hold

785
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,323
her own baby in her arms once.

786
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:32,660
If she can, she should come back to life
no matter what it takes.

787
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:20,935
I'm sorry.

788
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,188
I'm so sorry.

789
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,395
-Seo-woo, are you happy?
-Yes!

790
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,898
-Do you want to dance?
-Okay.

791
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:53,319
-Do you want to fly?
-Yes!

792
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,695
One, two, three.

793
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,448
One more time. One, two, three.

794
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,911
One, two, three.

795
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,456
One more time. One, two, three.

796
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:17,551
I was living silently

797
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,428
in someone's forgotten season.

798
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:21,931
But in this world,

799
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:24,433
nothing is forgotten forever.

800
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:35,111
This is not a dream.

801
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:36,654
How is this possible?

802
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:38,364
-Over here!
-A vacation as a reward.

803
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:40,282
For about 49 days.

804
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,576
What's wrong?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

805
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:43,994
Does this make sense? It does.

806
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,579
What do I do now?

807
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,457
Don't be surprised.
Yu-ri has come back to life.

808
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:50,084
You lunatic. Shut up.

809
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:51,752
You can be a human for 49 days?

810
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:53,546
Do us a favor.

811
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:57,466
Seo-woo, I'll make sure
you won't have to see things like those.

812
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:58,843
Seo-woo.

813
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:00,928
I'm almost at the kindergarten.

814
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,434
