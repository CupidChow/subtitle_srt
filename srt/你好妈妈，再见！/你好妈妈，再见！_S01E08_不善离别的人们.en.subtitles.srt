1
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,628
THE YEAR 2016

2
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,713
Yes?

3
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,175
Dr. Gye. This is from
the Human Resources Department.

4
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,636
-Human Resources Department?
-Did you apply for something?

5
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:55,263
No.

6
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,768
From the Human Resources Department...

00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,403
2016 DONGSUNG UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL
EMPLOYEE SUMMER CONDO RESULTS

8
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,614
SELECTED APPLICANTS
GYE GEUN-SANG, CHO GANG-HWA,

9
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:14,949
GO HYEON-JEONG, CHA YU-RI

10
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:37,347
A life enters deep into our lives,
then it suddenly leaves us

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,849
laughing at the times we spent together.

12
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,727
That's called parting.

13
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,195
WRITE A POST

14
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,531
MY FRIEND

15
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:09,671
MY FRIEND, THE REST PLACE OF MY MIND
MY CHA YU-RI, YU-RI, I MISS YOU

16
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,632
At this moment of parting,

17
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,803
someone will face the sorrow
that's pouring in,

18
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:19,764
as she faces in the reality.

19
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:07,145
Some may turn a blind eye to the grief

20
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,855
to protect themselves

21
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:13,568
and to survive
from this unbearable parting.

22
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,255
However, turning a blind eye,

23
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,842
the passing of time
or all the other things you are trying

24
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:42,180
cannot help you overcome this sadness.

25
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:12,460
EPISODE 8: PEOPLE WHO CAN'T SAY GOODBYE

26
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,007
Hey, boss.

27
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,426
Can I hold the umbrella?

28
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,887
No, you can't.

29
00:04:23,888 --> 00:04:26,349
You're getting a free ride.

30
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:29,811
You can't take the wheel. Don't you agree?

31
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,229
You're right.

32
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,772
Let's go.

33
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:38,111
If you take it back,
I'll have a bit more...

34
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,447
Can't you see that
my shoulder is soaking wet?

35
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,284
Gosh, my hair is wet too.

36
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,202
Goodness.

37
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,095
Gang-hwa.

38
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,681
Hey, nosebleed.

39
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,599
Fancy seeing you here.

40
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,273
I have to go.

41
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,275
Can I share your umbrella?

42
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,069
-Wait for me.
-You scared me!

43
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,446
-What are you doing?
-Let's share.

44
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,823
-Let me come with you.
-Gosh.

45
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,283
My goodness.

46
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,844
Hold up, ma'am. I mean, lady.

47
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,764
I got all the way there from here.

48
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,807
Now I'm back to square one.

49
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,893
So? Did I ask you to come with me?

50
00:05:51,976 --> 00:05:53,686
Take care of yourself from here.

51
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,189
Well, I...

52
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,566
What?

53
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,650
Nosebleed!

54
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,030
You should clean your place!

55
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,993
"You should clean your place!"

56
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:18,878
By the way, why were you with her?

57
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:22,548
Well...

58
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:27,220
You don't really like
to talk to the neighbors.

59
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,514
But you were laughing with her.

60
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,517
Was I laughing?

61
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,562
I see. Why was I laughing?

62
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,359
She's a little odd.

63
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,284
Seo-woo.

64
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,703
You can't be this rude.

65
00:06:53,287 --> 00:06:54,747
Be more careful with these.

66
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,873
Hey!

67
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,251
My goodness.

68
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:01,629
What are you doing?

69
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,381
Is Seo-woo

70
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,051
that precious to you?

71
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:13,099
Sure. She's adorable,

72
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,642
and she's sweet.

73
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,311
Oh, it's fine.

74
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:21,315
It sounded pretty bad,
but my forehead is really firm

75
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,984
so that blow didn't cause much pain.

76
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,821
You look worse than me.
You have two injuries.

77
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:28,531
It must really hurt.

78
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,829
She says I'm nice. Isn't that weird?

79
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:36,622
What?

80
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,420
Yes.

81
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,297
You're nice.

82
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,300
You don't mean that.

83
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,635
Why do you think that?

84
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,767
I guess she saw

85
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,811
that you're nice.

86
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,989
Then she'll have to be our pick-up helper.

87
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,956
-Okay.
-Are you out of your mind?

88
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,875
You told her to do it?

89
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,544
Do you know what a pick-up helper is?
What are you going to do now?

90
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,296
Should I work in Sri Lanka?

91
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,466
Asia won't do.
Go all the way to South Africa.

92
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,052
Do our hospital have postings
in South Africa?

93
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,220
Are you kidding?

94
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,554
Do I look like I'm kidding?

95
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,722
No.

96
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:41,229
Hey, you should've
told Yu-ri no straight up.

97
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,189
But she wants to do it.

98
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,983
How can I tell her no
when she wants to be with Seo-woo?

99
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,611
This is so frustrating.

100
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,823
Hyeon-jeong, call Yu-ri over.
We need to discuss what we're going to do.

101
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,078
She told us not to do anything,
but she is stirring things up.

102
00:08:57,161 --> 00:08:58,079
Call her.

103
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,499
-She won't come.
-Why not?

104
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,253
You're right. It's because I'm here.

105
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,296
-She's avoiding me.
-Why?

106
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,049
It wasn't in her plan to meet me.
She got caught by mistake.

107
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,343
-Why?
-Because he has Min-jeong.

108
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:16,931
Yu-ri must've thought she was
doing him wrong by showing up.

109
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:19,934
She didn't come to find me.
She bumped into me by mistake.

110
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,561
Right.

111
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,323
Yu-ri told Min-jeong

112
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:38,369
-that she was nice.
-Yu-ri said that?

113
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,454
How would she know?

114
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,832
It's not easy to know that
if you aren't close.

115
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,709
-Hey.
-What?

116
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,506
Have you ever told Yu-ri about Min-jeong?

117
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,091
Of course not!

118
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,136
She knew it all along.

119
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,347
She already knew that I remarried,
and that Min-jeong went to my college.

120
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,807
What?

121
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,019
I guess
she could've found those things out.

122
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,774
But I feel like Yu-ri has known Min-jeong
for a long time.

123
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,901
Is it just me?

124
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:15,990
She's definitely

125
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,534
hiding something.

126
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,789
I'm not here to ruin your life.

127
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,208
Do you remember anything?

128
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,421
Do you remember how you came back to life?

129
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:32,131
No, I don't.

130
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,345
But I think
there's something I need to do.

131
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,680
Something you need to do? What is it?

132
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,682
That is...

133
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,022
-I know.
-You do?

134
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,608
Of course I know.
It's even obvious to you.

135
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:54,070
But she asked me to wait.

136
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:59,867
I want to tell Min-jeong
and take Yu-ri to her mother or something.

137
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,951
But

138
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,205
that's just me.

139
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:06,874
For now,

140
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:10,378
I'm going to wait for her.

141
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,050
I'm with you.

142
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:23,516
It's Cha Yu-ri we're talking about.

143
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,770
Usually, she can never hold a secret.

144
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,316
There must be a reason
she's acting this way.

145
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,362
There must be a reason.

146
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:41,033
Gosh, why aren't they giving me an answer?

147
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,245
I know Yu-ri cursed them out,

148
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,580
but I can't believe
they revived her for that.

149
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,668
She wasn't the first ghost
to curse the deities out.

150
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,005
There must be something.

151
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:01,637
Hey, Gang-hwa.

152
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,642
Is everything okay with Min-jeong?

153
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,271
-Of course not.
-Why not? Does she want a divorce?

154
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,815
Where did that come from?

155
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,025
Did Geun-sang make you lose your mind?

156
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,944
Why are you being so dramatic?

157
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,654
-No?
-No.

158
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,616
Since Yu-ri came back,

159
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:26,620
I've been feeling bad, and it's hard
to look Min-jeong in the eye.

160
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,124
I see.

161
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,668
Anyway, Hyeon-jeong.

162
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:33,836
Yes?

163
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,087
Seo-woo

164
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,508
took a psychological assessment
because the daycare suggested it.

165
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:41,260
Well,

166
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:45,389
language, cognitive ability,
and development...

167
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,850
All of those came out

168
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,480
underdeveloped.

169
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,358
Hyeon-jeong, what should I do?

170
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,693
Well,

171
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:01,864
it's not unexpected.

172
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,074
Is she much slower than others?

173
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,952
What did Min-jeong say?

174
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,788
I told her not to be bothered by it.

175
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,583
-Because it might not be a big deal.
-What? Hey, Gang-hwa.

176
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:15,711
-You're unbelievable.
-What?

177
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,547
This isn't something
you should talk to me about.

178
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,424
How can you tell Min-jeong
don't be bothered?

179
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,301
Well,

180
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:27,097
I didn't want her to worry
thinking that it was her fault.

181
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:29,183
She has to deal with it though.

182
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:32,603
You can't take care of that for her.

183
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:33,938
Gosh.

184
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,901
Being too considerate doesn't help.

185
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:44,990
Okay.

186
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,537
Gosh.

187
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,129
Popo, have you been well?

188
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,966
You've missed me, right?

189
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,887
I can't go in there to play with you.

190
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,098
Do as I say.

191
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,808
All right. Down.

192
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,185
Sit. Down.

193
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,813
Good job. Well done.

194
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:17,606
Popo, you're so smart.

195
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,153
It's doing the tricks by itself again.

196
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:27,157
But it's acting like someone is there.

197
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,672
Being a human is so inconvenient.

198
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,695
CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, VITAMIN D+

199
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:10,367
Gosh, this is strange.
Can't you really think of anyone?

200
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,661
Anyone who owes you a thank you?

201
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,124
Nobody.
None of the neighbors said it was them.

202
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,376
-I can't think of anyone either.
-Then who?

203
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,545
Who keeps leaving these gifts?

204
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,549
How did they know you had bad liver?
Supplements for the liver.

205
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,135
Supplements for Mom's bad knees last time.
Now it's calcium?

206
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,763
Then, what are these?

207
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,473
These are what's crazy.

208
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,434
My friends don't even know
that I drink beer with gummies.

209
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,978
But how did they find out?

210
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:41,148
I've been in the living room all day,

211
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:44,109
and I didn't hear Popo bark.
Not even once.

212
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,861
But it always barks at people.

213
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,697
This is really strange.

214
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,616
Who could it be?

215
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:56,497
They never leave fruit or beverages.
It's always health supplements.

216
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,125
No, I don't need it.

217
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,003
-It's okay.
-You said your knees hurt.

218
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,339
You need to take calcium and magnesium.

219
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:09,218
Dad has a bad liver,
so he needs to take some milk thistle.

220
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,220
Everyone takes health supplements
these days.

221
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,847
It's okay. Don't waste your money.

222
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,933
Don't send them, okay? I won't take them.

223
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:16,976
You take them.

224
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,436
I'm still young.
You and Dad should take them.

225
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,188
I'll just send them over.

226
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,954
Did you finish that?
You finished that, didn't you?

227
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,248
-Right?
-That's crazy.

228
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,253
-Where are you going?
-I'm going out to get some fresh air.

229
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,297
Where's the key for the bicycle?

230
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,632
Will you ride the bike? It's cold out.

231
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,760
-You'll catch a cold.
-It's okay.

232
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,219
Where's the key?

233
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,351
I wonder
if they're taking the supplements.

234
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,316
I wish I could go check on them.
This is so frustrating.

235
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,113
Give me one.

236
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,491
Gosh, it's cold.

237
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,409
You might catch a cold.

238
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,745
Put on a scarf.

239
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,914
She's so adorable.

240
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,208
She's about Seo-woo's age.

241
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,543
Mom, you might catch a cold too.

242
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:09,379
I'm okay.

243
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:11,006
It's cold.

244
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,886
Get me more pine cones.

245
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,555
She likes playing outside.

246
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:21,642
Gosh, she got me this pine cone.

247
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,060
Do you like it?

248
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,814
My mom has a granddaughter too.

249
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,192
Oh, dear.

250
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,236
Give me some more.

251
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,761
I think she had too many sweets.

252
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,263
Let her have some today.

253
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:01,431
You should be careful.

254
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,351
She's so cute.

255
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,355
Here's one more.

256
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,692
There is a lot of it.

257
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,819
You're having fun.

258
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,668
A BEAUTIFUL START
JEONG GYEONG-HUN, KIM HYE-SU

259
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,630
KIM PAN-SEOK

260
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:32,648
Gosh, is your daughter getting married?
His girl is getting married.

261
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,150
What? Really?

262
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,110
-Congratulations.
-That's true.

263
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,072
She's finally getting married.
Congratulations.

264
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,908
Thank you. It's not like
I'm getting married though.

265
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,911
You didn't say anything,
but you've always worried.

266
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,373
Your two daughters are almost 40,
but they are still single.

267
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,376
Hey, a woman in her 40s
is just like a girl.

268
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,293
That's true.

269
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:56,296
Actually, he was single before he died.

270
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,173
He was way over 40 though.

271
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:02,469
Anyway, I guess you can go up there
with your mind at ease now.

272
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:06,223
You said you'd go up
once one of your daughters get married.

273
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:08,976
Ms. Mi-dong will be so excited
to hear that.

274
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,811
I know.

275
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:13,814
Right. Now I can leave feeling relieved.

276
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:17,567
What? Have you been staying here
to see your daughter's wedding?

277
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,570
Not really. I only had two daughters.

278
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,614
There was no man in the family.

279
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,450
I was worried that there were
only three women in my family.

280
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,244
You know it's a harsh world out there.

281
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:31,331
So that's how a father
with two daughters feels.

282
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,877
Now that I'm having a son-in-law,
I can leave without worries.

283
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,050
Why? Are you leaving, Hye-su?

284
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,636
Hey, let me come with you.

285
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,556
By the way,

286
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,143
why does the bride-to-be look so down?

287
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,645
Gosh, I guess you're right.

288
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,730
I know.

289
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,234
By the way, Granny is not here.

290
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,569
Isn't she here yet?

291
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,654
-Granny?
-Granny.

292
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,699
There will be a ritual today. Come on out.

293
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,827
What are you doing stuck in there?

294
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,495
Granny?

295
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,166
Gwi-sun.

296
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,127
Hey, Jeong Gwi-sun.

297
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,087
She's not in there, honey.

298
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,589
She left earlier.

299
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:23,800
Where did she go without telling me?

300
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,055
Honey, do you need some painkillers?

301
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,433
Gosh, no.

302
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:34,353
I'm okay.

303
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:50,118
How are you feeling? Is it painful?

304
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,706
She rarely got painkillers.

305
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,958
Right. She's being very patient.

306
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,835
I'm okay, Doctor.

307
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,629
It's tolerable.

308
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:05,133
Most people would shout out in pain
and ask for painkillers. You're amazing.

309
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,844
Of course. She's my daughter.

310
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,971
Well done.

311
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,139
I'm proud of you.

312
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,935
But you should tell us if it's painful.
You don't take it too much.

313
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,019
Okay.

314
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,815
Why would he say that
when she's being patient?

315
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,693
Gosh, my girl. Well done.

316
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:26,571
Sweetheart.

317
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,991
I like things like this. It's simple.
It's fancy, but not too fancy.

318
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:33,495
And there he is. He just looks scruffy.

319
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:36,540
-Did you not go to South Africa yet?
-Aren't you going back to your planet?

320
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:38,792
Aren't you working?
Why are you idling away here?

321
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,419
Are you going to South Africa?

322
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,963
He wants to be dispatched there
as soon as possible.

323
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,924
You want paternity leave and dispatch
while on disciplinary action?

324
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,259
It's not possible, right?

325
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,052
Of course not. Unless you are crazy.

326
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,095
Thanks.

327
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,807
You're so firm and straightforward.

328
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,435
You always say your piece.

329
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,979
My dad told me to see merits in people.

330
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:04,234
You guys should understand him.
He's not in his right mind now.

331
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,487
Anyway, did you fail
to get the limited edition watch?

332
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,115
I didn't know
there are things you can't get.

333
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,742
I even tried an overseas
direct purchase, but I couldn't find it.

334
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,202
But I already saw it.

335
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,913
It's not like I don't know about it.
So I have to buy it.

336
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,415
Then you should ask him.

337
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:19,791
Who was wearing it?

338
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:22,919
Gang Bin.

339
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,339
-Me?
-What? Gang Bin?

340
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,924
The baseball player?

341
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,468
Yes.

342
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,892
Your manic depression
and depression levels are low.

343
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,519
-But where did you buy that watch?
-What?

344
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:47,360
Oh, that one.
He does have an eye for watches.

345
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,238
You're classy.

346
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,492
By the way, Gang Bin didn't seem
like someone who'd kill himself.

347
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,703
-Why did he commit suicide?
-That's mysterious.

348
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,165
I should get back to work.

349
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,500
Have some coffee.

350
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,714
Gosh. Darn it.

351
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:12,219
Since you work at the kindergarten,
I don't need to see your resume.

352
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:14,554
Please take good care of her
from next week.

353
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,683
NAME

354
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,145
PICK-UP HELPER

355
00:25:41,498 --> 00:25:43,124
-Are you leaving?
-Don't get up. See you.

356
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,417
Seo-woo, see you later.

357
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,253
Bye.

358
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,475
Well...

359
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,228
What? Why?

360
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:08,024
You talked about the psychotherapy
for Seo-woo the other day.

361
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:08,984
Do you

362
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,320
want to go to the center with me?

363
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,323
You told me not to worry about it.

364
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,158
What? Well...

365
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,035
I did.

366
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,248
Never mind. Don't worry.
I'll see you later.

367
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,966
What was that?

368
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,510
Okay. I got it.

369
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,765
Once I get there,
I will kick out the ghost first.

370
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,644
What are you talking about?

371
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,104
If you keep cutting them like that,

372
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,732
we will end up dying
and becoming ghosts here.

373
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:52,611
I understand.

374
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,821
My gosh.

375
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,032
Gosh, my eyes sting.

376
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,124
What on earth did you understand?

377
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,292
Gosh.

378
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:10,462
That's not the right way.
You should cut them this way.

379
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,505
Gosh, this is frustrating.

380
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,592
Gosh.

381
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,846
-We have mandarins for snack today.
-Okay.

382
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,935
Ms. Kim, congratulations on your wedding.

383
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,063
Thank you.

384
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,778
The snack is ready.

385
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,489
-Yes.
-The mandarins look good.

386
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,875
-Come on out.
-Let's try this.

387
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,502
You are dead!

388
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:57,008
Now that the ghosts are gone,
she's playing with other kids.

389
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,635
Wait. Look at this.

390
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,720
Watch me.

391
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,098
Look at the color of this.

392
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,141
What's that thing?

393
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,976
Damn it.

394
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:16,236
That's strange. What's wrong?

395
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,781
What...

396
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:26,871
Gosh.

397
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,291
Hey! Don't you dare run away.

398
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,710
What?

399
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,753
What...

400
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:34,671
Sir.

401
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,173
How is this...

402
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,180
I had no idea.
I've been in and out of it often.

403
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,142
I'm sorry about that.

404
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,519
It's okay. You didn't know.

405
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,481
I also didn't know for five years
before it happened.

406
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:58,111
I will never show up
at the kindergarten now.

407
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,696
Okay.

408
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,241
By the way, I didn't know
Ms. Kim was your daughter.

409
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:05,410
She takes really good care of my daughter.

410
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,078
Really?

411
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:11,708
I didn't know the ties between ghosts
can be connected to living people.

412
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,626
I know.

413
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,796
Both ghosts and people
should live the right way.

414
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,215
It's such a small world.

415
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,135
Oh, right. Congratulations.

416
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,138
Ms. Kim is getting married.

417
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,097
Right.

418
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,809
Now you can go up there feeling at ease.

419
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,729
I guess so.

420
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,439
Thank you.

421
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,734
By the way,

422
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,861
about Hye-su.

423
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,198
Did something bad happen to her
at the kindergarten?

424
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:44,699
No. Why?

425
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:49,496
She's getting married soon,
so she's supposed to be happy.

426
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,916
But she seems depressed and cries a lot.

427
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,795
I wonder if she's sad

428
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,880
that I won't be at her wedding.

429
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:03,343
I didn't do anything good for her.

430
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:05,720
I feel bad.

431
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,890
Maybe I'm just being sensitive.

432
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,548
That's too bad.

433
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:28,177
The dead child is too concerned
for her mother to leave this world.

434
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,597
-What did you say?
-She cries every day

435
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,098
because of her mom.

436
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:35,018
So you have your door
thronged by evil spirits.

437
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,896
Once you perform a ritual,
it will get rid of them all.

438
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,814
Or you can use this talisman.

439
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,026
How dare you say such things?

440
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,154
What are you talking about? Who's crying?

441
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,156
You foolish lowlife.

442
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,616
How dare you come here

443
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,534
-and say things like that?
-What?

444
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,036
Do you even know her daughter?

445
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,539
What's this thing?

446
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,625
Gosh, this is my talisman.

447
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,209
It's not like I'm a fraud.

448
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,878
-Who are you?
-Me?

449
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:06,215
It says "www.midongs.co.kr".

450
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,550
"Midongs".

451
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,844
I'm Ms. Mi-dong.

452
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:12,889
-What?
-You just downloaded my talisman.

453
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:17,435
You should pay for this.
You can't download it illegally like that.

454
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,145
It looks so cheap-looking.

455
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,814
What do you think this is?

456
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,150
-Are you really Ms. Mi-dong?
-Yes.

457
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:26,319
Don't move an inch.

458
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,654
Damn it!

459
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,406
-That damn wench.
-Don't come.

460
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:33,284
Don't you dare come near here again.

461
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:37,914
Why are scumbags like that
wandering around here? Damn it.

462
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:43,252
She's not crying.
She's just roaming around everywhere.

463
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,050
Roaming around?

464
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,636
My daughter? In this world?

465
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:54,055
No, I didn't mean it. It's...

466
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,850
You're just like her. I bet you guys make
a lot of money performing exorcisms.

467
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:02,647
That's something I've never seen before.

468
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,318
Gosh, it's not like that.

469
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,654
Gosh.

470
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,826
Damn. This crazy mouth.

471
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,452
My gosh.

472
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,640
What's wrong?

473
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:43,021
Did something happen at the temple?

474
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,067
Nothing.

475
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:49,819
That's not true.

476
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,696
I'm sure something happened.

477
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,866
Some ridiculous people got on my nerves.

478
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,952
It's not like I'm a frog stoned to death.

479
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,374
No. It's nothing. Forget it.

480
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,213
-All right. Cheers.
-Cheers.

481
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,381
Cheers.

482
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:13,676
-Let's drink.
-Gosh, this is nice.

483
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,344
Excuse me.

484
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,849
I guess you are a drinker.

485
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,894
Actually, drinking is my kind of thing.

486
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,480
I can drink soju, beer, whiskey,
and even kaoliang liquor.

487
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,648
Good for you. You can drink a lot.

488
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,859
I don't think she gets along
with me though.

489
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:33,696
That's not true. We click really well.
Did you not know that?

490
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,698
I guess I'm the only one
who didn't know that.

491
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,951
She works in the kitchen, but she
roams around the kindergarten every day.

492
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:41,370
We're not supposed to leave the kitchen.

493
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,333
People shouldn't be so selfish
and care only about their work.

494
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,753
I should help the teachers
and the director.

495
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,922
I feel like the kindergarten
is my own home.

496
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,508
The problem is
you don't even do your job right.

497
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,677
Just mind your own business.

498
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,767
It's true that she helps us a lot.

499
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:04,852
-I see.
-I bet you love children.

500
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:09,398
I think she loves Seo-woo, not children.
She only plays with Seo-woo all the time.

501
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,570
It's just that I like cute kids.

502
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,865
She's so adorable.
She'll be so pretty when she grows up.

503
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,993
Should she become an actress?
I don't want her to be a celebrity though.

504
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:25,081
Gosh, you sound like her real mom.

505
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,542
She's silly.

506
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,460
Seo-woo is really adorable.

507
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,003
I know.

508
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,090
Gosh, Ms. Kim.

509
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,926
Your wedding is right
around the corner. Stop drinking.

510
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,803
It's okay. Give me that.

511
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,680
I want to drink today.

512
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:43,683
Ms. Kim.

513
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,185
I understand.
She's sad that she'll be married.

514
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:48,312
-Just drink it up.
-Let's drink.

515
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,022
Cheers.

516
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,670
Ms. Kim.

517
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,132
What's wrong?

518
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:22,930
Ms. Kim. Why are you crying
before your wedding?

519
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,058
Why would I get married?

520
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,062
Why should I get married?

521
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,657
Is it because

522
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,911
you miss your dad?

523
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,169
Your dad won't be at your wedding,

524
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,296
so you're feeling sad.

525
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,551
No.

526
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,180
That's not it.

527
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,666
Hye-su.

528
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,501
My daughter.

529
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,503
What's wrong?

530
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,672
What's the matter?

531
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,897
So I will walk down the aisle alone.

532
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:58,192
But that doesn't matter.

533
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,446
I'll feel sad for the moment,
but I can deal with it.

534
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,953
That's not the problem.

535
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:15,126
I just feel bad for my dad.

536
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,925
Why do you feel bad for your dad?

537
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,428
If I didn't get married late...

538
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,515
if I'd married at an earlier age,

539
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,477
my dad could've enjoyed the party.

540
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,240
He devoted his whole life
for his two daughters.

541
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,871
But he just left without having a party.

542
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,337
"You've raised your children so well.

543
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,297
Your devotion finally pays off."

544
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,924
He couldn't even hear things like that.

545
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,303
He didn't even have a chance
to brag about his children.

546
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:21,108
If I look happy tomorrow,
people will say this.

547
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:25,863
"I feel so bad for the bride's father.

548
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,159
He can't even attend
his daughter's wedding."

549
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,538
It's all my fault.

550
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,584
My poor dad.

551
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,927
I didn't do anything for my dad.

552
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,680
I didn't even do things
that all the other people do.

553
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:56,185
Ms. Kim.

554
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,787
Mr. Kim.

555
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,498
What are you doing here at this late hour?

556
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:03,335
You can't fall asleep at night
after receiving chemotherapy.

557
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,920
I know.

558
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,132
Patients need to sleep well.

559
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,717
Is it painful?

560
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,053
You've been patient.

561
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:15,681
It hurts.

562
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,018
A lot.

563
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:25,024
But I can tolerate it.

564
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,693
Why?

565
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,114
I don't know.

566
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,870
Whenever I feel pain,

567
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,458
I keep thinking of my mom.

568
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,510
You may bid farewell to the patient now.

569
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:00,809
Mom.

570
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,354
It's me, Yeong-ae.

571
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,065
Do you see me?

572
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:08,943
Mom.

573
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,653
Mom, please wake up.

574
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,405
Mom, please. Wake up.

575
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:19,245
Mom, please say something. Just one word.

576
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,996
Mom.

577
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:26,669
Mom, please wake up
and say something to me.

578
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,256
Mom.

579
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,842
It...

580
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,179
hurts.

581
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,364
Mom.

582
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,491
Mom...

583
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,868
I'm sorry, Mom.

584
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:04,790
My mom left in so much pain.

585
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,837
She died in a lot of pain because of me.

586
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,506
Yeong-ae...

587
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,927
I insisted.

588
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,765
I wanted to try everything
that could be done.

589
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,518
So I forced her to get treatment.

590
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,772
Because of me,

591
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,070
she had to leave in so much pain.

592
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:43,120
So whenever I feel pain,
I keep telling myself

593
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,583
that it would've been

594
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,795
a lot worse for my mom.

595
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,257
So I have to

596
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:58,969
put up with this.

597
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,015
That's how I feel.

598
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,936
That's how I endure it.

599
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,278
It's not your fault.

600
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,035
My gosh.

601
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,664
Goodness, you fool.

602
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,709
You fool.

603
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,468
There's no such thing

604
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,513
as a beautiful goodbye in this world.

605
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,767
It only hurts more and more.

606
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,144
You pretend you're over it,

607
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:53,065
but there's always something
broken inside.

608
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:57,111
But it's been a while
since her mother passed away.

609
00:44:57,861 --> 00:45:01,990
The older she gets, the more it'll hurt.

610
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:07,454
Goodbyes hurt more as you get older
and understand life better.

611
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,418
If you think about it,

612
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,254
how many people get to say goodbye

613
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,922
and leave a will

614
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,258
before they die?

615
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:22,970
Gosh, those who can do that
should know how lucky they are.

616
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,472
I bet their ancestors were good people.

617
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,849
You're right.

618
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:33,021
Anyway, Mr. Kim must feel so sad.

619
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:39,653
Too bad his daughter is going through this
before such a happy occasion.

620
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,072
People may say those things
to comfort her,

621
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,533
but I understand it can bother her.

622
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:47,786
It would hurt her to know
people feel sorry for her father.

623
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,830
I know.

624
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:55,878
Yu-ri.

625
00:45:56,962 --> 00:45:58,005
Mr. Kim.

626
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,882
Well...

627
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,594
Can you do me a favor?

628
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,533
We have some time
before your hair appointment.

629
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,993
Take your time.

630
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:29,411
Okay.

631
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,781
What is this?

632
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:09,451
Who left it here?

633
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,882
To my brightest jewel.

634
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,051
It's okay.

635
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,971
It's okay. It's no big deal.

636
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:30,764
There, there.

637
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,808
It's okay.

638
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:36,103
It's my favorite dress.

639
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,396
It's okay.

640
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:40,315
It's okay. It's no big deal.

641
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,194
UNIVERSITY REJECTION LETTER
NAME: KIM HYE-SU

642
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:45,821
I didn't get in.

643
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,823
It's okay.

644
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,494
It's okay. It's no big deal.

645
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,246
-Stop crying.
-I'm sorry, Dad.

646
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,373
My goodness.

647
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,792
It's okay.

648
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,086
I'm sorry, Dad.

649
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,629
It's okay.

650
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,093
I didn't know

651
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:11,513
my hardships would hurt you so deeply.

652
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,975
I'm sorry I was such a poor dad.

653
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,852
But, my girl,

654
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:19,980
I can tell you one thing for sure.

655
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,911
Even though I was poor
and powerless all my life,

656
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:36,663
I always worked hard.

657
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:40,208
So instead of feeling sorry for me,

658
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,669
please remember me as a strong person.

659
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:52,262
Also, don't think
you've done nothing for me.

660
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,223
I will always treasure

661
00:48:55,474 --> 00:48:57,726
the dental implants you got me.

662
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,903
KIM PAN-SEOK

663
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:49,319
-Why did you follow me here?
-We're not here for you.

664
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,864
It's Mr. Kim's daughter's wedding.
There's no way we'd miss it.

665
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,033
-Of course.
-Did you think we were here for you?

666
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,995
Gosh, you guys are such a bother.

667
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,746
What did you say?

668
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,833
Oh, nothing.

669
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,420
I was just talking to myself.

670
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,423
You scared me.

671
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:12,009
Now the bride will enter.

672
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,636
Let us welcome the bride!

673
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,487
Too bad she has to walk herself
down the aisle.

674
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,740
I wish her father was here.

675
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:35,991
I know.

676
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,200
Mr. Kim!

677
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:41,121
He looks so handsome in that lighting.

678
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:45,125
Yes, even his facial expressions
look good.

679
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,426
Our friend did a great job
raising his daughter,

680
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,011
working as a driver all his life.

681
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:58,472
-What a beautiful, young lady.
-I know.

682
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,850
She is thoughtful and kind-hearted too.

683
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,730
Great job, Pan-seok.

684
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,859
There is a reason

685
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:14,362
why you should live an honest life.

686
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,365
Your life is not only yours

687
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,327
but also your parents'.

688
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:43,183
WRONG PATTERN

689
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,269
That's strange.
I could've sworn this was the right one.

690
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,231
I'm home.

691
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,108
You came at the right time.

692
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:54,611
Can you try and unlock your dad's phone?

693
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,988
It keeps saying it's the wrong pattern.

694
00:51:57,072 --> 00:51:59,658
He changed it the other day.
I did it for him.

695
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,992
But why?

696
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,996
I took a photo of Popo's diagnosis
with his phone.

697
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,374
The new vet wants it.

698
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,917
Here. I'm taking a shower.

699
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,344
What is all this?

700
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:32,440
Gosh, why can't I keep my mouth shut?
Why did I say something so unnecessary?

701
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:34,734
Of course, she got angry

702
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,529
after hearing her daughter's spirit
is wandering around.

703
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,532
Darn it.
It's all that fake shaman's fault.

704
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,952
Yu-ri will make a fuss if she finds out.

705
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,913
Wait, where's my phone?

706
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:56,173
TROUBLEMAKER

707
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:09,352
MS. MI-DONG

708
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:12,230
-Hello.
-Hey, where are you?

709
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,108
Me? I'm walking on the street. Why?

710
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,610
Come over for a second.

711
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,737
I have something to tell you. I--

712
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:22,616
I can't. I'm hungry,
and I'm on my way to dinner.

713
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:25,076
You come over to me. Bye.

714
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,119
Hey.

715
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,954
Hey, wait!

716
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,457
Gosh, I can't believe her.

717
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,167
Darn it.

718
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:40,800
MESSAGE
TROUBLEMAKER

719
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:45,138
Gosh, is she serious?

720
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,849
Whatever, who cares?

721
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,267
Forget it.

722
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:53,855
SUPERNATURAL POWERS

723
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,238
"Supernatural powers," not "super weird"?

724
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,781
Be quiet, you silly.

725
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,034
-Are you a friend of Yu-ri's?
-Oh, yes.

726
00:54:06,201 --> 00:54:09,329
No way. She's just a shaman I know.

727
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:11,122
How could we be friends?

728
00:54:11,206 --> 00:54:12,582
She's as old as my mom.

729
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,960
That's not true.
I'm at least ten years younger than her.

730
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,836
Come on,
she looks a lot younger than you do.

731
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,631
I've been too easy on you lately,
haven't I?

732
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:24,386
-Do I look easy to you?
-See? She's one mean shaman.

733
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:25,387
"Mean"?

734
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:26,805
By the way,

735
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:30,809
how long have you known her?

736
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,979
You don't believe in superstitions.

737
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,652
Well, after coming back to life,

738
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:43,989
I started thinking there may be
something in shamanism after all.

739
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,283
So I went to her to ask about

740
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:49,744
why I came back to life.
That’s how we became close.

741
00:54:49,828 --> 00:54:51,413
-Right?
-Absolutely.

742
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:54,082
Also, it's not superstition.
It's humanism.

743
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:56,876
So why did she come back to life? And how?

744
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,962
Well, the thing is...

745
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,008
Don't.

746
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,386
What happened is...

747
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,515
It happens sometimes.

748
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:13,018
I'm still looking into it.

749
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:16,313
I'm figuring out
why she came back to life.

750
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:21,276
Hyeon-jeong, I'm craving
stir-fried pork and mung bean sprouts.

751
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:22,444
Oh, sure.

752
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,780
But I'm out of mung bean sprouts.
Just a second.

753
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,452
No mung bean sprouts?

754
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:36,958
Well, go ahead and eat. Please.
I'm going to the supermarket.

755
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,376
You're the best.

756
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,462
You're the best ever.

757
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:54,142
I bet she was so frustrated

758
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,019
that she went to see a shaman.

759
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,812
What? My mom?

760
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,024
Are you crazy?
Why did you say that to her?

761
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,150
I mean...

762
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,152
I'm sorry.

763
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:07,572
I was just trying to drive away
that fake shaman.

764
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:10,241
It was a slip of the tongue.

765
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,870
I can never keep my mouth shut.

766
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,997
I can't believe you.

767
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:24,714
Explain this to me.

768
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:27,092
What do you mean?

769
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,020
You volunteered at Seo-woo's kindergarten?
And you even took pictures?

770
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:42,649
Yes.

771
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,778
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from Seo-woo?

772
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,655
Why won't you listen to me?

773
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,491
I was just volunteering.
What's so wrong with that?

774
00:56:51,908 --> 00:56:53,576
Can't I even go and peep at her?

775
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,329
How many times do I have to tell you
we can't show up in front of her?

776
00:56:56,913 --> 00:57:00,166
She thinks her current mother
is her real mother. What if she finds out?

777
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,585
I know all that.

778
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,922
But I can't help it.

779
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,883
I think of her whenever I see a toy.

780
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,553
There's nothing I can do about it!

781
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,097
I miss her so much!

782
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,644
Do you think you're the only one?

783
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,233
I miss her too. I really do.

784
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:32,240
Do you think this is easy for me?

785
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:35,660
I miss my daughter

786
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,954
and granddaughter like crazy too.

787
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,082
I miss them so much

788
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:44,502
that it tears my heart out!

789
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:22,207
She may pretend to be okay,
but she really isn't.

790
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,083
She's just holding it back.

791
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,753
-I know that.
-Then why did you say that to her?

792
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:28,379
I'm sorry.

793
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,340
My gosh.

794
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,759
But listen.

795
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:36,095
If you know how much
your mom is suffering,

796
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:38,056
shouldn't you do something?

797
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,599
What are you trying to say?

798
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,477
You should take your place back
as fast as you can.

799
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,103
Then you can live.

800
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:48,858
-Your mom doesn't have to suffer anymore.
-That's enough. We're done with this.

801
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,443
I'm not going to do that.

802
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,404
I'm going up once Seo-woo becomes okay.

803
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:57,325
I can't seem to find the answer
no matter how much I pray,

804
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:58,826
but if you think about it,

805
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,829
it may not be so important
why the deities brought you back to life.

806
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:05,542
Just take your place back within 49 days,

807
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:08,086
and you won't lose your life again.

808
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:12,173
No matter what the deities think,
take this chance and take your life back.

809
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:13,591
I said, stop.

810
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:15,760
I don't want to.

811
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:29,190
What is this all about?

812
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,651
Hyeon-jeong.

813
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:34,737
What was she talking about?

814
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,742
You have to take your place back
within 49 days?

815
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:42,954
Otherwise,

816
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:44,998
you will...

817
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:48,960
lose your life again?

818
00:59:58,845 --> 00:59:59,887
Hello.

819
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,514
Gang-hwa, where are you?

820
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,600
Hyeon-jeong? I'm home.

821
01:00:06,811 --> 01:00:09,814
Hyeon-jeong, please don't do this.
I beg you.

822
01:00:10,815 --> 01:00:11,733
Is this it?

823
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,110
Is this what you've been hiding?

824
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,238
That you'll die again in 49 days?

825
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,037
Why would you die again? Why?

826
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,164
You can live.

827
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,666
You just have to take your place back.

828
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:30,460
So why?

829
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,086
There is...

830
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,840
no place for me anymore.

831
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:36,966
There is.

832
01:00:38,259 --> 01:00:39,886
You can take it back.

833
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:42,472
Is Min-jeong what you're worried about?

834
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,642
You have to live.

835
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:48,478
Don't you want to live until

836
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:50,855
Seo-woo calls you mom?

837
01:00:51,856 --> 01:00:53,274
You're her mom.

838
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,570
It's not important

839
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:00,198
that I'm her mom.

840
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:02,992
Then what's important?

841
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,829
Hyeon-jeong...

842
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:09,999
Seo-woo is sick because of me.

843
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,126
Because of me.

844
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:16,005
I just need her to be healthy.

845
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,050
What about you?

846
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:26,349
What's going to happen to you?
Don't you think it's unfair?

847
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,771
You died at such a young age

848
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:33,981
without getting to hold
your own baby once.

849
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,359
Even I feel it's so unfair!

850
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:40,863
No. I can't let you go like this. Never.

851
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,533
Gang-hwa loves her!

852
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,041
Oh Min-jeong.

853
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,964
Gang-hwa loves her,

854
01:01:58,798 --> 01:01:59,882
doesn't he?

855
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,264
You know that.

856
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:09,267
What would be more important than that?

857
01:02:14,439 --> 01:02:15,690
Hyeon-jeong.

858
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,775
All I want

859
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,529
is that Gang-hwa doesn't cry.

860
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,615
That's all I want.

861
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:36,210
Gang-hwa, get in our car.
You can't drive right now.

862
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:39,464
-I'll pick up your car--
-Don't worry about me.

863
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:40,548
I'll be fine.

864
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,508
Just get in our car.

865
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,011
All right. Drive safely.

866
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,305
We'll come over later.

867
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:26,511
I am happy

868
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:30,097
I am happy

869
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,726
I am happy

870
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,480
I am really happy

871
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:41,359
The day I've been waiting for has come

872
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:44,028
It's such a joyful day

873
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,741
Throw your shoulders back

874
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,202
And stick out your chest

875
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:54,163
Wear casual clothes

876
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:56,165
And meet your warm friends

877
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:58,835
With a joyful heart

878
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,546
Run around the fields and mountains

879
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,548
And sing

880
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:06,050
Let's all sing together

881
01:04:09,178 --> 01:04:12,849
I am happy

882
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:16,561
I am happy

883
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:20,231
I am happy

884
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,484
I am really happy

885
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,750
Yu-ri.

886
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:23,836
Okay.

887
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,882
Yu-ri, I understand.

888
01:05:27,965 --> 01:05:29,425
Hyeon-jeong.

889
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:49,648
Mr. Cha.

890
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:53,444
Why don't you go inside
and get some sleep?

891
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,196
I'm fine.

892
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:57,907
Go get some rest.

893
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,756
-You can go home. You must be tired.
-I'm okay.

894
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:25,976
I'll be right back.

895
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,630
Bring my baby back!

896
01:08:56,173 --> 01:08:58,509
My baby.

897
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,055
My baby.

898
01:09:04,890 --> 01:09:07,810
Bring her back!

899
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:10,146
Bring her back!

900
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,820
My baby.

901
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:22,199
My baby.

902
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,077
Bring her back!

903
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,221
We could never possibly find

904
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:47,933
a way to deal with goodbyes.

905
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:26,430
What should we do? Mom has a weak heart.

906
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:28,974
-Yu-ri?
-Yu-ri?

907
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,935
Are we dreaming?

908
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,228
Is she gone?

909
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:35,231
You know our pick-up helper, right?

910
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,816
I'll make sure you stop seeing
things like that.

911
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,568
-You bastard.
-Me?

912
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,821
Your kid looks just like you.

913
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,323
It belongs to Yu-ri.

914
01:10:45,032 --> 01:10:46,325
It's where Yu-ri should be.

915
01:10:46,408 --> 01:10:48,994
I think we can let her go now.

916
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:50,704
Mom.
