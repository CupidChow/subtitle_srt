1
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:54,971
CHA YU-RI

2
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,324
Do you think you own this place?

3
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:16,159
Stop crying!

4
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,828
Gosh, I can't sleep.

5
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,457
Stop crying and introduce yourself
if you're new here.

6
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,502
She looks scared and startled.

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:31,341
You can't make sense of this,
and you're terrified, right?

8
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,805
Not only that,
she thinks this is terribly unfair.

9
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,973
She's so young.

10
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,060
She probably never expected
to be a ghost before she hit 40.

11
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,063
Gosh, I know how that feels.

12
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,816
You feel wronged and frightened.

13
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,693
You can't stop crying because you're sad.
Right?

14
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,947
My husband does nothing but cry.

15
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,639
What am I going to do?

16
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,980
What am I going to do
about my poor mother?

17
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:37,282
I thought death was just about
leaving this life

18
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:41,661
after making the most of the time
God has given me.

19
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,671
PARK HYE-JIN

20
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,881
Hye-jin.

21
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:57,844
Hye-jin.

22
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,650
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:14,986
My daughter...

24
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,781
My poor daughter.

25
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,659
JEONG GWI-SUN

26
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,917
You should be in the hospital.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,086
You're sick.
You should stay in the hospital.

28
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,672
My baby.

29
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,918
But I realized this after my death.

30
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,048
My life was not entirely mine.

31
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:25,974
EPISODE 6: EVEN IN THE FACE OF DEATH,
FAMILY IS STILL MY NUMBER ONE

32
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,923
That's just ridiculous.

33
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,216
I know.

34
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,469
You should do it then.

35
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,346
A marriage of convenience.
Is it decided then?

36
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,639
Seriously?

37
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,392
-Is it necessary?
-I guess you really hate that.

38
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,978
-A marriage of convenience?
-That's so funny.

39
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:26,367
Welcome.

40
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,495
What brings you here, Min-jeong?

41
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,040
Well...

42
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,431
Soju, no. Give me a glass of beer, please.

43
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,391
Okay.

44
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,920
Beer has too many calories.

45
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,423
Okay.

46
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,054
-Let's go.
-Seo-woo, did you have fun today?

47
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,264
-Yes.
-That was fun.

48
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:21,774
This way.

49
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,317
Let's eat it later.

50
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,569
Let's go home.

51
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,167
Is Seo-woo that odd?

52
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:44,172
I was wondering
if she's that different from Ha-jun.

53
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,855
It's okay. I don't think she knows.

54
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,946
She'd never imagine
that I've come back to life.

55
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,035
Hyeon-jeong, I'll get going.

56
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,214
-Don't give her more than two bottles.
-They look too much alike,

57
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,758
from head to toes.

58
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,429
How can they look exactly the same?

59
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,267
Well...

60
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,603
Min-jeong, what are you--

61
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,562
Look.

62
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,732
They're different sizes,

63
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,861
but they look exactly the same.

64
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,989
They aren't even twins though.

65
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,866
Oh, the shrimps.

66
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,576
You mean the shrimps.

67
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,869
Right.

68
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,455
They probably look the same to us.

69
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,458
But they probably all look different
if we look carefully.

70
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,171
Right, the shrimps.

71
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,006
Is Seo-woo

72
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,134
that precious to you?

73
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:21,936
Sure. She's adorable.

74
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,437
and she's sweet.

75
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,607
Then...

76
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,611
you can be Seo-woo's mom.

77
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,664
She's drunk, right?

78
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,875
Yes. She drank more than she could handle.

79
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,903
What...

80
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,115
happened?

81
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,638
You don't have to give her strawberries.
It's all right.

82
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,474
-But these are very delicious.
-It's okay.

83
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:45,227
Ms. Cha, Seo-woo can't have strawberries.
She's allergic

84
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,271
-She can't have it.
-Allergic?

85
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,942
Goodness, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

86
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,168
Did you beat me?

87
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,252
No.

88
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:13,631
What? What happened to your face?

89
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:16,384
Don't you know?

90
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,301
Me?

91
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:18,969
No, I don't.

92
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:20,930
I slept here last night.

93
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,685
What did you do? What happened?

94
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,396
I don't remember.

95
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,730
What?

96
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,109
Are you okay? Doesn't that hurt?

97
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,447
What's this stench?

98
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,032
Did you drink?

99
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,245
I'm so upset.

100
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,748
Look at your face.

101
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,627
What happened last night?

102
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,796
You don't need to know.

103
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,382
It's just a nosebleed. It's no big deal.

104
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,134
How is this not a big deal?

105
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,261
My Hyeon-jeong got a nosebleed!

106
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:01,595
Oh, you.

107
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,556
That means the other person
might not be alive!

108
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,767
Now I'll have to work my butt off
to pay the settlement money.

109
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:09,311
Old habits never die.
You and your fistfights.

110
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,396
Hey.

111
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,815
I got hit.

112
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,359
Exactly. You got hit.
That never usually happens.

113
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,069
Did you let her go after you got hit?

114
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,696
Right.

115
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,866
I shouldn't have let her live.

116
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,076
Ha-jun, close your eyes.

117
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,161
Okay.

118
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,124
Ha-jun, open your eyes.

119
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,834
Fistfights?

120
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,794
I can't quit because of you!

121
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:37,298
That must hurt
and this must be excruciating!

122
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,302
Ha-jun, you can open your eyes now.

123
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,970
Let's go to daycare.

124
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,055
Daddy is fine. He won't cry.

125
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:45,973
Let's go.

126
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,147
It hurts.

127
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,738
Gosh.

128
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,824
Goodness.

129
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,971
You wretched bastard.

130
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,476
What are you looking at, sir?

131
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,230
-Hey!
-You're such a jerk!

132
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:38,192
-How dare you?
-You son of a...

133
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,860
You took our offerings too!

134
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,280
You can't give
unfair preferential treatments!

135
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,074
What did Yu-ri say to become human?

136
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,659
Jerk. Bastard.

137
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:49,453
She called him
all the names in this world.

138
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,121
-You can't do this to us!
-What a bastard!

139
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,920
-You're a mean punk!
-Wretched man!

140
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,632
-You son of a...
-You should die!

141
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,467
-Don't be like that!
-What a jerk!

142
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,678
-Just die!
-You're the worst!

143
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,805
-Wretched punk!
-You're worthless!

144
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:21,944
They'll be punished by Heaven
if they provoke him like that.

145
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,913
-Son of a...
-What?

146
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,456
-Goodness!
-No!

147
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,190
Goodness.

148
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,495
I don't think cursing at him
will make them human.

149
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,132
Mi-ja.

150
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,884
Yes, sir.

151
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,352
Were you looking for me?

152
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,150
If Ms. Mi-dong gets here, stall her.

153
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,536
Gosh.

154
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,872
What?

155
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,000
Are you going to fight me?

156
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:04,380
What's this?

157
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:20,270
Do you hear the ghosts sing?
The song of angry ghosts?

158
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:27,277
It is the music of the ghosts
Who will not be slaves again!

159
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:32,992
When the beating of your heart
Echoes like the beating of the drums

160
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,411
Tomorrow will open

161
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:42,376
And I will become human

162
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:53,637
Do you hear the ghosts sing?
The song of angry ghosts?

163
00:16:53,721 --> 00:17:00,144
It is the music of the ghosts
Who will not be slaves again!

164
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:06,191
When the beating of your heart
Echoes like the beating of the drums

165
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,402
Tomorrow will open

166
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:15,451
And I will become human

167
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:26,545
What do you think you guys are doing?

168
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,255
It's a fight.

169
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:29,423
-Fight!
-Fight!

170
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,509
-What?
-Article 1, Clause 1 of the Constitution.

171
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:37,431
The ghost world is a democratic republic.
Sovereignty resides with the ghosts.

172
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,640
With ghosts!

173
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:41,852
And all ghosts are created equal.

174
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,022
But you fancy only Yu-ri.

175
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:46,482
Only Yu-ri!

176
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,942
He means favor, not fancy.

177
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:50,235
-What?
-Favor.

178
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,278
Fancy means...

179
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,404
Forget it.

180
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,490
No, that doesn't matter.

181
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,993
It makes no sense
that only Yu-ri became a human!

182
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,704
We can't take this anymore.

183
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,415
So we are going to protest.

184
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,459
-It's a protest.
-It's a protest.

185
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,169
A protest, my foot.

186
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,546
You guys lost your mind
and cursed the deities out.

187
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:13,217
I bet you can't wait to go up there.

188
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,761
-Where are my bells? Where are they?
-My gosh.

189
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,429
Where did they go?

190
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,264
Don't get cold feet.

191
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,850
She can't send us up there.

192
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,852
-What?
-Really?

193
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,480
-I knew it.
-Come on.

194
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,526
-Go ahead.
-Damn it.

195
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,402
You...

196
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,200
How much did I drink?

197
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,618
I even blacked out.

198
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,748
Is Seo-woo

199
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,502
that precious to you?

200
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,964
Sure. She's adorable.

201
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,882
and she's sweet.

202
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,592
Then...

203
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,513
you can be Seo-woo's mom.

204
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:02,182
I'm sure I said something.

205
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,229
What on earth did I say?

206
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,028
Hello, Seo-woo.

207
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,365
Are you feeling okay?

208
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,825
Well... Yes.

209
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,370
By the way, your nose...

210
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:26,748
I fell off the bed this morning.

211
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:28,834
I see.

212
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,352
Well... Let's go.

213
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,063
We should get going.

214
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,316
Go.

215
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,367
I guess you're going somewhere.

216
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,702
Yes.

217
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:18,008
What happened to the three of them?
Did they have a fight or what?

218
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,093
No, they are on the same side.

219
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,178
-What?
-What?

220
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,972
They all have the same Band-Aid.

221
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,641
That's sharp.

222
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,644
I think there's something going on.

223
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,771
-Hello, Seo-woo.
-Hello.

224
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:32,564
Take off your shoes.

225
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,899
Well done.

226
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,275
Let's go.

227
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,528
Can you take off your shoes yourself?

228
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,988
-Hello.
-Hello.

229
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,073
Hello.

230
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:43,116
Bye, Ha-jun. Say bye to your mom.

231
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,534
-Bye.
-See you later.

232
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:45,827
-Bye.
-Bye.

233
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,995
See you.

234
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,205
Let's go.

235
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,141
You're so heavy.

236
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,906
Hyeon-jeong.

237
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,534
We're going for coffee.

238
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:28,453
Let's talk about the kindergarten

239
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,456
and the kids with problems together.

240
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:38,171
I have a lot of problems. I have no time
to talk about kids with problems.

241
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,673
Oh, right.

242
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:44,219
If you have some time, why don't you talk
about your own problems?

243
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,473
Let's go, Min-jeong.

244
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:55,397
Okay.

245
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,860
-I can't take this anymore.
-Let it go.

246
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,903
Let go of me. I'm going home.

247
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:02,946
Really?

248
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,782
They are so peculiar.

249
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,910
What kind of problems
would five-year-old kids have?

250
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:11,371
It's the adults
who created the problems, right?

251
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:14,624
I agree. The adults create problems.

252
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,420
Kids who have problems, who are strange,

253
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,005
and who start talking late.

254
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,550
That's not what I meant.

255
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:25,552
They are no big deal,

256
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:27,971
but adults think they are problems.

257
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,724
I see.

258
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:37,230
By the way,
did I make any mistakes last night?

259
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,652
The last thing I remember is
being in your restaurant.

260
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,239
No. You just enjoyed your food and left.

261
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,075
-Oh, well...
-Why?

262
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,535
Nothing. No reason.

263
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,116
I knew it. We didn't get anywhere.

264
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,744
I can't believe this. Has Ms. Mi-dong
always been this cruel?

265
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:36,706
Look what you've done.
This is all your fault.

266
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,750
We didn't know
Ms. Mi-dong would do this to us.

267
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:41,002
You all agreed to do this.
Why are blame us?

268
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,005
Gosh, it feels so stuffy in here.

269
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:47,717
I should go to see my grandson today.
What do I do?

270
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,179
He's having a talent show.

What's that?

280

What's the name?

281
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:23,670
Picasso. It looks like Picasso's painting.

282
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,048
Look at the color combination.

283
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,759

go to the school reunion lately?

He only gets jealous.

363
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,397
I'll take care of your kid.

364
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,316
-Really?
-Sure.

365
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,403
What? You should've done that
when we raised our children.

366
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,490
I was busy working to support my family.

367
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,784
And my grandchild isn't like my children.

368
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,452
Anyway,

369
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,914
I will take care of everything
as a grandpa, okay?

370
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:52,415
-Father.
-What?

371
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,292
-Can I record that?
-Sure.

372
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:57,629
I'll take care of everything
as a grandpa, okay?

373
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,261
Why would I raise your child?

374
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,274
She's right.

375
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,277
She's worried

376
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,031
that you'd try
to take your own life again.

377
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,993
You need Seo-woo.

378
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,247
You won't survive otherwise.

379
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,849
Well done.

380
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:55,228
All right. Let's play with this now.

381
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:57,897
Come here.

382
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,907
Slow down.

383
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,578
-Let's do it again.
-Seo-woo is adorable, isn't she?

384
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,081
She's just like my daughter as a kid.

385
00:31:16,541 --> 00:31:18,751
Okay. Let's put this on here.

386
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,336
Pull it down.

387
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,171
Like this. All right.

388
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:26,926
Did you have to dress up like this
on a day like this?

389
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,553
You told me to wear a suit.

390
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:31,639
I told you to wear a suit.
I didn't tell you to dress up like this.

391
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,392
The disciplinary committee
can't make favorable arrangements

392
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,436
if you don't look pitiful and pathetic.

393
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:39,814
If things work that way,
what's the good of having a prison?

394
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,192
You've always looked so shabby.
You should've worn the same thing.

395
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,360
Dr. Cho.

396
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,613
Dr. Jang has been looking
for you today.

397
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,655
Really?

398
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,742
I guess I will see him someday.

399
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,668
HOSPITAL DIRECTOR PARK HYEON-SU

400
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,463
He will see a psychiatrist
and get treatment.

401
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,965
About 90%
of a thoracic surgeon's work is surgery.

402
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,635
Why do we need a doctor
who can't perform surgeries here?

403
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:10,345
Please wait a little more.

404
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:14,223
Dr. Cho was the best
thoracic surgeon in our hospital.

405
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,517
He will get his second wind soon
once he gets treatment.

406
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,561
I don't care anymore.

407
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,065
We will abide by the decision
of the disciplinary committee.

408
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,401
-Director Park.
-It's not that I don't understand

409
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:27,236
why you are being like this.

410
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:29,948
I know

411
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,951
it could be traumatic for him.

412
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,373
However, it's unacceptable
that a doctor can't perform surgeries.

413
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,671
I would've felt the same if I were him.

414
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,140
So why did Yu-ri get a job
at the kindergarten?

415
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,643
I saw Yu-ri and Min-jeong there yesterday.

416
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:01,312
Hyeon-jeong and I
almost got a heart attack.

417
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,190
She just came back to life,
why does she want to work there?

418
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,733
What's up with her?

419
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:10,113
Are you sure you're a psychiatrist?
Quit it, you fool.

420
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,197
What did you say?

421
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,575
Hello, Dr. Jang.

422
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:39,684
DR. JANG IS SO ANNOYING

423
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,687
You wait outside.

424
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,771
Yes, sir.

425
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:45,982
Please move over.

426
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,483
I need to get out.

427
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,528
Thank you.

428
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,408
I was going to do it right from now on.

429
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:59,787
It was just a joke.

430
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,793
Well...

431
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:09,172
I mean...
I've been out of my mind recently.

432
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,925
You can't imagine
what's going on with me now.

433
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,385
Choose one or the other.

434
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,765
About five years ago.

435
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,434
Raise a question about it
to get me fired.

436
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,853
Or keep acting ridiculous
to get yourself fired.

437
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,397
You have to do one of the two
to feel better.

438
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,318
Gosh, why would you bring that up again?

439
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,531
Why!

440
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,119
Why did you do this to me?

441
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,166
What should I do now?

442
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,545
What am I supposed to do?

443
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,536
I'll get treatment.

444
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:22,995
I can do this.

445
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,125
Come in and treat him.

446
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,460
-Yes, sir.
-I'm not talking to you.

447
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,753
Okay.

448
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,798
Excuse me.

449
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,843
There's no way you can get treated by him.

450
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:40,054
Behave yourself at the disciplinary
committee unless you want to get fired.

451
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:44,976
And what's with your hair?

452
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:49,230
You have to look pathetic and pitiful.
Why are you doing this?

453
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,278
-I told you.
-What?

454
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,698
-Good.
-Shut up.

455
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,581
This is crazy.

456
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:09,375
Definitely crazy.

457
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,526
Who threw away money
on the street like this?

458
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,827
It's 50,000 won.

459
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,248
They all are money.

460
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,543
They are 50,000 won bills.

461
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,591
This is amazing.

462
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,138
They all are money.

463
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:05,932
Money!

464
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,608
Min-jeong.

465
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:17,735
Hey, you're here.

466
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,741
Can you help me return to work?

467
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,701
-Return to work?
-Yes.

468
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,079
Not at this hospital.
I want to go somewhere else.

469
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:30,456
Well, I can look into it.

470
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:33,501
But isn't your kid too young?
Is it going to be okay?

471
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,838
Yes. It will be fine.

472
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,131
Your husband works here.

473
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,008
It'd be easier to work here, but why?

474
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,053
I see.

475
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,181
Because he's being disciplined?

476
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,601
I understand. He might get fired.

477
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,853
We will find it out after today.

478
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,607
I guess there will be
the disciplinary committee today.

479
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,068
Did you not know that? What?

480
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:02,446
Where's the Oh Min-jeong who'd
drop everything and come running for him.

481
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:05,574
I don't know. Maybe she's dead.

482
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,495
I bet you two had a fight.

483
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,707
A quarrel between husband and wife
is just a quarrel.

484
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,542
It's not like you'll get a divorce.

485
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,923
Yes. I will get a divorce.

486
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,385
One more time. One, two, and three.

487
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:31,517
Ms. Mi-dong!

488
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,354
No. Just give up.

489
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,816
We did something we shouldn't have done.

490
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,443
We all cursed her out.

491
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,446
But why are we getting punished
when Yu-ri got awarded?

492
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,574
Do we have to stay in here
until someone shows up?

493
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,200
JANG YEONG-SIM

494
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,958
-My gosh.
-What?

495
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,586
What happened? Is someone out?

496
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,172
Yes. We're out here.

497
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,507
The talisman just fell off.

498
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,595
Then you should do something for us.

499
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,472
What? We should?

500
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,850
-Okay.
-All right. I'm on it.

501
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:16,854
-Darn it.
-You can't touch it.

502
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:17,813
Damn it!

503
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,567
Wait here. We will bring someone.

504
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,235
-Let's go.
-Okay.

505
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,029
Wait here. We'll be right back.

506
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,203
Hey, Mr. Ma. Excuse me.

507
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,248
Dad, it's not going to work on him.

508
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,878
-Shall we go to Ms. Mi-dong?
-She will put us back in.

509
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:44,548
Oh, right.

510
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,271
Hey, Seo-woo.

511
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,066
We will have fun again next time.

512
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:04,443
Make sure not to skip meals.

513
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,195
Bye.

514
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,843
If Mom finds out about this,
she won't like it.

515
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,311
What are they doing here again?

516
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,858
If you keep being like this,
we will haunt your daughter.

517
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,610
I can't believe this.

518
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,660
Gosh, I'm still not sure.

519
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,872
I mean, even ghosts have some ethics.

520
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,167
This is the only way
we can lure Yu-ri out.

521
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,504
I guess that's true.

522
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,343
Gosh, okay. You take care of it.

523
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:14,680
Dad, this isn't time to feel guilty.

524
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,099
We have to survive.

525
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:18,934
Then...

526
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,225
Hey!

527
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,478
Come here.

528
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,774
-How dare you do this to a little kid?
-Get out of here.

529
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,651
-Get lost.
-Go far away.

530
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,319
Get out and don't come back.

531
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:22,831
Why?

532
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,501
Did you think we'd try to harm
your daughter or something?

533
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:28,837
It's true we were under pressure,
but what do you take us for?

534
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,507
That's what it looked like.

535
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:34,426
You guys did threaten me too.
I had reason to be suspicious.

536
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,720
What's the point of sticking together
for five years?

537
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,973
-You still can't trust us.
-Exactly.

538
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,559
Fine, I'm sorry. That's why I'm here.

539
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,738
What's all this?

540
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,909
Gosh, is this how Ms. Mi-dong gets
when she's angry?

541
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,662
What did you guys say to the deities?

542
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,247
Some words I can't repeat.

543
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,458
And we did it as a group.

544
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:17,052
I beg you
to forgive those ignorant ghosts.

545
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:22,808
I've punished them severely,
so please have mercy on them.

546
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:26,937
Gosh, should I just send those idiots up?

547
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:33,569
I take it back. Please have mercy on them.

548
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:41,410
Aren't you guys afraid
of being summoned without a notice?

549
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,121
That's what I was going for,

550
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:47,333
but you guys want to remain here
as ghosts, don't you?

551
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:50,210
-Of course, we do.
-We had to try.

552
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:53,047
We can come back to life
if we can go back to where we were.

553
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,673
And I think I can do that.

554
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,133
You killed yourself.

555
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,930
I can't take my place back.

556
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,224
The deities know that well.

557
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,517
All right.

558
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,019
Then,

559
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,229
can you at least do us favors?

560
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,440
-That's a great idea.
-Please do us favors.

561
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,401
Fine, tell me. What do you want me to do?

562
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,738
Please tell my son to replace my portrait
next to my urn.

563
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,990
It's from when I got married.

564
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,534
-It's too old.
-I want my portrait to be replaced too.

565
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,037
I want one from when I was
on my previous team.

566
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:28,749
My new uniform sucks.
It doesn't fit me well either.

567
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:33,128
-Please deliver my ledgers to my mom.
-I want new music in the cinerarium.

568
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,881
I'm getting sick of it
after hearing it every single day.

569
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:37,549
-I want alcohol!
-I want fried chicken!

570
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,139
Stop!

571
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,768
Are you asking me to spend my 49 days
doing you favors?

572
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,020
That's crazy. I can't do this.

573
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,313
-Wait!
-Where are you going?

574
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,232
You, of all people,

575
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,567
can't do this to us.

576
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,196
No one understands us better than you do.

577
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,573
You're our only hope.

578
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,202
You know how we feel.

579
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,798
No, sweetheart.

580
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,425
What should I do?

581
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,595
Yeong-hye.

582
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:27,099
Oh, no. I don't know what to do.

583
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:29,560
What should I do?

584
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:44,950
COMPANY EDGE CAUSED
A HOPEFUL YOUNG WOMAN TO DIE

585
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:06,638
CLOSED FOR HOLIDAYS, OPEN AGAIN IN 3 DAYS

586
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:26,158
Forget it. There are no ghosts
who have no regrets,

587
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,328
but you must have forgotten everything
in just a few days.

588
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,038
I'm disappointed.

589
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,665
You hurt me.

590
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:37,336
Who says I've forgotten?

591
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,214
I remember all of it.

592
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:52,059
Fine, I'll do each of you one favor.

593
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,436
-Really?
-Are you sure?

594
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,188
-Now you're talking.
-Yes!

595
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:03,028
Calm down. Please speak one at a time.
Granny, you want new music?

596
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,947
Hold on.

597
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,574
That's not what I want!

598
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,285
Do you want a new portrait?

599
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,539
You want chicken and alcohol?
Where are your ledgers? I'll deliver them.

600
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,708
-You want a new portrait too?
-I just said whatever.

601
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,753
So what do you want? I can do it for you.

602
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,297
-Give us a second.
-Let me think.

603
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,508
-What should I ask for?
-This is hard.

604
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,134
-What can she do for me?
-Let's see.

605
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:34,560
Gosh, I knew this would happen.
That's why I told you not to get caught.

606
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:36,061
You're too nice.

607
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,479
Thank you.

608
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:44,528
I can never do them any favors.

609
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,030
Being a shaman is a curse.

610
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,533
I know all their stories
but I'm not allowed to get involved.

611
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:53,203
-But I still feel bad.
-Gosh, you're too nice.

612
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,497
What did you say?

613
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:00,502
My gosh.

614
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:04,047
You don't even have to tell me
what kind of things they asked you to do.

615
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:19,313
Granny, what are you going to ask her
to do? Have you decided?

616
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,480
Gosh.

617
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,650
Why do you keep calling me that?

618
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,071
What about you?

619
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,323
Me?

620
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:34,995
I was thinking of asking her
to deliver a message to my son,

621
00:48:35,078 --> 00:48:38,373
but I'm not sure if it's a good idea
to remind him of me

622
00:48:38,457 --> 00:48:41,710
when he's finally forgotten about me.

623
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,256
I'm sure none of the things are
for themselves.

624
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,345
Isn't it easy for you?

625
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,805
You just need your ledgers
to be delivered to your mom.

626
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,516
-You've been saying it all the time.
-Gosh, seriously.

627
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,061
Leave me alone. Go away.

628
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,441
My mom thinks

629
00:49:07,027 --> 00:49:08,612
I was a civil servant.

630
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,238
-What?
-Gosh.

631
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,496
The reason why they're lingering here is
their children and parents.

632
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,293
What about you?
After taking your own life,

633
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:26,171
why are you still here?
Is there even anything you want?

634
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,097
Just because I killed myself
doesn't mean I have no regrets.

635
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:38,350
A funeral for baseball player Gang Bin
was held a few days ago.

636
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:42,020
Many friends and colleagues came
and paid their respects.

637
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:45,607
Team owner Lee Jeong-hee
and coach Park Hyeon-seok

638
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:48,068
were filled with grief.

639
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,697
His close friends including
singer-turned-actress An Hyeon-sook,

640
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,116
-female singers Im Bo-reum and...
-My goodness.

641
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,785
-...male singers...
-A person died,

642
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,748
and all they care about is
who attended your funeral and who didn't?

643
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:05,377
Man, I sure don't envy celebrities.

644
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:08,213
...attended his funeral.

645
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:13,719
They only realized what matters in life
after they died.

646
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,519
Promise me
you won't say anything unnecessary.

647
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,770
Like what?

648
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,356
Don't say whatever comes to your mind.

649
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,983
Just say you're sorry

650
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:30,193
and promise you'll be treated.
Beg for forgiveness!

651
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,653
-"Beg"?
-Yes.

652
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,739
-How?
-Desperately.

653
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,990
Show me.

654
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:39,161
Get down on your knees or something.
"Please forgive me this once."

655
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,455
You're good. It's not my style.

656
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,541
Come here.

657
00:50:49,087 --> 00:50:51,381
You haven't performed any surgery
for four years.

658
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,466
That's right.

659
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,845
You should have reported your condition
and received treatment.

660
00:50:57,054 --> 00:51:01,099
What kind of doctor runs away
during a laparotomy? Am I wrong?

661
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:04,394
You're right.

662
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:07,272
I see your wife passed away
at our hospital.

663
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,567
The documents here say
your condition was caused by her death.

664
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,738
I'm not sure if it justifies
you not being able to perform surgery.

665
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:17,407
You're still a doctor,

666
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,077
aren't you?

667
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,370
Yes.

668
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,833
Does that mean
you will follow our decision?

669
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,002
Yes.

670
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:33,340
If you have nothing more to add,
you may leave now.

671
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:45,352
That went pretty well.

672
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,983
Is there anything you want to say?

673
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,326
Isn't a doctor a person?

674
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:10,418
A doctor declares more than a dozen deaths
on any given day.

675
00:52:12,754 --> 00:52:14,631
After a while,
it doesn't mean much anymore.

676
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,678
It's just another unfortunate death,
that's all.

677
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,389
Yes, that is our job.

678
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,976
But have you ever imagined that the person

679
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:28,562
dying unfortunately on the operating table

680
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,524
could be your wife?

681
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:38,113
Have you ever imagined
it could be your mother, father, or child?

682
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,950
"You're still a doctor."

683
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,747
But isn't a doctor is a person too?

684
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,468
Welcome.

685
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,810
You idiot.

686
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,938
Gang-hwa,
pull yourself together, will you?

687
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,738
When are you going to stop
being like this? Pull yourself together!

688
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:22,908
Dr. Jang.

689
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,285
It's you.

690
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,537
Here.

691
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:33,418
Gosh, stop being so angry.

692
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,296
Please.

693
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:42,636
Stop being so angry.

694
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:48,266
How could I ever pull myself together?

695
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,937
I don't have the right to.

696
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:56,399
She died because of me.

697
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,947
I killed her.

698
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,532
I did.

699
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,038
I killed her.

700
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,002
Bring Yu-ri back.

701
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:19,923
Bring her back.

702
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:23,593
Bring her back, you jerk.

703
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:45,907
There's no way I can pull myself together.

704
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,840
One iced Americano, please.

705
00:55:06,594 --> 00:55:08,888
Mommy got hurt. Blow on it, Ha-jun.

706
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:13,852
Thank you.

707
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,898
How does Yu-ri know
how much Min-jeong can drink?

708
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,066
A divorce?

709
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,697
Apparently, she is seeing
divorce lawyers to get consulted.

710
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,949
-Oh, my.
-The thing is, she even went

711
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:31,119
to my brother-in-law's law firm.
That's how I heard about it.

712
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:33,455
See? I told you.

713
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:36,124
-Being a stepmom isn't easy.
-It isn't.

714
00:55:36,207 --> 00:55:37,751
What's going to happen to Seo-woo now?

715
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,502
I feel sorry for her.

716
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:43,673
I know. I was right.
She married Seo-woo's dad for his money.

717
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:47,802
Now I understand why she's been
sending Seo-woo to so many academies.

718
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:51,681
-Could she be seeing a guy?
-Oh, my. You're so smart.

719
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,308
-Gosh!
-Gosh, you startled me.

720
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,769
Do you have so much time?

721
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,439
So have you found
any of your own problems?

722
00:55:59,522 --> 00:56:02,609
I wouldn't believe you've had
enough time to find all of them.

723
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:05,153
Cut it out and be on your way.

724
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,405
You're the one who didn't want
to have coffee with us.

725
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,532
If you spread groundless rumors
in a public place,

726
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,868
you may face charges.

727
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:15,747
Did your brother-in-law
never mention that?

728
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:18,375
What's the big deal?
We were only talking to each other.

729
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,962
You think kids have no idea, but they do.

730
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,507
They repeat what they hear
at the kindergarten.

731
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:32,305
How dare you even mention names
in front of the kids?

732
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,391
Maybe I should bring charges.

733
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,559
It's not like I made anything up.

734
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,852
It's a fact.

735
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,188
Seo-woo's mom has even written up
divorce papers.

736
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:44,734
As Seo-woo's friends' moms,

737
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:47,695
we were only discussing
what we can do for Seo-woo.

738
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,572
My goodness.

739
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,282
I don't know what to say.

740
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,121
Let's go, Ha-jun.

741
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,500
Come here, sweetie.

742
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,524
Hyeon-jeong, are you listening?

743
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,694
What? I'm sorry. What were you saying?

744
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,781
Ha-jun cried today
when he saw a cut of hairtail.

745
00:57:31,865 --> 00:57:35,201
Saying he felt sorry for the hairtail,
he made such a fuss.

746
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,703
Really?

747
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:40,999
Yu-ri.

748
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:42,959
What?

749
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,627
Are you

750
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,672
really okay with seeing Seo-woo

751
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:49,716
only at the kindergarten?

752
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,552
You don't want to raise her yourself?

753
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:56,347
No.

754
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,141
I'm happy this way.

755
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,727
Why do you keep asking?
I already told you.

756
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:04,397
You're keeping a distance from Gang-hwa
because of Min-jeong.

757
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,860
You can't do anything
because Gang-hwa is with Min-jeong.

758
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:11,779
Hyeon-jeong.

759
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,573
Yes?

760
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,618
I don't belong there anymore.

761
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,704
It's where Min-jeong

762
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,081
should be.

763
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,185
Seo-woo, you've gotten a lot better.

764
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,979
We just have to come back here
a few more times.

765
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,371
Thank you.

766
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,810
I don't know anymore.

767
00:59:26,479 --> 00:59:28,147
What should I do with those two?

768
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,991
Min-jeong

769
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:22,660
is preparing for a divorce.

770
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:26,831
She wants to divorce Gang-hwa.

771
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:39,177
Are you sure you don't want to go back
to where you were?

772
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,305
Toughen up a little.

773
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:45,600
Forget it.
I don't want to ruin their happiness.

774
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:48,770
They may not be living
too great of a life.

775
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,482
What if their marriage is rotten
on the inside?

776
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:11,477
It's 50,000 won.

777
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,897
That's right. It's a 50,000-won bill.

778
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:18,192
-Gosh, that hurts.
-It's money.

779
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:20,778
-Come on. Please...
-It's money.

780
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:24,699
Unbelievable.

781
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:29,912
-It's money!
-Catch her. Run!

782
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:31,873
-Min-jeong!
-It's money!

783
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:33,958
Wait, Min-jeong!

784
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,043
Min-jeong!

785
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,087
-Min-jeong!
-It's money!

786
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,298
-Min-jeong!
-Min-jeong!

787
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,883
Be careful!

788
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:44,302
-Oh, my.
-Oh, no!

789
01:02:44,385 --> 01:02:45,803
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

790
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,264
My goodness. Why did you run?

791
01:02:48,347 --> 01:02:50,183
-I'm okay.
-Gosh.

792
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,018
I'm fine.

793
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,478
-Bye.
-Wait.

794
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,814
Wait, Min-jeong!

795
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,735
-Wait!
-Wait, Min-jeong!

796
01:03:01,068 --> 01:03:03,321
-Stop!
-Wait!

797
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,490
Stop there! Gosh!

798
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,535
-My goodness.
-Unbelievable.

799
01:03:09,827 --> 01:03:12,163
She's completely out of control.

800
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:16,542
She's usually not like that.
What's with her today?

801
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,586
She can't drink more than a bottle.

802
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,339
-Really?
-I'm out of breath.

803
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:26,010
-Where are you going?
-Stop her!

804
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:28,429
Good. I can't run anymore.

805
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:30,348
I can't. Gosh.

806
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,351
Are you okay?

807
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:38,606
-Are you okay?
-I'm burning up.

808
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,066
I'm scared.

809
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,696
Your face...

810
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:50,868
scares me.

811
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,707
Yu-ri! Are you okay?

812
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,587
Gosh, that hurts. That really hurts!

813
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:14,851
Then...

814
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,938
you can be Seo-woo's mom.

815
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,300
Can I do it?

816
01:05:31,802 --> 01:05:34,096
I don't know what I'm living for.

817
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,349
Home, work, home, work...

818
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,892
I want to live a little.

819
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,685
At least you're single.

820
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:41,604
My wife drives me crazy.

821
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,522
She can't stop nagging me.

822
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:46,567
I want to go on a vacation
to a deserted island alone.

823
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:49,403
My mom is such a nag too,
so I'm moving out.

824
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,947
She drives me crazy!

825
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,241
I guess it's not a good idea for a woman
in her 30s to live with her mom.

826
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,328
Those ungrateful bastards.

827
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,790
I know. Be nice to your family
while you still can, you idiots!

828
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,542
You will regret everything later!

829
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,420
It took me only one second
to regret my decision to kill myself.

830
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:10,132
When you're about to die,

831
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:13,177
they say your life flashes
before your eyes, right?

832
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:14,845
Bullshit.

833
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:17,556
All I could think of was
this one sentence.

834
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,522
"Gosh, what's going to happen

835
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,482
to Pil-seung now?"

836
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,780
-What are you doing?
-Why are you taking it away?

837
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,699
Darn it!

838
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:37,702
-Gosh, what a waste!
-We're not finished yet!

839
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:42,081
Even in the face of death,
there's something that doesn't let you

840
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,209
only think about yourself. It's family.

841
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:13,029
Yu-ri or Min-jeong?

842
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,447
Is it like, "Choose Mom or Dad?"

843
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,866
I choose Yu-ri. Definitely.

844
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:19,452
My dead friend came back to life.

845
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:22,038
Everyone has a friend
who came back to life.

846
01:07:22,121 --> 01:07:24,790
You want to be her pick-up helper?
To scare away the ghost?

847
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:27,960
What can I do?
I'm the only one who can protect Seo-woo.

848
01:07:28,044 --> 01:07:29,045
Do you like that lady?

849
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:30,421
I like the pretty lady.

850
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:32,673
He's living with his wife.
Yu-ri can't be there.

851
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,301
What kind of lunatic would say yes
to that? No way.

852
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:37,511
Can I do it?

853
01:07:37,595 --> 01:07:38,804
I have to.
