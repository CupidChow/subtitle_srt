1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,961
An unknown fire broke out

2
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,546
in a building in Seoul

3
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:50,967
around 4 a.m. today, killing 19 people
and injuring 30 others.

4
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,012
The fire burned the store in an instant

5
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,639
-Fire, again?
-and filled it with thick toxic fumes.

6
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,517
-Gosh. So many died.
-The fire started in the 13th floor

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,728
-Will you really go?
-and quickly spread

8
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,146
to the 14th and 15th floors.

9
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,648
They should fix the artwork themselves
since they bought it.

10
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,110
Why are they sending for you
when you're this pregnant?

11
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,155
It's okay.
Being pregnant can't be an excuse.

12
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,950
I should do my work. I'm a professional.
It's going to snow.

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,538
Professional Cha.

14
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,167
I know you'll still go even if I stop you.

15
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,377
Be very careful, all right?

16
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,670
Of course.

17
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,049
Anyway, is this all?
Didn't you forget something?

18
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,218
You forgot something.

19
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,304
Yes!

20
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,847
Bye.

21
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,558
-Be careful.
-Okay.

22
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,605
-Bye.
-Bye.

23
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,942
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

24
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,862
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

25
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,830
A FIRE IN A BUILDING,
FEARS OF MASSIVE CASUALTIES

26
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:06,000
Nobody is born with the knowledge
of their final day in this world.

27
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,796
Countless deaths pass us by in life,

28
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:12,257
but if it isn't happening to me now,

29
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,427
it's considered to be someone else's
heartbreaking drama.

30
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,306
It's okay, Mom.

31
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,850
It won't kill me.

32
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:28,022
Okay. I'll finish it quickly,
and go straight home.

33
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,065
Okay.

34
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:42,203
Yeol-mu, don't watch that.

35
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,656
Help.

36
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,242
Please save my baby.

37
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,119
Help.

38
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,497
I'm so sorry.

39
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:28,625
I...

40
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,251
My baby...

41
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:43,116
Breaking news.
The death toll has risen to 30.

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,996
We'll join the reporter covering the fire
and take a closer look at the situation.

43
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,831
SEOUL BUILDING FIRE DEATH TOLL RISES TO 30

44
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,166
The main character
of a heartbreaking drama

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,670
could be my mother, my father

46
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,256
or me.

47
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,010
In this unpredictable world,

48
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,554
there is nothing that won't happen

49
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,222
to me.

50
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:11,894
EPISODE 4
THERE IS NOTHING THAT WON'T HAPPEN TO ME

51
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,826
Gang-hwa.

52
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,411
Yes.

53
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,248
Hello.

54
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:36,794
Do-yeon?

55
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:44,469
-You haven't finished filling this out.
-Oh, the kitchen assistant interview?

56
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,013
I just went to use the bathroom.

57
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,643
Your kid left this.

58
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,976
Did you do something wrong?

59
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,646
What? Do something wrong?

60
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,399
They took disciplinary action against you.

61
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:41,609
They wouldn't have
if you hadn't done anything wrong.

62
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,027
Oh, that.

63
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,280
It's because I only do outpatient care.
That's all I do.

64
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,202
She looks a lot like Yu-ri.

65
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,919
I've only seen her in pictures,
but I was surprised.

66
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,671
You must've been shocked.

67
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,632
Oh, you think so?

68
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,643
Well, Min-jeong.

69
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,978
Yes?

70
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,396
Well...

71
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,231
That...

72
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,316
Actually...

73
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,114
It's nothing.

74
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,575
Let's just go.

75
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,121
Did you go somewhere?

76
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:38,624
Yes, I had to take care of something.

77
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,002
I see.

78
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,561
You majored in glass art,

79
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,438
and you're pretty young.

80
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:06,068
Do you think you can handle
the kitchen assistant job?

81
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,261
You can start tomorrow.

82
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,096
Pardon?

83
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:37,975
You seem really desperate for the job.

84
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,728
You look like you'd jump off a bridge
if I didn't hire you.

85
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,106
Oh, well... It's not because of that.

86
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,569
You can start tomorrow, Do-yeon.

87
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,615
Start working here?

88
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,285
Yes, isn't that why you submitted
the application?

89
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,538
That's right.

90
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,541
Thank you.

91
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:11,384
If I get a job there,
I can chase away all the ghosts

92
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,553
and see Seo-woo every single day.

93
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,513
It's like killing two birds
with one stone.

94
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,765
I'll have my cake and eat it too.

95
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,294
The wedding ceremony
of Director Go Tae-seong and Na Eun-ju

96
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,378
-will begin.
-What?

97
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:51,173
Is he getting married again? So soon?

98
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:53,426
That jerk.

99
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,431
What's the matter?
Won't you marry again if I die?

100
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,558
Don't you know me?

101
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,477
Of course not! I'm sorry, Yeol-mu.

102
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:08,566
Hey, remarriage? Is that even a question?
I'm going to follow you no matter what.

103
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:11,861
Hey, what about our baby?
Someone has to raise our baby.

104
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,614
That's right. You're right.

105
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,283
Yeol-mu, I'm sorry. Daddy wasn't thinking.

106
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,704
I'll raise the baby by myself.
It's not like he can't live without women.

107
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,623
Why did he marry again?

108
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,625
Did you think

109
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,793
I'd be impressed?

110
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:32,214
Don't be so sure of yourself.
You never know what's going to happen.

111
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,884
I'm sure he was like you too at first.

112
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,011
They say the proof of the pudding
is in the eating.

113
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,181
No, it's not.
I really will not marry again.

114
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:41,724
Remarry?

115
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,684
Why would I get married again?

116
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:45,436
I'm not a pushover.

117
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:57,740
-Well...
-How...

118
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:06,123
How did you find out?

119
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,833
I mean...

120
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,169
-I...
-That you remarried?

121
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,464
I just found out.

122
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,225
Is that why you didn't ask me
how I've been?

123
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,852
Won't you

124
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:29,313
ask me

125
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:31,148
why I remarried?

126
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,278
Why did you?

127
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,279
What?

128
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,658
Well... I...

129
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,076
It was because...

130
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,039
It just happened.

131
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,751
"You were dead
and I had to move on with my life."

132
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,588
That should be the answer.
How can you say "it just happened"?

133
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,718
She went to the same school as you.
A nursing major.

134
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,097
Yes.

135
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,436
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:14,108
What? Why are you sorry?
You didn't do anything wrong.

137
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:17,069
I just am.

138
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,989
I'm sorry about everything.

139
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,451
I'm not here to ruin your life.

140
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,457
Do you remember anything?

141
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:35,337
Do you remember how you came back to life?

142
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,632
No, I don't.

143
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,677
But I think

144
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,929
there's something I need to do.

145
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:47,141
Something you need to do? What is it?

146
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,185
What could that be?

147
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:52,229
That is...

148
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,442
What's that?

149
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,320
This?

150
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,001
Mom.

151
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:19,882
What were you doing?

152
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:24,386
Nothing. I was setting up a date
for my rotating savings group meeting.

153
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,680
Don't you know how to knock?

154
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,890
Is that necessary?

155
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,975
The neighbor said it wasn't her.

156
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:33,771
I wonder who left it.
It couldn't have been Robin Hood.

157
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,483
No! It really wasn't Gang-hwa.

158
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,735
The person said something strange
and left.

159
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,570
Just take it.

160
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:45,866
Don't you dare keep in touch
with Gang-hwa. I won't stand it.

161
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,284
Okay.

162
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,856
She's still all wrapped up in the past,

163
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:23,279
but she wants everyone else
to live like nothing happened.

164
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,660
You scared me!

165
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,165
What? What is it?

166
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:40,212
Hey, Seo-woo's stepmom isn't uploading
Seo-woo's pictures anymore.

167
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,964
Look.

168
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:47,970
These were uploaded three months ago.
She hasn't uploaded anything since.

169
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,972
Do you think something happened?

170
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:54,977
Can you ask her
to upload Seo-woo's pictures?

171
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,354
I'm sure she must be busy.

172
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,482
If you keep looking at this,
Mom will catch you red-handed.

173
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,741
I can't tell my granddaughter
that I'm her grandpa.

174
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,244
I can't buy her a gift.

175
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,831
I can't say hi to her on the streets.

176
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,875
I feel

177
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:22,671
so frustrated.

178
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,051
Gosh. I guess the real Robin Hood
has been here all along.

179
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,180

180
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:34,475
His kid goes to the same daycare.
They must've taken pictures together.

181
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:36,977
-Right. They must be friends.
-Give me that.

182
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,356
GYE GEUN-SANG

183
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,074
What's this?

184
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:53,118
Why are all his pictures headless?
It's freaky.

185
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,707
It's covered with his pictures
without heads!

186
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,377
Darn, that punk.

187
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:03,295
Gosh.

188
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,590
Yu-ri came back to life.

189
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,846
That crazy bastard.

190
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,434
Hardly anyone knows

191
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,562
that I like their eel.

192
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,400
You haven't been there since Yu-ri died.
It's been four years.

193
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:25,567
That's right.

194
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:31,115
Hyeon-jeong! It's a ghost!

195
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:34,284
A ghost? Stop it
or I'm going to rip your mouth.

196
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:35,577
One more beer, please.

197
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,954
-Okay.
-Okay.

198
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,124
Hyeon-jeong.

199
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:43,836
Why does she keep coming back
when she doesn't even like you?

200
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:47,339
Is she going to put hair in the food?

201
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:50,676
Feelings can be deceived,
but you can't fool your taste buds.

202
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,261
Let's go.

203
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,264
Let's go with Daddy.

204
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,807
There.

205
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:01,895
-All right.
-Your kid is here again.

206
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:08,610
This is a bar. Isn't it bad
for his emotional development?

207
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,988
Kids should grow up watching
only nice things.

208
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,699
Don't let him see something like this.

209
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,743
That's enough.

210
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,911
It's okay.

211
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:24,460
Ma'am, I didn't ask for your advice
or counsel, so you're being nosy.

212
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,795
Whether a kid is at a bar
or under a bridge,

213
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,297
what's important

214
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,674
is that his parents are with him.

215
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:37,681
I'm just worried about him.
What will he learn from a place like this?

216
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,475
That's none of your business.

217
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,353
As long as I'm straight and honest,
my kid will be too.

218
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,024
"Don't do this. Don't do that."

219
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,818
Why are there so many codes of conduct
for raising a kid?

220
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,403
It's not like we're in the army.

221
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,158
I take care of my kid, and you do yours.

222
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:58,118
Enjoy.

223
00:17:58,202 --> 00:17:59,078
Okay.

224
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,166
Come here, Ha-jun.

225
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,085
-Will you play
-Please enjoy.

226
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,169
-with your mom?
-Thank you.

227
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:22,935
About earlier.

228
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,023
Did you say it expecting me to hear it?

229
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:30,567
What do you mean?

230
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,153
Well...

231
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,658
When Yu-ri died,

232
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,785
my mom...

233
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,168
Hey, Hyeon-jeong.

234
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,337
Hyeon-jeong, wait.

235
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,630
Hey, Hyeon-jeong.

236
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,883
Gosh, you shouldn't go there.

237
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,428
-Please, Mother.
-You just gave birth. You can't go there.

238
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,266
It hasn't even been three weeks.
Why would you want to go to the funeral?

239
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,393
What if you meet with a misfortune there?

240
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,978
-Mom!
-Just send them some money.

241
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,396
-Mother, please.
-Come here.

242
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,689
-Mom, stop it.
-Mother.

243
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,065
-Please.
-Just stay still.

244
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,777
She was like her sister.
She's feeling devastated already.

245
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,487
-Come here.
-Mother.

246
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,364
-Mother.
-Just go, Hyeon-jeong.

247
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,949
-Will you stay still?
-Damn it.

248
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,409
People these days will understand.

249
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,995
Those who just gave birth
or are about to get married

250
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,163
can't go to a funeral.

251
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,414
Come home.

252
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,708
-Mother.
-You'll be suffering bad luck.

253
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,376
-Mother.
-Is it a statutory rule or what?

254
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,961
-Why can't she go?
-It brings bad luck.

255
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,005
-Why are you being like this?
-What if I die?

256
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,132
Will you stop her coming to my funeral?

257
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,302
You fool. How could you say that?
It's not the same.

258
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,180
What's the difference?
Someone she cares about just died.

259
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,265
What if something happens to your kid?

260
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,601
That's ridiculous. Hyeon-jeong, just go.
Yu-ri is waiting.

261
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,060
Hey, you can't go.

262
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,645
I'm so sorry, Mother.

263
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,481
Hey! What if something happens
to your son?

264
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,276
-Gosh, please stop it.
-Let go of me.

265
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,361
-Come here.
-We should stop her.

266
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,696
Just go home.

267
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,701
Why do you bring it up all of a sudden?

268
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,621
-What?
-Why are you making a connection?

269
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,791
You seem to have
a strange victim mentality.

270
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,210
I mean,

271
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,172
my mom used to tell you

272
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,674
what to do or what not to do.

273
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:19,843
She was like that.

274
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,221
Look at you.

275
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,476
Has it always weighed on your mind?

276
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,357
I understand how your mom
was feeling back then.

277
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,360
Old people tend to be

278
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,613
more cautious about
what might happen in the future.

279
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:43,992
And they have their own priorities.

280
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,581
My mom would've done the same thing.

281
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,627
-Hyeon-jeong.
-What?

282
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:56,713
-Come here. Let me give you a kiss.
-What? That's creepy.

283
00:20:56,797 --> 00:21:00,968
My gosh. Is it because you're old?
You're very thoughtful.

284
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,136
You darn fool.

285
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,475
My goodness. It's so smart.

286
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,352
How does it recognize my face?

287
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,951
LOG IN

288
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:30,580
Yu-ri.

289
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,251
Don't resent Gang-hwa.
Let's just congratulate him.

290
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,130
Seo-woo and Ha-jun went to the same
kindergarten for the first time today.

291
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,968
I gave your husband a scolding today.
I told him to pull himself together.

292
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,096
My friend. The rest place of my mind.

293
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,514
My Cha Yu-ri.

294
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:50,851
Yu-ri, I miss you.

295
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:51,768
LIKE

296
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,277
Good.

297
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:05,741
We have a new menu.

298
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,326
Salad...

299
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,452
And a heart.

300
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,953
Okay. Good.

301
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,165
NEW NOTIFICATION

302
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:14,958
OKAY

303
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,335
CHA YU-RI LIKES YOUR POST

304
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,180
I GAVE YOUR HUSBAND A SCOLDING TODAY

305
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,891
MY FRIEND, THE REST PLACE OF MY MIND
MY CHA YU-RI, YU-RI, I MISS YOU

306
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,518
What...

307
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,941
What's going on? Why is this...

308
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,362
Cancel it.

309
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,114
Is it canceled?
Did she get a notification?

310
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,867
I can't believe this.

311
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,660
What did I just do?

312
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,496
What should I do now?

313
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:54,498
This is crazy.

314
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,961
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

315
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,132
Is it really canceled?

316
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,427
Gosh, what do I do?

317
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:12,808
Seo-woo's mom...

318
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,228
is back alive.

319
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,314
Does it even make sense?

320
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,982
It's just nonsense.

321
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,359
It's ridiculous.

322
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,904
What if I tell Min-jeong?
What is she going to do?

323
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,781
What's she supposed to do?

324
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,666
I'm totally lost now.

325
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,502
I don't have to let her in on this.

326
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,590
She went to the same school as you.
A nursing major.

327
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:50,303
How did she find out?

328
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,849
I should have...

329
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,144
I should've told her myself.

330
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,399
Gosh.

331
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,412
SIM GEUM-JAE

332
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,998
"Geum-jae, I love you.

333
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:21,626
I will love you until I die."

334
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,712
Jang-mi from Cafe Jeong?

335
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:26,715
No, she's married.

336
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,051
It's Sun-ja. Cheon Sun-ja.

337
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,013
Oh, right. It's her.

338
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,683
Gosh, that silly girl.

339
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:38,226
I told her to forget me.

340
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,520
My gosh.

341
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:44,858
She's still not over me.

342
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:48,653
I see.

343
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,575
I guess I'm not someone easy to forget.

344
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,746
This is where you should put it.

345
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:00,207
GANG SANG-BONG

346
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,961
Sang-bong, why did you do that?

347
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:06,463
Why...

348
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,425
Who else can become
the king of base stealing?

349
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,718
Who are they?

350
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,471
They're a fan club.

351
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,764
You startled me.

352
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,142
He's just a baseball player.

353
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,270
-Is he a celebrity or what?
-I know.

354
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:25,440
People would think
he's a Korean idol star or something.

355
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,736
Instead of doing all the silly stuff
like fan service or play manipulation,

356
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:32,781
if he practiced harder,
he would've ended up in the Major Leagues.

357
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,287
Hey.

358
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,999
Aren't you standing up?

359
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,796
What? Are you snickering?

360
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,972
Make sure not to invade my space.

361
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,771
Damn it.

362
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,877
That codger.

363
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,514
It's time for counseling.

364
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,474
That damn old codger.

365
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,226
He must've upset her a lot.

366
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,270
That must be why her cancer is back.

367
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,689
That son of a bitch has such a long life.

368
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,274
He tortured my whole life,

369
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,151
and now he's torturing my children.

370
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:54,404
He should die
so my children will live at ease.

371
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,532
Are you saying you can't go up
because your daughter's cancer is back

372
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,534
or your husband is not dying?

373
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,119
You should make yourself clear.

374
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,872
I don't care
whether that bastard dies or not.

375
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,084
I just need to see my daughter get better.

376
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:11,755
JEONG GWI-SUN

377
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,206
You startled me.

378
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,749
Why? Do you want to fight?

379
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:51,336
You better not do that.
You might get beaten up.

380
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,671
I'm Gang Bin, you know.

381
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:53,755
He used to be a thug.

382
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,133
What? A thug?

383
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,094
He was a loan shark.

384
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:01,513
He was notorious for bullying debtors.

385
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,641
When are you going to pay me back
working like this?

386
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,686
So you can work here.
It means you're just fine.

387
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:11,189
Let me just take one of your organs.
Let's do that.

388
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,151
Thank you.

389
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:16,820
Watch out.

390
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,914
STAFF ONLY

391
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:28,998
What happened?

392
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,669
Gosh, what's going on?

393
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,382
He was struck by falling steel bars

394
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:40,176
-walking out of a construction site.
-I'm happy to hear that.

395
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,971
Thanks to that,
the debtors got to clear off their debts.

396
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,305
But he must be upset.

397
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,557
Are you really gay?

398
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,183
Yes. What?

399
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,270
So

400
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:54,190
you should tell my mom where my ledger is.

401
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,692
Then I will go up.

402
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:56,776
Your ledger, my foot.

403
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,696
If I get involved in human affairs,
I'll be punished by Heaven.

404
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:03,533
Why did you do something you couldn't
even tell your family in the first place?

405
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,119
-It's your comeuppance.
-Damn it!

406
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,704
Those who borrowed money from me

407
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,456
are living well off
without paying it back.

408
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:13,001
Those who are alive should live well off.

409
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:16,296
Regrets are what dead people do.
You should go up immediately.

410
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,631
How dare you tell me what to do?

411
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:19,924
I'm not going up.

412
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,136
I'm going to kill you
and kill myself today.

413
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,180
Go ahead and do whatever you want.

414
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,314
That crazy idiot.

415
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,734
SIM GEUM-JAE

416
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:42,864
My

417
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,576
Body

418
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,078
You can't go up alone
leaving your son here?

419
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,665
Lonely

420
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:55,960
Then you should go with your son.
Bring your son.

421
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,018
So this is your son.

422
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,897
And this is his son.

423
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,027
Son.

424
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,283
Well...

425
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,703
My son is still alive.

426
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,206
I'll go with him once he dies.

427
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:36,376
Bring me with you, okay?

428
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,377
Hey!

429
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,295
You wench.

430
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,841
How dare you weigh in
when men are talking?

431
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,300
This damn family.

432
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,553
I should just

433
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:49,097
break off the family line.

434
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,349
I should break it off.

435
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,810
This stupid family.

436
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:57,647
Things will be easier
if I break off this family line.

437
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,358
No. Don't go.

438
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,860
No one can go up there.

439
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,822
Go ahead and beg me for reincarnation.

440
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,782
It's not going to happen.

441
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,660
Damn it!

442
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,079
Gosh.

443
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,585
You...

444
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,014
How dare you come here?

445
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:32,390
Why?

446
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,935
Write me a talisman. A strong one.

447
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:36,853
What?

448
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:45,695
You wanted to go up so badly.
I guess you want to live now.

449
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,572
You got a job at your kid's kindergarten?

450
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,033
Gosh.

451
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,242
Let me see.

452
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:52,911
All right.

453
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,830
But I'm still not sure

454
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,541
if it works for young ghosts.

455
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,376
Go in there.

456
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:02,420
Here.

457
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:06,591
What is this? What kind of talisman
is this? Aren't you drawing it?

458
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:10,219
This isn't the Joseon Dynasty era.
I've got a good color printer here.

459
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,804
All the famous shamans in Gangnam

460
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:14,724
use my design for their talismans.
Do you know that?

461
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,643
Really? Are you sure?

462
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:20,396
-If you don't like it, give it back to me.
-My gosh, I didn't say that.

463
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,607
Why are you being so radical?

464
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,570
So do you want to drive out
all the ghosts around your kid with it?

465
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:31,157
Yes. I can't let Seo-woo
see ghosts because of me.

466
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,036
It's just too hard.

467
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:38,539
Gosh, I'm glad you know that.

468
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,751
I guess this isn't an easy life.

469
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,711
It's really lonely.

470
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,675
So what about you?
When will you take your place back?

471
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:53,554
So you will reach out to your kid
slowly like that in the kindergarten.

472
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,223
What about...

473
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,308
What about your husband?

474
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,269
Your husband.

475
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:03,064
You should make them divorce.

476
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,608
Who knows?
It might be already in progress.

477
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,445
You don't have much time left.
You only have 46 days.

478
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,406
Forget it.

479
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,449
I'll throw out all the ghosts
around Seo-woo

480
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,993
and put things back on track.

481
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,370
And you'll leave?
Will you go up just like that?

482
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:20,748
-Why?
-Because I want to.

483
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,250
Don't leave.

484
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:32,343
SOYUL CHILD PSYCHOTHERAPY CENTER

485
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,071
Seo-woo.

486
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,825
It's a secret that we came here today.

487
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,201
Okay?

488
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,796
I don't like Gummy bears.

489
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:17,555
Seo-woo.

490
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,078
Hello, Seo-woo?

491
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,875
Wow, are you giving this to me?

492
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,586
Let me eat it then.

493
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,508
It tastes so good.

494
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:59,472
I guess Seo-woo is going
to the kindergarten now.

495
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,224
Yes. See you then.

496
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,482
SOYUL CHILD PSYCHOTHERAPY CENTER

497
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,544
Let's start by talking about it.

498
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,589
Sir?

499
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,844
Let's talk about that time.

500
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:39,595
Get lost.

501
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,222
Okay.

502
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,307
"Get lost."

503
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:47,478
How are you feeling now?

504
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,605
I told you to get lost. Stop it.

505
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,984
Okay. "I told you to get lost. Stop it."

506
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,528
Stop it. All right, let's stop it.

507
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,322
Are you sure you're not getting treatment?

508
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:02,076
I can't protect you from Dr. Jang forever
That's enough. Do you want to get fired?

509
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,287
-What would you do?
-What would I do?

510
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,415
What do you mean?
Why do you keep asking me that?

511
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,584
Say Hyeon-jeong died
and came back to life.

512
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,545
But you're already remarried.
What would you do?

513
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,547
What would I do? What?

514
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:18,342
So Hyeon-jeong died.

515
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,720
-And I got remarried.
-Yes.

516
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:23,181
-Then Hyeon-jeong came back to life.
-Yes.

517
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,682
I'll be dead then.

518
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,101
Hang on.

519
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,021
So she got remarried...

520
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:33,107
I mean, I got remarried.
Why did you come back?

521
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,484
Everyone would've been happy
if she didn't come back.

522
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:38,029
No. Wait.

523
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,325
Gosh, this is crazy. It's so annoying.

524
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,578
My gosh. I just can't
bear the thought of it.

525
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,748
Why do I keep thinking about it?
Is this a new way of torturing?

526
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:52,168
Forget it. It's my fault for asking you.

527
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,586
Forget about it. Get out.

528
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,713
Go post some OOTD photos or something.

529
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,465
Go put on some suspenders.

530
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,635
-Hey.
-Just go.

531
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,386
This is my office.

532
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,514
Oh, really? Gosh, I don't care.

533
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,644
I might be disappointed.

534
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,646
But I could understand
my husband is remarried.

535
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,730
I'm dead anyway.

536
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,565
-You think?
-I agree.

537
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,276
I wouldn't care if he's remarried or not.
I'd just miss my kid.

538
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,112
Your kid? Even more than your husband?

539
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:23,115
Sure. My husband is just a stranger
once I get divorced.

540
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,825
But my kid is my family.

541
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:28,329
Do you know the disease
young mothers these days often have?

542
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,289
Thanatophobia?

543
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,666
Thanatophobia?

544
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,505
It's like a disease
where people worry too much.

545
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,465
They are worried if they'd die.

546
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:42,510
What's unusual is that young mothers

547
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,804
aren't afraid they might die.

548
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,557
"What's my kid going to do if I die?
This little kid will live without a mom."

549
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,102
This is what they are afraid of.

550
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,438
They are afraid of dying
with their kids left alone.

551
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,941
How devastated would they feel?

552
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,322
That's enough.
Let's stop talking about it.

553
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,158
Why do you keep asking
stupid questions like that?

554
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:10,204
Let's go if you're done.
Dr. Cho will buy us coffee.

555
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:35,313
Excuse me. When do we get to see the kids?

556
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:39,525
We have no time to see the kids.
It's not easy to feed all these kids.

557
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:43,195
Gosh, it stings.

558

559
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,488
No. This isn't right. Something's wrong.

560
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,949
I can't keep doing this.

561
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:30,826
This isn't right.

562
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,662
Get some rest. It's lunchtime soon.

563
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,625
-Really?
-Yes.

564
00:39:40,669 --> 00:39:42,671
My gosh.

565
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,760
They must be somewhere here.

566
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,930
Are they hanging around Seo-woo again?

567
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:57,937

568
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,234
SUNSHINE CLASS
CHO SEO-WOO

569
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,906
What? A kitchen assistant?

570
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:12,868
Why would you work there?

571
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,875
To see Seo-woo?

572
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:23,379
Don't worry. I won't tell people about me.

573
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:25,965
I won't tell Seo-woo, either.

574
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,053
I'll let you meet Seo-woo.

575
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,848
You don't have to do this.

576
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,563
Seo-woo.

577
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,190
There he is too.

578
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,991
Hey, kid.

579
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:09,884
I don't want to do this.

580
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,052
I'm sorry, kid.

581
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,893
Gosh, don't be like that.
I'm feeling weak.

582
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,353
No.

583
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,773
I'm sorry.

584
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,956
What? Why isn't it working?

585
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,924
Gosh, Ms. Mi-dong. That fraud.

586
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,388
All right. I need that.

587
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:04,146
Kid, run away if it hurts.

588
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,615
What? Doesn't it hurt?

589
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:17,868
It's supposed to hurt a lot.

590
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,414
But I'm still not sure
if it works for young ghosts.

591
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,002
Is it not working because he's too young?

592
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,798
How should I drive him out then?

593
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,008
Give me some more.

594
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,275
What's all the mess?

595
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,694
Gosh, I'm sorry.

596
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,028
What...

597
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,905
Hey, kid.

598
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,742
Who on earth is he?

599
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,077
What should I do?

600
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:04,123
What are you doing? You're scaring me.

601
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,845
KIM HYEOK-JIN

602
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:20,032
She's here again, right?

603
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,243
She's still having a hard time.

604
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,746
A woman who lost her husband
is called a widow.

605
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,582
A man who lost his wife
is called a widower.

606
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,877
And a kid who lost his parents
is called an orphan.

607
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,674
But there's no word
for a parent who lost their kid. Know why?

608
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:41,804
It's because no word can describe it.

609
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,850
There's no word in this world
that can describe the excruciating pain.

610
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,691
You're not fine at all, are you?

611
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,906
"The people here

612
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,784
are all unfortunate people
who have lost their child.

613
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,620
So what am I doing here?

614
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:53,000
Why am I in the middle of these people?"
That's what you're thinking.

615
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,339
That's what I thought too.

616
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,595
When I was with people
who knew what I was going through,

617
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:09,057
it felt like they couldn't even laugh
because of me.

618
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:13,729
And when I was with people who don't know,
I couldn't laugh with them

619
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:18,066
because I felt like I don't deserve
to laugh after losing my child.

620
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:23,322
In the end, I came here looking
for people in the same situation as me.

621
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,033
But even then

622
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:32,247
I felt out of place
with all these unfortunate people.

623
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:35,000
I couldn't understand it.

624
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:42,216
Coming here doesn't make things
any better.

625
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:43,717
Each of us

626
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,680
has to figure out on their own

627
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,559
how to live with this.

628
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,960
Here you can see

629
00:47:19,044 --> 00:47:22,381
that so many people die each day.

630
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,301
"Not me.

631
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,930
And definitely not my child."

632
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,100
I don't understand
how I could have believed that.

633
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:58,417
Why are you crying? Stop crying.
You can get more food, okay?

634
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,502
If you finish this, you'll get more.

635
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,588
Sit down and enjoy it.

636
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,631
There you go. Pick up your chopsticks.

637
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,633
What are you doing here?

638
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:10,846
You should eat. If you don't eat,
you won't become tall and handsome.

639
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,973
Are you going to eat or not?
Did you just kick me?

640
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:16,101
This is not okay. I'll teach you a lesson.

641
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,898
What is this?

642
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,859
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

643
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,778
Hi, Seo-woo.

644
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:32,910
Sausages. They're tasty. Eat a lot.

645
00:48:32,993 --> 00:48:35,412
Chew your food well and eat a lot, okay?

646
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,581
Here you go.

647
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,666
Enjoy.

648
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,128
-Some soup...
-Wait. Give her more meat and veggies.

649
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,133
Doesn't it look so tasty?

650
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:49,259
Enjoy.

651
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,348
She's a little kid.
She can't eat that much.

652
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,350
Do you know her?

653
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:58,769
Sorry?

654
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,689
Yes, I know Seo-woo very well.

655
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,691
She seems quite settled in now

656
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,985
considering all the fuss she made
a few months ago.

657
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,196
A fuss? What do you mean?

658
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:12,908
She wasn't talking as much as
the other kids and didn't seem to fit in,

659
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,701
and the moms made a fuss about it.

660
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:19,373
What do they care
if a kid can't talk well or fit in?

661
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:20,666
She wasn't causing any trouble.

662
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:24,461
She wasn't,
but they were afraid she might.

663
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,964
They worried
being in the same class with her

664
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,383
would affect their kids' development

665
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,177
and insisted on moving her
to the younger kids' class and whatnot.

666
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,263
There was one mom
who was especially adamant.

667
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:37,182
Who? Who was it?

668
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:38,934
-What's with her?
-There's this woman.

669
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,020
Did her kid talk right after being born?

670
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:44,648
Some kids start talking early,
and others late.

671
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,859
Some kids are noisy,
and others keep to themselves.

672
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,987
Kids are not mass-produced
in some factory!

673
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,279
What a ridiculous woman.

674
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:53,573
The kids might hear you. Smile.

675
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,621
Eat up. Isn't it tasty?

676
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,624
Come here.

677
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,085
Hurry up.

678
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,295
-Good job.
-Keep it up.

679
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,630
The color is wrong.

680
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:12,509
-One more.
-Good job.

681
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:15,637
-One by one.
-There you go.

682
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:17,723
-Great job.
-Come here.

There you go.

685
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:26,189
You did a very good job.

686
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:29,109
Bring it here.

687
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:31,153
There you go. Good job.

688
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,405
One by one.

689
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:46,960
Seo-woo, why are you holding
it in the air? This is where it should go.

690
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:55,677
-Where are you going?
-Hyeok-jin!

Or at least the director.

Actually, I've heard it
a few times before.

Me too.

698
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:47,229
I wouldn't worry. She is a little kid
and remembers his name, that's all.

699
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:50,398

Then again,

708
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,543
Why are you crying?

709
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,629
Let's go.

710
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,512
Mommy's here!

711
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,431
Let's clean up, guys.

712
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:07,184
It's the last one.

713
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,352
See you.

714
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,233
Whoever throws it the farthest wins.

715
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,153
Mommy's here!

716
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,785
Mommy's here!

717
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,004
Mommy!

718
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,673
-Bye. See you tomorrow.
-Let's go.

719
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:02,489
You're still here.

720
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,283
I'm about to leave.

721
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:08,411
Quite a difference
from earlier today, right?

722
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:13,208
Kids can get pretty anxious
toward the end of the day.

723
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:17,254
And it gets worse
every time a kid is picked up.

724
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:26,614
So you've been waiting for Mommy
all this time,

725
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,116
Hyeok-jin.

726
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,917
Sweet boy.

727
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:49,220
I said, stay out of our lives, Mom!

728
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,557
She's scared of you.

729
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,644
Didn't I say we were strangers
unless you quit this thing?

730
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,689
My son is five years old now.

731
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,318
I can't let him meet a shaman
who attracts ghosts.

732
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:05,195
Quit this nonsense already!

733
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:06,988
"This nonsense"?

734
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,533
Do you think I chose to live this way?

735
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,661
Did I know my life would turn out
like this?

736
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,538
Are you saying this is normal?

737
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,248
Stop contacting us.

738
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,545
I can't believe what I just heard.

739
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,883
You haven't even lived half your life.
How dare you lecture your mother?

740
00:56:26,966 --> 00:56:29,386
She dressed, fed, and raised you!

741
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:33,390
What?

742
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:35,141
Who are you anyway?

743
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,268
Why are you back here?

744
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,731
Why am I here? To send
a five-year-old ghost to a good place.

745
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:44,109
It's something only your mother can do.

746
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,237
Is it about a ghost again?

747
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,827
Look down on ghosts, don't you?

748
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,038
You were alive yesterday,
and the day before that,

749
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,500
so you assume you will be tomorrow.
You think you'll never be a ghost.

750
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,294
But too bad.

751
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:06,673
No one knows what might happen tomorrow.

752
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:12,679
Yeong-seon, stay for dinner!

753
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,771
After all that boasting,
is this how you let your son treat you?

754
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:23,189
I told you

755
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,483
I lead a lonely life.

756
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,820
Still, he was sweet when he was little.

757
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,823
Now that he's grown up,
he has many things to protect.

758
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,621
Why did you say you were here?

759
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,926
Since baby ghosts don't really know
what death is,

760
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:55,305
they ascend as soon
as they get what they want.

761
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:59,225
-Really? He just needs to meet his mom?
-That's right.

BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN

763
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,237
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

764
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,530
Good morning.

765
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:15,408
MEET OUR FAMILIES

766
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:18,745
You didn't have to come so early
just because you're new.

767
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,623
You could have waited in the kitchen.

768
00:58:21,706 --> 00:58:23,124
Good morning.

769
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,417
Director.

770
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:26,503
Yes?

771
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:29,589
That photo...

772
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,175
Isn't it about time it was returned?

773
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,812
You're right. It's already been months
since Hyeok-jin left.

774
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,781
MEET OUR FAMILIES

775
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:14,133
-I have to go to the bathroom.
-You can't. We're busy.

776
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,987
Why isn't she here yet?

777
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:38,366
She should hurry up.

778
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:40,326
Her little boy is waiting.

779
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:56,527
Mommy!

780
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,163
You're here.

781
01:01:08,081 --> 01:01:10,708
Yes. Is everything all right?

782
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:12,710
Yes.

783
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:41,531
Seo-woo,

784
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,366
what is it?

785
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,493
Did something happen?

786
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:53,668
Seo-woo,
is there something you want to tell me?

787
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:58,131
Seo-woo.

788
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,718
Who do you want to give this to?

789
01:02:14,522 --> 01:02:18,317
SUNSHINE CLASS
KIM HYEOK-JIN

790
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,582
Is there

791
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,959
someone here?

792
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,471
Seo-woo did?

793
01:03:28,679 --> 01:03:31,891
Yes, she brought Hyeok-jin's toy
to his mom.

794
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:35,812
Unbelievable.
Hyeok-jin's mom must have felt bad.

795
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,940
She used to try so hard to stop Hyeok-jin
from playing with Seo-woo.

796
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:42,193
I know. She even asked us
to move Seo-woo to another class.

797
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:45,196
Would she have known
what would happen to her kid?

798
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:01,921
Ms. Oh.

799
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,591
Yes?

800
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,302
I apologize.

801
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,639
For everything.

802
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,435
Please thank Seo-woo for me.

803
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:35,454
Hyeon-jeong!

804
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:38,499
Where is she?

805
01:04:40,751 --> 01:04:42,420
Did she go grocery shopping again?

806
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,882
She goes grocery shopping all the time.

807
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:46,883
UNDER SURVEILLANCE

808
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:48,593
And she eats it all herself.

809
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:54,599
There's nothing to steal
in this tiny diner anyway.

810

BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN

811
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:06,027
She was the one being harsh on Seo-woo?

812
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,657
She must feel even more terrible now.

813
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,437
You must be so bored but hang in there.

814
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,896
I'll be here next week.

815
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:08,899
I can't wait for you to come.

816
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:12,361
Are you guys soulmates or something?

817
01:07:12,611 --> 01:07:15,489
How could you even give birth
only a week apart?

818
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:17,158
Did you time it that way?

819
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:18,743
Did you?

820
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,580
Do you think that's even possible?
You idiot.

821
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,664
I know.

822
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:27,293
By the way,
why is he sitting there like that?

823
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:32,256
-Because he's crazy.
-Let him be.

824
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,509
Hey, man.

825
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,387
See? He's crazy.

826
01:07:41,015 --> 01:07:42,808
While you're just a man,

827
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:45,227
I'm a dad.

828
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,313
-A dad.
-Are you all right?

829
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:49,190
I'm a father, a parent.

830
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:54,612
Let me tell you something
now that I became a dad a week before you.

831
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:56,572
The thing is,

832
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,157
it feels

833
01:07:59,241 --> 01:08:00,451
very strange.

834
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:04,663
When you see your own child

835
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,042
for the very first time,

836
01:08:08,876 --> 01:08:09,835
it just...

837
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,759
You burst into tears
without even realizing it.

838
01:08:19,136 --> 01:08:20,596
It gives you

839
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:24,475
a grave sense of responsibility
and immense confidence at the same time.

840
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,062
You'll see.

841
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,355
Unbelievable.

842
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,527
-What's with him?
-He's crazy.

843
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,280
You did a great job.

844
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,032
You're a mom now.

845
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,618
Mom did a great job.

846
01:08:42,701 --> 01:08:44,245
At your age...

847
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:45,621
I'm so proud of you.

848
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,373
My age?

849
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,707
-Gosh.
-What about it?

850
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,543
Why would you kick him there?

851
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,586
Hey, say that again.

852
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:54,880
-Scoot over, please.
-Gosh!

853
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,925
Geun-sang, what are you doing?

854
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,261
I'm in more pain than Mom is.

855
01:09:00,344 --> 01:09:03,889
Yu-ri, stop looking at him.
It's bad for the baby.

856
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,685
-Does it hurt a lot?
-You kicked me in the wrong place.

857
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,228
-Goodness.
-In the very wrong place.

858
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,647
-Take care.
-See you.

859
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,778
He's a dad now,
but he hasn't changed a bit.

860
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,947
He won't change
even if he becomes a grandpa.

861
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:23,409
Anyway, they say you cry a lot
the moment you see your baby.

862
01:09:23,492 --> 01:09:25,578
Everyone cries, apparently.

863
01:09:25,870 --> 01:09:30,708
Why, would you cry? I'm sure you will.
"I'm so happy to meet you, baby."

864
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,501
Gosh, no.

865
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,254
I'll welcome my baby in a sweet way.

866
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,464
"Hi, welcome."

867
01:09:37,673 --> 01:09:40,217
Want to make a bet?
Whoever cries first buys chicken.

868
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,094
-Deal!
-Are you sure?

869
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:43,804
Keep your word.

870
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:45,556
Worry about yourself.

871
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:47,600
I won't go easy on you.

872
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,101
Will you be all right?

873
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:50,644
I'm a strict person.

874
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,439
-Look at Daddy.
-Mommy is here.

875
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:54,648
CHA YU-RI

876
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,318
Look at me.

877
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:58,819
I'm your mommy.

878
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:00,779
Your mommy.

879
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:46,784
-Stop looking at me.
-You're bleeding. It means you're a human.

880
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,620
Yu-ri! Behind you, Hyeon-jeong! I'm sorry!

881
01:10:49,703 --> 01:10:52,206
Hyeon-jeong missed me so much.

882
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:54,375
What? How did you know that?

883
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:55,960
I think she's hiding something.

884
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,836
Will she disappear again after 49 days?

-Hey.
-She showed up all of a sudden.

886
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:02,258
Who knows if she'll disappear
all of a sudden too?

887
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:04,593
I told you to come up with an excuse
to stay away.

888
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,595
I didn't choose to be here.

889
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,139
Whatever. What are the chances
of running into her?

890
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:10,557
Excuse me.
