1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:48,381
GANG-HWA AND YU-RI, AGE 24

2
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,219
My gosh! Come on! Wait!

3
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,930
I told you, I'm not going!

4
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,017
I'm not going, you crazy jerk!

5
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,144
The exams are starting soon, and what?
Soccer?

6
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,230
You must be out of your mind.
And you look like a fly right now.

7
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:05,982
Hey!

8
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:11,071
Hyeon-jeong said she's bringing a friend.
She's really pretty!

9
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:13,281
Gang-hwa,
we did so much to get into college.

10
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,366
You're just going to study?
What about dating?

11
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,036
I'm not going to date anyone.
That's not why I came here.

12
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,038
Med school students shouldn't slack off.

13
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,415
You should be ashamed
to face your parents.

14
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,753
Hey. Didn't I tell you not to talk
about my parents?

15
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,173
Gye Geun-sang, that little jerk!

16
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,427
A medical student? Gosh, you invited them
without telling me? I'm leaving.

17
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,596
Hey, wait!

18
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,682
We're just going to watch soccer.
I'm not telling you to date him.

19
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,102
I don't feel comfortable meeting guys.

20
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,479
All right, I get it. My goodness.

21
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,232
Just sit back down. Come on.

22
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,733
-Welcome.
-Hello.

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,152
A player with a good scoring ability...

24
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:53,571
Hey, I'm only staying
for 30 minutes, all right?

25
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:56,533
Who told you to date her?
We're just going to watch soccer.

26
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,993
-Okay. Hurry up.
-It's your fault we couldn't watch--

27
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:01,704
Soccer really isn't important right now.
Unbelievable.

28
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,832
-Hyeon-jeong!
-Honey!

29
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,667
It's Kim Dong-jin!

30
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,127
Hey, I brought my friend.

31
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,496
It only took us three seconds
to see each other

32
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,248
and fall in love.

33
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,888
Love approached us

34
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,392
at an unexpected moment,
pretending to be something ordinary.

35
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:09,981
Yu-ri!

36
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,777
-Are classes over?
-Yes.

37
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,908
FIRST DAY OF DATING

38
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,083
WHAT SHOULD WE DO TO CELEBRATE
100 DAYS OF DATING?

39
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:46,976
Look at this.

40
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,938
GANG-HWA!

41
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,855
YES?

42
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,607
I TOLD MY PARENTS...

43
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,694
THAT I'M SPENDING THE NIGHT
AT HYEON-JEONG'S!

44
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:14,837
SECOND ANNIVERSARY ENDED WITH A FIGHT

45
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,425
Yu-ri, I'm so sorry.

46
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,219
What are you sorry about?

47
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,346
What?

48
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:27,475
You idiot.

49
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:31,062
THREE YEARS TOGETHER ALREADY

50
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,818
Hey, put me down.

51
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,244
THEY'RE A COUPLE TOO! I'M SO LONELY!

52
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:50,373
As if mocking that short moment,
our love lasted years.

53
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,334
During that long time together,

54
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,421
we believed that
our destiny was invincible.

55
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,929
All right, the 2010 World Cup,
held in South Africa...

56
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,891
GANG-HWA AND YU-RI, AGE 28

57
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,855
I was...

58
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:17,859
I was just about to leave,
but another patient was...

59
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,610
I wonder why the ER is like that.

60
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,739
This always happens when my shift
is about to end.

61
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,949
It's really annoying, right?
I'll pour that...

62
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,451
Here.

63
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,162
Okay, I can pour my own drink. Here.

64
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,374
All right. Cheers...

65
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,834
Okay, I'll just drink it.

66
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:37,879
All right.

67
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,134
I can't do this any more.

68
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,553
No, Yu-ri. I'm really sorry.
It's my fault.

69
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,805
Yu-ri, please. I...

70
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,432
Let's just...

71
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,976
All right, Park Ji-sung has the ball.

72
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,729
Park Ji-sung! Okay, he's going!

73
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,231
He's running toward the goal.
Park Ji-sung!

74
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:59,067
-Yes, shoot!
-Let's get married.

75
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:02,612
Goal!

76
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,074
What? What did you just say?

77
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:11,329
I'll live with you!

78
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,833
Marry me, Cho Gang-hwa!

79
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,712
-Park Ji-sung!
-Park Ji-sung!

80
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,672
Park Ji-sung!

81
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:25,009
SOUTH AFRICA WORLD CUP 2010
SOUTH KOREA VS. GREECE

82
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:45,238
I love you too

83
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,950
I will

84
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,829
Love you longer

85
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:58,251
I’ll make you smile forever

86
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:01,796
If we

87
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,550
Live together

88
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,344
No!

89
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:13,558
I love you too

90
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,562
I will

91
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,232
Love you more

92
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:27,155
I’ll make you smile forever

93
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,366
If we

94
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:33,911
Live together

95
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,334
I love you too

96
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:44,589
I will

97
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,301
Love you more

98
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,973
-I’ll make you smile forever
-I’ll make you smile forever

99
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:57,435
-If we
-If we

100
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,272
-Live together
-Live together

101
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:05,276
We believed in the 13 years together,
thinking...

102
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,278
-Thank you!
-...it would be unbreakable.

103
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:11,908
PRESENT TIME
GANG-HWA AND YURI, AGE 37

104
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,386
Seo-woo, come and eat.
Mommy finished making our meal.

105
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:38,976
Seo-woo.

106
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,232
Seo-woo, don't touch that.

107
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:47,360
Mommy's going to get angry.

108
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,366
That's dangerous! No, Seo-woo!

109
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,454
Cho Seo-woo.

110
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,417
You shouldn't touch. It's dangerous.
Mommy is going to get upset.

111
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,716
Come here.

112
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:34,532
But life didn't turn out
the way we wanted,

113
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:38,786
and no one expected our parting.

114
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,542
EPISODE 1
LIFE IS FULL OF UNPREDICTABLE SURPRISES

115
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,681
Why did you put water there?
It's so dangerous!

116
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,433
If you were just a second late...

117
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,728
Kids her age cause trouble
the minute you take your eyes off them.

118
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,355
Hey, are you listening to me?

119
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,114
She can't see me, right?

120
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,452
But why is she showing attitude?

121
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,504
What was that about?

122
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,092
Seo-woo!

123
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,014
Seo-woo,
you seem to be in a good mood today.

124
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,891
Good girl.

125
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,225
I am a ghost.

126
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,437
A ghost that people cannot see.

127
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,316
One of the things
people are mistaken about,

128
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,985
something that they can never know
when they're alive,

129
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:57,114
is that humans are not the only ones
living in this world.

130
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:00,660
There are actually so many beings

131
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,454
living together in this world,
even if they can't see them.

132
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:17,176
Gye Geun-sang.

133
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,221
-You have constipation, right? Drink this.
-What?

134
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,604
How could you do that to your friend?
You jerk.

135
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,192
-Mommy said...
-Including us ghosts.

136
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:37,029
You almost got in huge trouble today,
didn't you?

137
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,911
My little baby, you're so adorable!

138
00:11:43,994 --> 00:11:45,871
Give Mommy a kiss.

139
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,707
Give me a kiss.

140
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,214
Come on, hurry!

141
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,759
Have a great day!

142
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,470
-Bye!
-Bye!

143
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,390
Bye-bye!

144
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,018
Hey, should we go?

145
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,231
Ms. Oh?

146
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,776
Are you busy?

147
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
Come join us for coffee today.

148
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,073
That's right.
Stop rejecting us and come with us.

149
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:04,992
It'll be fun to chat together.

150
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,536
I don't enjoy hanging out in groups.

151
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,833
She's so rude.

152
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,252
Gosh, that Put-off.

153
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,923
-What does that mean?
-It's her nickname.

154
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,676
It's because her daughter
must be put off by her.

155
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,973
She's just five years old right now,

156
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,892
but she's sent to art, English,

157
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,478
and ballet academies all day.

158
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:34,271
That's why she's Put-off?

159
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,148
I guess that makes sense.

160
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,484
She wouldn't do that
if Seo-woo was her own kid.

161
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,735
She's not her real kid?

162
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:43,823
Seo-woo's dad got remarried
after his ex-wife died.

163
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:47,409
She's sending Seo-woo to academies
since it's hard to look after her.

164
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,912
So Seo-woo's real mother is dead...

165
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:53,415
-No wonder why she seemed--
-A bit dark, right?

166
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,209
You felt that too, right?

167
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,419
If you watch her closely...

168
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,382
She's a bit dark and strange.

169
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,426
-Hey, mothers!
-Oh, my gosh.

170
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,685
I know people are nosy
about other families' kids,

171
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,520
but you should watch what you say.

172
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,188
-We didn't...
-We weren't saying...

173
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,108
We all die eventually.

174
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:23,821
I heard you're going on a trip
to Bali soon. The volcano didn't erupt yet

175
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,406
in Bali, right?

176
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,744
Gosh, what's up with her?

177
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:32,162

178
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,039
She's not dark at all.

179
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,709
She just seems that way
to them because they think so.

180
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,253
How could a five-year-old kid be dark?

181
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,630
They just have to die to realize.

182
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,549
It's better to have one more look
at my own kid

183
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,134
than to chat about other people's kids.

184
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,928
Do they think
they'll live forever or what?

185
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,142
They won't be badmouthing
this place again, will they?

186
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,643
I don't care if they do.

187
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,776
Whatever. Nothing I can do about it.

188
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:05,863
I'm not scared of starving.
They can curse as much as they want.

189
00:15:06,655 --> 00:15:09,116
Damn it. I want to just rip everything.

190
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,535
I'll just peel all this
with my bare hands.

191
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,454
I'm going to rip out everything.

192
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,122
Darn it. I should get a knife.

193
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:25,633
CHO GANG-HWA IS AN IDIOT!

194
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,845
We got your ECG test results,
and you do have an arrhythmia.

195
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,431
But it will be a simple surgery,
so you don't need to worry.

196
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,767
You'll be doing the surgery, right?

197
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,354
No, a doctor much more skilled
than me will do it,

198
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,438
so don't worry.

199
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,107
I see.

200
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,069
All right.

201
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,696
Okay, thank you.

202
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,406
All right. Bye.

203
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:56,413
Check Doctor Jang's schedule
and give him the patient's data.

204
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:57,790
All right, thanks.

205
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,504
-I'm sick right now!
-Sir...

206
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,881
-I'm sick! I need treatment!
-When you're sober...

207
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,091
Come back when you're sober.

208
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,467
-I...
-You're drunk...

209
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,843
Come back again tomorrow.

210
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,304
-Where's the doctor?
-The doctors' schedules are full.

211
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,223
-I...
-You should head back now.

212
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,934
-Come on.
-Get me the doctor!

213
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,061
-Calm down.
-Sober up and come back tomorrow.

214
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,814
-No! I'm really sick.
-My goodness.

215
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,108
Do you get it? Let go of me.

216
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:26,068
I told you, I'm sick!

217
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,071
You're just drunk right now.

218
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:32,408
No, I'm not drunk!

219
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,081
Hey, come over here.

220
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:41,041
Go that way.

221
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:45,170
I'm going to the computer room.
Go that way, okay? You punk.

222
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:46,296
Go on.

223
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,052
-I said I'm sick!
-Sir! You're drunk!

224
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,345
Sir!

225
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,764
I told you, I'm sick!

226
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,933
Who is he? He's not a doctor!

227
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:01,437
-Come on!
-My goodness.

228
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,272
My gosh.

229
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,275
All right.

230
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,068
-Did you eat, Doctor?
-Yes.

231
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,779
Doctor Cho, Doctor Jang
was looking for you.

232
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,365
In what way?

233
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,951
Was he like, "Did you see Doctor Cho?"

234
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,912
Or did he yell, "Where's that bastard,
Cho Gang-hwa?"

235
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,748
Did he swear? How did he say it?

236
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:22,291
I think it was the latter.

237
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,252
Thanks.

238
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,088
Thank you.

239
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,976
Your manic depression
and depression levels are low.

240
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,604
-But where did you buy that watch?
-What?

241
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,692
Oh, I mean...

242
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,613
And no obsession or bulimia.

243
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:55,574
-Can I touch it?
-Excuse me?

244
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,742
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

245
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,207
Come back again next time.

246
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,294
"Come back again"?

247
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:10,130
Don't be ridiculous.
How could you say that at a hospital?

248
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,091
-Did you see?
-What, that man?

249
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,718
Is it your first time seeing an athlete?

250
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:18,555
Gosh, is he a baseball player
or a celebrity?

251
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:22,017
No, I meant his watch!
Did you see his watch?

252
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,811
It's a limited edition.

253
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,314
I tried to get my hands on it
for a year but I failed.

254
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:31,693
How did he get that?
Do celebrities get it first?

255
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:35,405
You're a celebrity in our hospital too.
You're famous.

256
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,782
Come on. Get inside.

257
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:40,619
My gosh.

258
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,789
Well, I get it.

259
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,916
Did you see how he looked in his outfit?

260
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,253
You can't be a popular celebrity
just with a good-looking face.

261
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:53,048
The face and body proportions
are important. I guess I'm known for that.

262
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,551
I didn't mean that kind of celebrity.

263
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,344
I meant that you're famous
for being crazy.

264
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,554
-"Crazy"?
-Yes, crazy.

265
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,682
Whatever. Just come over here
and give me the doctor's note.

266
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:03,559
Doctor Jang is looking for me.

267
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,937
My gosh. You're crazy.
How long are you going to keep this up?

268
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,314
Just tell him the truth
and receive treatment for it.

269
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,692
How are you, Doctor Jang?

270
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,319
-I'm not fine.
-All right.

271
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,456
You.

272
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,711
I've been calling you for three days.
Why didn't you come?

273
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,796
Well, you know...

274
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,676
I had a lot of patients to see, so...
As a doctor, I couldn't abandon them.

275
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,345
-Patients are the most important--
-Stop the bullshit.

276
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:44,933
You say that, but you're only
treating outpatients all the time.

277
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,353
Don't you feel guilty at all when you see
the others in our department

278
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,606
spending day and night
performing surgeries?

279
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,275
I'm not letting you off now.

280
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,736
You'd better begin surgeries
starting next month.

281
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,573
If you don't want to perform surgeries,
why are you at a university hospital?

282
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,824
Just open your own clinic!

283
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,410
Why would I open a thoracic clinic?
It'll fail for sure.

284
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,454
That's a crazy idea.
Why would you suggest that?

285
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:06,955
What did you say, you punk?

286
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,335
Plus, it's not because I don't want to.

287
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:14,296
I give you a doctor's note every month,
asking you to understand.

288
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,633
What if my hand starts shaking
when I'm operating?

289
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,261
I might cause a terrible accident.
Then we'll all be doomed.

290
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:24,348
He's right, Doctor Jang.
I was actually talking to him about it.

291
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,016
-Shut up!
-Okay.

292
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,228
-Bring it here.
-Okay.

293
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,897
All right. Bring it to him.

294
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,698
Give me that.

295
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,327
"Difficulty concentrating

296
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,871
due to irregular routines and insomnia.

297
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:51,041
Symptoms of hand tremors
and bipolar disorder.

298
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,589
Seemed lethargic and depressed yesterday,

299
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:01,677
but seemed to be in a great mood
after 6 p.m."

300
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,350
I'm lethargic when I come to work
in the morning

301
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,687
-and I feel great when I get off work too.
-Right. Me, too.

302
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,524
"Felt extreme happiness after drinking

303
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,735
and felt extreme pain the next day."

304
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,573
What pain?

305
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,082
A hangover.

306
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:39,214
Do you call this a doctor's note?

307
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,591
It's a best friend's note! You little...

308
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,469
You crazy jerks!

309
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,055
You jerk...

310
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,350
I didn't do anything wrong.
Don't say that to me. It's your fault.

311
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,688
Do you have a brain to think?

312
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,318
-Hello.
-Hello.

313
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,197
OPERATION ROOM, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

314
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,912
I am happy

315
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,624
I am happy

316
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,919
I am really happy

317
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,132
The day I've been waiting for has come

318
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,885
It's such a joyful day

319
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:29,723
Throw your shoulders back

320
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,933
And stick out your chest

321
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:35,228
Wear casual clothes

322
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,105
And meet your warm friends

323
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,649
With a joyful heart

324
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,861
Run around the fields and mountains

325
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,529
And sing

326
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,823
Let's all sing together

327
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,002
I am...

328
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,515
I am happy

329
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:15,268
I am happy

330
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,895
I am...

331
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,787
Seo-woo, your dad's here.

332
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,708
-You're home early today.
-Yes. Did you have fun today, Seo-woo?

333
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,419
"Fun"?

334
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,463
She went to the daycare center,
an art academy, a ballet academy,

335
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:44,631
and an English academy.

336
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:47,926
-Nothing much happened today?
-No, nothing.

337
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,511
"Nothing"?

338
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,389
Hey, your daughter
was in huge danger today.

339
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,100
She could've been electrocuted
and followed me here!

340
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,648
Seo-woo.

341
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,902
Let's do the dance too.

342
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:11,533
Great!

343
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,083
Just can't take your eyes off
your handsome husband, can you?

344
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:04,211
You must be wondering
how I can be so handsome.

345
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,254
Don't be ridiculous.

346
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,549
I'm looking at you in advance since
I won't be able to see you a lot now.

347
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,135
Are you going somewhere without me?

348
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:16,097
When I give birth to our baby,
I won't have time to see you.

349
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:17,182
I'll be really busy.

350
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,268
Look at my face in advance too.

351
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,728
It will be hard to see me soon.

352
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:24,231
All right, I will do as you tell me.

353
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,399
Let's see that face of yours.

354
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,278
Hey! Stop that!

355
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,280
I'll look at you like this...

356
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,616
Hey! Come over here.

357
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,618
-Let me do that too.
-Stay still.

358
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,162
Cho Seo-woo. I told you
not to spill your food, right?

359
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:45,252
Don't be too harsh.
A kid can spill some food.

360
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,338
You spilled it,
so pick it back up and eat it.

361
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,427
Seo-woo, you're five now.
You should be able to do it yourself.

362
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:02,519
My gosh. She's only five.
What could she do on her own?

363
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:12,862
He said he wore diapers until he was five.
How ridiculous.

364
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,324
I'm going to tell Seo-woo everything
when she grows up.

365
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,703
-My baby, what did you have for lunch?
-Pork cutlet.

366
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,289
-Do you want sausage stew for dinner?
-Yes!

367
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,457
I'll make you a delicious sausage stew.

368
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,285
DECEASED GANG SANG-BONG

369
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:19,054
The funeral of baseball player Gang Bin,

370
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,182
who was found dead
in his home a few days ago, began today.

371
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,976
The police believe that
he may have made such a drastic decision

372
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,105
due to rumors on the match-fixing scandal
and his homosexuality.

373
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,233
The team that Gang Bin played for...

374
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,042
JEONG GWI-SUN

375
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,839
CHA YU-RI

376
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,642
Damn it.

377
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,865
-Who are you?
-Seriously?

378
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,577
Did we just scare him?
Because we are ghosts?

379
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:27,247
Who the heck are you guys?

380
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,332
Excuse my language. Who are you?

381
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,084
We're the Grim Reapers, punk!

382
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,838
If you're new here, you should try
to make a good impression on us.

383
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,590
Why are you crying your eyes out?
You're being loud!

384
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,470
Well, this is his first time dying.
He's basically a baby.

385
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,348
Everyone dies only once.

386
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:49,227
Aren't you Gang Bin?

387
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,354
I can't believe this!

388
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,357
-The king of stealing bases? Really?
-Yes, Gang Bin.

389
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,569
My goodness. Yes, it's you! You're him!

390
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,739
I did hear that you were dead.
I didn't know you'd end up here.

391
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,198
Who is this guy? Do you know him?

392
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,951
You know, he's that athlete!

393
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:07,287
The baseball player, Gang Bin!

394
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:08,955
Gang Bin!

395
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,791
-Gang Bin!
-Come on!

396
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,252
-You were good at stealing bases!
-It's Gang Bin!

397
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,087
-I wanted to ask you.
-Everyone, come on out!

398
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,381
-He's an excellent baseball player!
-Seriously.

399
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,133
Guys, come on out!

400
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:23,052
-Everyone, come and see!
-My gosh, look at you.

401
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,013
-Guys!
-This is Gang Bin!

402
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,598
He's here!

403
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,517
-Hurry up!
-My gosh, it's Gang Bin.

404
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,603
-I can't believe this.
-Gang Bin!

405
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,397
-He's really here.
-He's so tall.

406
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:36,649
-Come on here. Look.
-This is awesome.

407
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,151
-It's Gang Bin.
-Gang Bin.

408
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:40,236
-Gang Bin is here?
-It's Gang Bin.

409
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:43,406
Gang Bin is here. Hey, come over here.

410
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,534
-Hey, he's a celebrity.
-He looks just like on TV.

411
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,037
-Nice!
-He's handsome.

412
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:50,580
It's Gang Bin!

413
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,708
-I'm a fan.
-Hey, Gang Bin.

414
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,836
-It's Gang Bin.
-Where are you going?

415
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,379
-Where are you going?
-Hey.

416
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:02,258
-My gosh.
-Oh, no.

417
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,058
It's my first time seeing an athlete.

418
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,144
It's nice to meet you here. Hey, say hi.

419
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,979
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

420
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:17,106
-Hi.
-Hello.

421
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,860
He's got an awful case of the syndrome
for an athlete.

422
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:23,071
-What syndrome is it?
-Celebrity Syndrome.

423
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:27,951
What?

424
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,411
GANG SANG-BONG

425
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,996
You even had a stage name?

426
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,290
His real name is Gang Sang-bong.

427
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,543
Gang Bin is such a fake name.

428
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,587
You're not Won Bin, Hyun Bin,
or Kim Woo-bin.

429
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:43,758
Look at him.
This awesome celebrity is joining us.

430
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,804
But how did you end up here?
You're young to be here.

431
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,097
He killed himself.

432
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,767
The story about his suicide
was all over the news.

433
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,356
You killed yourself?

434
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:02,402
Damn it. You hang out with her.

435
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,782
Hello. I killed myself too.

436
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:45,361
-Oh, no.
-Gosh. Is she okay?

437
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,406
Are you all right?

438
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,366
What's this?

439
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,245
Who mopped the floor and made it so clean?

440
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:58,791
Well, the living don't stay here.
It's clean since no one comes here.

441
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,211
Did you break your bottom?

442
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:07,508
My gosh, you should have gone easy
on yourself. Why act all flashy?

443
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,181
Good. Everyone is here.

444
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:15,850
Is this the guy?

445
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,478
He won't make a scene
since it was suicide.

446
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,480
Well, we don't make a scene, either.

447
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:24,484
By the way, did Mr. Choe leave
after saying goodbye to his family?

448
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:25,818
As if that's true.

449
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,820
-Come on out.
-What?

450
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:33,117
What? Why is Mr. Choe still here?

451
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,745
He said he would leave if he met
with his family for the last time.

452
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,955
-Right.
-My gosh.

453
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,124
ANCESTRAL RITES FOR CHOE
REST IN PEACE

454
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:43,586
He must've seen it somewhere.
He went to say one last goodbye.

455
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,187
Everyone, it's me.

456
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,190
I'm leaving now.

457
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,151
Live a good life.

458
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,698
I was happy thanks to you guys.

459
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,491
And thank you.

460
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,039
My dear daughter-in-law.
I'll miss your soup.

461
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,293
You punk. Be nice to your wife.

462
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:29,340
My dear second daughter-in-law.
Thank you for hard work, too.

463
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:30,967
I love...

464
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,177
A wet wipe, please.

465
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,598
Where did this butterfly come from?

466
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,396
Those brats killed their father twice.

467
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,277
Hey.

468
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,404
Why are you crying?

469
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:54,157
I already wrote up a report
that you were leaving.

470
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,034
It's me who wants to cry now.

471
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,245
The same goes for you guys.

472
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:03,499
I know that you guys are ghosts.
But please keep your promises.

473
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:07,587
My district is the only one
with a zero percent accomplishment. Zero!

474
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:08,921
Well...

475
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,051
How can my number be a zero?
Does this even make sense to you?

476
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,513
Where do you think you're going?

477
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,809
I wasn't going anywhere.
I was just coming back home.

478
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,687
Does she have eyes
on the back of her head?

479
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,813
What did you say?

480
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,525
Okay. I won't run away from you. Okay?

481
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,403
Let go of me. Come on, let go of me.
We can talk after you let me go.

482
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,363
-Let go of me!
-Goodness.

483
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,453
Is that how you want to play this?

484
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:46,000
-Come on!
-Chill!

485
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:46,959
Stop it.

486
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,337
Come on.

487
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:52,924
Seriously?

488
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,551
It's not our fault your number is a zero!

489
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,304
It's all because of that reincarnation
cycle policy from above.

490
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:01,140
It's because of that weird policy
you guys made.

491
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,768
Don't you know we live
in the world of democracy?

492
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,355
She's right. Yu-ri has a point!
Times have changed.

493
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:11,526
-I agree!
-That's right. I agree!

494
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:16,280
There are fewer people in this world
because you won't leave and reincarnate.

495
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:19,992
The number of ghosts skyrocketed.
All I see on the street are ghosts!

496
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,619
It's already packed here!

497
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,288
Do you still think
the policy doesn't make sense?

498
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,917
If that's what you were going to do,
why give us democracy, to begin with?

499
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,337
You could have sent the Grim Reapers
and taken all of us against our will.

500
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:32,713
You said ghosts also have rights.

501
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,633
So you told us to choose whether
we'd stay here or get reincarnated.

502
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:39,929
But now you are telling us to go up
because the population is decreasing?

503
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,391
Deities are no different than humans.

504
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:46,727
When there's a new power group,
policies always get changed.

505
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,438
-Those policies always change.
-Exactly my point.

506
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,192
You'll be punished for that!
How dare you run your mouth like that?

507
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,903
I'm sure they have their reasons.
The higher-ups--

508
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,947
Reasons, my ass!

509
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,075
Let's be honest. Who would want
to go up there when they die?

510
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:05,288
Her son's business failed,
so he comes here and cries every day.

511
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:09,041
And she's deeply worried because
her daughter relapsed back to cancer.

512
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,169
It's not a good time
for everyone to leave.

513
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:12,295
I'm sure you know that!

514
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:15,882
Let's go.

515
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,385
-Let's go.
-Let's get going.

516
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:27,643
See? You always hurt our feelings.

517
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,568
Then, why can't you go?

518
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,863
Your husband remarried.
You've got nothing to worry about.

519
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,658
You think I don't know
you want to be with your daughter?

520
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,703
Well, am I not allowed to do that?

521
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:47,997
She's my daughter!
I want to stay by my daughter!

522
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,460
That little...

523
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,003
All she can do is talk!

524
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,925
How many times must I tell you
you shouldn't stay by a child?

525
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:02,303
Let's not make this difficult
and go up without a fuss!

526
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:06,933
CHA YU-RI

527
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,192
Fine.

528
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,986
Being dead is already unfair.

529
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,406
I know it's hard for you
to leave behind your baby.

530
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,826
Poor things.

531
00:37:27,036 --> 00:37:29,664
CHA YU-RI

532
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:30,831
Goodness.

533
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:59,819
CHA YU-RI

534
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:06,867
Oh, my. Good morning, everyone.

535
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,913
You must be over the moon
since it's your death anniversary.

536
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,957
Your stomach is in for a treat.

537
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:15,334
I know, right?
I hope I don't upset my stomach.

538
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:17,044
Is today her death anniversary?

539
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:19,547
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

540
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,800
I have six months to go until mine.

541
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,178
Well, she's in for more than just a treat
on her death anniversary.

542
00:38:57,376 --> 00:39:02,673
SEO-WOO'S BIRTHDAY

543
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,813
This washes away toxic words spoken
by the mouth

544
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,751
This is for the gods in five directions

545
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:45,716
I would love to have a sip of alcohol
right about now.

546
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,511
Can you tell the monk for me?

547
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,428
Gosh.

548
00:39:57,645 --> 00:40:00,398
ANCESTRAL RITES FOR CHA
REST IN PEACE

549
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,445
Goodness.

550
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,447
I'm stuffed.

551
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,241
Gosh.

552
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,618
I'm about to throw up.

553
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,709
Why was she in such a rush to leave,
my baby?

554
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,296
My poor daughter.

555
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,387
Gosh, why are you crying, Dad?

556
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:35,891
Why would you feel sorry for her?
You cry about everything.

557
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,602
She left this world before her parents.
She doesn't deserve pity.

558
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:40,855
Stop crying. Let's clean up and go home.

559
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,417
I know, Mom.

560
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,085
I'm sorry.

561
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,798
But don't be so harsh on Dad...

562
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,467
Mom, did you wash your face?

563
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,511
I'm so sleepy.

564
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,306
I'll be in the passenger seat.
I can't doze off there.

565
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:46,397
Will she be happy or disappointed
that her husband remarried?

566
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,691
Don't you know how Yu-ri was?

567
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,610
She won't be disappointed.
She'd be happy for him.

568
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,237
True.

569
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,992
Mom, you should go easy on Gang-hwa
at least on her death anniversary.

570
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,159
Shut it!

571
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,662
He's not our family anymore.

572
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,998
He's living a good life now.
Why would he come here?

573
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,628
Hurry.

574
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:20,723
Ma'am, you might be experiencing
shortness of breath due to micro-dust.

575
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:24,018
Ma'am, you must wear masks
when you go out.

576
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,564
Everything looks fine.
Let's talk when the results come out.

577
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,943
They both had the endoscopy
under anesthesia.

578
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,404
But his wife woke up
from anesthesia first.

579
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,865
Without knowing that,
he kept calling out his mistress' name.

580
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,992
-"Mi-jin."
-My gosh.

581
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,911
Guess what the wife said after hearing it.

582
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:45,080
-What did she say?
-"Scalpel."

583
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:48,667
Seriously?

584
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,211
BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN

585
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,104
It's Seo-woo.

586
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,866
What? What is it this time?

587
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,952
All right. You may go on with your days.

588
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:27,414
What?

589
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,627
I thought you felt bad for me.
Why are you doing this?

590
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,004
You only heard what you wanted to hear.

591
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,798
Didn't you hear me say
about being by a kid?

592
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,633
She's not just a kid. She's my daughter.

593
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:41,220
Whether she's your daughter or not,
you should not stay with her.

594
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,182
Come on. Are you seriously
going to tie me up here?

595
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,644
-Untie me. Untie me right now!
-Why are you getting mad at me?

596
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,647
-What? I didn't say anything wrong!
-How dare you?

597
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,818
You think you're so powerful.
You're nothing without those bells!

598
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:59,113
No! That's not true!

599
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:03,075
My goodness, you never listen to me.
You are so frustrating!

600
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,326
Gosh.

601
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:13,836
Oh, no. Poor you.

602
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:17,423
An evil spirit latched onto your family
and won't leave you guys!

603
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:18,841
Have you gone mad?

604
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,093
This will be enough to keep
that spirit away from you.

605
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:22,803
It's 200,000 won. I accept card payments.

606
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,889
Unbelievable.
Are you here to make money off me?

607
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:28,058
I dare you to write one for them.

608
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,938
Hello. Are you...

609
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:41,363
No, it's fine.

610
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:43,532
-Let's go.
-Hold on a second.

611
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,410
This isn't over.

612
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,419
What...

613
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:56,628
Oh, lord.

614
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,055
Why are you here?
I requested to be on night duty tonight.

615
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:09,683
Did you not see the log?
It got switched to me.

616
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:11,685
-Really?
-Yes.

617
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:13,562
You can go. I'll do it.

618
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:18,692
My gosh, that's all right.
You should go home.

619
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,153
Go when you can.
Go before I change my mind.

620
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:23,322
I might just kick you out of here.

621
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,782
Have a good night.

622
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,222
Go home. Your daughter must be waiting.

623
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,061
A patient is seizing in the ICU.

624
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,230
-Hey.
-Move out of my way.

625
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:11,578
I guess Dad won't be coming home today.
Let's have the cake first.

626
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,831
No.

627
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,960
Then, shall we wait a bit more?

628
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:34,763
Dad wished you a happy birthday.

629
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,059
Happy birthday, my dear Seo-woo.

630
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,756
That jerk. Again?

631
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:21,226
Come on out when I ask nicely.
Or else I'll beat you up.

632
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,354
I'll punch you twice if I find you.

633
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,943
Really? You're not going to come out?

634
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:32,279
Show yourself.

635
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,323
You'd better come out.

636
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,455
Come out now.

637
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:51,798
I knew it.
You ran when you saw me, right?

638
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,177
I clearly told you
not to set foot in this house.

639
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:56,970
Well,

640
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:00,932
you can't tell a local spirit
to leave his land.

641
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:04,019
-Where should I go?
-This isn't your land! It's my daughter's!

642
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:05,479
Go find your remains.

643
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,065
Well,

644
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,234
I don't know where they are.

645
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,236
I lost them.

646
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:14,988
What?

647
00:51:15,697 --> 00:51:16,990
How?

648
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,327
But still. You can't stay here.

649
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,205
That's your problem.
Kids have such weak energy.

650
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,957
-If you stay, you'll soak up her energy.
-In that case,

651
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:28,460
the same applies to you.

652
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,629
Do you think you're a human?

653
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,632
-What?
-In my opinion,

654
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,425
you're a bigger problem than me.

655
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,178
Soon,

656
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,806
she might have to be possessed by you.

657
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,144
She

658
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,271
can see us.

659
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,903
You lunatic!

660
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,822
I've been lenient
because I felt bad for you.

661
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,532
You think you can say whatever you want?

662
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,118
Goodness.

663
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:03,453
How dare he say such nonsense?

664
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,336
Are you up, Seo-woo?

665
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,033
Seo-woo.

666
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:44,953
Yes?

667
00:53:01,761 --> 00:53:03,180
Did you sleep well, Seo-woo?

668
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,140
Do you want some water?

669
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,644
Come here. Let's go.

670
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:33,460
I think Seo-woo

671
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:35,921
can see me.

672
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:44,971
It's because of me, right?

673
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,100
Well, children have weak energy.

674
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:53,521
But I've been next to her
ever since she was born.

675
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:56,441
It is my fault.

676
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:00,195
You should have told me.

677
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,780
I recently found out.

678
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,532
I told you that
you shouldn't stay next to a child.

679
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,326
I caused this.

680
00:54:07,702 --> 00:54:09,246
It's because I'm a ghost.

681
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:12,040
It's all my fault.

682
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:14,251
You stayed with her
because you were a mom first.

683
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:15,543
Seo-woo.

684
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,463
What should I do with Seo-woo now?

685
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,061
If she can already sense and see you,

686
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,272
ghosts will know and swarm around her.

687
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:38,358
Since she's still a kid,
she can't tell humans and ghosts apart.

688
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,068
So she might be in bigger danger.

689
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,486
Seo-woo!

690
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,822
-Catch me.
-Seo-woo! Where did she go?

691
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,573
You haven't seen her, right?

692
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,284
Where did she go?

693
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:48,952
Seo-woo.

694
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,162
Where did she go?

695
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:53,123
Seo-woo. Cho Seo-woo.

696
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,542
Where are you, Seo-woo?

697
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,544
Seo-woo.

698
00:54:58,461 --> 00:54:59,713
Seo-woo!

699
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:12,517
She's not here.

700
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:16,271
I swear she was playing right here.
It's like a ghost is pranking.

701
00:55:16,354 --> 00:55:17,439
She's not upstairs.

702
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:19,274
What's wrong? What happened to Seo-woo?

703
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,068
Let's spread out
and look for her a bit more.

704
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,070
-Then, we'll call the police. Okay?
-Okay.

705
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,406
Seo-woo.

706
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,533
Seo-woo!

707
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,536
Seo-woo! She's not there?

708
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,079
She's not here.

709
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:40,837
Seo-woo!

710
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,762
All right, everyone. Gather round.

711
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,984
I made this one.

712
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,111
No, the one next to it.

713
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,629
Since she's still a kid,
she can't tell humans and ghosts apart.

714
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,964
So she might be in bigger danger.

715
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,224
Seo-woo.

716
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,476
Seo-woo!

717
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:38,311
Seo-woo...

718
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:39,813
Oh, no.

719
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:43,024
Over here! She's right here!

720
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:46,486
In there! She's in the fridge!

721
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:50,615
Oh, gosh. Can you hurry and get her out?
Oh, no.

722
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,706
Seo-woo.

723
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,175
Seo-woo. Seo-woo.

724
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,761
Seo-woo!

725
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,742
Goodness, Seo-woo.

726
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:37,036
She's here! Seo-woo is here!

727
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:39,164
Goodness.

728
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:41,458
-Where is she?
-She's right here.

729
00:57:41,541 --> 00:57:43,460
-Seo-woo.
-Goodness.

730
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,544
Seo-woo.

731
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:31,966
EMERGENCY CENTER

732
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:41,267
Seo-woo collapsed. Take a look!

733
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:51,110
She's all right, isn't she?
Seo-woo is okay, right?

734
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,366
Why would she go into the freezer

735
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,619
all by herself?

736
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,205
Well...

737
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,416
Kids don't even know where the kitchen is.

738
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,836
I have no idea how she found the place
and got in there all by herself.

739
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,359
I'm sorry.

740
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:36,072
It's my fault.

741
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:04,100
Mommy is sorry.

742
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,079
You're going up?

743
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,709
I'll leave. I'll go. I'll disappear.

744
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,671
Then Seo-woo will be fine, won't she?
She won't have to see ghosts.

745
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,214
I don't know that for sure.

746
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:37,467
I'll go up there and beg.

747
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:42,096
I don't have to be reincarnated.
I'm willing to fall under.

748
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,766
I just...

749
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:48,686
I was going to leave
after I see her walking.

750
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:53,191
I just wanted to see her walk.

751
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,200
PARENTS: CHA YU-RI, CHO GANG-HWA

752
01:01:39,153 --> 01:01:41,739
Then I wanted to see her talk,

753
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:45,827
run, and eat.

754
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:49,539
I knew I had to go.

755
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,376
But I wanted to stay just a little longer.

756
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,962
Just a little longer...

757
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:43,509
Mom!

758
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:48,431
Su-ah, gosh, my daughter.

759
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,352
Did you do well today?

760
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,104
-Of course, I did.
-Really?

761
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,239
Why? Why not?

762
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,700
Why can't I do that?

763
01:04:31,659 --> 01:04:33,452
Why can't I?

764
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,165
Can't I just stay and watch her?
Am I not allowed to have that?

765
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,626
Why can't I do that? Why not?

766
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:47,091
Who do you think you are?
Who gave you the right to do that?

767
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:59,687
CHA YU-RI

768
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,510
You said I can stay!
You told me that I can stay here!

769
01:06:54,927 --> 01:06:57,763
Why not? Why can't I stay?

770
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:06,731
Do you call yourself a deity?
Does that mean you can do anything?

771
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:10,943
How can you be a deity? You jerk!

772
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,413
We could just have some sujebi
on the weekend.

773
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,749
Sujebi isn't easy to make.

774
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:28,961
There wasn't even a potato at home.
I needed to shop for groceries anyway.

775
01:07:44,018 --> 01:07:46,103
What are you doing? Come along.

776
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,688
Yes, I'm coming. Let's go.

777
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,182
I'm starving.

778
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:32,775
What's with Dad?

779
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:34,568
Hey.

780
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:38,572
It's because he's too weak.
He's way too weak-hearted.

781
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:41,867
You're right. I can't do it.

782
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,162
I'm sure you can do anything
you put your mind to,

783
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,664
but I can't do that.

784
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:52,878
I miss my daughter and my granddaughter!
It's not that easy to stay determined!

785
01:09:00,761 --> 01:09:02,596
He saw Seo-woo again, didn't he?

786
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:06,892
That's why I suggested we move.
At least we won't have to see her.

787
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,436
Go back to your room too.
You're distracting me.

788
01:09:11,605 --> 01:09:12,648
Yes.

789
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:54,476
Yu-ri.

790
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:55,686
Yu-ri...

791
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,521
Yu-ri...

792
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:02,776
Yu-ri!

793
01:13:32,825 --> 01:13:35,244
Why is this cold? I can see myself!

794
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:37,704
Wait, did I just become a human?

795
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,832
But why? All of a sudden?

796
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,166
If you see them, ignore them.

797
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,836
Don't let other ghosts catch you.

798
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:46,171
I'm sure there are
people who look awfully alike,

799
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,631
who look like twins.

800
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:50,008
-Are you out of it?
-Wait, what is this?

801
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:52,136
Have you ever seen a doppelganger?

802
01:13:52,219 --> 01:13:55,347
If you return to your place
within 49 days,

803
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,266
you can continue to stay alive.

804
01:13:58,642 --> 01:14:00,227
Hey, Seo-woo.

805
01:14:03,897 --> 01:14:06,900
