1
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,792
Do you need anything else?

2
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,460
-Could we have more sauce?
-Okay.

3
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,420
He's a fraud, not a husband.

4
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,714
Everything he said
when we were dating was a lie.

5
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,049
He said his senior told him

6
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,259
if he's too good to his wife,
he'll lose power.

7
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,470
So he says he can't let me have my way.

8
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,264
How can he be so stubborn
over such a petty thing?

9
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,518
You left with your stuff
over a petty thing too.

10
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:45,396
You can't expect a guy to sit down to pee
when he's peed standing up his whole life.

11
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,401
Hyeon-jeong, this isn't just a simple
matter about how he uses the toilet.

12
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,113
-This is a matter of pride.
-You really are newly-weds.

13
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,197
You're so cute.

14
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,955
All right. I get you.

15
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:05,917
Cho Gang-hwa, that little punk.
He's the problem, isn't he?

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,378
Eat up first.
You said you haven't eaten anything.

17
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,796
No, I'm not going to eat.

18
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,512
They say that those who die after eating
look better as ghosts too.

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,722
Come on. Eat.

20
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,725
I'm so angry.
I don't feel like eating anything.

21
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,395
Hyeon-jeong.

22
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,565
Maybe I shouldn't have married him.

23
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,026
All right. Just eat up. Eat.

24
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,446
I won't go home even if he comes here
and begs on his knees.

25
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,699
Okay, I get you.

26
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,577
Back then, when I never expected my death,

27
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,788
I was preoccupied with petty emotions
in everyday life

28
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,000
and didn't realize what really mattered.

29
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,586
Just eat up first.
Let's talk after you eat.

30
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,005
I really don't feel like eating.

31
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,799
I know, I understand.
But still, you should eat.

32
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:58,595
-I'm really going to end it this time.
-Then break up with him.

33
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:03,558
But even if you do, do it after you eat.
Come on, open your mouth.

34
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,855
Here, eat this.

35
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,066
Being able to eat something

36
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,444
and touch the person I love,

37
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,905
and being alive and breathing,

38
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:19,407
even in the hardest of times...

39
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,535
I only realized how beautiful that is

40
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,455
after I died.

41
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,462
EPISODE 3: REALIZING THE BEAUTY OF LIFE
IS ONLY POSSIBLE AFTER DEATH

42
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,754
-Cha Yu-ri!
-You're mistaken.

43
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:41,531
What...

44
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,868
How...

45
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,706
How can this be?

46
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,998
I'm such an idiot.
How could I have gotten caught like that?

47
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,796
Should I just tell him the truth?

48
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,759
Oh, that's what happened. I get it now.

49
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:47,013
So you need to go back to your place
within 49 days to completely come to life.

50
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,473
You need to be my wife.

51
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,061
Oh, but there's a problem.

52
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:56,189
The position of my wife
is occupied right now.

53
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,816
I have a wife already.

54
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:06,783
What?

55
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,286
Seo-woo sees ghosts?

56
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,914
And you came to get rid of them?

57
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:19,045
Oh, that's what happened. I get it now.

58
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,507
You could've told me before.

59
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,591
Hang on.

60
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,928
But how is Seo-woo

61
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,139
able to see ghosts now?

62
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,393
Don't tell me...

63
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,813
Were you lingering around us
as a ghost? That's scary.

64
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,858
Gosh, I'm getting the chills.

65
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,535
How can I tell him that?

66
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:53,704
I'd be scared too if I heard
that a ghost was lingering around.

67
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,332
How do I explain this?

68
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,683
SPECIALIST DOCTOR EXAM RESULTS

69
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,561
Stop chewing the straw.
It's bad for your health.

70
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,188
Just leave me be. I'm so anxious.

71
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,776
I'm the one who should be anxious,
you know.

72
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,764
I mean, it's not a dream.

73
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:03,608
Whatever. Just pretend I'm not her.
There are lots of people who look alike.

74
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,243
CHO GANG-HWA
IDIOT

75
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,578
There was...

76
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:18,873
only one person...

77
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,710
around me...

78
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,087
who doodled

79
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,673
and wrote stuff like this.

80
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:32,220
It's you.

81
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,972
I'm sure it's really you,

82
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,517
but how...

83
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,607
How can you be here in front of me?

84
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,904
How is this possible?

85
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,323
Tell me.

86
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,494
Come on, say something.

87
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,996
Come on.

88
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,994
Where were you?

89
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,748
What happened?

90
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,334
What?

91
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,086
Oh, sorry.

92
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:48,838
My friend...

93
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,632
-My friend--
-Which friend?

94
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,887
How can they just take our kid...

95
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:03,060
What's wrong? You look like
you've seen a ghost or something.

96
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:07,023
Go home first.
I need to go somewhere for a minute.

97
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:08,941
Gang-hwa!

98
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,076
You woke up, and you were
at a charnel house?

99
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,496
Do you remember anything
about before you woke up?

100
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,666
It's been four years. I mean,
do you know it's been four years?

101
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,502
I don't know. I can't remember anything.

102
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,631
I remember that I died.

103
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,676
But I woke up, and it's the present.

104
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,261
What...

105
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,724
Did you rise from the dead
or something?

106
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,143
No...
That doesn't really make sense either.

107
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,937
That's what I want to say.
This doesn't make sense.

108
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,066
It's so ridiculous. I'm sure I died.

109
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,444
How am I alive again?

110
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,945
Maybe...

111
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,199
What is it? Do you remember something?

112
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,452
A vacation as a reward.

113
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,621
Maybe I got something like that.

114
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,082
For about 49 days.

115
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:08,834
Maybe I was a model soul
in the other world,

116
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,462
like how there are model prisoners
in jail.

117
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,716
So you were given a vacation?

118
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:18,552
-By who?
-Well...

119
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,554
I guess someone like...

120
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,808
God?

121
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,268
God?

122
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,778
Well...

123
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,675
MIN-JEONG: WHAT'S GOING ON?

124
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:08,310
I need to go to the bathroom for a minute.

125
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,229
Okay. Go.

126
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,449
WHAT'S GOING ON?

127
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,462
Seo-woo, who were you with today?

128
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,089
You weren't with the pick-up helper.

129
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,676
A pretty Auntie.

130
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,929
"A pretty Auntie"?

131
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:47,057
A woman?

132
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,274
Seo-woo, what happened to your hand?

133
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,619
What did she do with someone else's kid?

134
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,638
I really didn't mean for this to happen.

135
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,518
I should just leave for now.

136
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,568
What? Where is she going?

137
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,737
Yu-ri!

138
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,115
Yu-ri.

139
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,543
Where are you going?

140
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:57,962
Well...

141
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,175
I...

142
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,392
What's with you?

143
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,104
Why do you keep running away?

144
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,484
It's me.

145
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,030
It's me, Gang-hwa. Cho Gang-hwa.

146
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,290
Right.

147
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,584
Cho Gang-hwa.

148
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:46,051
I'm just so startled right now.

149
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:49,221
I really didn't mean for this to happen.

150
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:52,016
I don't know what situation
you're in right now.

151
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,562
What I mean is that...

152
00:14:58,689 --> 00:14:59,773
Well...

153
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:04,278
Maybe we both need some time
to think things over.

154
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,114
Something like that.

155
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,794
Don't go anywhere, and just stay here.

156
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,088
I'll come back tomorrow.

157
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:28,969
And use this to buy anything
you want to eat.

158
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,932
Thanks.

159
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,518
-You should go.
-What?

160
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,395
Right.

161
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:42,691
Don't go anywhere. Stay right here, okay?

162
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,611
Don't leave.

163
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,823
I'll get going now.

164
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,161
Gang-hwa.

165
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:57,414
Yes? What is it?
Do you have something to say?

166
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,209
I'm sorry about earlier.

167
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,336
About taking Seo-woo.

168
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,522
Why did I have to get caught like that?

169
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,650
What do I do now?

170
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,724
Hi.

171
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:41,435
Hey, Seo-woo.

172
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,549
Hyeon-jeong, that looks delicious.

173
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:13,967
You know,

174
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,719
maybe it's that.

175
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,679
What?

176
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:19,681
A ghost.

177
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,646
Are you insane? That hurt!

178
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,439
Watch what you say.

179
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:29,858
Are you saying Yu-ri's lingering
as a ghost?

180
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,819
I think I really saw her.

181
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,739
I actually saw her for a second.

182
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,575
My aunt said
I have some psychic abilities.

183
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,579
Stop eating them!

184
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,164
That hurts! Okay, I'll stop!

185
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:47,584
I'll stop eating them!
I'm not going to eat them!

186
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,461
-Don't eat them!
-You're so mean!

187
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,380
-They're not even tasty!
-You ate a ton!

188
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,173
-Enjoy your food.
-You little...

189
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:56,718
My baby...

190
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,305
Honey! Ha-jun woke up because of you!

191
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,474
-My Ha-jun.
-Did you wake up

192
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,143
because Mommy yelled like a hippo?

193
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,020
It's okay, I'll scold that loud hippo.

194
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,897
-What?
-Let's punish the hippo.

195
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,819
Die, Hippo!

196
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,571
-Come over here.
-The hippo...

197
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,823
-Do you want to get beaten by the hippo?
-Sorry.

198
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:21,410
-I won't do that again.
-Don't you dare. My goodness.

199
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,957
Sorry about that. Eat up.

200
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,877
I'm raising two sons right now.

201
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,005
That kid is a doctor, though.
A neuropsychiatrist.

202
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,132
But he has mental problems himself.

203
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:41,305
You hippo! Die, Hippo!
Get out of our restaurant, Hippo!

204
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,225
Stop talking to the customers
and leave, you hippo!

205
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:46,810
-Hey!
-Hippo!

206
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,605
-Come over here!
-Hippo!

207
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,648
MISAENG

208
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,860
Does this make sense?

209
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,155
It does. I saw her with my own eyes.
I even talked to her.

210
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,074
What do I do now?

211
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,661
All right. First, I should tell
her mother and father.

212
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,290
I tell them, and then say...
What should I say, though?

213
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,458
What...

214
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,753
That I remarried?

215
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,423
How can I tell Yu-ri that?

216
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,591
Can you see Yu-ri?

217
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,552
-My gosh.
-Hyeon-jeong.

218
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:21,553
What?

219
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,014
How did you know?

220
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,851
Your blabbermouth friend lives with me.

221
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,899
So many people look alike.
Will you act like this every time?

222
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,069
-Why are you suddenly acting like this?
-Hyeon-jeong.

223
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,738
Listen. Don't get too startled.

224
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,493
-It's not someone who looks like her.
-No?

225
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,829
-Geun-sang was just overreacting?
-No, I mean...

226
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,206
Don't be surprised.

227
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,544
Yu-ri...

228
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:58,590
has come back to life.

229
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,553
Oh, really?

230
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,558
I'm telling you, Yu-ri came back to life.

231
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,144
-Right.
-What?

232
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,398
That's great. Just wonderful, you lunatic.

233
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,401
-How ridiculous.
-Hey, I wasn't...

234
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,487
I mean it!
I'm telling the truth, Hyeon-jeong.

235
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,450
She must have fallen down.
Her hand was hurt.

236
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,667
Who was it?

237
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:46,638
What?

238
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:49,808
What is it?

239
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,103
-Were you listening to me?
-Of course.

240
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:02,529
I'm sorry. I've got a lot on my mind
right now. What did you say?

241
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,286
I'm sorry.

242
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,247
What?

243
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,958
What are you sorry for?

244
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,878
For losing Seo-woo.

245
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:19,880
It was my fault.

246
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:23,175
What are you talking about?
It's not your fault.

247
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:25,802
Well. What happened was...

248
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,432
My friend knows Seo-woo well,
so they were hanging out. So...

249
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,351
It's actually my fault.

250
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,895
I should've told you beforehand.

251
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,021
I'm sorry.

252
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,025
Who's that friend?

253
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,569
My friend?

254
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,447
Just a friend.

255
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,866
We can meet together later.

256
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,202
Oh, what time is it?

257
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:57,501
Let's sleep. It's late.
You should sleep now too.

258
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:56,685
-What is it at this hour?
-What? Well...

259
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,980
What...

260
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,481
CARD PAYMENT
CHICKEN 21,000 WON

261
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,318
My goodness. This is a lot. Wow.

262
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,322
My gosh. They're my juniors.

263
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:14,619
I gave them my card to use
when they're on the night shift. But...

264
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,289
My gosh.

265
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,797
I guess they were really hungry.

266
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:27,632
They're ordering a lot.

267
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,760
Thank you.

268
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,143
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

269
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,813
Oh, it's the pizza. Over here!

270
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,492
This is so awesome.

271
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,745
It has been so long.

272
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,582
What should I eat first?
What should I eat?

273
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,767
It's hot.

274
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:03,562
Beer. Yes, beer.

275
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:06,147
My babies. My beer.

276
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:08,567
You've been hiding here.

277
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,004
That hit the spot.

278
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:35,135
If I go to sleep, I'd be wasting a day.
There's no time to sleep.

279
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,555
MY MISTER

280
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:41,766
It's starting.

281
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,774
HER WATERY KIMCHI

282
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,366
Why? Does it taste a bit too familiar?

283
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,160
How did you...

284
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,002
-At the ER and the restaurant
-What?

285
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,503
-Who did it?
-Let's watch the news.

286
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:11,546
-Damn it.
-Shall we?

287
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,506
She just splashed
the watery kimchi over him.

288
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,717
Put it back on.
Come on, switch the channel.

289
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:20,138
Hey. Since when did you watch the news?
You're a sucker for dramas!

290
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:24,059
You guys are unbelievable!
Come on, put it back on. Please?

291
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,935
She's about to slap him.

292
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,139
This is good.

293
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,308
Darn it...

294
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:08,645
Come on.

295
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,981
Being a ghost really sucks.

296
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,375
Look at that.

297
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:55,108
BEAUTIFULLY COOKED FRIED CHICKEN FLOATS UP

298
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,192
BEST LATE-NIGHT SNACK

299
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,403
Doesn't that look delicious?

300
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,782
Of course, it does.
It's none other than fried chicken.

301
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,119
Even shoes would taste good
if they were fried.

302
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,790
Knowing its taste can be more torturous.
It'd hurt less if I didn't know.

303
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,543
If I could go back in time,

304
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:17,172
I wouldn't leave any fried chicken behind.
I left some the day before I died.

305
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,132
If you could, don't kill yourself.

306
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,468
Will you kill yourself after eating that?

307
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,806
I mean, times have changed.

308
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,601
But they still serve the same food
at the memorial ceremony.

309
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,103
They should at least change
the menu every year.

310
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,064
They've been serving the same food
for 54 years!

311
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,442
Am I in Oldboy or something?

312
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,027
Mi-ja.

313
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,030
Yes, sir.

314
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,032
Do you need something?

315
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,911
How dare you raise your voice?
That's no way for a woman to behave.

316
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:52,707
I am sorry, sir. We should go inside now.

317
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,168
Unbelievable.

318
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,712
What about his son?

319
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:59,964
Why does he always bother
his daughter-in-law?

320
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,800
He bothers her even when he's dead.

321
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:05,386
Exactly. Who is that family lot
really for? That awful man.

322
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,273
By the way, given how I haven't seen Yu-ri
for the past few days,

323
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:20,610
something must have happened to her.
Has anyone seen her lately?

324
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,987
Not me. You?

325
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,989
Me, neither.

326
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,367
I haven't seen her.

327
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,869
Have you seen her?

328
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,956
I saw. See what? What did I see?

329
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,041
-No.
-I haven't seen her.

330
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,677
For 49 days?

331
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,348
Now, I have 47 days.

332
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:53,518
I told you that
you shouldn't stay next to a child.

333
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,982
Well, children have weak energy.

334
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:04,028
I should take care of him first.
I must handle him.

335
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,239
I don't have time for this.

336
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,164
I turned in a report on you.
So get treated.

337
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:20,420
Look. A surgeon is unable to enter the OR
because he's claustrophobic.

338
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,672
Do you think that is acceptable?

339
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,009
The disciplinary committee
is in a meeting!

340
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,010
Disciplinary committee?

341
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,472
Don't be anxious. It doesn't suit you.

342
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,016
That's cute.

343
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,060
I'll try to get you off with a warning.

344
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,691
What are you doing?
Are you going to resign?

345
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,818
I can't see patients then, right?
I'm off now.

346
00:31:46,029 --> 00:31:47,655
Hey, Gang-hwa. Hey!

347
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,366
Sir, he must be insane.

348
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,161
Gang-hwa.

349
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,625
Right. I shouldn't handle this by myself.

350
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,294
I should explain this
to my mother-in-law first. Then--

351
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,172
Have you gone mad?
Or are you trying to go crazy?

352
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,633
This isn't like you.
Where are you going right now?

353
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:07,800
You won't believe me.

354
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:10,136
I confided in your wife,
she almost beat me up.

355
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:12,639
She beats me up for breathing. Talk to me.

356
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,849
Talk to me.
We'll see if I believe you or not.

357
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:17,226
Will you believe me? I doubt you will.

358
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,395
I'll try to believe you.
Tell me. Go ahead.

359
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,772
Yu-ri came back to life.

360
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,567
-What?
-Yu-ri came back to life.

361
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,820
I see.

362
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,864
My gosh.

363
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,284
-Gang-hwa, come here.
-I knew you wouldn't believe me.

364
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,787
Leave me alone.
Take photos for your online posts.

365
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,789
You come back here.

366
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:41,125
Hey! You must be out of your mind.

367
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:47,048
We'll never figure out
how she became a human again on our own.

368
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,508
We must find and ask her.

369
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:50,051
Where could we find her?

370
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,720
There are only so many places she can go.
We'll easily find her.

371
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:57,475
By the way, why did you not want
to tell the others at the cinerarium?

372
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,436
It would be easier if everyone helped
to find her, wouldn't it?

373
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,521
Listen to yourself.

374
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,065
Then,
she'll have every ghost following her.

375
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,401
What if they ask her a bunch of favors?

376
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,403
Do you think
she will have time to help us?

377
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,322
Right. My gosh,
you really thought this through.

378
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,993
You're right. She can see
both ghosts and humans.

379
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,790
There he is.

380
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:30,008
My son, what did you do
in that room all night?

381
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,551
Gosh, you lost weight overnight.

382
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,429
Isn't it obvious?
He went inside with a woman.

383
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:38,307
I doubt they just talked.
I'm sure they shared more than just words.

384
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,601
You little punk.

385
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,272
They had a meeting.
They were very focused on their meeting.

386
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,024
-What's up? Are you sick?
-What is it?

387
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:46,983
-What's wrong?
-What?

388
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,943
-Don't work too hard.
-What's wrong?

389
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,778
-Hey.
-Are you sick?

390
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,406
-You tend to focus too much on meetings!
-Are you?

391
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,230
There are ghosts all over this place.

392
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:28,775
I didn't get this before,
but I get it now.

393
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:31,152
-Do something.
-What? He must handle it himself.

394
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,488
What can we do? Just wait.

395
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,656
-Mom.
-Let's go.

396
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,699
Damn it.

397
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:39,786
Did they put a GPS tracker on me?
They are everywhere I go!

398
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,037
Yu-ri.

399
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,624
I know you can see us. Please?

400
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,334
-When was my appointment?
-Help us.

401
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:51,047
Yu-ri, please help us.
We are at the same cinerarium. Yu-ri.

402
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,887
My poor son, Pil-seung.

403
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,388
Honey, don't cry.

404
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,391
-Please? Don't cry.
-Pil-seung.

405
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,268
-He can handle it himself.
-Oh, no. Poor baby.

406
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,978
-Pil-seung.
-Oh, no.

407
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,151
Are you sure no one is inside?

408
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,278
-I'm going in.
-Okay.

409
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,364
-Go.
-Go, go.

410
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,702
No, I can't do that.

411
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,498
Damn it. I can't believe this.

412
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:31,916
Wipe it well!

413
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:34,835
Thoroughly.

414
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:41,634
Clean it well!

415
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,226
Thank you. I was just so worried.

416
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,187
My gosh. He's a grown man.
You don't need to worry about him.

417
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,857
He might be a grown man,
but he still can't take care of it well.

418
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,402
Right. That's hard for me too.

419
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,503
Hello. Why isn't anyone

420
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,088
in Room 554?

421
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,423
She left earlier.

422
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:23,217
She left? Did you say she left? Why?

423
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,220
I mean, when did she leave?

424
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,849
It's not like she disappeared
all of a sudden, right?

425
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:34,437
She didn't vanish into thin air
before your eyes, right?

426
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,105
She left the room key with us.

427
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,025
And she walked out that door.

428
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:42,778
She walked out.

429
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,405
I see.

430
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,907
I'm sorry. Thank you.

431
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:51,287
I told her to stay in the room.
Where did she go?

432
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:57,626
Judged?

433
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:00,838
You came back to life because
you're facing the 49-day judgment here?

434
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,507
Why? Why only you?

435
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,596
You jerk!

436
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,685
-She's gone mad.
-I would've gone to hell for saying that.

437
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:16,687
Right. Why did He let you live?

438
00:39:16,771 --> 00:39:20,441
She needs to find her rightful place
in 49 days. She'll live then.

439
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,567
Right.

440
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,613
Damn it. Good for you.
You should find your place right now.

441
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,656
Her husband remarried.

442
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,201
Do you think she'd just swoop in
and take her place?

443
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,661
Right, your husband remarried.

444
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,707
When you first came to the cinerarium,
he came every day and cried his eyes out.

445
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:40,461
He looked so loyal.
But who knew he'd remarry that fast?

446
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,213
He stopped coming at once.

447
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:44,423
Why are you bringing it up?
It's a long time ago.

448
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,426
Then, does it mean you're a human
for these 49 days?

449
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,054
Yes, I can go up only after the 49 days.

450
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,227
Then, do us a favor.

451
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,146
We won't tell the others
that you became a human.

452
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,648
No.

453
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,735
I already have a lot on my plate,
trying to turn Seo-woo back to normal.

454
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:08,072
If I start doing favors for ghosts,
I'll waste all of my time. No.

455
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,658
You forgot I just helped you
are asking me for another favor.

456
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
No way. Never!

457
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,370
Come on, that was an urgent matter!

458
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:16,705
She's right. Do us a favor!

459
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,375
We'll tell every ghost
that you can see ghosts!

460
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:20,793
What?

461
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:24,463
No!

462
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,677
I have something to tell my daughter.

463
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,262
I hid some money in the cabinet.

464
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,264
-But my son used all of it.
-Tell my wife

465
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:35,599
-it's in the fridge.
-You know what he did?

466
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,268
-Please help me.
-Just one favor.

467
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,478
-No. I can't hear anything.
-Just this once.

468
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:42,356
-Please help me.
-Move out of the way.

469
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:45,609
-Do me this one favor!
-I really need to tell him that.

470
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:10,759
Oh, no.

471
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:29,528
My gosh.

472
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,867
Please keep my family healthy.

473
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,077
Please help us.

474
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,204
Great!

475
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,040
-I'm begging you.
-Great.

476
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,960
Keep them safe! Accept our prayer!

477
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:48,506
Have mercy on them!

478
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,424
Have mercy on them!

479
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,845
Oh, my. Don't you think she's getting
better at performing as time passes?

480
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,056
She'll be able to stand
on a straw cutter soon.

481
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:02,019
Goodness. Be quiet
if you want to get some food from her.

482
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,522
-Excuse me.
-Don't talk to me.

483
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,773
I'm not into you.

484
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,694
By the way, are you really gay?

485
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,404
We're really curious.

486
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,657
Gosh, I'm about to starve to death!

487
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,867
Stop that nonsense
and take out your bells!

488
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,789
You're begging for food here.
Don't be grumpy.

489
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,042
She's performing the ritual.
Her customer must get her money's worth.

490
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,879
My goodness, there are
so many mischievous spirits here.

491
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,131
Oh, my.

492
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,218
I should just send all of you up.

493
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,262
Yeah, right, Ms. Mi-dong.

494
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,891
I know you're a softy inside.
You can't even send an ant up.

495
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:45,104
By the way, what is Yu-ri up to?
Where on earth is she?

496
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:46,438
She's missing the ritual.

497
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,315
I haven't seen her for a few days.

498
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,025
Did something happen?

499
00:42:50,109 --> 00:42:51,318
Should I go look for her?

500
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,113
Why would you? She's probably
roaming around here and there.

501
00:43:18,053 --> 00:43:19,680
-Where are you going?
-Stop!

502
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,893
-Hey!
-Miss!

503
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,645
Wait for me!

504
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,153
-Where did she go?
-Come on!

505
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:49,043
This is what Ms. Mi-dong meant
when she said it'd be exhausting.

506
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:56,383
I totally understand how you're feeling.
But I already have so much on my plate.

507
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,492
This one. And that. Give me two of these.

508
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,337
My goodness.

509
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,506
Oh, my knees.

510
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,153
Where could she go?

511
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,616
HEALTH SUPPLEMENTS:
71,000 WON, PAID IN FULL

512
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,870
Health supplements?

513
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,138
Yes. Both my parents are here, Gang-hwa.

514
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:11,018
There's nothing new around the house.
It's all the same.

515
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,561
What? The calming pill?

516
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,606
Make them take one.
Just trust me and do it.

517
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,233
And you should take one too. Right?

518
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:20,694
I'm warning you.
Something crazy is about to happen.

519
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,781
I need you to stay calm.
Okay? I'll be there soon.

520
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:32,748
Take it.

521
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,334
-What?
-Why did you take this out?

522
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,586
Take it. And I should take it too.

523
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,757
What are you talking about?
Did you have a dream?

524
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:45,844
Get that out of my face.

525
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,222
Gang-hwa told me to give this to you.

526
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,182
He said we should take it
and wait for him.

527
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,017
You brat.

528
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,270
I told you not to stay in touch
with Gang-hwa.

529
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,356
He's doing well now.
Don't drag him to our lives.

530
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,816
I didn't drag him here.

531
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:02,069
He was the one who called me first.
He said it was urgent.

532
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:05,322
Call him back. Why is he coming here?

533
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:08,283
He'd better not come.
Or I'll give you a good beating.

534
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:13,789
He said he was coming!
What can I do about that?

535
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,210
She's driving me nuts.

536
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,217
Is he coming alone?
Will he not bring Seo-woo?

537
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,718
I don't know.

538
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:28,846
But something is off.

539
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,307
He kept asking if something had happened
with us, as if something had.

540
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,520
Here.

541
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,485
I won't take it.

542
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,238
Seriously? You touched it.

543
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,080
Coming!

544
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,628
Gang-hwa.

545
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:05,215
Yeon-ji.

546
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,301
Everything's okay?

547
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,305
It looks like something happened to you.

548
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:14,558
Did you guys have a visitor? It's...

549
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,184
-"It's"?
-It's...

550
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,316
What? What is this?

551
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,068
Did you buy this?

552
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,029
SUPPLEMENTS FOR KNEES

553
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,823
How did you know
that my mom has bad knees?

554
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:34,036
Gang-hwa, don't buy stuff like this.
My mom will seriously kill me.

555
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:38,790
So who's coming?
You said someone was coming.

556
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:40,626
I guess she already did.

557
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,464
Who?

558
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,258
Well...

559
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,761
Later.

560
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:53,722
I don't think you should hear it from me.

561
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:56,725
It's cold outside. Go inside. Bye.

562
00:48:56,975 --> 00:49:00,020
Gang-hwa, who's coming to visit us?

563
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:01,688
Gang-hwa!

564
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:04,358
What was that?

565
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,570
Damn it. This won't be pretty.

566
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,798
It ended.

567
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:34,304
I hope he didn't follow Seo-woo home.

568
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:45,565
Hey.

569
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,401
Come here.

570
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,074
It's all right. Come here.

571
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,244
Come here.

572
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,833
You're happy that I can see you,
aren't you?

573
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,420
What's your name?

574
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:10,966
Did you come here because you wanted
to play with your friends? But you can't.

575
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:14,011
If you stay here,
you might hurt my daughter.

576
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,888
Actually, you might hurt everyone here.

577
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,307
Why don't we go somewhere else and play?

578
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,184
Come here.

579
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:24,354
Excuse me.

580
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,148
Who are you?

581
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:31,862
Didn't you pick Seo-woo up yesterday?
You're her dad's friend, right?

582
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,572
Pardon?

583
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:37,075
You should have told me so
if you were his friend.

584
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,202
I thought you were a pick-up helper.

585
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,582
I know I should've confirmed it with you
no matter how busy I was, but...

586
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:47,794
Where are you going?

587
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:49,755
-Hey, kid.
-Pardon?

588
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,465
Who?

589
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,967
He can't go inside.

590
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,103
Are you looking to hire
a kitchen assistant?

591
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:10,942
We can't serve hot beverages here.
It's iced coffee. Is that okay?

592
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:11,985
Sure.

593
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:15,530
But the meeting with the parents
is taking longer than expected.

594
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,658
So the director will be late.
Is that really okay with you?

595
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,786
She can interview you tomorrow.

596
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:24,206
That's all right. Waiting is my hobby.

597
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,458
I can just sit here.
What's so hard about that?

598
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,668
Okay, then.

599
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,760
-The meeting must go well today.
-Okay. Just trust me.

600
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,637
It's not that I don't trust you.

601
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,722
-I'm just worried.
-Just trust me on this.

602
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,101
-You're here, ma'am.
-Hello.

603
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,019
-Hello, hello.
-This way, please.

604
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,069
-Hello.
-Hello, Director.

605
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:58,281
I definitely saw him come in here.

606
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,120
It's about Seo-woo.

607
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,707
I'm sorry to say this,
but it's getting scary.

608
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:09,292
This wasn't her first time.

609
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:12,629
I heard she gets kind of gloomy
and talks to herself in a corner.

610
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:17,342
We understand your concern, ma'am.
We've been keeping our eyes on her too.

611
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,845
And we plan on sharing this
with her mother soon.

612
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:23,807
Goodness, there's just no talking to her.
She won't even budge.

613
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,642
Why do you think we came to talk to you?

614
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,019
She said she'll manage
and that it's none of our business.

615
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,771
It's not like we want to be concerned.

616
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,440
Of course,
Seo-woo didn't do anything wrong,

617
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:34,818
but still,
my kids come to this kindergarten.

618
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,904
It feels kind of icky with this.

619
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,824
We're bringing this up
for our children's sake.

620
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,244
I knew it would be those mothers.
Darn them.

621
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,705
Why are they acting so immature
over a child?

622
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:50,458
There's nothing wrong with my Seo-woo.
"Icky"?

623
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:56,965
Seo-woo.

624
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:03,680
Ma'am, Seo-woo hasn't gone home yet.
Could you please lower your voice?

625
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,184
See? I knew it.
She's always the last to go home.

626
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:10,103
-How can she be okay if she's overlooked?
-Seo-woo, let's play over there.

627
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:13,481
I told you that I think
she probably married him for money.

628
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,150
He's a doctor at a university hospital.

629
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,569
She'd get a fortune if she got half
of his assets as alimony.

630
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,237
KO SEOK-WON LAW OFFICE

631
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,406
Yes, this is Ko Seok-won's law office.

632
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:27,204
KO SEOK-WON LAW OFFICE,
DIVORCE, CUSTODY, INHERITANCE

633
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,415
There aren't any grounds for divorce.
He's not liable for anything.

634
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,315
-Min-jeong.
-Hey.

635
00:53:56,399 --> 00:54:00,278
You must be worried about your husband.
Are you all right?

636
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:04,074
My husband? No, I was just passing by.
I came in to see you.

637
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,743
Why? Is something going on?

638
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,081
Min-jeong... You haven't heard?

639
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:19,506
Everything hit the fan today.
I thought you came because of that.

640
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:23,802
He cut open a patient's belly,
but couldn't operate, so he just left.

641
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,763
He'll be referred
to a disciplinary committee.

642
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,932
He might even get fired.

643
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,560
JW LAW FIRM, DIVORCE ATTORNEY

644
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:11,391
This is the only place she could be.

645
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,838
I'm sorry. Mommy is sorry.

646
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,426
Mommy is so sorry.

647
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,762
I'm so sorry, Seo-woo.

648
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,972
Please stop crying.

649
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,099
Mommy is sorry.

650
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,476
-Gang-hwa.
-Yes?

651
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,063
What is it? Do you have something to say?

652
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:00,940
I'm sorry about earlier.

653
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:03,234
About taking Seo-woo.

654
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,416
I'll pick up Seo-woo today.

655
00:58:23,625 --> 00:58:24,876
Wait, no.

656
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:28,671
-Hello?
-No, it's okay.

657
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:30,340
It's okay, Min-jeong. I'll go.

658
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,300
You're at the hospital.
How can you do that?

659
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:36,346
No, I'm not at the hospital.
I've been dismissed as a punishment.

660
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,764
So...

661
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:39,933
Never mind, I don't mean
that I was punished.

662
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:45,104
Anyway, something like that has happened,
so you can go home for now.

663
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:48,191
I'm almost at the kindergarten.
See you at home.

664
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:49,984
Hello?

665
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,778
Hey...

666
00:58:57,992 --> 00:59:00,119
I found this in your study.

667
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,454
What?

668
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,418
Right.

669
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:09,754
Why was it there?

670
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,507
It's okay. I guess it fell off
from one of your old books.

671
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,968
-You probably didn't know either.
-Right.

672
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:25,436
Anyway, it's Yu-ri, isn't it?

673
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:27,605
Seo-woo's mother.

674
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,399
Yu-ri.

675
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:31,609
Yu-ri is...

676
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:35,113
This can't happen. What do I do?

677
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:50,628
You're nothing but a darling, Seo-woo.
Those adults are fools.

678
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:57,885
Seo-woo, I'll make sure
you won't have to see things like those.

679
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,220
I'll do that.

680
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,685
Anyway, where did he go?

681
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,368
No.

682
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:25,079
You were great today.

683
01:00:25,163 --> 01:00:27,457
-I told you I can be good.
-What has gotten into you?

684
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,250
Anyway, who's that other woman?

685
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,877
No idea. A new teacher, probably.

686
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,338
-She's really pretty.
-You and your lookism.

687
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:36,174
-My goodness!
-Seo-woo is in there.

688
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,181
Wow, that brat.

689
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,725
-Put-off.
-She's so cool.

690
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:47,685
Hey.

691
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:49,604
-Stop that.
-What's with you?

692
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,397
I knew you were too good today.

693
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,447
Hello, I'm Sella.

694
01:00:59,614 --> 01:01:00,615
Hello.

695
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,700
Do you want to take a picture?

696
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,671
No...

697
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,497
Seo-woo, where are you going?

698
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,583
Hello, Ms. Oh.

699
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,710
Hello.

700
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,175
-Don't run, Seo-woo. You'll fall.
-Seo-woo.

701
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,083
Gang-hwa.

702
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:35,960
Hey.

703
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,963
Hello.

704
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:35,019
You never miss a year.

705
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,898
Of course, it's her birthday after all.

706
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,067
She can't take my present,

707
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,071
but I can't let her be lonely.
My dear Yu-ri.

01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,871
My daughter.

711
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:04,043
My beloved daughter.

712
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,255
Are you listening to me?

713
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:29,944
Yes, I love you too.

714
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:32,822
Mom, are you listening to me too?

715
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:53,926
Perhaps the most beautiful thing
we can feel in our lives

716
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,805
is telling someone we love
that we love them

717
01:06:58,055 --> 01:07:02,309
and thanking someone
who we're grateful for.

SISTER'S GRILLED EEL

721
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,936
Who leaves...

722
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:51,150
snacks for drinks in front of a bar?

723
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:54,737
Thank you.

724
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:58,699
Thanks for the food!

725
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,538
I realized that it's a great joy to give

726
01:08:04,997 --> 01:08:08,250
and that you end up feeling sorry
if you always receive.

727
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:13,506
I came to this realization after my death
through the people I love.

728
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:22,181
She looks a lot like Yu-ri.
Did you do something wrong?

729
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,308
Seo-woo's mom came back to life.

730
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,435
What is this nonsense?

731
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,479
What's going on?

732
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,231
-It's a ghost!
-A ghost?

733
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,649
I'm going to rip your mouth.

734
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:33,275
When will you get your place back?

735
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,362
If I get a job there,
I can chase away all the ghosts

736
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,072
and see Seo-woo every single day.

737
01:08:38,155 --> 01:08:40,324
We have no time to see the kids.

738
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:43,494
You don't have much time left.
You only have 46 days.

739
01:08:43,577 --> 01:08:46,413
It all happened because of me.
I'll have to resolve it.
