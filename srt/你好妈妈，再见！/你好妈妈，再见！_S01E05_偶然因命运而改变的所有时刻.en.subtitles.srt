1
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,568
This stop is Dongsung University.

2
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,196
You may exit on your right.

3
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:30,715
Your bag...

4
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,009
Wait! Excuse me!

5
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,517
Hey, what are you guys doing there?

6
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:44,687
-Min-jeong.
-Hey.

7
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:46,689
Whose is that?

8
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,150
I picked it up on the subway.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,028
Should I have left it at the station?

10
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:55,073
Hey, Cho Gang-hwa.

11
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,576
-Hello, Professor!
-Is that all you have to say?

12
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,412
Don't you have something for me?

13
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,998
What? What should I give you?

14
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:10,547
Bullets of love! Bang, bang!

15
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,259
-You little punk. Unbelievable.
-I'm sorry.

16
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,011
Do you want to fail this semester?

17
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,222
You still didn't hand in the report.

18
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,183
Oh, my report. I brought it, of course.

19
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,521
My bag!

20
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,901
My goodness. You're a med school student.
Aren't you supposed to be smart?

21
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,404
Did you lose your brain after
the entrance exam?

22
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,323
No, I'm sure I brought my bag
when I left home today.

23
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,616
That's strange. Where is it?

24
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,454
My bag...

25
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,056
There are some moments

26
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,851
when a small coincidence you experience

27
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:09,063
grows into a huge thing called fate.

28
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,525
You're really going to tell him
you like him?

29
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:17,614
He's known as the med school idiot.
He even wore mismatched shoes last time.

30
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,240
That's his charm.

31
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:22,911
You know,
real geniuses are actually idiots.

32
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,705
You're ridiculous.
He just seems like a real idiot.

33
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,498
He's not a genius at all.

34
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:36,257
Even this idiot got a girlfriend.
Why don't we have girlfriends?

35
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,302
That's what I mean. Are you happy?

36
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,387
Did you say her name was Cha Yu-ri?
Is she pretty?

37
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,889
Let go of me.

38
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:46,851
Don't be so old-fashioned. You shouldn't
judge women based on their looks.

39
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,979
Looks aren't important.
The heart is what matters.

40
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,857
-But she's really pretty.
-Back then, I thought

41
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,985
that kind of fate could change back

42
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,154
into a small coincidence.

43
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,865
-This jerk...
-My gosh!

44
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:33,022
CHA YU-RI, CHO GANG-HWA

45
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:45,660
EPISODE 5: EVERY MOMENT
WHEN CHANCE TURNS INTO FATE

46
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:56,421
Wow, 3,000 won for two radishes...

47
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:59,966
It's scary to even buy food to eat.

48
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,576
Yu-ri...

49
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:35,585
Yu-ri...

50
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,295
Yu-ri...

51
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,299
SISTER'S GRILLED EEL

52
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,926
Who leaves...

53
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:45,845
NEW NOTIFICATION

54
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,221
CHA YU-RI LIKES YOUR POST

55
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,308
Listen. Don't get too startled.

56
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,812
Yu-ri...

57
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,816
has come back to life.

58
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:14,499
I have to call Hyeon-jeong.

59
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,377
Geun-sang, calm down.

60
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,798
There are no such things as ghosts.

61
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,466
Geun-sang.

62
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,010
Ghosts don't exist.

63
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,472
There is no such thing.

64
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,016
But there is! She's right there!

65
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,559
There is a ghost!

66
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,563
Hyeon-jeong.

67
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,190
Hyeon-jeong.

68
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,819
Do you know what I just saw?

69
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:43,736
Yu-ri.

70
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,238
It was Yu-ri.

71
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,240
Yu-ri!

72
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:49,492
It's Yu-ri!

73
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,745
Yu-ri! Behind you, Hyeon-jeong!

74
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,206
Behind you...

75
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:59,085
No, don't wave at me.
Hyeon-jeong, she's waving...

76
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,878
Why is she waving at me?

77
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,464
I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!

78
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,341
I'm sorry!

79
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,173
I missed you.

80
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,514
Hyeon-jeong...

81
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,146
Hyeon-jeong...

82
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,752
PEOPLE COMING BACK FROM THE DEAD

83
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:27,340
Dead...

84
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,969
MY FRIEND CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD!

85
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,722
There are cases like this!

86
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:40,645
Did you click this, you idiot?
You really believed it?

87
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:44,398
Damn it! You little jerk.

88
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,193
I should report jerks like this.

89
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,490
Is this for real?

90
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:54,534
All the ridiculous things you said
are true?

91
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,327
What?

92
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,081
How did he find out?

93
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:10,716
Dr. Jang told you to wait!
Where are you going?

94
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,468
-Tell him I couldn't wait.
-What?

95
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,430
Tell him I was waiting for him
desperately. Fist bump? Okay, never mind.

96
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,353
What's gotten into him these days?
He doesn't get how serious this is.

97
00:09:22,436 --> 00:09:25,356
Right. He's doing anything he wants
when he's been disciplined.

98
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,109
Seeing him just makes me
pity Dr. Jang now.

99
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,777
He's coming. What do we say?

100
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,464
-Bathroom?
-Well...

101
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,633
He left.

102
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,051
He left?

103
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:02,852
Oh, no! Dr. Jang!

104
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,103
-Oh, my gosh!
-Dr. Jang!

105
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,423
That hurt.

106
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,760
Is this...

107
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,554
Is this even possible?

108
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,478
-Where was your honeymoon?
-Okinawa.

109
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,355
-You got scammed--
-Germanium bracelets.

110
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,231
Right. She's right.

111
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,027
-It really is her.
-You really can't remember anything?

112
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,077
No.

113
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,704
No way.

114
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,791
My aunt definitely said people
become ghosts when they die.

115
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,502
Ghosts? Don't be ridiculous.

116
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,379
I've never even seen ghosts.

117
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,465
So what are you going to do now?

118
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:17,802
What?

119
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:19,220
Well...

120
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,848
What do you think we should do?

121
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,937
Sorry, I...

122
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,357
Your mother.
Let's go to your mother's house first.

123
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,317
-Your mother...
-No, I can't.

124
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,276
What?

125
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,321
I mean...

126
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,241
My mom has a weak heart, and...

127
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,535
Anyway, not right now.

128
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,454
Don't ever tell her about this
if you run into her, okay?

129
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:48,165
-You too, okay?
-What? All right.

130
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,086
Then stay at our house.
Why stay at a hotel?

131
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,714
Go check out her room
and get her stuff here.

132
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,174
Will you do that, Hyeon-jeong?
I'd really be grateful.

133
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,343
Don't do that, you guys.

134
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,267
Just for two months.

135
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,185
No, just 49 days.

136
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,646
Just leave me be for 49 days.

137
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:16,068
And after that, I'll decide
whether to go to my mom or whatever.

138
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,321
-So just don't do anything right now.
-But it'll be better to stay--

139
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,866
I was hiding because I thought
you'd worry like this.

140
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,037
You really don't need to worry,
Hyeon-jeong.

141
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,334
Do whatever you want.

142
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,676
I'm glad you're back.

143
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:43,679
I'm glad.

144
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,228
I'm so glad.

145
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,317
I'm so glad you're back, Yu-ri.

146
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,404
Thank you.

147
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,543
I thought you'd gone mad
over the last few days.

148
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,546
I'm amazed that you are so calm.

149
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,632
It'll be crazy not to go mad
in this situation.

150
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,053
What should I do now?

151
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,222
Don't ask me. I don't know, either.

152
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,517
Nobody in Korea would know.
Nobody in this world would know.

153
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,894
A situation like this
can't even be imagined.

154
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,354
This is just...

155
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,443
Hey, what about Min-jeong?
Does she know about this?

156
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,029
-She saw her.
-What?

157
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,489
Did you introduce them?

158
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,242
"This is my wife,
and this is my dead wife."

159
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,326
Don't be ridiculous.

160
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,747
They ran into each other
at the kindergarten.

161
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:55,251
Min-jeong just thought she looked
like Yu-ri. She only saw her photos.

162
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,337
Right. She wouldn't believe it
even if you told her.

163
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,590
Wait. But still, don't you think
you should tell her?

164
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,008
So what if I tell her?

165
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,636
What do I say if she asks
what I'm going to do about it?

166
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,304
What do I tell her?

167
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:13,227
That would just be overwhelming her
to make the decision that I should make.

168
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,562
I guess you're right.

169
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,815
No need for both of you to go mad
when it can stop with one.

170
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:22,486
Anyway, just listen to Yu-ri
and don't do anything for now.

171
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:25,072
To be honest,
there's nothing you can really do.

172
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:29,618
And Yu-ri asked us to wait
for 49 days, didn't she?

173
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,413
Let's just watch how things go for now.

174
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,001
This should be good news,

175
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:41,422
but why do I feel that something's wrong?
I feel guilty.

176
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,771
Thank you...

177
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,944
Yu-ri...

178
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,821
They're still crying.

179
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,743
Yu-ri...

180
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,419
Are you feeling okay?

181
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,345
Hyeon-jeong really cried a lot.

182
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,555
She must be really glad.

183
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,768
Hyeon-jeong missed me so much.
She cried every day.

184
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,603
She did.

185
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,065
What? How did you know that?

186
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,073
Well, I saw my social media.

187
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:53,035
She wrote a lot of posts on mine,
saying she missed me.

188
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,120
I can imagine how she was.

189
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,000
It's a relief.

190
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:03,837
At least she's glad.

191
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:06,090
I feel grateful.

192
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,769
Mommy is sorry.

193
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,694
I just collapsed with shock

194
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,488
instead of showing happiness
at seeing you.

195
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,166
Yes?

196
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,003
No, everything is fine.

197
00:16:47,214 --> 00:16:48,215
Yes?

198
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,884
Yes, it's working fine.

199
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,761
Here.

200
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:58,517
Were there problems in the other rooms
last night?

201
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,978
-You kept calling my room.
-Oh, that?

202
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:03,188
Actually...

203
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:05,649
Do you have any problems with your room?

204
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,278
All right, thank you.

205
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,781
She answered. She's in her room.

206
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,825
All right. Thank you.

207
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,078
Can you check just one more time?

208
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,039
You checked two hours ago.

209
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,958
-We haven't seen her leave.
-Just once more.

210
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,919
It's not about
her leaving the room, it's...

211
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,588
How should I explain it?

212
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,507
I'm worried she might disappear...

213
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,426
I mean... Please, just once more.

214
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:36,430
All right. I'll call her.

215
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,184
Is the hot water coming out?

216
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,645
Actually, the man who checked in

217
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,482
kept asking me to check.

218
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,569
He said he was worried
you might disappear.

219
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:57,701
You idiot.

220
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,918
Just let me off over there.

221
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,628
What?

222
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,852
I think she's hiding something.

223
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:29,191
Why isn't she going to her parents' house?
They may faint, but it's from happiness.

224
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:34,446
She asked us to give her 49 days
to think over things.

225
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,949
Hyeon-jeong, that's the weirdest part.

226
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,661
It's either one month or two.
What's with the 49 days? It seems ominous.

227
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,623
Will she disappear again after 49 days?

228
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,417
-Hey.
-But it makes sense.

229
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:50,420
She showed up all of a sudden,
she could disappear all of a sudden.

230
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:04,226
My gosh, you didn't have to.
You should just eat them yourself.

231
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,687
What is it?

232
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,689
I got it from Jeongdongjin.

233
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:11,984
They're wild seaweed, so it'll taste great
if you make seaweed soup.

234
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,614
Is that so? Thank you, I'll enjoy it.

235
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:18,782
All right, bye.

236
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,751
What did she give you?

237
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,922
What is it?

238
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,519
Mom?

239
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,774
What is it? Why is she acting like that?

240
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:05,787
My gosh.

241
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,624
Not again...

242
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,473
PRESS TO START

243
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,400
STOCK INVESTMENT

244
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:41,967
Do-yeon?

245
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,428
You haven't finished filling this out.

246
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,888
-Oh, the kitchen assistant interview?
-Yes.

247
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:49,683
Ms. Oh.

248
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,772
I'll get going.

249
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,774
-Oh, you're leaving?
-Yes.

250
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,450
-Thank you for your work.
-No problem.

251
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:10,412
There's nothing to clean,
even if I only come once a week.

252
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,081
Other houses are a total mess.

253
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,458
The husband makes a mess,

254
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:16,918
and the wife follows him around,
cleaning up after him.

255
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,838
-My goodness.
-I guess other families are like that.

256
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:22,716
That's right.
There aren't many husbands like yours.

257
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,469
He puts stuff back in their place
without you having to nag.

258
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,887
There's nothing much to do.

259
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:30,057
But sometimes you feel sad
if there's nothing to clean up after.

260
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,101
-Bye, then.
-Bye.

261
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,622
Are you leaving?
Do you want to eat something?

262
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,832
No, it's fine.

263
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,419
This is enough for me.
No need to make a fuss preparing food.

264
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,468
The photo of Seo-woo's mom...

265
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,434
The photo? What about it?

266
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,730
It disappeared, so I was curious.

267
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,857
Well...

268
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,153
I just...

269
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:27,864
The photo...

270
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,200
No, there's nothing to explain.
I was just saying.

271
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,453
I got curious,
so I thought I'd take a look at it.

272
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:36,123
They said it's going to snow tonight.

273
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,628
Oh, I got an umbrella.

274
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,464
Bye, then.

275
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,468
Bye, Seo-woo.

276
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,815
Seo-woo, shall we go
to the kindergarten now?

277
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:03,066
Okay.

278
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,094
What are all these, Seo-woo?

279
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,642
Hello.

280
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,564
RED BEANS

281
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:44,900
It hurts. Why are you hurting me?

282
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,034
It hurts! Wait! It stings. Hold on!

283
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,246
It hurts so much! No!

284
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,256
Who on earth are you?
Why are you doing this to us?

285
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,884
-How can she see us though?
-I guess she's a shaman.

286
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,886
Of course.
I can see you because I'm a shaman.

287
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,137
Let's cut to the chase.

288
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:17,140
Starting today, no ghosts are allowed
inside that kindergarten.

289
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,769
All of you are old enough
to understand what I'm saying, right?

290
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,312
Leave when I ask nicely.

291
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,023
You can't kick out ghosts!

292
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,192
This was my spot
long before you came along.

293
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,860
I won't leave! Suit yourself!

294
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,153
Hey, hey.

295
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,740
You know, I believe in communicating
whether it's people or ghosts.

296
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:35,909
I don't use violence or anything
to sort out problems.

297
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,704
And these don't hurt at all.
They don't, right?

298
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:42,165
They don't hurt at all. Isn't that true?

299
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,447
Damn it. She is a shaman.

300
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:16,491
-Let go of me.
-Gosh, what is this?

301
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,159
-Let me go.
-I was doing fine as a ghost.

302
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,621
-Why are you torturing me?
-Okay. I'll leave. I'll leave this place.

303
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:22,747
-Really?
-Yes.

304
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:26,418
You should have complied from the get-go.
We just ended up wasting our energy.

305
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,006
Damn it.

306
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,174
Damn you!

307
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,678
Go far away from here. Go far away. Go!

308
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,931
Goodbye! Don't come back!
Never come back here!

309
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:51,234
Goodness, you're quite strange.

310
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:54,029
You made a huge mess
in the kitchen yesterday.

311
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:57,741
Why do you keep scattering the red beans
that the kids use to play games with?

312
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,786
I was going to use it just for a bit.

313
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:05,165
Oh, yes. Kids were supposed to feel these
and play games with them. Right?

314
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,208
I'll go and buy another bag right now.

315
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,501
I'm sorry.

316
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,758
She seems to be in a good mood.

317
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,178
RED BEANS

318
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:22,182
Should I have bought some more?
I should put some in Seo-woo's bag too.

319
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:24,851
This will do.

320
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,605
DOLLS

321
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,939
Pink.

322
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:32,859
Seo-woo loves those.

323
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,536
What?

324
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,954
What was that?

325
00:28:39,175 --> 00:28:41,803
I haven't warmed up my fingers yet.

326
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,816
Why can't I get one?

327
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:00,488
This is so annoying.

328
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:02,490
Come on.

329
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,220
Hey.

330
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:29,601
-Me?
-Yes, you.

331
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,694
Can you sell one of them?

332
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,242
Okay. Which one? This?

333
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:47,577
Not that one.

334
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,330
Something a five-year-old girl
would love at first sight.

335
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,624
-The pink one.
-I see. This one?

336
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,338
No. Why would I sell this to you?

337
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,259
You have a lot.
You don't run a doll shop, do you?

338
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,637
It's not like you need them.
Sell it to me.

339
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,389
It cost you 1,000 won.
I'll give you 3,000 won. It's a good deal.

340
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,432
What? 1,000 won?

341
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,644
I had to stack it, put it up,
and support it. It cost me 3,000 won.

342
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,937
Also, the cost of my labor.

343
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,690
My hourly rate is pretty expensive,
so I'm actually losing money.

344
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:21,152
Fine. Okay. Can you help me get that one?

345
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,533
Where did he go? He didn't even eat yet.

346
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,285
I swear I saw him just moments ago.

347
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:30,662
-Dad.
-What?

348
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,145
You'd better get this.
I have only 1,000 won left.

349
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:58,398
Look. You can't go after this one
from the beginning.

350
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,692
That one.
You have a higher chance of winning that.

351
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:04,195
No freaking way. Seo-woo likes pink!

352
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:06,990
I'm so close getting it, anyway.
I just need to push it in.

353
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,200
Here I go.

354
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,213
-Hey!
-My gosh!

355
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,257
My gosh, you startled me!

356
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,634
You said you were so busy
you didn't have time to help us.

357
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,095
What are you doing here with my son?

358
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:32,307
Excuse me. What's wrong with you?
Who are you talking to?

359
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,433
Your son?

360
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,767
Him?

361
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,980
Right. He's that guy.

362
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,696
Me? What about me? What is it?

363
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,407
Isn't my son so handsome?
He takes after me.

364
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,535
He's handsome and all.
Can you do us a favor?

365
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:54,829
My gosh.
Did something go wrong with his DNA?

366
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:58,791
How could someone like you give birth
to a tall guy like him?

367
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,294
What are you talking about?
You're scaring me.

368
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:05,757
Well, I'm just saying that
you look just like your parents.

369
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,008
I don't have any parents.

370
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:11,220
My son. What do you mean you don't
have parents? Your mother is right here.

371
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,266
Right. Hey.

372
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,937
Can you cook a meal for my son?

373
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,357
It's been over a week
since he had a proper meal.

374
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,984
He only eats noodles, bread,
and instant food.

375
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,528
At this rate,
he might die before his time.

376
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,447
Seriously? That's all you wanted?

377
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,866
You're so weird. Really weird.

378
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,743
That's a huge favor to ask!

379
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,664
Making sure my baby is fed
is the most important thing.

380
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,541
Come on, you and I are both parents.

381
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,294
Can you please do us this favor?
I'm begging you.

382
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,671
Please do this for us.

383
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,631
-Please. Do this for us.
-Please.

384
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:50,927
-Hey.
-What? What is it now?

385
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:53,972
I'll cook for you.

386
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,183
In exchange, give me that doll.

387
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,728
You ought to.
You failed to win the other one.

388
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,898
You can't blame me for that.
I messed up because you scared me.

389
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:05,316
Why would you cook for me?

390
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,860
The negotiation fell through.

391
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,737
-Come on, you promised!
-You're unbelievable.

392
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,531
-It's just a meal.
-Come on.

393
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:13,157
-Do this for us.
-You said you'd do it.

394
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,701
-Just this once.
-Just do it.

395
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,577
-You know this was--
-Gosh. Be quiet.

396
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,788
Forget it! Whatever! I don't need that.

397
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,124
Hey, hold on.

398
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,310
Stop looking at me.

399
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,524
You're bleeding. It means you're a human.

400
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,318
You deserved that.
Why did you steal his doll?

401
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,278
Darn it.

402
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,531
-How dare you steal from me?
-Come on.

403
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,577
You've been punished for stealing
with your nosebleed.

404
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,330
Take this instead.

405
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,791
Or not if you don't want it.

406
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:10,298
He's a grown man. Why would he
like pink dolls? Is he a pervert?

407
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,053
No, he's not. Pil-seung is a man.
He's super manly!

408
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,179
We all saw it.

409
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:17,555
Stop talking.

410
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,269
Yu-ri, we're doing this for your sake.

411
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,938
People at the cinerarium
are going crazy to find you.

412
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,274
She's right.
What if they all find out about you?

413
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:31,569
Your 49 days will be over,
trying to do favors for those ghosts.

414
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,490
No, hold on a second.
You only have 44 days left already.

415
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,991
-Gosh.
-Oh, no. What will she do?

416
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:40,703
You guys make such a nice family.
Gosh, you're so persistent.

417
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,957
-Isn't that true, honey?
-That's true. No. Right. Yes.

418
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,543
If you don't help us out,

419
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,837
we'll stay glued to your daughter.

420
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,256
What? You guys are unbelievable!

421
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,637
Don't you dare go near my daughter!

422
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,180
I won't let that slide!

423
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,890
What? What are you...

424
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:03,768
I won't let you slide for this! Okay?

425
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,770
Damn it.

426
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,314
Oh, darn it.

427
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,539
What on earth is going on?

428
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:30,336
You told me not to get caught.
They'll make my life very difficult.

429
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:36,300
When Pil-seung's family found out
about you, it was over, you fool.

430
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:41,264
Anyway, you all understood
what I just explained to you, right?

431
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,431
So you're saying that

432
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,518
Yu-ri will face her judgment
for 49 days as a human.

433
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,271
But since she's somewhat like a shaman,

434
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:50,523
she can't help us
or get involved in our business?

435
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:53,192
You got it. In other words,

436
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,821
don't ask her to do favors for you.

437
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:58,322
She can't help you, anyway.

438
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,782
This is so not fair!

439
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,954
Why does she get special treatment?

440
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,456
I want to face my judgment here and go up.

441
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,416
Relax.

442
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,960
-Ms. Mi-dong wasn't behind this.
-You...

443
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,547
She's being punished by the deities
for badmouthing them.

444
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,972
You! You stupid jerk!

445
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,765
-Gosh.
-Oh, no.

446
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,476
Come over here!
We should have a go at each other!

447
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,855
It won't work with you.

448
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,441
Swearwords take up half
of your sentences. You think they'll care?

449
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:34,609
Damn it.

450
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,077
Well, it just happened...

451
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,871
Gosh.

452
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,298
Something must have happened to you.

453
00:36:57,673 --> 00:37:02,011
You must have expressed awful resentment
for them to allow this to happen.

454
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,305
Seeing how they gave her a chance,

455
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,807
I'm sure they must have
an ultimate plan for her.

456
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,769
-Right?
-Yes. I'm sure of it.

457
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:13,940
I keep praying to find out what it is,
but they won't give me an answer.

458
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,443
Did you go see your mother?

459
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:19,862
No. Why would I?

460
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,823
Why wouldn't you go?
She should've been the first to visit.

461
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,618
No one misses you more than your mother.

462
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:29,330
Why? Are you afraid
that she would faint out of shock?

463
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,539
No.

464
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:35,670
I'll disappear
after turning Seo-woo back to normal.

465
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,215
What's the point?
I'll just end up giving her false hope.

466
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,383
Goodness.

467
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:44,136
Can't you just take your place?

468
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:46,138
Yes.

469
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,850
Forget it.

470
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:53,896
Once a human or a ghost starts
to get greedy, it's endless.

471
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,942
I'll be happy as long as Seo-woo
doesn't see ghosts and live a happy life.

472
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,236
RED BEANS

473
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:01,654
Goodness.

474
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,544
Seo-woo, can you look at this?

475
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,754
I'm very curious.

476
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:21,674
What letter does the word,
"crocodile" begin with?

477
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,307
Seo-woo, you know the answer to this.

478
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,934
You told me what it was yesterday,
didn't you?

479
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,937
Seo-woo.

480
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:52,163
She needs to work on phonics,
but before that, she doesn't speak.

481
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,957
She won't talk at all.

482
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,543
After assessing her, she can't
get into any English kindergarten,

483
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,420
let alone
a prestigious English kindergarten.

484
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:02,882
I see.

485
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,217
Ma'am.

486
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,554
How often do you talk to your daughter?

487
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:09,472
Pardon?

488
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:12,516
I talk to her if I need to.

489
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:15,895
Why do you ask?

490
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,647
It's important
for children to talk to their moms

491
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:21,400
before the age of six
instead of learning by memorization.

492
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,235
Best to let them talk as much as they can.

493
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,114
I see.

494
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,504
Seo-woo.

495
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,257
Is it good?

496
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,467
Yes.

497
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,573
My son. Tell me how good it is.

498
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,661
It tastes so, so, so good!

499
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:17,498
If it's so, so, so good,
it means it's the tastiest ice cream!

500
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,292
Of course. It's better than
a hundred ice creams!

501
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,753
Mom, do you know what a hundred is?

502
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,881
That's a really big number.

503
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,842
It's bigger than ten!

504
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,720
A hundred? My gosh, you're adorable.

505
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,597
Let me try it too.

506
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,867
Ta-da.

507
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,496
Isn't this awesome?

508
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,124
I could cook a meal for you.
Not this junk food.

509
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,667
What do you mean?

510
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,836
Look. A convenience store
is as good as a restaurant.

511
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,838
Tteokbokki, fishcake, and trotter.

512
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,300
I can add an egg in the ramyeon too.
This is so amazing.

513
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,803
We always say that time flies by.

514
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,348
But when we look back,
nothing stays the same.

515
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,608
A lot of things have changed, right?

516
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,987
Of course, things must change.
It's been almost five years.

517
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,071
You know what?

518
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,491
I'm not disappointed at all.

519
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,659
I'm glad for these changes.

520
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:37,703
So don't worry about me. Goodness.

521
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,877
Seo-woo's stepmother...

522
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,970
Don't you want to know who she is?

523
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,330
No, I don't.

524
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,540
Why not?

525
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,876
I mean, I would want to know
what kind of person she is the most.

526
00:42:29,421 --> 00:42:32,258
Because I know what kind of person she is.

527
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:33,551
You do?

528
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,346
A good person.

529
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,932
She's a good person.

530
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,976
Right?

531
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:46,188
Yes, that's right. She's a good person.

532
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,567
-Let's eat.
-Fine. Let's eat.

533
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,026
Dig in.

534
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,028
All right.

535
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,948
What is it? What?

536
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,325
Where are you going? What? Why...

537
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,456
I see. Well...

538
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,917
Hello.

539
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,379
You must need to buy something.

540
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,131
Yes.

541
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:29,815
Yu-ri.

542
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:32,359
Yu-ri, are you okay?

543
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,445
I'm okay.

544
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,370
She must have run out of alcohol.

545
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:18,781
That's right, Ms. Oh Min-jeong.
You know how to drink.

546
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,201
You like soju.
You totally belong to my club.

547
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:41,845
Thank you. Bye.

548
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:09,915
Bye.

549
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,856
There's only one table here.

550
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,274
I see. Right.

551
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,861
They usually set up more than one table.

552
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:42,906
You don't have a drinking buddy.

553
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,325
When people drink alone,
don't they drink at home?

554
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,537
People in this neighborhood
gossip too much.

555
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:55,294
I see. I thought that didn't bother you.
Does that bother you?

556
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,964
No, it doesn't. I'm not bothered by it.

557
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,508
Of course, it bothers her.
She's acting tough.

558
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,182
Mothers in this neighborhood
gossip about kids.

559
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:10,601
What they are doing is truly ugly.
Just ignore them.

560
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,937
No. That doesn't bother me at all.

561
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,649
That's good to hear then.

562
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:27,284
Is Seo-woo that odd?

563
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:38,962
I was wondering
if she's that different from Ha-jun.

564
00:47:07,741 --> 00:47:09,785
What's wrong with your stomach?
Does it hurt a lot?

565
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,037
Where? Did you eat something bad?

566
00:47:12,120 --> 00:47:13,413
What is it? Is she sick?

567
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:14,873
She says her stomach hurts.

568
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:17,709
Forget about the kindergarten.
Let's get her to a hospital.

569
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,503
-Let's get changed.
-All of a sudden?

570
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:21,839
She was fine just now.

571
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,509
Seo-woo, are you okay?

572
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:26,802
Yes.

573
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,013
You said your stomach hurts.

574
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,850
-It doesn't?
-No.

575
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:41,608
In that case, I'll button you up again.

576
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,819
She seems to be fine.

577
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,697
Exactly. She said she was in pain.

578
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,867
She must have recovered quickly
because she's so young.

579
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,368
Okay.

580
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,787
-Shall we?
-Yes.

581
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,581
Okay, let's go.

582
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:58,292
2019 SUNSHINE CLASS
PARENT PARTICIPATION PROGRAM

583
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,544
BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN

584
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,591
There's Yul-hee's mom. Hey!

585
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,676
-Hello.
-Hello.

586
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

587
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,665
Your shoulders will get dislocated.
Put him down.

588
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,752
Son?

589
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,754
What completes fashion?

590
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:44,963
Coolness!

591
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:47,174
Coolness! Yes, you have to look cool.

592
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,760
Do you think David Beckham
worked out his arms to play soccer?

593
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:52,471
He did it to look cool
in the parent participation programs.

594
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,056
You're such a big talker.

595
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,099
Mr. Cho, hello.

596
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,268
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

597
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,104
Why...

598
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,314
Why is he...

599
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,066
What is he going to do?

600
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,902
-Hello.
-Hello.

601
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:09,196
Hi, Min-jeong.

602
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:11,365
Why on earth are you... Hello.

603
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,574
What?

604
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:18,455
He should come. Everyone is supposed to.

605
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,499
Of course. I was just joking.

606
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,085
Of course, he should be here.
It's a parent participation day.

607
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,836
Gosh, Seo-woo. You're so adorable.

608
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,881
Are you insane? Are you crazy?
Why are you here?

609
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,132
What are you going to do?

610
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,010
Let's go. We should go.

611
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:33,095
We're late.

612
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,429
Let's go in.

613
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,768
They're going to run into her.
What's his plan?

614
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,814
What plan?
I hope she just finds out everything.

615
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,065
Let's go.

616
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:54,825
Goodness. We're running out of time.
What are you doing?

617
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,327
-Aren't you going to take this out?
-Right, yes.

618
00:49:58,286 --> 00:50:00,372
Whatever. What are the chances
of running into her?

619
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,082
I just won't leave the kitchen.

620
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,377
-Goodness.
-Take this to the sensory playroom.

621
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:06,753
I have to get fruit ready.

622
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,838
What? I'll...

623
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:09,297
I'll cut up the fruit.

624
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,134
It's your first time doing this.
You can't do that.

625
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,386
Just take this to the room.

626
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:16,221
No, wait, I...

627
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:53,467
Excuse me.

628
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,179
Yes?

629
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:03,769
You must use that often. The red beans.

630
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,354
Yes, kind of.

631
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:09,399
Excuse me.

632
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,159
I'm Elsa. Aren't you jealous?

633
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,160
I am.

634
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:22,120
Mi-so, do you want to go next?

635
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:26,083
Who do you think lives between A and C?

636
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,544
-O.
-No, that's not it.

637
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,213
-B.
-It's B.

638
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:33,465
-B.
-It's B.

639
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,884
-B!
-B! You're right!

640
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,427
-B!
-All right!

641
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,513
Her mom just told her.

642
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,225
Ha-jun, do you want to go next?

643
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,353
-You can do it!
-Okay.

644
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:50,899
Which letter of the alphabet do we need
between B and D to complete this?

645
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,027
-C.
-It's C.

646
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:56,488
Ha-jun. Hey, Ha-jun.

647
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:59,241
-Look at me. C.
-C.

648
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,992
Hey, man.

649
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:03,120
C. Ha-jun.

650
00:52:04,246 --> 00:52:07,207
Ha-jun. C. It's C.

651
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,750
Onion ring.

652
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,712
You're right. It's an onion ring.

653
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,172
Onion ring.

654
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,929
Hey, where's Yu-ri?

655
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:24,724
No idea. I don't see her.
I think she's staying in the kitchen.

656
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:28,270
What's with you? I told you to come up
with an excuse not to come today.

657
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,981
Do you think I wanted to come?
Do you think I want to be here?

658
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:34,025
I suggested we go out
and tried saying Seo-woo is sick. I tried!

659
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,069
If that worked, I wouldn't be here.

660
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:39,406
Anyway,
it looks like Yu-ri will stay hidden too.

661
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:42,117
I'm sure it'll pass. Whatever.

662
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,119
What are you doing?

663
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,245
-Let it pass.
-Okay.

664
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:46,955
-Let's go after this is over.
-Let's go.

665
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,373
-Yes.
-We should. Let's go.

666
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,875
What are you wearing?

667
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:52,043
Just let it pass. Let it pass.

668
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,880
-Let's feel it.
-All right!

669
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,428
Daddy, look at this!

670
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,014
Seo-woo.

671
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:07,934
Don't come to this side.
There are more red beans on that side.

672
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:11,354
Mi-so can't play
if you keep messing these up.

673
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:13,940
Seo-woo, come over here.

674
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,984
-Let's play with these.
-Okay.

675
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:20,780
Seo-woo.

676
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,783
You can't be this rude.

677
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,827
Be more careful with these.

678
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,953
Hey!

679
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,331
My goodness.

680
00:53:30,665 --> 00:53:32,792
What are you doing?

681
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,631
It looked like you needed more red beans.
This is how you do sensory play.

682
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,675
-Everyone!
-All right!

683
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:43,595
-Yes!
-More red beans!

684
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,348
-Let's do it!
-All right!

685
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,984
Darn it.

686
00:53:58,193 --> 00:54:01,029
Mi-so's mom really gets on my nerves.

687
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:04,699
Gosh, I'm so pissed.

688
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:10,872
I thought you'd be back right after
you dropped it off. What took you so long?

689
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,459
They're going to play with skewers.
Three skewers per family.

690
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,794
Strawberries.

691
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:21,883
Seo-woo loves strawberries.
She'll be thrilled.

692
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,223
It's so good.

693
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,769
You know what?
I went to every corner of Seoul

694
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:36,064
then I had to go to a town
right below Seoul

695
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:39,234
to get these strawberries.

696
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,027
-Isn't it good?
-It is.

697
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:43,697
I just crave strawberries
and nothing else.

698
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,617
-Our kid will be a strawberry fanatic.
-What? A strawberry fanatic?

699
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,702
This isn't good.

700
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:52,247
I'll quit working as a doctor
to start a strawberry farm.

701
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,748
No.

702
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:57,627
Oh, okay.
We'll just keep buying strawberries.

703
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,423
Yes, that's it.
Give the strawberry to Seo-woo.

704
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,844
Hey, not that one.
Give the strawberry to Seo-woo.

705
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:09,848
My gosh, she likes strawberries.

706
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,434
She has no idea what the kid likes.

707
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,855
Seo-woo, you like strawberries, don't you?

708
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,523
Okay, Sunshine Class!

709
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:21,568
-Yes, yes, teacher!
-Yes, yes, teacher!

710
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:23,778
All right, we're going to
give you some fruit.

711
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,739
-Yes!
-You can make some fruit skewers

712
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,907
with your mommy and daddy.

713
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,910
-Yes, yes, teacher.
-Yes, yes, teacher.

714
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,497
All right.

715
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,834
Okay. Yes. No.

716
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,424
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

717
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:52,724
Look at mine.

718
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:01,983
You don't have to give her strawberries.
It's all right.

719
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,611
I see.

720
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:08,156
But these are very delicious.
It's not too sour.

721
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,116
It's okay.
You don't have to give it to her.

722
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:15,830
But she'll love it.

723
00:56:15,914 --> 00:56:17,916
Ms. Cha, Seo-woo can't have strawberries.

724
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,418
She's allergic to strawberries.
She can't have it.

725
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,545
She's allergic?

726
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,801
Goodness, I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

727
00:56:28,676 --> 00:56:29,969
I'm sorry.

728
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,686
-Ouch!
-Goodness, Seo-woo.

729
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:41,064
Seo-woo!

730
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:43,900
Are you all right?
Goodness, that must have hurt.

731
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:46,361
Are you all right, Seo-woo?
That must hurt.

732
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,446
Are you all right?

733
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,271
MISAENG

734
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,449
Are you okay?

735
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:36,453
You couldn't have known
what she's allergic to.

736
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:39,038
That can happen.
I gave birth to Ha-jun and raised him,

737
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,249
but I have no idea
everything he's allergic to.

738
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,751
Do you think she knows?

739
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,004
-What?
-That I'm Cha Yu-ri.

740
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:49,424
I think she definitely knows
at this point.

741
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,342
What do I do, Hyeon-jeong?

742
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:56,055
Things were already risky enough.
Why did I suddenly step in?

743
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,060
Are you more worried about that?

744
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:02,979
Goodness, Yu-ri.

745
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,875
Of course! I can't let her find out.

746
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,002
Why not? You have to tell her anyway.

747
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:12,215
Will you continue to live
as the kitchen lady?

748
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:14,425
Aren't you going to raise Seo-woo?

749
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:18,346
No.

750
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,806
What? Why not?

751
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,770
Well, you know...

752
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,110
You can't tell anyone else.

753
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,992
-Actually...
-Actually?

754
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,249
I'm...

755
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,548
I'm a...

756
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,258
A...

757
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,844
A...

758
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:22,452
This is Ms. Oh Min-jeong,
a new addition to Gynecology Department.

759
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,288
I was appointed last week,
and this is my first day.

760
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,372
Nice to meet you.

761
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,791
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, Min-jeong.

762
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,130
We need the Gynecology Department
in operating room six.

763
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,923
An expecting mother's emergency.

764
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,561
The mother was in a car accident,
but the infant is breathing all right.

765
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,230
-Check the neonatal unit and send her.
-Okay.

766
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:21,946
Coincidence was already
making itself bigger and bigger

767
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,615
unbeknownst to me.

768
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:56,522
-Did you beat me?
-Me?

769
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,648
Look at your face.

770
01:02:57,732 --> 01:02:59,734
What happened last night?

771
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:02,278
It makes no sense
that only Yu-ri became a human!

772
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,613
I can't take my place back.

773
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,614
Stop!

774
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,657
You don't want to raise her yourself?

775
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:10,328
You're keeping a distance from Gang-hwa
because of Min-jeong.

776
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:13,456
They may not be living
too great of a life.

777
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:17,418
They look too much alike,
from head to toes.

778
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:18,503
You're getting divorced?

779
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:20,922
You can be Seo-woo's mom.

780
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,678
