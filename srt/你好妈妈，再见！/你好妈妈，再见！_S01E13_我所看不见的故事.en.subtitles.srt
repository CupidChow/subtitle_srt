1
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,211
Hey, get up!

2
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,672
Do you know what time it is?
Come on, get up.

3
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,884
-No...
-Hey, you're already late! Come on.

4
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,218
Hurry. Hey!

5
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,138
Hey! The soup's spilling...

6
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:56,931
Goodnight...

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,601
-"Goodnight"? Come on, get up.
-Just a bit more...

8
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,031
That's so funny. Oh my gosh.

9
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:16,493
I'd prefer a woman
who's cold to every guy.

10
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,328
I want a guy who's always kind.

11
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:19,621
WHICH GUY WOULD YOU MARRY?

12
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,748
A woman who's kind to every man?

13
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,334
-I'd--
-Then would you...

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,466
All right.

15
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,843
My goodness.

16
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,805
Hey, what is this?

17
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,641
Should I tell you why sales are so low?

18
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,563
The time that had been flowing with us

19
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,400
suddenly stopped one day.

20
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:49,961
I...

21
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,339
What? I'm doing my best.

22
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,884
-It's too salty.
-Oh, really?

23
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,617
Don't cry.

24
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,123
Don't cry.

25
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,250
Don't cry.

26
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,132
Time stopped for the person I love
because of me.

27
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,760
I prayed
that it would start flowing again.

28
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,437
-Hey, Gang-hwa.
-Bye.

29
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,315
Date that nurse, Oh Min-jeong.

30
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:54,817
Think about it the other way around.

31
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,030
What if it happened to you,
and you left Yu-ri all alone?

32
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,408
Would you like it if Yu-ri lives her life

33
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,286
suppressing her feelings
because she feels guilty about it?

34
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,044
Aren't you Yu-ri's friend?

35
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:13,962
I am.

36
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:18,132
I'll always be on her side,
and I'll think from her point of view.

37
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:20,635
I'm doing this for her.

38
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,740
You idiot. You loser.

39
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:02,135
MIN-JEONG

40
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:05,096
Yes, press it. Call her and meet her.

41
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,682
Come on, call her.

42
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,268
CALL

43
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,318
Gang-hwa, you used to have
so much charisma. Where did it all go?

44
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,158
I know you like her.

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,954
I'm sorry.

46
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,457
I'm sorry.

47
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,128
I must've lost my mind.

48
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,096
During the time I couldn't see her,

49
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,850
what would she have thought?

50
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:55,104
You fool.

51
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,066
You idiot.

52
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,207
EPISODE 13:
A STORY I COULD NOT SEE

53
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,719
What's wrong?

54
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,597
What's the matter?

55
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:36,020
Did something happen?

56
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:37,730
You've been

57
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:46,572
next to me the whole time...

58
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,592
You

59
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,517
saw everything?

60
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:18,229
How

61
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,857
could you stand it?

62
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,374
You saw...

63
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,258
all of that?

64
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,274
I'm sorry, Yu-ri.

65
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,568
No...

66
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:10,698
I'm sorry, Yu-ri.

67
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,450
No...

68
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:15,328
Don't cry.

69
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,455
Don't cry.

70
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,168
Don't cry...

71
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,467
Don't cry...

72
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,522
GANG-HWA, WHERE ARE YOU?

73
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,025
GANG-HWA

74
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,945
CALLING GANG-HWA

75
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,495
The person you are calling
is unavailable--

76
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,796
Are you crazy?

77
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,131
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

78
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,676
I found out only recently.

79
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,177
If Gang-hwa finds out,

80
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,097
how is he going to handle it?

81
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,400
Cho Gang-hwa. Hey, Gang-hwa.

82
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,570
What's going on?

83
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,327
-What's with your face?
-You knew everything, didn't you?

84
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,829
What?

85
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,249
Knew what?

86
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,544
That Yu-ri was by my side

87
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,590
for the past five years.

88
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:52,508
How did you know?

89
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,304
Gang-hwa...

90
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,443
She didn't remember.

91
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,446
She said she just woke up at a cinerarium.

92
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,906
What do we do about Gang-hwa?

93
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,075
That's why she couldn't tell him.

94
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,993
What?

95
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,579
After Yu-ri died,

96
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,292
Gang-hwa really had a tough time.
He blamed himself.

97
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,047
Right. He was just living
because he couldn't die.

98
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,550
Thinking of that just makes me...

99
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,177
But Yu-ri saw all of that.

100
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,597
That's why she couldn't tell him.

101
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,559
Because Gang-hwa
would blame himself again.

102
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,189
Hyeon-jeong.

103
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:53,569
I feel so bad for Yu-ri. What do we do?

104
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:57,907
Min-jeong.

105
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,454
Hello.

106
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,166
Did you happen to see
Seo-woo and Gang-hwa?

107
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,876
Mom!

108
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,047
Seo-woo, what are you doing here?
Where's your dad?

109
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:17,385
-Did Gang-hwa go somewhere?
-He went somewhere.

110
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,178
-What?
-Well, he went

111
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:20,763
there.

112
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,181
Somewhere.

113
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,809
Where did he go? You know, right?

114
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,602
-The hospital.
-Yes.

115
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,479
-The hospital.
-He went to the hospital.

116
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,148
He got an urgent call from the hospital.

117
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,526
And I have dementia,

118
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:36,529
so I keep forgetting stuff.

119
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:37,988
-Pardon?
-What?

120
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:42,201
The dads were planning
on spending time with the kids,

121
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:46,247
but Ha-jun wouldn't let go of me,
so the three of them played together.

122
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,750
-So that's why you were with Ha-jun.
-Right.

123
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:52,545
-Why didn't you say so?
-Sorry.

124
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:57,633
Well, Gang-hwa and I had fun
with Seo-woo today,

125
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,844
but he just got an urgent call

126
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,179
so he left Seo-woo with us
and left in a hurry.

127
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:07,143
I couldn't get in touch with Gang-hwa,
so I came here just in case.

128
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:10,271
It was an urgent call,
so he probably can't answer his phone.

129
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,656
Why

130
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,743
didn't you tell me sooner?

131
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,414
What's the point of telling you?

132
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,375
It'd only hurt the both of us.

133
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,133
Weren't you hurt

134
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,595
when you saw me

135
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,390
living a happy life without you?

136
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,854
Were you okay with that?

137
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:55,941
It hurt.

138
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:57,610
A lot.

139
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,409
Someone else was seeing the smile
you used to only show me.

140
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,330
And someone else was holding the hand
that only I used to hold.

141
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,752
And someone else was in the place
I was supposed to be at.

142
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,630
It hurt.

143
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:23,552
I'm sorry.

144
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:26,972
I'm really sorry.

145
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,100
But it hurt

146
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,853
a million times more

147
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,564
seeing you cry alone.

148
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,242
You woke up alone,

149
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,953
ate alone,

150
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,539
and watched Seo-woo alone

151
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:53,666
in an empty house without me.

152
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,127
And you...

153
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,505
cried alone.

154
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,843
That hurt so much

155
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,638
that I didn't even get jealous
of the other person.

156
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,391
It broke my heart,

157
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,269
but strangely enough, I felt so relieved.

158
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,773
I should've

159
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:22,945
endured all that.

160
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,700
I should've endured it

161
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,079
even if it was agonizing.

162
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,376
You felt enough pain,

163
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,754
and you endured enough.

164
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:44,592
I can hardly breathe.

165
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,385
How could you do this?

166
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,141
Bring her back. Bring her back, you jerk.

167
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,610
I only wanted one thing back then.

168
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:11,535
I wanted you to put me behind you
and go on with your life.

169
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,665
So don't blame yourself.

170
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,965
You really love Min-jeong.

171
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,763
I know you do.

172
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,184
Even if no one in the world can tell,
I know it.

173
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,858
Gang-hwa.

174
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:35,202
I'm not yours anymore.

175
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,042
You can let me go now.

176
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,521
I wonder why Gang-hwa came at this hour.

177
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:06,817
I don't know.

178
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,237
Yu-ri coming back to life

179
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,782
is a huge blessing for us.

180
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,745
But it might not be the case
for Gang-hwa and his wife.

181
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,457
I feel sorry for Gang-hwa's wife.

182
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,213
You don't need to feel sorry.

183
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:33,761
We're not asking for her place
as Seo-woo's mom or Gang-hwa's wife.

184
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,433
We're just grateful
that Yu-ri came back to us.

185
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,686
I know,

186
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:48,108
but if I knew this was going to happen,

187
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:52,654
I should've opposed
when Gang-hwa came to us asking permission

188
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,574
for him to remarry.

189
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:57,534
No.

190
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,790
Even if I go back to that day,
I would still tell him to remarry.

191
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,376
I can't see him suffering like that again.

192
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,515
Is that why you ran away
when you first saw me?

193
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,559
You never wanted

194
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,313
to appear in front of me?

195
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,069
Seo-woo's freezer incident happened
because of me.

196
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,656
How could I do that to you?

197
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,368
The freezer?

198
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:41,995
Why is that

199
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,414
your fault?

200
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,713
Didn't you hear from Hyeon-jeong?

201
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,012
Then who did you hear that from?

202
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:03,642
A man who said he was your friend.
He was wearing black clothes...

203
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,190
-Who are you?
-I'm here for your daughter.

204
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,108
Why?

205
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,152
Who is he?

206
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,238
Did he approach you and Seo-woo?

207
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,240
Yes.

208
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,368
Where's Seo-woo? Where is she right now?

209
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,704
At Hyeon-jeong's. Misaeng.

210
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,124
Yu-ri.

211
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,751
What is it? What's going on?

212
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:37,926
Seo-woo

213
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:40,304
can see ghosts.

214
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:44,600
What?

215
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,023
That freezer incident happened

216
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,693
because she followed a ghost.

217
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,700
What do you mean, Yu-ri?

218
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:03,702
What...

219
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:08,624
Why would Seo-woo see ghosts?

220
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,628
I was always by her side

221
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,465
since she was born.

222
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,387
That's why she can see ghosts.

223
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,728
I'm sorry.

224
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,152
I'm so sorry.

225
00:20:38,362 --> 00:20:41,281
It's all my fault. I'm really sorry.

226
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,412
Seo-woo has been watching me.

227
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:50,332
That's why...

228
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,043
I'm sorry.

229
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,837
I'm sorry.

230
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,524
Good.

231
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,122
Gang-hwa?

232
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,420
-Why are you here?
-I couldn't reach you,

233
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:37,587
so I came to find you.

234
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,549
Why do you look so dazed?

235
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,843
Well...

236
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,220
It's nothing.

237
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:46,972
It's nothing.

238
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,350
Is something going on?

239
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,352
What?

240
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,609
No,

241
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,611
I'm fine.

242
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,619
You should've taken her home
if you were going to the hospital.

243
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,629
Seo-woo, come here.

244
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,785
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

245
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,996
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

246
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:03,256
Yu-ri.

247
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,679
It's not your fault.

248
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,433
It's okay.

249
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,937
It's okay, Yu-ri.

250
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,114
Did Yu-ri go out again?

251
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,825
Yes. Are you going to pray again?

252
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,744
I should.

253
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,581
Mom. It seemed like
Yu-ri cried all night--

254
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:02,209
It's fine, you don't need to tell me.
I know.

255
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:07,839
I'm going.

256
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:09,508
Okay.

257
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,927
Be careful.

258
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,355
What is it?

259
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,857
Who's visiting so early in the morning?

260
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,581
My gosh. Who is it?

261
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,918
It's you. What is it?

262
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,586
-Where's that exorcist?
-What?

263
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:50,799
Where is that exorcist jerk?
I'm going to kill him! Is he in here?

264
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,342
-No.
-Come out!

265
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,511
What's gotten into you?

266
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,973
Wait, did he actually find your daughter?

267
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:02,435
Oh my goodness. He's begun now.

268
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,564
Come on, why don't you calm down first?

269
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,524
How can I calm down right now?

270
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,025
A shaman?

271
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,361
How can you do that to a six-year-old?

272
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,737
All right, just come inside.

273
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:16,116
-Come inside.
-Did the deities order this, too?

274
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,701
-My gosh.
-Did they order this?

275
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,705
-Did you hear that?
-Yes.

276
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,207
The exorcist is after Yu-ri's daughter.

277
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:28,044
He's such a heartless monster.

278
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,171
So make sure to avoid him at all costs.

279
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,007
One mistake,

280
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,884
and we'd be sent up
before we see Pil-seung get married.

281
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,761
No way. No.

282
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,598
-That can't ever happen.
-Let's go.

283
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:41,308
Yes, let's go.

284
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,524
Are you just going to stand there
huffing like that?

285
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,151
What choice do I have?

286
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,903
There's nothing I can do right now.

287
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:54,821
What?

288
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,158
What should I do?

289
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:01,202
I was going to go up
when Seo-woo became normal.

290
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:05,123
But she can still see them,
and there's a weird exorcist after her.

291
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,293
But there's nothing I can do.

292
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,922
There is something you can do.

293
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,550
Like what?

294
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,261
Your daughter can stop seeing ghosts.

295
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,055
Don't worry.

296
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:21,890
Trust me.

297
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,352
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure of it.

298
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,397
So you should focus on your job
and what you want to do.

299
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,483
What do you mean?

300
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,944
You're going to leave soon.
There are only a few days left.

301
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,322
Will you just waste your time and leave?

302
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,033
Is there anything you want to do?

303
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,475
Whatever the reason may be,
this is a rare chance.

304
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,145
There's no time
to even do everything you want.

305
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,066
Since you made up your mind
to leave this world,

306
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:14,984
do everything you want to do.

307
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,528
But that exorcist--

308
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:20,156
Goodness, didn't I tell you?
I told you Guk-bong would be back again.

309
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,242
But why does he keep showing up?

310
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:24,536
To confirm
that your daughter can see ghosts.

311
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,955
Once he confirms it, we can't undo this.

312
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,833
There are fewer people
who can see ghosts these days,

313
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,751
so he's not going to lose even one.

314
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,045
But you're completely against it.

315
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,172
You bet I am.

316
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,090
Exactly.

317
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,844
Just focus on protecting your daughter
and hang in there until you leave.

318
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,053
Enjoy your time here.

319
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,640
What happens once I leave?
What will happen to Seo-woo?

320
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,726
Don't worry.

321
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:51,104
She can stop seeing ghosts. Just trust me.

322
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,024
Yu-ri.

323
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:58,570
Mom.

324
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,988
Why are you here?

325
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,449
I...

326
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,327
She's not crying.
She's just roaming around everywhere.

327
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,205
Roaming around?

328
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,416
My daughter? In this world?

329
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,376
No, that's not what I meant. It's...

330
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,424
Mom, are you here to pray?

331
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:21,926
Yes.

332
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,762
Why are you here?

333
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,514
I just had to take care of something.

334
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,141
Let's go, Mom.

335
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,393
I was just about to leave, too.

336
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:31,853
Okay.

337
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:42,572
I feel like a sinner
because I slipped just once.

338
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,953
Once she leaves,

339
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,415
how is her mom going to deal with that?

340
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,418
Your friend? That shaman is your friend?

341
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:56,377
Yes.

342
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,884
She looks way older than you.
How is she your friend?

343
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,678
Age doesn't matter in friendship.

344
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,764
She's nice despite her looks.

345
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,726
Did you really come here to meet her?

346
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,394
Yes.

347
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,022
Mom, what about you?

348
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,693
Why do you think?
I came here to offer my prayer.

349
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:24,739
I thanked him
for sending back my daughter.

350
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:28,993
What if he takes you back
because I stop coming to pray?

351
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,965
Mom,
is there anything you want to do with me?

352
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,258
With you?

353
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,261
Things you regret not doing with me.

354
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,181
I am

355
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:55,728
just happy to be with you.
I don't want anything else.

356
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:11,786
You already got her ready?

357
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,913
Yes. I'll drop her off
at the kindergarten.

358
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,084
Gang-hwa, what's gotten into you
yesterday and today?

359
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,128
What? What do you mean?

360
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,213
You're practically glued to her.

361
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,393
-Where are you going?
-To pee.

362
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,478
To pee? Let's go.

363
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,110
Where are you going?

364
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,590
You've been following her around
the whole day.

365
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,468
-Really?
-Yes.

366
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,435
Right. About Seo-woo's pick-up helper...

367
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,145
What?

368
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,522
-Min-jeong.
-Yes?

369
00:32:23,524 --> 00:32:24,359
Let's

370
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,948
get a new pick-up helper.

371
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,409
Tell me why you want a new helper.

372
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,124
If you don't tell me, I won't do it.

373
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,841
There's a room somewhere
in Gang-hwa's heart.

374
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,928
It's a room I'm not allowed to open

375
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,723
even if everyone else
in the world can open it.

376
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,560
And that was really tough.

377
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,299
You don't have to tell me now,

378
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,053
but tell me when you are ready to tell me.

379
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,183
Can you come to the hospital
later in the afternoon?

380
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:47,734
I'll tell you everything.
Why we need a new helper.

381
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,741
You're going to leave soon.

382
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:56,743
There are only a few days left.

383
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,911
Will you just waste your time and leave?

384
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,538
Is there anything you want to do?

385
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:08,046
What was that?

386
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,923
Hey, you know that dumb friend of yours?

387
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,593
What's his name? Bin or Bong?
He's following your friend.

388
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,887
My dumb friend? Geun-sang?

389
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,727
Yu-ri.

390
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:24,896
Are you okay?

391
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:27,356
I heard everything.

392
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,650
How did you go through all that?

393
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,278
It's all right.

394
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,199
Everything will be okay.

395
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:40,828
-Geun-sang.
-Tell me.

396
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:43,748
Tell me everything. I'm all ears.

397
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,376
What have you been up to?
Why is a ghost following you?

398
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,129
What are you saying?

399
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,256
Don't make jokes about that.

400
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,300
You of all people shouldn't.

401
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,677
What's wrong with you?

402
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,804
No, that's not true.

403
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,765
Why are you making things creepy?

404
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,392
Where? Where is it?

405
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,436
-Goodness.
-Where?

406
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,395
Gosh.

407
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,565
Yu-ri. Where are you going? Don't go!

408
00:35:10,399 --> 00:35:11,651
Tell me before you go!

409
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,280
I'm scared. I'm...

410
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,326
You give me peace like a river

411
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,579
You give me peace like a river

412
00:35:23,746 --> 00:35:25,414
Hallelujah

413
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,459
You give me peace like a river

414
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,586
You give me peace like a river

415
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,727
-Hello.
-Hello.

416
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,024
I'm right about this.

417
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,193
It's all over the town.

418
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:57,113
Those two were crying like crazy
at the playground.

419
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,074
Are you sure it was Seo-woo's dad
and the kitchen assistant?

420
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,868
-Yes.
-She said they were.

421
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,913
But she has no idea.
They are hanging out like besties. Gosh.

422
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,835
Hi, you're here.

423
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,628
Hello, Seo-woo.

424
00:36:12,712 --> 00:36:15,256
-All right. Take off your shoes.
-Take off your shoes.

425
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,802
Let's take off your shoes and go inside.
Let's go.

426
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:22,972
Say bye to your dad.

427
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:23,890
Seo-woo.

428
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:29,645
-Oh, right.
-Okay.

429
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,314
Bye.

430
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,732
Let's go.

431
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,056
He's not okay at all.

432
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:15,399
Are you okay?

433
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:21,447
I mean, she should've told you
she watched you for five years.

434
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,868
No. How could she tell you that? Goodness.

435
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,080
Have you ever felt like

436
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:33,417
you did something awful
that you didn't want this person

437
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,419
to find out,

438
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,837
but it turns out

439
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,716
that this person had been watching
the whole time?

440
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,635
That's how I feel.

441
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,263
I know. It feels naked.

442
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:50,434
Hey, but what you did wasn't awful.

443
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,645
Is remarrying a bad thing?
Why is that awful?

444
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,399
She saw everything.

445
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,192
Were you aware of it?

446
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,069
That she'd stay with you as a ghost?

447
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:02,989
Did you know she'd come back?
Don't blame yourself.

448
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,241
Yu-ri said
this is why she didn't tell you.

449
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,455
Gang-hwa, Dr. Jang is looking for you.

450
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,091
Observe my surgery starting this week.

451
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,092
Pardon?

452
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:27,638
When I do my surgery,
come into the operating room

453
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,223
and watch.

454
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,020
We did enough for counseling.

455
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,147
Let's try exposure therapy
to overcome this.

456
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:40,109
I'm not confident
that I can handle the exposure.

457
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,444
Bye.

458
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,029
-Hey. You.
-Doctor Cho.

459
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,905
-Hey!
-Doctor Cho.

460
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:50,536
-What should we do?
-What do you think? He'll have to do it.

461
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,455
What other choice does he have?

462
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,665
Will he get fired?

463
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,055
Gang-hwa,

464
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,350
you can let me go now.

465
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,738
Those mothers can't even look me
in the eye now.

466
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:30,034
I guess we were pretty scary that day.
They can't say anything to me now.

467
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,579
Thanks to you,

468
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,583
living in this town
became a little easier.

469
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,379
I'm glad.

470
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,631
They won't talk about Seo-woo now.

471
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,676
Come to think of it,
did I hit them too hard?

472
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,720
That shouldn't even count as hitting.

473
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:50,930
You know what?

474
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,393
You must think this is
some kind of a cafe for moms.

475
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:59,480
This is my place of business.
My sacred place of business.

476
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:05,694
Hyeon-jeong!

477
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,488
I'm just so thirsty.

478
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:13,744
That hit the spot.

479
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,499
Why are you chopping so many green onions?

480
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,085
My gosh, it's so spicy. My eyes sting.

481
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,098
Hyeon-jeong.

482
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:37,601
I was just passing by.

483
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,063
Have some coffee.

484
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:43,524
-Okay.
-My gosh.

485
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,609
You have a lot of dishes to wash.

486
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,111
It's nothing.

487
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:52,741
Hyeon-jeong!

488
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,952
The weather is warming up now.

489
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:58,247
Those are some huge anchovies! Oh my.

490
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,294
These are good. Are they from Tongyeong?

491
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,472
Hyeon-jeong. And Do-yeon.

492
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,767
This isn't a place you stop by.
What is this place?

493
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,978
A place of business.

494
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,522
I love it.

495
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,692
Having a place I can stop by
in my neighborhood.

496
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,654
I didn't have any place I could stop by
in this neighborhood.

497
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,117
This feels like a hideout.

498
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,083
-I have an appointment. I'll get going.
-Okay.

499
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:45,544
Seo-woo doesn't have lessons today.

500
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:47,630
Play with her at home
or at the playground.

501
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:49,965
Seo-woo.

502
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:52,009
Mom!

503
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,431
I'm leaving now. Play with the aunt
and I'll see you at home.

504
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,683
Okay? Bye, Ha-jun.

505
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,851
Bye.

506
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,894
Goodness.

507
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,940
Good girl.

508
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,404
Go play.

509
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,407
I'll get going.

510
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,034
Bye, Min-jeong.

511
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:23,707
Well,

512
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,795
we are friends, right?

513
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,676
Seeing how close we are,

514
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,012
I was wondering
if I could call you guys friends.

515
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,604
Of course. We are best friends.

516
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:46,522
You bet.

517
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,975
Hello.

518
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,268
Hi.

519
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:27,563
We have a lot of beautiful accessories
today. Look around.

520
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:33,319
FRIENDSHIP BRACELET,
SHARE YOUR MEMORIES

521
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,446
Give me three of those.

522
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:38,490
Are you giving them to your friends?

523
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:39,867
Yes.

524
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:42,745
-How much are they?
-50,000 won.

525
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,044
-Here you go.
-Sell a lot.

526
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,629
-Wear them well.
-Okay.

527
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,018
It's all my fault.

528
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,939
What's wrong with you?
Why is this your fault?

529
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:14,109
If I didn't

530
00:44:15,611 --> 00:44:17,029
encourage Gang-hwa

531
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,824
to date Min-jeong back then...

532
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,202
I'm sorry.

533
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,912
Why would you say that?

534
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,165
I was really thankful to you
when you did that.

535
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:30,959
There must be a way.

536
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,171
I told the shaman to find us a way.

537
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,965
I'm trying to wrap my head around it,

538
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,053
but I can't have you leave me again.

539
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,266
Hyeon-jeong.

540
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:47,726
Yes?

541
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,314
Everyone is having a hard time
because I came back.

542
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,026
I didn't come back to make people suffer.

543
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,363
Because of me, Gang-hwa and you

544
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:01,740
are in such pain.

545
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:07,371
I should have hidden from you guys
and never gotten caught.

546
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:11,458
This is not why I came back at all.

547
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,504
Why did I get caught?

548
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,216
I shouldn't have.

549
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,725
What is it?
Do you have something to tell me?

550
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,393
To be honest,

551
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,396
I like you.

552
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:33,856
You're cool.

553
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,232
So what?

554
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:41,613
That's why I really wanted
to tell you this.

555
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,661
You should change your pick-up helper.

556
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,579
What?

557
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,584
Why? Why must I do that?

558
00:45:55,502 --> 00:45:57,379
Everyone is talking about it now,

559
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,381
saying your helper and your husband

560
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,217
are having an affair.

561
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:08,390
Now, you're spreading groundless rumors?
Are we done here?

562
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:13,103
No, people said that they were crying
at the playground together.

563
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,147
It's true.

564
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:18,942
Please go.

565
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,821
Goodness.

566
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,365
All right. Let's do it one more time.

567
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,535
All right. Here. Goodness.

568
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,995
-Harder?
-Yes, harder!

569
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:33,373
My gosh, look. I caught it. I got it.

570
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:35,626
All right. Let's do it again.

571
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,170
Again. Let's do it again.

572
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,589
Goodness.

573
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:44,134
-Throw it far this time.
-Dad, you must be tired. Stop it.

574
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,552
That's nonsense.

575
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,764
I'm still going strong. Right, Seo-woo?

576
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,725
Grandpa can play with you
for 12 more hours.

577
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,227
All right. One more time!

578
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,688
-All right.
-He's unstoppable.

579
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,357
Goodness.

580
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,608
Give me a few minutes.

581
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,611
-I'll go and buy some cool drinks.
-Sounds great. All right.

582
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,113
You got it. You caught it, Seo-woo.

583
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,243
All right. Look. Grandpa caught it too.

584
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:17,709
Seo-woo, do you want to sit down
and rest for a bit? Okay.

585
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:21,046
All right. Let's put this here.

586
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:22,756
Goodness.

587
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,008
Gosh.

588
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:27,219
Who do you take after?

589
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:31,265
You have pretty eyes, nose,

590
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,517
and cheeks.

591
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,562
And even your hands are pretty.
Look at them wriggle.

592
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:38,814
My goodness.

593
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,650
Oh, no. Goodness.

594
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,652
My gosh. Oh, no.

595
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:47,030
-Are you okay? Oh, goodness.
-Yes.

596
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,450
Seo-woo, don't go anywhere. Stay there.

597
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,036
-Gosh.
-Oh, no.

598
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,089
-I know, right?
-Sure.

599
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,508
-What should we play?
-Let's play with Mimi.

600
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,051
-Sure. I like that.
-Mom.

601
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:10,804
Mom said she'd cook tteokbokki for us.

602
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,812
-Here.
-Okay.

603
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,106
You should be careful.

604
00:48:21,189 --> 00:48:22,649
-Thank you.
-Sure.

605
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,318
Seo-woo.

606
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,074
Seo-woo.

607
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,623
Seo-woo.

608
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,211
Seo-woo!

609
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,672
Seo-woo!

610
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:49,426
Dad.

611
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:51,970
Yu-ri, this is bad.

612
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:53,931
Seo-woo...

613
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:54,890
Seo-woo.

614
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,601
Oh, no. Seo-woo...

615
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,603
Oh my gosh.

616
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:04,650
Seo-woo!

617
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:05,692
Seo-woo.

618
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,194
Seo-woo!

619
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,807
I'll tell you everything.
Why we need a new helper.

620
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:42,062
He can just say he's uncomfortable
because she looks like his late wife.

621
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,065
Gosh.

622
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,030
PICK-UP HELPER DO-YEON

623
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:23,645
Min-jeong.

624
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:28,108
-What's wrong?
-Gang-hwa. What are we going to do?

625
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:31,236
What is it? What?

626
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,148
-Seo-woo!
-Seo-woo!

627
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,442
Seo-woo!

628
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:11,735
Seo-woo!

629
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:12,736
Seo-woo!

630
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:17,157
Seo-woo.

631
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:18,075
Seo-woo.

632
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:20,410
Seo-woo.

633
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,789
-Seo-woo.
-I didn't do that.

634
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:24,748
Seo-woo.

635
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:28,877
-There's one over there, too.
-Seo-woo.

636
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,171
Where's she?

637
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,422
Seo-woo!

638
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,009
Excuse me. Have you seen a girl this big?

639
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:37,052
Seo-woo!

640
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,348
Excuse me. Have you seen a girl this big
wearing a purple coat?

641
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,599
Seo-woo!

642
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,601
Seo-woo!

643
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,811
Seo-woo!

644
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:47,854
Seo-woo!

645
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,189
-Seo-woo!
-Seo-woo!

646
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,691
-Seo-woo!
-Seo-woo!

647
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,319
Seo-woo!

648
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,530
Seo-woo.

649
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:58,532
Seo-woo.

650
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:01,660
Seo-woo!

651
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,830
Oh, no. What are we going to do?

652
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:05,872
She'll be okay.

653
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:07,958
No. What will we do?

654
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,293
-She'll be okay.
-What are we going to do?

655
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:11,253
She'll be okay.

656
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,213
She'll be okay.

657
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,757
Oh, no.

658
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,269
My poor Seo-woo. Oh, no.

659
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,315
Seo-woo!

660
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,699
Seo-woo!

661
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,285
Seo-woo.

662
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:47,497
What are we going to do?

663
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,715
Oh, no.

664
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,092
Sorry. I am so sorry.

665
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,346
How...

666
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,600
How could you lose her?

667
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,740
Seo-woo.

668
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,905
Seo-woo!

669
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:06,076
Seo-woo, are you okay?
Seo-woo. You're okay.

670
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,702
Thank goodness.

671
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,162
Seo-woo!

672
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,373
Seo-woo.

673
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:13,458
-Seo-woo!
-Mommy.

674
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:17,170
-Seo-woo.
-Mommy...

675
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:18,505
Seo-woo!

676
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,757
What were you doing here?

677
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,803
-Mommy...
-Goodness. Seo-woo.

678
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,722
-Mommy...
-Goodness...

679
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,392
-Goodness...
-Mommy...

680
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,562
I'm sorry.

681
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,941
Mommy...

682
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,152
Mommy...

683
00:54:46,366 --> 00:54:48,034
Mommy...

684
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:54,332
Our little baby son
grew up to be this big, honey.

685
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,878
Look at how handsome he is.

686
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,883
Our son grew up so well all by himself.

687
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,845
He's such a kind and handsome man.

688
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:11,099
He won't be lonely
once he gets married, right?

689
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,393
Then

690
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,437
we can go.

691
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,521
Yes, once our son

692
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,359
has a family of his own, we can go then.

693
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:25,905
Let's go now. He has a flight today.

694
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:28,783
Safe flight, Jang Pil-seung.

695
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,662
Son, have a great day!

696
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,248
Have a safe flight, and eat well.

697
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:40,211
Honey!

698
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,047
The exorcist!

699
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:43,214
-What?
-What?

700
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:45,759
Goodness!

701
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:07,155
You jerk! Take this!

702
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,247
Seo-woo. Seo-woo?

703
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:18,750
Come here. It's all right.

704
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:20,752
That's it.

705
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,046
Come here. That's it.

706
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,465
That's it. Good girl.

707
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,760
How dare you? Come here! Come!

708
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,640
Come!

709
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:36,184
That's it.

710
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,105
That jerk. How dare he try to bully Yu-ri?

711
00:56:40,897 --> 00:56:42,148
Seo-woo!

712
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,859
Mom, take a step back.

713
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,779
-We can't be too close to her.
-Yes, you're right.

714
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,490
Seo-woo, come here. Come.

715
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:54,452
That's it. Good girl. Great job.

716
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,579
That's it.

717
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:58,873
We're almost here.

718
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:00,458
Come here.

719
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,378
That's it.

720
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:06,297
Gosh, that looks fun. Try going up there.

721
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:09,843
Go up there and stay in that box. Okay?

722
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,721
Over there. There. That's it.

723
00:57:19,894 --> 00:57:22,814
Seo-woo, we're playing hide-and-seek.

724
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,026
You can't come out of there.
Make sure you stay hidden. Okay?

725
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:29,988
Good girl. Let's go.

726
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,828
Let's go find Yu-ri.

727
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:45,920
Honey.

728
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,465
I wonder what you're doing here.

729
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,719
We aren't doing anything.
We were just hanging out.

730
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,262
Where's the kid?

731
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,437
I saw you taking her.

732
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,524
Where did you hide her?

733
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:17,952
Okay. Don't say anything.

734
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:22,832
Let's go up.

735
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,718
Who is it?

736
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:35,887
Goodness.

737
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:37,805
What's wrong?

738
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:47,440
Goodness, why are you going around
not eating anything

739
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,108
even after you became a human?

740
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,568
You're breaking my heart.

741
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:54,197
It's because I'm human.
I wouldn't be like this if I were a ghost.

742
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:55,698
Don't be so smart.

743
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:59,327
Why did you come here
instead of going home?

744
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:04,582
My mom will be worried sick
if I go home like this.

745
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,919
What about that tough lady
who's supposedly your best friend?

746
00:59:11,089 --> 00:59:14,300
Why? Does she keep telling you
to take your place back?

747
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:17,011
Yes.

748
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:20,598
Ms. Mi-dong.

749
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,643
I think it was a punishment

750
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:26,104
that I'm back to life.

751
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:28,731
It's not a reward.

752
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:35,321
Ever since I came alive again,
everyone is unhappy.

753
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:39,534
Goodness, what happened to you?

754
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,207
I'm sorry,

755
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,043
but could you please leave?

756
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:54,007
I really don't want to see you right now.

757
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:56,718
How...

758
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:00,680
How can you lose her? How?

759
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:04,309
I'm sorry.

760
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,436
I'm so sorry.

761
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:26,706
You're shaken up.

762
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,710
She's shocked too. That's why.

763
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,130
Let's go. I'll take you home.

764
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,256
I'm sorry.

765
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:39,969
I shouldn't have come. I'm so sorry.

766
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,388
What do you mean?

767
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:47,143
Yu-ri, it's not your fault.
It's all right.

768
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:52,106
Why do you always say
everything is all right?

769
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,903
It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.

770
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,247
Yu-ri.

771
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,438
I shouldn't have come back to life.

772
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:35,024
It's not like you wanted to.

773
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,652
And you didn't get caught
because you wanted to.

774
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:42,365
Everyone cries, worries,
and sighs when they see me.

775
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:47,704
No one smiles.

776
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,832
Everyone is tormented because of me.

777
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,044
Everyone who's alive is like that.

778
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,797
They think more about tomorrow than today.

779
01:01:58,756 --> 01:02:02,552
That's why they have a lot of troubles,
sigh a lot, and regret a lot too.

780
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,306
If they thought
they'd live just another day

781
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:09,267
like you or other ghosts here,

782
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:11,853
there's no need to worry about it all.

783
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,570
Goodness.

784
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:24,907
Ms. Mi-dong--

785
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,037
Yu-ri! You're here. You came.

786
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,081
When did you get here? When?

787
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,585
Yes, Yu-ri came. Our dear Yu-ri.

788
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:38,588
You were sick of this place.
Why did you come?

789
01:02:38,671 --> 01:02:40,423
This is my home too.

790
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:41,841
I'm glad you're here.

791
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:44,135
-I'm so glad.
-I missed you.

792
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:45,720
I'm glad you're here.

793
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,900
Why do you always say
everything is all right?

794
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:03,279
It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.

795
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,397
You must've been shocked.

796
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:01,462
Min-jeong.

797
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:05,383
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

798
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,885
It wasn't your fault, okay?

799
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,098
Then whose fault is this?

800
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,520
Is it because you're at the hospital
all day long?

801
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:24,402
I hired a pick-up helper
to return to work, then lost my child.

802
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:27,947
And Seo-woo

803
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:33,995
is slower and grayer than most children.

804
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:38,165
If these aren't my fault,
whose fault is it?

805
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:41,711
Am I not her mother?

806
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,045
Min-jeong.

807
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:48,467
When something is wrong with a kid,
everyone blames the mother.

808
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:52,305
Why do you always say it's not my fault?

809
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:55,391
You said I'm Seo-woo's mother.

810
01:04:58,394 --> 01:04:59,937
Am I really her mother?

811
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,194
I'm sorry.

812
01:05:09,113 --> 01:05:09,947
I'm sorry.

813
01:05:13,993 --> 01:05:15,494
Why are you always

814
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,539
sorry

815
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,293
and fine?

816
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,484
Cha Yu-ri.

817
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:52,615
Those three syllables
are taboo words to me.

818
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,702
How long

819
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:00,247
will you keep that door shut?

820
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,210
How long will you keep that door
locked up?

821
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:08,589
You have to open that door
for me to go in.

822
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:14,595
That's the only way
I can truly be Seo-woo's mom.

823
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:39,996
The pick-up helper.

824
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:47,837
That's her.

825
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:49,839
Yu-ri.

826
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:52,675
Cha Yu-ri.

827
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:07,857
What

828
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:10,943
do you...

829
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:14,697
What do you mean?

830
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,580
Seo-woo's biological mother.

831
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:25,416
Cha Yu-ri.

832
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,880
She came back to life.

833
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:58,866
Why? You can't seem to sleep?

834
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,662
I don't want to waste my time sleeping.

835
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:08,417
Mom, can you sing for me?

836
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:11,087
What? Which song?

837
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:14,882
"Pine Tree."

838
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:17,384
"Pine Tree?"

839
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:18,969
You remember that?

840
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:21,514
I used to sing it for you
when you were a baby.

841
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:24,892
It has been so long,
so I want to listen to it. Sing it for me.

842
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:35,986
Pine tree, pine tree

843
01:08:36,654 --> 01:08:41,617
Your light is evergreen

844
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:46,956
On a lonely autumn day

845
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:52,211
And even in a snowstorm

846
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:58,592
-Pine tree, pine tree
-Pine tree, pine tree

847
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:03,639
Your light is evergreen

848
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:08,394
On a lonely autumn day

849
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:13,023
And even in a snowstorm

850
01:09:18,028 --> 01:09:19,446
Seo-woo's biological mother.

851
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:22,283
Cha Yu-ri.

852
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:28,289
Pine tree, pine tree

853
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:34,837
You are evergreen

854
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:42,887
Anyway, we established the hierarchy
in this chaotic neighborhood.

855
01:09:43,095 --> 01:09:45,097
That means we're the bosses, right?

856
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:47,766
This is why we should be careful
around kids.

857
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,851
You already learned.

858
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:51,812
Exactly, she learns very fast.

859
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,314
She called us bosses.

860
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,817
Don't laugh like that
when older ladies are talking.

861
01:09:56,901 --> 01:09:58,986
She should lie down head-first
on a bottle cap.

862
01:09:59,069 --> 01:10:01,864
You can't do that nowadays.
You'll get handcuffed.

863
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,949
This world is coming to an end.

864
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:05,784
Let's go out and get some eggs.

865
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:06,744
Okay.

866
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:14,376
Goodness, she won't even stand up
to see the older ladies off. Unbelievable.

867
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,922
-Keep the restaurant safe, will you?
-Yes.

868
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,303
I couldn't see the time
they spent together,

869
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:11,433
but their time has been passing by
diligently.

870
01:11:40,546 --> 01:11:42,214
It must've been fun

871
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:46,385
to see how much I loved her
like some kind of an idiot.

872
01:11:46,468 --> 01:11:49,930
You looked so happy
when you were around other people.

873
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:52,057
You should take care of yours first.

874
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:53,559
You're a mess.

875
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,894
Will you live as a doctor
who can't operate?

876
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:57,896
You need to face this to get better.

877
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,690
Why did you leave me all alone?

878
01:12:00,441 --> 01:12:01,608
Why did you do that?

879
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:05,654
Do you know what's more desperate
than saying, "I want to die"?

880
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:07,239
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

881
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,490
I want to live too.

882
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:14,163
