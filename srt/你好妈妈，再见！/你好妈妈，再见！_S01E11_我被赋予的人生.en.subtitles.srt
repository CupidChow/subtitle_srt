1
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,089
-You want to do what?
-Do one favor for each other.

2
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,801
We might not have time
for each other once our baby's born.

3
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,471
We should enjoy our newlywed status
before it ends.

4
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:59,559
I wasn't joking.
Just tell me, and I'll do it for you.

5
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,518
-Really?
-Of course.

6
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,898
Well, then
since it's a rare opportunity...

7
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,026
I should really
put a lot of thought into it.

8
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,654
Pick me up on a rainy day.

9
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:12,947
What? That's it?

10
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,491
"That's it"?

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,201
When I was little,

12
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,870
mothers would come to school
with umbrellas on a rainy day.

13
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,372
I envied the other kids so much
because my mom never came.

14
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,918
Why are you telling me
such a sad story so suddenly?

15
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,462
She had no choice since she was working.

16
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,380
All right. I'll do that.

17
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:31,132
Really? You'll do that for me?

18
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,384
Of course. That's a piece of cake.

19
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,553
I'll go pick you up whenever it rains.

20
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,430
You shouldn't say that so casually.

21
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,517
It's raining almost like rainy season
these days. Are you sure you'll be okay?

22
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,686
-Of course.
-Okay. Your turn, then.

23
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,855
Tell me what you want.

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,233
I'll give you anything you want.
What do you want?

25
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,485
I don't really want much.

26
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,737
Maybe a diamond.

27
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,283
One about this size.

28
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,830
You've just crossed the line.

29
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,791
I enjoyed spending time with you.

30
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,838
I hope you live a happy life.

31
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,560
It's raining.

32
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:33,903
Honey, it's raining a lot.
What about that promise you made?

33
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,662
I'm too lazy to go.

34
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,999
My gosh.

35
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,845
Honey, I feel so heavy today.

36
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,222
Can we just skip today?

37
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,643
Of course.

38
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,541
My husband! You're here.

39
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,710
-My wife.
-Yes.

40
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:35,298
I thought you were going
to pick me up whenever it rained.

41
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,675
I really was about to go...

42
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,428
but I felt too lazy.

43
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,598
Oh, did you? It's fine.

44
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,850
You shouldn't come out.
You should take care of yourself.

45
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,602
Oh, you're so wet.

46
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,104
Yes, I'm totally soaked.

47
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,814
You're right. You're all soaked.

48
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:57,278
Maybe our Yeol-mu said
you should go pick me up, but you...

49
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,488
No, I...

50
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:02,200
Back then, each day arrived so naturally

51
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,495
that I thought it was obvious
for the next day to arrive.

52
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,622
You've fed our sleeping baby
so many tangerines again?

53
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,123
Our baby really likes tangerines.

54
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,591
-Honey.
-Oh, Honey!

55
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,760
-You came to pick me up?
-Yes.

56
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:23,304
-Really? Thank you.
-Of course.

57
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:43,241
If I had known that the next day
wouldn't arrive ever again,

58
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:48,913
I wouldn't have let each precious day
just pass by idly.

59
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:54,585
EPISODE 11:
THE SHARE OF LIFE GIVEN TO ME

60
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,219
I can't believe we ran out of salt.

61
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,765
Still, I'd rather go to the supermarket
than peel carrots.

62
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,225
Definitely.

63
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:22,572
My goodness.

64
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:29,537
Ma'am.

65
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:33,374
Are you okay?

66
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,044
Mister! Wake up!

67
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,170
Oh, no...

68
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,187
Help.

69
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,691
Please save my baby. Help.

70
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:10,578
-How long has it been?
-She needs treatment right away!

71
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,246
Hurry!

72
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,415
Excuse me, the grandmother
is in a bad state.

73
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,626
-Get a surgery room ready!
-It's urgent!

74
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,294
You should treat the grandma over there!

75
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,797
-The grandmother--
-She was just startled.

76
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,840
-We should treat this patient--
-No!

77
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:24,675
She's going to die!

78
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:29,931
Ma'am.

79
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,350
No... Please.

80
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:33,851
What do I do?

81
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,687
What happened? What is it?

82
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,023
Gang-hwa, where are you going?

83
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,027
-Gang-hwa.
-A car accident.

84
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,487
Send her to ER.

85
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,948
Please take care of this grandmother!

86
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,825
You need to treat her first!

87
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,244
Please, she's going to die.

88
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,002
Gang-hwa.

89
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:01,546
What is it? Are you okay?

90
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,633
Yes, I'm fine.
But check that grandmother, please.

91
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,683
I think she's going to die soon.
Do something, please!

92
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,644
We have doctors here,
so it's going to be okay.

93
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,938
No! She's going to die!

94
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,566
Gang-hwa, hurry!

95
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,116
-Over here!
-Yes?

96
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,784
Do a chest X-ray and ECG on her

97
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,162
-and contact the Cardiology Department.
-What? We...

98
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,955
-Come on! It's urgent!
-Okay!

99
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,999
Hurry!

100
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,676
Please...

101
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:57,393
-Here.
-Oh, thank you.

102
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,687
She's okay for now.

103
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,398
She'll get surgery
as soon as her family arrives.

104
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:06,194
That's a relief.
I really thought she might pass away.

105
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,201
-How did you know?
-What?

106
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,745
Know what?

107
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,788
Well...

108
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:21,459
Even the doctors didn't realize
the state she was in.

109
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,253
How did you know?

110
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,425
Well, you know...

111
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,552
I had a feeling.

112
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,263
A feeling?

113
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,432
You know how I can often
guess things right.

114
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,477
You know,
that thing you always mentioned...

115
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,730
Right, the golden time. You said
it's critical not to miss that period.

116
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,733
I could feel that it was the golden time.

117
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,111
You felt that from a grandmother
who wasn't even showing pain?

118
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,321
Yes.

119
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,334
I should go to work now.

120
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,378
You should go, too.

121
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,712
I'll be off.

122
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:08,756
Hey, wait...

123
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,800
Yu-ri.

124
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,471
Yes? What is it?

125
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,101
Is your stomach okay?

126
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,563
Yes.

127
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,982
You should get some honey water.

128
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,778
I feel awful.

129
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,282
-Oh, my stomach.
-Drink up. Come on.

130
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,993
You always feel awful whenever you drink.

131
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,369
Why can't you stop drinking?

132
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,997
Stop nagging me, I'm about to die here.

133
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,040
You should just quit drinking, like me.

134
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,625
Come on, drink this.

135
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,378
I think I'm going to throw up
if I drink that.

136
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,840
But you should still drink this.
You're going to ruin your stomach.

137
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,676
I really can't drink anything right now.

138
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,845
Come on. Just a little bit.

139
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,930
-Just a bit.
-Do I really have to?

140
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,182
-Yes. Come on.
-It's like drinking poison.

141
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,769
Poison? Do you really think
your husband would do that?

142
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,356
-Okay. That's enough.
-Drink a bit more.

143
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,528
I'm fine. Don't worry.

144
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:38,095
-Yu-ri.
-I'm so happy.

145
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,743

148
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,673
Gang-hwa.

149
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,000
Wait...

150
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,293
Hey...

151
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:53,838
Oh, no...

152
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,589
This is awful.

153
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:57,758
What is this?

154
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,052
Open up.

155
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,638
Ms. Mi-dong.

156
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:05,599
You know nothing will be solved
by avoiding me.

157
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,730
All right.

158
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,442
Let's at least talk face-to-face, okay?

159
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,779
Let me at least see your face.

160
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,334
Who is that man?

161
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,212
What is it?

162
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,340
Ms. Mi-dong must be dating someone.

163
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,676
Oh, my. Someone so young?

164
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,345
It's the trend to date young men
these days.

165
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,181
-Really?
-She's doing well for herself.

166
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,432
Wait, that man...

167
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:48,684
He's an exorcist!

168
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,352
Exorcist?

169
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:03,324
My gosh. What should I do?

170
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,535
That poor thing.

171
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:14,752
You know, the civil servant
that got rid of all the ghosts in Seoul.

172
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,671
You're dead, so you should go up now.

173
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:20,466
Hand in hand with your friends.

174
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,678
He just sent up every ghost he saw
without giving them a chance.

175
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,388
So he has a success rate of 99.9 percent.

176
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,350
Since he took over Gangnam,
Gangdong, and Gangseo-gu,

177
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,060
all the ghosts have been annihilated.

178
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,229
But why is he here?

179
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,442
-We should run!
-Go! Hurry!

180
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,366
Are these rubber shoes or what?

181
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:51,914
This place looks like
it's from the Joseon Dynasty.

182
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,294
Even the shaman in the north
would be more elegant than this.

183
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:02,216
What? What is it? Why are you here?

184
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,344
What is a successful elite exorcist
doing here?

185
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,263
Do you really not know?

186
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,183
Why would an exorcist
with a 99.9 percent success rate

187
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:15,563
be sent to a cinerarium
with a zero percent success rate?

188
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:17,940
Why do you think they've sent me?

189
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,985
It's not zero percent.

190
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,362
I sent up two people a few days ago.

191
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,906
Wow, that is so amazing.

192
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,409
You sent as many as two people?

193
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,870
That's two in ten years. Isn't that right?

194
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:35,040
LEDGER

195
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,918
You couldn't even send up
a ghost who died from suicide.

196
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,507
How can you not even send up
those who were trying to...

197
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:44,758
reset their lives?

198
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,013
I'm at a loss for words.

199
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,017
I'll take care of everything.

200
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,978
Take a little break.

201
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,196
What are you going to do...

202
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,617
with Cha Yu-ri...

203
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,123
and Cho Seo-woo?

204
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,919
Wait, I'll take care of--

205
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,255
The deities sent a message
a long time ago.

206
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,841
Are you going to keep ignoring it?

207
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,468
No, don't.

208
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,470
I'll take care of it.

209
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,765
You can't do such a thing.
We should have pity on them.

210
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,852
Do you still not get it?

211
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:41,774
There isn't a single ghost
that isn't pitiful.

212
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,402
Wait...

213
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:46,403
Please.

214
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,708
CHA YU-RI

215
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,341
So I wonder...

216
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,801
What if...

217
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:16,183
What if Seo-woo keeps seeing ghosts?
What will happen?

218
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,810
It's nothing serious.

219
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:21,605
She will be just like me.

220
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,898
A shaman?

221
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,818
That can't be right.
I can't let it happen.

222
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,915
This is too harsh.

223
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,727
I was a ghost for five years.

224
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,646
I don't want anything else.

225
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,356
You're a mom. You know how I feel.

226
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,109
This is the only thing I can do

227
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,486
for Seo-woo, you know.

228
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,906
-Wait, Yu-ri.
-If you don't stop, I'll go up right now.

229
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,951
Gosh, I'm getting a headache.

230
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,375
What am I supposed to do? Oh, my gosh.

231
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,795
What... Oh, Ms. Jeon.

232
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,507
What are you doing there
when it's so cold outside?

233
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,303
Well, I just needed
some fresh air to think.

234
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,346
Did you buy groceries?

235
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,558
Would you like some coffee?

236
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,102
-Why not? It's been a while.
-Okay.

237
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,233
Thank you.

238
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,987
It's been a while since you came here.

239
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,366
You didn't come
in case you might run into Gang-hwa.

240
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,954
That's true...

241
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,750
but it was also because
I might be reminded of her.

242
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:14,927
I heard Yu-ri

243
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,763
is working as a pick-up helper

244
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:20,182
and a kitchen lady at the kindergarten.

245
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,101
Did Yu-ri tell you that?

246
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,771
No, I heard it from Gang-hwa.

247
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:30,150
I just couldn't talk about this
with Yu-ri.

248
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:35,155
She doesn't mention her kid to me either,
whether it's intentional or not.

249
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:37,449
Right...

250
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,035
She didn't say much to you either, right?

251
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:41,703
Well...

252
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:43,956
She didn't.

253
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,294
She came back from the dead,

254
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,714
but her husband isn't hers anymore,

255
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,926
and the baby she had for ten months
isn't hers, either.

256
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,303
She got rid of Seo-woo's things

257
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,889
in her room. I guess it upset her.

258
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,476
But...

259
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:07,104
you're happy, right?

260
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,233
I won't have...

261
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:15,112
any regrets even if I die right now.

262
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,416
Hyeon-jeong!

263
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,251
Yu-ri!

264
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:30,878
Mom?

265
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,923
What are you doing here, Mom?

266
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,384
Did Hyeon-jeong call you?

267
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,179
Mom, did she say anything strange to you?

268
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,099
"Anything strange"? What do you mean?

269
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,976
I was just passing by, so I came in.

270
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,228
Hey, can't I even give her
a cup of coffee?

271
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,565
I was just curious. Sorry.

272
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,027
Mom, let's go home. I'm really hungry.

273
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,446
My goodness. All right.

274
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:00,282
-Thank you. I'll visit again.
-Yes, Ms. Jeon.

275
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,659
-Let's go.
-Careful on your way back.

276
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,585
MISAENG

277
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,505
-You're that hungry?
-Yes.

278
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,341
-What did you get?
-No, it's fine.

279
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,176
-Let me hold that. Come on.
-It's fine.

280
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,559
You don't want to live?

281
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,146
You don't want to live at all?

282
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,775
I do.

283
00:20:37,027 --> 00:20:38,654
I really do, Hyeon-jeong.

284
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,370
SUPERNATURAL POWERS
SHAMAN MS. MI-DONG

285
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,961
-Mom.
-Yes?

286
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:55,879
What?

287
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,382
Nothing. I just wanted to call you.

288
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,426
Am I annoying you?

289
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,304
Of course not.

290
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,640
I love it.

291
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,145
I missed my daughter's chattering voice.

292
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,605
Really?

293
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,776
I could remember everything.

294
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,447
Your face, your character,

295
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,324
and even how your toes looked.

296
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,160
But...

297
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,999
one day, I couldn't remember your voice.

298
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,253
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't remember.

299
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,883
I felt so sorry about that.

300
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,138
You don't need to feel sorry.

301
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,641
They say the first thing
that people forget is sound.

302
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,601
It's just natural.

303
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:56,106
It's not natural for a mother
to forget her child's voice.

304
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,574
I don't know what kind of miracle this is,

305
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,411
but I pray every morning and night,

306
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:13,957
saying thank you to Buddha

307
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,542
again and again.

308
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,687
What? Is it pretty? Do you want it?

309
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:39,191
No, there's someone I want to buy it for.

310
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:42,027
Mom, wait here just for a moment.
I'll go and buy it.

311
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,247
Come inside before I beat you up.

312
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,543
Oh, I thought I came to the wrong room.

313
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:01,838
What...

314
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:07,427
Why are you sitting there like that
in a room without the owner?

315
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,348
I was doing some thinking.

316
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,602
Why are you thinking
in someone else's room?

317
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:17,938
You have a much bigger room.

318
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,327
He felt guilty.

319
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,579
I think he didn't seek help earlier

320
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:37,332
because his symptoms were
the only reminder of what happened.

321
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,292
He didn't want to forget everything.

322
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:43,839
But you're telling me that he's
receiving treatment nowadays, right?

323
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,925
-Yes, sir.
-Why?

324
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,096
He wouldn't do it
just because I made a fuss.

325
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,099
I guess there must have been
a change in his life recently.

326
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:56,768
He didn't tell me, though.

327
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,400
What is it? What?

328
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,402
If you need to scold me,
just get it over with.

329
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,488
Why are you looking at me
with that sad gaze? It doesn't suit you.

330
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,661
You were the only one who didn't sign.

331
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,831
So that's what this is about.
I'm not mandated to sign.

332
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,418
You were the one who started this proposal
to ban giving priority to VIP patients.

333
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:24,045
Will this change anything? Did it?

334
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,422
I see. You've changed.

335
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,424
You were dead set against it
when I started it.

336
00:24:27,507 --> 00:24:30,010
Now, you're on the front line of this.

337
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,810
I heard you're getting proper treatment.

338
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,355
Why?

339
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,901
Pardon? You told me to get treated.

340
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,320
Exactly. Why?

341
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,616
You've been refusing treatment
for five years.

342
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,118
You must have made up your mind somehow.

343
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,830
Made up my mind? I didn't do such a thing.

344
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,500
I just did it. Just because.

345
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,293
Why do you always say that?

346
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,254
Do you live just because you're alive?

347
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,339
Yes.

348
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,800
Hey, the old geezer is looking for you.

349
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,010
You crazy jerk.

350
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,347
He found you.

351
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:17,974
That punk.

352
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,896
You punk. Open the door.

353
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,148
You jerk.

354
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:41,873
PETITION AGAINST PRIORITIZING VIP PATIENTS

355
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,929
These are some lightweight glasses.

356
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,515
They will be way lighter
than the glasses you're wearing now.

357
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,308
Would you like to try them on?

358
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,937
You're going home early these days.

359
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,355
What do you have at home?

360
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,690
Something amazing.

361
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,985
What is this?

362
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,904
Come on. That brat again.

363
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,407
-Gosh, seriously.
-Why? Is it your sister again?

364
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,159
Yes. She wore my clothes again
without my permission.

365
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,371
And she always gets my clothes dirty
after wearing them. Seriously.

366
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,498
She's dead meat.

367
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,583
I'll get going now.

368
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,876
-Good work today.
-Bye.

369
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:28,813
Why is this here?

370
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,070
-Yu-ri, this is yours.
-Hey, this is yours.

371
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:40,075
Why is that in your hand?

372
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,333
Hey, you.

373
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,884
Mom! Look at Yeon-ji!

374
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,469
Damn it.

375
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,597
Put it down. Or I'll really kill you.

376
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:05,684
-Mom!
-I told you not to wear my clothes.

377
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,519
That's mine, too!

378
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,813
When you wear my clothes,
you always get them dirty!

379
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,524
I made myself very clear that I'd rip

380
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,734
all of your clothes
if you wear my clothes again.

381
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,903
How dare you talk
to your older sister like that?

382
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,699
Put that down right now!
Gang-hwa bought that for me!

383
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,367
As if I care!

384
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:25,203
Put down my clothes right now!

385
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,122
You're unbelievable.

386
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,133
You!

387
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,136
-You.
-You're unbelievable.

388
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,679
-You're done.
-How dare you?

389
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,597
Fine. It's the end for both of us!

390
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:46,224
-Let go.
-You must have a death wish.

391
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:00,780
Yu-ri.

392
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,621
My sister.

393
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,958
Don't cry.

394
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,628
Don't cry, Yeon-ji.

395
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,483
You look beautiful. It looks nice on you.

396
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,942
Really?

397
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,529
You should put this
in the center like this.

398
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:44,032
There.

399
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,576
-Dad.
-Hey.

400
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,917
What's wrong, Dad?

401
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:39,295
It's nothing. I'm all right.

402
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,672
I'm okay.

403
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,759
I'm fine.

404
00:30:58,731 --> 00:30:59,941
That fool.

405
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,902
I told him not to cry in front of her.

406
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,628
My bestie.

407
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,297
You're my bestie now.

408
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,507
Hey, she's my bestie!

409
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,508
She's mine.

410
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:26,885
-She's mine.
-Hey.

411
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,937
You seem to be in a good mood.

412
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,356
You think so? I guess I am.

413
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,400
You know Hyeon-jeong?

414
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,694
Hyeon-jeong? What about her?

415
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,822
I'm going to be friends with her now.
She seems like a nice person.

416
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,449
Yes. That sounds great.

417
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,869
Hyeon-jeong might be bad-tempered,
but deep down, she's a nice person.

418
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,079
I can't tell if it's a compliment or not.

419
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,625
I'm not going to be considerate
of you starting now.

420
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,876
What do you mean?

421
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,755
I want to be good friends
with Hyeon-jeong...

422
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,881
and...

423
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,550
the lady who resembles Yu-ri.

424
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:25,944
Seriously?

425
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,196
She has such a strong energy.

426
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,910
How many days does Yu-ri have left?

427
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:40,625
I'm not the type to disclose

428
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,419
personal information about people.

429
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,843
Has it reached a halfway point?
About 20 days?

430
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,680
She has 20 days?

431
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,269
That's less than a month.

432
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,278
Find her a way.

433
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:12,657
How could I find her a way?

434
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,826
It's not like I didn't try.

435
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,495
It doesn't have to be with Gang-hwa.

436
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,206
She belongs with her family.
That's her life, too.

437
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:21,165
Will that not work?

438
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,751
From our point of view,
that makes sense, too.

439
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,379
But as of now,
there's nothing I can do for her.

440
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:29,507
This isn't fair at all! Then you shouldn't
have brought her back to begin with.

441
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,050
You must be reasonable.

442
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,011
You can't bring her back
and take her again.

443
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,139
Well, I wasn't the one
who brought her back.

444
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:40,018
If Gang-hwa gets divorced
and Yu-ri goes back to her life with him,

445
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,188
she doesn't have to die? Are you sure?

446
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,065
Well...

447
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:50,445
Ha-jun, Mama Hippo
disappeared this morning

448
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,572
without telling us why.

449
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,824
-Where do you think she went?
-To the zoo.

450
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,285
To the zoo? What? What am I seeing?

451
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:01,789
I didn't know she comes out to meet
her clients, too. She's so diligent.

452
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,459
Ha-jun, do you want
to look around the zoo?

453
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,421
Are you sure about that?

454
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,465
Well,

455
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,176
you know...

456
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,927
First of all...

457
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,971
Gosh, he startled me.

458
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,806
Jeez.

459
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,852
My goodness. You'd better leave. You...

460
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:25,730
Hey, get lost.

461
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,275
Go!

462
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,943
Leave.

463
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,822
What's that punk doing with him?

464
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,993
Pardon?

465
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,579
No, it's nothing.

466
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,290
What?

467
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,169
-It hurts! You're hurting me.
-Unbelievable.

468
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:52,006
-It hurts!
-Why are you glued to that doctor?

469
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,425
No, I was just following him around.

470
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,927
That's the same thing.

471
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,513
You're harassing him
because he didn't diagnose you properly.

472
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:01,474
-Okay, fine. Let go of me first.
-Come here.

473
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,185
-Come here.
-I'll go. Fine.

474
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,771
-I've been too lenient on you.
-Why are you so strong?

475
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,232
-Look over there.
-What are you doing?

476
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,998
PARK HYE-JIN

477
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,458
You're first.

478
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,544
You'll leave first.

479
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,802
You heard that, right?

480
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,140
If you committed suicide
to start a new life,

481
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,433
we should hurry this up,
so you're reincarnated.

482
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,936
She's not the only one
who committed suicide!

483
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:51,107
He committed suicide, too.
Take him with you first.

484
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,942
Damn it.

485
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,657
Who said he committed suicide?

486
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,458
No deaths here...

487
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,545
are as wrongful and cruel as his death.

488
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,480
Isn't sending the kids to school
the hardest?

489
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:32,773
-Tell me about it.
-It's hard.

490
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,317
It's especially hard for Chi-in.

491
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,735
Well, you know.

492
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,778
Excuse me.

493
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,073
-Yes?
-Are you just coming to work?

494
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,367
It's not time for me to go home yet.

495
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,077
That's true.

496
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:46,245
Wait.

497
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,083
I heard you're a kitchen assistant
and Seo-woo's pick-up helper, too.

498
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,293
Right.

499
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:55,004
Seo-woo's mother is hard to please.
It must be very hard.

500
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:59,050
-Excuse me?
-Seo-woo is different from the other kids.

501
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:01,552
You know, she's a bit slow.
Don't you agree?

502
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,429
Hey.

503
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:07,934
Seo-woo...

504
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,938
is slow compared to other six-year-olds.

505
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:17,526
However, I've been observing
other kids at the kindergarten,

506
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,403
and there are kids
who are slower than her.

507
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,529
-My gosh.
-Like who?

508
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,448
-Who are they?
-Isn't it Ha-jun?

509
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,076
Mi-so.

510
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,161
-Chi-in.
-What?

511
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,537
Eun-bi.

512
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,957
Seriously.

513
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,212
What did she just say to me?

514
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,922
My Mi-so is slow?

515
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,425
What? Chi-in is slow? Has she gone mad?

516
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,761
My daughter isn't slow!

517
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,930
They don't want me to badmouth their kids.

518
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,933
Only their kids are precious.
They are such nasty mothers.

519
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,269
You think you'll live forever, right?

520
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:54,939
You know what? Wait until you die.
You'll regret wasting time like that.

521
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:56,774
What?

522
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:03,823
Seo-woo's mom

523
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,825
is going to abandon Seo-woo.

524
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,578
Hello, Mi-so. What are you doing?

525
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,415
I'm playing a secret-sharing game.

526
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,459
A secret-sharing game? What secret?

527
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:19,755
Seo-woo's mom is going to abandon Seo-woo.

528
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:24,677
What?

529
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,764
Who told you such a thing, Mi-so?

530
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:32,435
I heard my mom
and my dad talking about it.

531
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,112
Goodness.

532
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,865
I can't believe those women.

533
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,913
-Honey, what are you doing?
-Yes?

534
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,081
Give me a second.

535
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:59,003
I must tell Chi-in and Eun-bi's mom
about Seo-woo and Ha-jun's mom.

536
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:03,716
My goodness. Come on.
You must be bored out of your mind.

537
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,635
Here's today's update.

538
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:09,013
Seo-woo's mom filed for divorce
but didn't ask for alimony.

539
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,306
Why?

540
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:13,851
Ha-jun's dad was the late baseball player,
Kang Bin's shrink.

541
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,854
Kang Bin's fans threw eggs at him
for dereliction of duty.

542
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:18,147
Send.

543
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,863
What is this?

544
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,241
GROUP CHATROOM WITH MOTHERS
FROM SUNSHINE CLASS

545
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,327
Oh, no.

546
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:32,661
What is it?

547
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,206
No. What am I going to do?

548
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,500
No, don't read it!

549
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,794
-What am I going to do?
-What is it?

550
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,962
MI-SO'S MOM: HERE'S TODAY'S UPDATE

551
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:48,344
She must think I'm a joke.
I can't believe this bitch!

552
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,140
Hyeon-jeong.

553
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:02,566
Hey, this is the wrong chatroom.

554
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,818
Unbelievable.

555
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,822
MI-SO'S MOM LEFT THE CHATROOM

556
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,754
-People are awfully mean.
-Aren't they?

557
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,757
I thought you didn't care.

558
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,009
Yes, it doesn't get on my nerves.

559
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,304
You keep lying to yourself.

560
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,015
Of course, it's concerning
when people insult you.

561
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,809
Everyone stands up for themselves.

562
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,811
We don't pretend like we're okay.

563
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:40,813
-Really?
-Of course.

564
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,190
Even deities get angry
when they're slandered.

565
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,861
Should we face them and end this together?

566
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,705
They must be out of their minds!

567
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,665
How could they say that
in front of their kid?

568
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,000
Here.

569
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,713
Unbelievable. Those crazy bitches.

570
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,131
They must have gone nuts!

571
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:10,176
Why don't they just put up
a notice at the kindergarten?

572
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,344
How should we destroy these bitches?

573
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,977
Should we just give them hell?

574
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,026
Give them hell? Do what?

575
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:31,363
Why do you always torture people?
No, Hyeon-jeong. Don't do that.

576
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:33,240
Honey. Hello?

577
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,160
This is bad.

578
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,287
There's never a quiet day for you guys.

579
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,122
I'm getting tired of that.

580
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,458
You have two problems on your hands.

581
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:43,667
What are you talking about?

582
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,420
What did she say?

583
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,978
Don't you remember Bruce Lee of Yeouido?

584
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,187
Didn't I tell you?

585
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,023
My life will be over
trying to pay the settlement money.

586
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,400
You're in the same boat.

587
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,235
Gosh, Yu-ri.

588
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,530
Have you forgotten
how Hyeon-jeong and Yu-ri met?

589
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:55,781
How could I forget?

590
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,536
A BOOKSTORE IN 1999

591
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,705
Let go of it. I grabbed it first.

592
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,082
Stop lying. I grabbed it first.

593
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:08,544
It's crystal clear
that I grabbed it first.

594
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,670
I grabbed it first.

595
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,047
You're ridiculous. Hey!

596
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,301
-Hey.
-Let go. Let go of me.

597
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,969
I can't believe this. Hey.

598
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:18,721
-Hey! You and your stupid yellow.
-Hey.

599
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,763
Bruce Lee of Yeouido.

600
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,432
Gandalf of Yeouido.

601
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,691
Hold on. What is Min-jeong
doing in the middle?

602
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,695
A sidekick?

603
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,335
Seo-woo. Ha-jun.

604
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:01,138
Let's cover up your legs.

605
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:06,268
Hyeon-jeong.

606
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,317
Hyeon-jeong, wait. Hold on.
Let's talk about this.

607
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,070
Hyeon-jeong!

608
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,572
I'm playing with your mom.

609
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:21,408
Go over there and play with your friends.

610
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,371
My goodness. What is this? Oh, no.

611
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:27,998
Goodness.

612
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,585
Hey! You!

613
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,966
My gosh. It hurts! Hey, I'm on your side!

614
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,512
What is it? Oh, no.

615
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,014
-No!
-Hey!

616
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:07,222
Did you see their faces?
We totally destroyed them.

617
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,517
Look at us.
I can't believe you two fought them.

618
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,643
Really?

619
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,229
You had Mi-so's mom in a headlock.

620
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,355
You almost killed her.

621
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,649
No way.
That's not nearly enough to kill her.

622
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,569
Min-jeong was amazing.
She used a baseball bat to beat them

623
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,154
-with a blank look.
-Right.

624
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,740
It wasn't a real baseball bat.
It was a toy.

625
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,699
-No way.
-My gosh.

626
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:26,909
It was enough to kill people.

627
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,577
-You swung it big like this.
-Right.

628
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,039
-I thought Chi-in's mom was going to die.
-Same here.

629
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,957
But that felt nice.

630
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,793
I thought she was our sidekick,

631
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,836
-but she was our boss.
-Exactly.

632
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,213
The boss?

633
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,839
The boss, the leader, and the head.

634
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,758
Okay.

635
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:46,762
You two had great teamwork
when we fought. Did you rehearse it?

636
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,683
We even fought  on our first encounter.

637
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:54,353
A fan of Sechs Kies. A fan of H.O.T.

638
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:57,022
Really?

639
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,025
I don't think
you would have liked any idol groups.

640
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:01,360
-Right.
-You only studied, right?

641
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,445
I had a favorite, too.

642
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:04,780
Who?

643
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:06,240
Hey, let go of me!

644
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,242
-You let go first!
-It's mine!

645
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,868
-I picked it up first!
-Stop it!

646
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,829
-I'm going to kill you.
-Let me go!

647
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:14,081
-I'm going to tell everyone.
-Let go!

648
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,958
-I got it first!
-They're on the cover!

649
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,292
A lackey?

650
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:19,086
Hey.

651
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,588
Hyeon-jeong and Yu-ri
are Guan Yu and Zhang Fei,

652
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,048
but Min-jeong is Zhuge Liang.

653
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,884
They lose their temper easily,
but they're stupid.

654
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,806
Hyeon-jeong is Guan Yu. She's the oldest.

655
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,892
Yes, sure. Congrats.

656
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,477
Thanks.

657
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,730
Darn it. Hey.

658
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:43,402
Is it really okay to let them hang out?

659
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,281
What will you do
when Min-jeong finds out later?

660
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,871
She likes Hyeon-jeong and Yu-ri.

661
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:00,043
Min-jeong never liked anyone this much.

662
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,093
How did things end up like this?

663
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,470
What do you think?

664
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:13,515
Yu-ri begged us not to tell. That's why.

665
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,227
Gosh, Hyeon-jeong doesn't say anything,

666
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,563
but she's probably dying between them.

667
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:21,440
She's so worried
that she can't seem to sleep.

668
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:23,150
And she's losing her hair too.

669
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,864
Cheers!

670
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,330
Just thinking about
Eun-bi's mom makes me laugh.

671
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,708
I feel kind of bad for her.
She didn't do anything wrong,

672
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,960
but I went in there and did that.

673
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:44,212
She's the nicest, so I feel really bad.

674
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:50,135
Hey, I need to use the restroom.

675
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,559
That's not the restroom.

676
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:00,479
She's just going out to get some air.
Let her go.

677
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,814
I see.

678
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,483
Do you want another drink?

679
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,278
SEO-WOO'S MOM FILED FOR DIVORCE
BUT DIDN'T ASK FOR ALIMONY. WHY?

680
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,965
Don't you feel much better
now that you made an example of them?

681
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,259
How did you hold yourself back
until now?

682
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:16,096
I didn't. I vented in my own way.

683
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:17,347
By drinking alone?

684
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,849
How did you know?

685
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,769
Your physiognomy?

686
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,149
You're one strange woman.

687
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,861
At times, you seem to know me
better than myself.

688
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:35,741
It's not easy for someone
to see who they are.

689
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:38,535
We're busy watching over others.

690
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:40,954
Is that so?

691
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:43,081
And that shows how nice you are.

692
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,584
It's freezing.

693
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,003
-I need to go to the restroom too.
-Sure.

694
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,308
Min-jeong.

695
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,601
Yes?

696
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:03,977
May I...

697
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,772
ask you something?

698
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,648
Sure. Go ahead.

699
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:13,487
Will you...

700
00:51:15,238 --> 00:51:16,490
get divorced?

701
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,706
The chat room.

702
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,422
No.

703
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:19,511
I'm not getting divorced.

704
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,475
Weren't you going to?

705
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,984
You caught me.

706
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,322
I was going to.

707
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:41,741
I grew too weary.

708
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:49,416
Everyone tried to stop me
when I said I was marrying him.

709
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,377
But I was confident.

710
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,588
I liked him too much.

711
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,301
But over time, I began to realize

712
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:00,969
that this is...

713
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:06,391
far from easy.

714
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:14,065
Other couples

715
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:18,028
work together to lay one brick on another

716
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,989
to make their own home.

717
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,491
But I...

718
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:31,291
felt like I had been
repairing a house after it was bombed.

719
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,045
Our house had marks

720
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:40,425
from the bombing here and there.

721
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,642
It's not a memory one can easily forget.

722
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,063
Right.

723
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,401
There's a room
somewhere in Gang-hwa's heart.

724
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,239
He knows he has that room...

725
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,325
and so do you.

726
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:07,619
You know, right?

727
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,292
I do.

728
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:20,131
It's a room I should never open up

729
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:23,969
even if everyone in this world
opens up to look at it.

730
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,014
And that was really tough.

731
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,562
That's why I wanted...

732
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:36,940
to get divorced.

733
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:43,863
But?

734
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,243
But come to think about it,

735
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,502
I love him too much.

736
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,513
Gang-hwa loves her!

737
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,726
Oh, Min-jeong.

738
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:17,355
Gang-hwa loves her, doesn't he?

739
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:21,818
You know that.

740
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:35,123
You like that nurse. Stop denying it.

741
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,541
I don't like her.

742
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:38,043
I don't.

743
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,503
No, Hyeon-jeong.

744
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,966
Will you live your entire life
missing Yu-ri?

745
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,927
Is your life over without her?

746
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,473
What's so bad about liking someone else?
You didn't do anything wrong.

747
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,810
What's next?

748
00:55:58,772 --> 00:55:59,981
What do I do next?

749
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,236
Date her?

750
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,280
Marry her?

751
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,116
Why not? If you like each other, go ahead.

752
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,792
Yu-ri would want that too.

753
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,845
-Happy?
-My goodness.

754
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,056
Pretty flowers.

755
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,063
-Go.
-Yes. Okay.

756
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,106
Okay.

757
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,707
Hyeon-jeong.

758
00:57:09,884 --> 00:57:11,511
Were you talking about something serious?

759
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:14,889
Put it here.

760
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:18,017
Right there.

761
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,271
Good job. That's it.

762
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,607
Gosh, great job.
What else should we put there, Seo-woo?

763
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:31,614
Ta-da. Where should we put this?

764
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:34,617
Hey.

765
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,036
Where are you going, Seo-woo?

766
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,542
Why did you bring that?

767
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:55,805
Gosh, great job.
Did you want to put it there?

768
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:59,100
But Seo-woo, who is this?

769
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,269
Cha Yu-ri.

770
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,357
Seo-woo.

771
00:58:07,942 --> 00:58:09,068
Who?

772
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:10,320
Cha Yu-ri.

773
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,573
Gosh, you're so good. Is it fun?

774
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,867
Is it?

775
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,328
-Is it fun?
-Yu-ri.

776
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:19,954
-Gosh, it's so fun.
-Cha Yu-ri!

777
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,582
What?

778
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,585
-We need to go.
-Where?

779
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,879
-There's something going on.
-Let's go.

780
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:29,255
What is it?

781
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:23,142
2015

782
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,733
It has been days.

783
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,069
You said you'd do it today.

784
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:35,405
I mean,

785
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:39,242
that's concrete,
so I can't do it with a normal nail.

786
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,202
I need an electric drill and all.

787
00:59:41,286 --> 00:59:43,329
You said that yesterday!

788
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,915
You said you'd bring it and do it today!

789
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:48,334
I'm feeling heavy enough already.

790
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,129
Do you know how hard it is
to pick up the vacuum?

791
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,047
-I'm sorry.
-Darn it.

792
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,633
I completely forgot.

793
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:01,806
I'll make sure I get everything tomorrow
and have it done, honey.

794
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,558
Don't worry. I mean it.

795
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:06,644
If I don't do it tomorrow,
I won't even call myself a human.

796
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:10,273
And honey, it doesn't really fall over
if you let it stand like this.

797
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,357
-Don't worry.
-Darn you.

798
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:21,075
My gosh, seriously.

799
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,164
Gosh.

800
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,366
If I had known the time given to us

801
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:04,077
was this short,

802
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,413
I would have treasured

803
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:10,750
every insignificant moment.

804
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,396
But life

805
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,732
left some more time for me.

806
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:09,600
Are you insane? Why would I
call out her name around Seo-woo?

807
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:12,603
Seo-woo knew Yu-ri's name.
She called her Cha Yu-ri.

808
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,897
-You know who I am, right?
-Yes.

809
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,023
I'm sorry.

810
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,277
Min-jeong, let's get a new pick-up helper.

811
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,613
That exorcist will be back.
Stay by your daughter and protect her.

812
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:23,823
What's all this?

813
01:02:23,906 --> 01:02:26,451
If someone tries to take Seo-woo,

814
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,202
spray this in their eyeballs, okay?

815
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,330
I'm here for your daughter.

816
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:32,957
Seo-woo.

817
