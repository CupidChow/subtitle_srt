1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,294
What are you talking about?

2
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,422
You can't go.
Your due date is the day after tomorrow.

3
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:51,134
Goodness. It's okay, Mom.
It won't kill me.

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,553
I know it's work, but you're almost--

5
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,599
Okay. I'll finish it quickly,
and go straight home.

6
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:58,933
My goodness.

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:02,395
There's no stopping her.

8
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,607
Gosh, look at the time.

9
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:07,859
Is Yu-ri going somewhere?

10
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:12,072
Someone who bought her work
asked her to fix something.

11
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,949
She's due soon,
she shouldn't be going around.

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,409
Why didn't you stop her?

13
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:18,036
She doesn't listen to me.

14
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,540
She said she'd be quick,
so she should be fine.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,669
So, what did you say you dreamed about?

16
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:28,671
I don't know. I don't remember.

17
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,091
I woke up this morning feeling weird.

18
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,509
I feel uneasy.

19
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,595
It means nothing
since you don't remember.

20
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,477
Goodness, it's all done.

21
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,445
Hello?

22
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,864
Yes, it is.

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,002
I wish there was an emergency blinker

24
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,713
for the bad luck that suddenly drops in.

25
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,884
I can't avoid the pain
that's about to rush in,

26
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,928
but I can prepare myself.

27
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:20,181
They said

28
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,893
his name would give him a short life.

29
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,149
I thought nothing of it.

30
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,235
Why did I do that?

31
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,407
If only I had changed his name...

32
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:40,827
I feel like

33
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,788
it's my fault.

34
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,711
Everyday I want to turn back time

35
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,840
to that day tens of thousands of times.

36
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,636
If only I had stopped her

37
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,182
from going to work

38
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,560
just for five minutes.

39
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:06,978
No,

40
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,733
just for one more minute,

41
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,777
then she'd still be here.

42
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,408
Why didn't I stop her?

43
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,172
But even if there is a blinker,

44
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:39,260
bad luck will never turn it on
for us to notice it.

45
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,096
She died because of me.

46
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,769
I killed her.

47
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,230
I did.

48
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,317
I killed her.

49
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,156
Bring Yu-ri back.

50
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,575
Bring her back.

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,746
Bring her back, you jerk.

52
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,957
Bring Yu-ri back.

53
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,876
So you don't have to blame yourself

54
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,379
for not seeing it coming.

55
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:19,968
EPISODE 14: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

56
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,263
Min-jeong.

57
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,100
Why are you crying? Don't cry.

58
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,727
It's not your fault. Okay?

59
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,940
Then whose fault is it?

60
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,362
Is it because you're at the hospital
all day long?

61
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,327
I hired a pick-up helper
to return to work, then lost my child.

62
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,747
And Seo-woo

63
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,795
is slower and grayer than most children.

64
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,008
If these aren't my fault,
whose fault is it?

65
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,553
Am I not her mother?

66
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:04,846
Min-jeong.

67
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:10,351
When something is wrong with a kid,
everyone blames the mother.

68
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,147
Why do you always say it's not my fault?

69
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,191
You said I'm Seo-woo's mother.

70
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,779
Am I really her mother?

71
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,037
I'm sorry.

72
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,748
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,295
Why are you always

74
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,423
sorry

75
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,177
and fine?

76
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:08,326
Cha Yu-ri.

77
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,457
Those three syllables
are taboo words to me.

78
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,461
How long

79
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,090
will you keep that door shut?

80
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,885
How long will you keep that door
locked up?

81
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,598
You have to open that door
for me to go in.

82
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,354
That's the only way
I can truly be Seo-woo's mom.

83
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:01,879
The pick-up helper.

84
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:09,679
That's her.

85
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:11,722
Yu-ri.

86
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,517
Cha Yu-ri.

87
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:29,657
What

88
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:32,785
do you...

89
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,581
What do you mean?

90
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:44,589
Seo-woo's biological mother.

91
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,341
Cha Yu-ri.

92
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,763
She came back to life.

93
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:04,525
I'm sorry, but could you please leave?

94
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,945
I really don't want to see you right now.

95
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,073
How... How can you lose her? How?

96
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,375
Seo-woo, you're up.

97
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,923
Good morning, Seo-woo.
Shall we wash up?

98
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,220
Min-jeong.

99
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,613
All done.

100
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:23,748
Okay.

101
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,136
Stay here for a minute.

102
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,329
You need to get ready for work.
You're late.

103
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:06,666
I know you can't believe it.

104
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,212
Because I couldn't either.

105
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,384
No, I don't believe it.

106
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,220
It doesn't make sense.

107
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,597
Does this make sense to you?

108
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,557
The kitchen assistant.

109
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,769
The pick-up helper is Seo-woo's mom?

110
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:28,688
She came back to life?

111
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,399
Stop joking around.

112
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,735
Why would I make a joke like this?

113
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:37,655
Exactly.
Why would someone joke around like this?

114
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,576
This is the worst you've ever been.

115
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,415
It's unbelievable,

116
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,000
but it's true.

117
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,043
I don't believe it.

118
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,466
Then why did you cry so much?

119
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,181
Fine.

120
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,977
Let's say what you're saying is true.

121
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,272
Then

122
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,153
why did you tell me this now?

123
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,660
I'm sorry.

124
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,125
At first, I was flustered,

125
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,712
so I couldn't tell you. But...

126
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,132
you can't be the only one
who doesn't know.

127
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,051
Min-jeong.

128
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,137
Believe it or not,

129
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:46,807
it's true.

130
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,524
MISAENG

131
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,073
-Excuse me.
-Gosh.

132
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:07,161
-What's up with him?
-Why are you following me?

133
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,999
Can you see me?
Do you see ghosts, too?

134
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,626
Can you see me?

135
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,338
Are you on my left or right?

136
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,007
-Where are you?
-Gosh.

137
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,050
Darn.

138
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:25,012
No, I'm a Christian.

139
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,264
I don't believe in ghosts.

140
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,976
I think I believe it a little.

141
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,645
I did.

142
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,480
It's because I go to fortunetellers.

143
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,066
Why did Yu-ri tell me that?

144
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,777
Gosh, he's no fun.

145
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,199
Hyeon-jeong.

146
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,329
Hyeon-jeong.

147
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,461
-Hyeon-jeong!
-Yes? What?

148
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,922
How spicy do you want that to be?

149
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,549
Goodness.

150
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,344
-What is it this time?
-Oh, gosh.

151
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,429
Is it because of Yu-ri?

152
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,229
Did you sigh while talking about her?

153
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,188
Excuse me?

154
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,692
You're the one who always sighs
because of her.

155
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,737
I'm just worried about Yu-ri,
and I feel bad for her.

156
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,739
That's all.

157
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,033
Yu-ri is Seo-woo's mom,

158
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,078
so I want to help her,
but it's complicated.

159
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,164
That's why I keep sighing.

160
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,042
Gang-hwa and you feel the same way, too.

161
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,420
I now understand

162
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,965
why Yu-ri hid from us

163
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,719
instead of coming to us first.

164
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:48,888
Why?

165
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,640
Everyone is having a hard time
because I came back.

166
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,311
Because of me, Gang-hwa and you
are such in pain.

167
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,855
I shouldn't have gotten caught.

168
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:02,109
What is it?

169
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,611
Hey.

170
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,032
-Watch the shop for me.
-Why?

171
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,200
Where are you going?

172
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:11,869
Hyeon-jeong, don't go.

173
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,413
I can't look after the store alone
right now.

174
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,457
I'm in a state of great fear.

175
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,250
Hyeon-jeong!

176
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,671
Are you out of your mind?

177
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,673
How can you take your eyes off her?

178
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,676
She was right behind me.

179
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,846
It was really just for a second.

180
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,097
Within that second...

181
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:37,353
I knew something was strange last night.

182
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,481
Did Gang-hwa's wife say something?

183
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,943
Why wouldn't she
when the pick-up helper lost her kid?

184
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,906
Gosh, you idiot!

185
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,241
Idiot!

186
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,412
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

187
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,752
OH MIN-JEONG
I'M SORRY

188
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,849
-Pil-seung's family?
-Yes.

189
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,769
Guk-bong was grilling them
to find out where Seo-woo was,

190
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,813
and they threw a fit not to tell him.

191
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,232
I heard she was hiding in the playground.

192
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,609
Yes, in a slide.

193
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,528
They hid her well.

194
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,780
I guess they're pretty loyal.

195
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,534
They were taken away from there.

196
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,496
Where is Pil-seung's family now?

197
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,129
No way...

198
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,465
They're gone.

199
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,177
Come on. Don't mess with me.

200
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,015
They're a tenacious bunch.
They've been holding out for 20 years.

201
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,518
They're gone just like that

202
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,186
because of Seo-woo?

203
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,148
It's been 20 years,
so it's about time they left.

204
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,108
They held out a long time.

205
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:09,778
I don't believe it.

206
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:13,657
Well...

207
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,995
They were taken
because they were hiding Seo-woo?

208
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,788
It's okay.

209
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,582
They made the choice.

210
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,460
They understand how a mother feels.

211
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,506
You'll be up there soon.

212
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,593
Thank them when you get there.

213
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,142
I should cook for Pil-seung one more time.

214
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,145
Like you got enough time.

215
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,856
Don't worry about others.

216
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,568
Enjoy what you can while you're here.
You idiot.

217
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,911
I can't believe what they did.
I'm so grateful.

218
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,291
But I can't thank them
because they're gone.

219
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,796
-Yu-ri.
-Yes, Mom?

220
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,215
Come out. Hyeon-jeong is here.

221
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,634
Really?

222
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,260
What is it?

223
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,845
Hyeon-jeong is here.

224
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,388
Okay.

225
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:30,484
Hey.

226
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:32,319
What is this?

227
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,780
Hey, hop in.

228
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,699
Hyeon-jeong.

229
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,202
What's this? Where did you get it?

230
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,579
Why do you even ask? I'm hip like this.

231
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,664
Get in.

232
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,667
-Is it really okay?
-Sure.

233
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,710
Yeon-ji! Bring your sister's bag!

234
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:52,756
My gosh.

235
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,928
What are you waiting for? Hop in.

236
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:10,941
All right then. Shall we go?

237
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,442
Where are we going?

238
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,111
Anywhere.

239
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:16,113
We can go anywhere you want.

240
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,202
She's finally smiling.

241
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,664
Gosh, I can tell they are soul mates.

242
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,669
Mom, I think Hyeon-jeong
is the best. Right?

243
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,315
-Yu-ri, do you like it?
-I love it.

244
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,984
It feels so refreshing!

245
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,278
I like it too!

246
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,779
All right. Let's go.

247
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:58,864
One.

248
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,033
Two. Three!

249
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,787
This is amazing.

250
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,210
I'm so excited!

251
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,045
-Yu-ri.
-Yes?

252
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:15,964
Are you all right?
Do you want to go back down?

253
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:16,882
I'm fine.

254
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,176
You don't seem fine though.

255
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,260
I'm okay.

256
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,137
-I'm okay--
-Hyeon-jeong.

257
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,683
Gosh, no. This isn't right.

258
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,436
No!

259
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:31,813
Yu-ri.

260
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,941
Hyeon-jeong.

261
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,090
I love the scenery.

262
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:13,939
Hyeon-jeong, hurry.

263
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,478
Is this for me?

264
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:17,044
DON'T JOKE AROUND LIKE THAT AGAIN

265
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:34,978
OPERATION SCHEDULE

266
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,605
You're joining my case tomorrow.

267
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,025
I said I don't want to do this.

268
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,818
-Why not?
-Just because.

269
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:43,904
I'm not doing it.

270
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,614
Why not?

271
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,200
Why don't you want to do it?

272
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,077
You've been okay with the counseling.

273
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,912
You need to face this to get better.

274
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,123
Will you keep living as a doctor
who can't operate?

275
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:58,919
Maybe later.

276
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,545
I'll do it later.

277
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,130
When would it be?

278
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,841
It's about time
to stop torturing yourself.

279
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,894
-Here.
-Thanks.

280
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,689
This is the Cha Yu-ri I know.

281
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,819
Yu-ri.

282
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,487
Yes?

283
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,030
For the past five years,

284
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,119
were you around me as well?

285
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,706
Of course.
I stuck around you all the time.

286
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,670
You would remember my birthdays
even when I would forget.

287
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:46,466
Maybe I was struggling not to forget you.

288
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,011
I guess that's why.

289
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,056
After you left,

290
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,725
it didn't really hit me at first.

291
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,272
When I studied abroad,
we didn't see each other for about a year.

292
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:02,941
It was like that.

293
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,695
I felt like you were just away
for a little bit.

294
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:09,948
And once...

295
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:13,493
I realized that I would never be able
to see you again,

296
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,372
I couldn't even eat.

297
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,541
I just cried my eyes out.

298
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,670
But after a little while,

299
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,839
I felt hungry again.

300
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,010
So I started to eat,

301
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,970
take care of Ha-jun,

302
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:33,180
and work.

303
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,226
And one day,

304
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:42,689
I realized

305
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,734
that I was slowly forgetting about you.

306
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:51,990
I celebrated your birthdays
because I wanted to cling on to you.

307
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:55,035
Because I was sorry for you.

308
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,873
And you knew it, right?

309
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:01,625
Of course, I did.

310
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,295
Actually I was sad
that you were forgetting about me.

311
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,423
But

312
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:13,637
I was more afraid of not being forgotten.

313
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,101
Watching people struggle because of me,

314
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:22,896
was real hell.

315
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:25,649
Gang-hwa?

316
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,446
So you knew it too.

317
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,074
That he has a problem.

318
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,744
I do. I was around him all the time.

319
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,331
He was recently put on probation.

320
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,083
I found that out later on though.

321
00:25:46,836 --> 00:25:48,505
That's what I did to him.

322
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,216
I broke his heart.

323
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,093
How is that your fault?

324
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:54,928
It's not like you wanted to die.

325
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,765
But it was my choice.

326
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,853
I just made him feel guilty.

327
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,209
Where did she go, leaving me all alone?

328
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,171
Oh, right.

329
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:32,924
That's right.

330
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,266
SUPERNATURAL POWERS
SHAMAN MS. MI-DONG

331
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,644
SEO BONG-YEON

332
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,327
I know he's a stone-hearted human,

333
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:05,248
but how could he send them up
just like that?

334
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:06,791
Exactly.

335
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,294
I didn't even get to say goodbye. Damn it.

336
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,593
You guys are not human.

337
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,721
To Guk-bong...

338
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,182
I mean, to people,

339
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,809
you guys are just demons
who should be sent up.

340
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,603
How could you say something so harsh?

341
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:27,896
I know.

342
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,024
So if you don't want to get caught
and sent up all of a sudden,

343
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,859
stop avoiding Guk-bong

344
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:37,364
and get over your regrets in this world.

345
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,369
This is really frustrating.

346
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,002
Hello?

347
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,379
Hello, ma'am.

348
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,798
Do you make domiciliary visits?

349
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:55,965
What?

350
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,724
Min-jeong. Believe it or not,

351
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,601
it's true.

352
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,453
What are you doing?

353
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,330
Get off, Yu-ri.

354
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,835
You said we'd hang out at my place.

355
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,921
We'll be drinking.
Let's leave the car here and walk.

356
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,927
I'm hungry. Let's go.

357
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,609
-I'm so hungry.
-Me too.

358
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,695
-I shouted too much.
-I know.

359
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:01,531
I couldn't help it
because you were driving so fast.

360
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,585
-Is it here?
-Yes.

361
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:14,669
It's for us.

362
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:16,629
-It just came right on time.
-I know.

363
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:18,715
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

364
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,300
It's pork belly meat.

365
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,802
-Let's go.
-Mom, Yu-ri and Hyeon-jeong are here.

366
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:25,054
Gosh, I can't wait.

367
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,057
-Let's eat.
-It must be really good.

368
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,436
Hello, Ms. Jeon.

369
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,282
CHA MU-PUNG, JEON EUN-SUK,
CHA YU-RI, CHA YEON-JI

370
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,155
-It looks delicious.
-It's warm.

371
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,240
My goodness.

372
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,408
-I'm hungry.
-It looks great.

373
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,370
Here's a cold beer for you.

374
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,205
Yeon-ji, you're the best.

375
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,748
We have five drinkers here.

376
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,458
This is far from enough.

377
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,544
I don't drink beer.

378
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,461
I like soju.

379
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,840
I knew it. You're so my type.

380
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,801
Mom, I'll get you soju.

381
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,553
-Here, Dad.
-My daughter is the best.

382
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,595
Gosh.

383
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,680
It's good, isn't it?

384
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,350
-This is nice.
-Dad, please open this for me.

385
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:53,393
Give me that.

386
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,103
All right.

387
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,106
It's open.

388
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,401
It flew away like this.

389
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,403
Let's drink.

390
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,488
Here. Have some of this.

391
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,282
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

392
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,242
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

393
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,747
It tastes so good.

394
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,920
So we're all together with Hyeon-jeong.

395
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,672
It's been so long since we did this.

396
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,048
I know.

397
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,801
I've been too busy
working and raising my kid.

398
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,846
She was just afraid
she would remind us of Yu-ri,

399
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,598
so she was being thoughtful.

400
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,350
Do you think I don't know that?

401
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,854
I had no idea

402
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,899
this day would come again.

403
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,110
What are you doing, Dad? This isn't right.

404
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,488
She's right. Why are you being so silly?

405
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:48,865
Okay. I get it.

406
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,575
-I'm done. It's over.
-It's over.

407
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,953
-Mr. Cha, please stop.
-What's over?

408
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,873
It's nothing.
Your dad is just being lame again.

409
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,917
Mom, where did you learn how to say that?

410
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,294
-Sure.
-She says all kinds of stuff.

411
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,421
-Gosh, Dad.
-Stop it.

412
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,093
-It tastes good.
-So did you guys have fun?

413
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,428
Yes. We had a lot of fun.

414
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,848
Her driving has improved a lot.
She couldn't even drive at 50km/h before.

415
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,183
That was a long time ago.

416
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,187
That's not true.
I was a novice driver back then.

417
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,606
Still, that is too slow.

418
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,484
Here, Yu-ri. Try this.

419
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,861
You seem to have only one daughter.

420
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,155
You're my son. All right.

421
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,991
I didn't know I was a son.

422
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:35,787
All right. I should give this to my son.

423
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,872
Here. Good.

424
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,958
Why don't we take a picture?

425
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:41,668
-Good.
-Let's do that.

426
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,169
Do I look okay?

427
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:45,004
-You look perfect.
-You look beautiful.

428
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,839
-Don't worry.
-You're always pretty.

429
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,840
I'll put it on here.

430
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,134
Gather together and look at the camera.

431
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,511
Mr. Cha, come closer.

432
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,137
One...

433
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,806
Come closer to each other.

434
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,183
-One...
-Is that how it works?

435
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,853
Let me see the picture.

436
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,939
I'll show you.

437
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,561
I'm very grateful to Hyeon-jeong.

438
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,315
I'm always grateful to her.

439
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,608
Did you like it?

440
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,528
Yes. I loved it.

441
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,447
What was so good?

442
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,035
I liked the wind,

443
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,163
I liked the air,
and I liked Hyeon-jeong next to me.

444
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,083
I'm glad to hear that.

445
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,920
It'll be always like that from now on.

446
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,924
We will have happy moments
like that every day, Yu-ri.

447
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:41,013
Do you not want that?

448
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:43,224
Of course, I do.

449
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,770
What?

450
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:52,775
-Dad.
-Is Dad sleeping already?

451
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:57,405
Dad, you can't sleep here.

452
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,741
-My gosh.
-It's been less than a minute.

453
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:03,786
It was somewhere around here. Where is it?

454
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,831
There it is. It says Misaeng.

455
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,794
What is he doing here?

456
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,257
Hey.

457
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,762
Gosh, it hurts. Let go.

458
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,931
-What are you doing here?
-It's not like that.

459
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,141
Let go of me.

460
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,934
-It really hurts.
-Come here.

461
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,231
Come here. I got you.

462
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,775
-Just follow me.
-It hurts.

463
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,693
Hello.

464
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,447
Stay still. Stop.

465
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,741
What's with your arms?

466
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,285
Is something there?

467
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:48,039
What have you been up to these days?
Why is there a ghost around you?

468
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:50,082
What? A ghost?

469
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,709
-Stay still.
-Ghost?

470
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,753
I told you to stand still!

471
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,962
Isn't it staying still?

472
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,757
-It hurts.
-Stop it. Stay still.

473
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,807
Is he always so stupid like that?

474
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,228
Because she's not here.

475
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,854
Who?

476
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,607
His wife. He's Hyeon-jeong's boy.

477
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,817
Hyeon-jeong. Where are you?

478
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:20,947
Hurry and come right away, Hyeon-jeong.

479
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:25,618
Gosh, you now know Yu-ri was around you
for five years.

480
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:27,245
Just come over here.

481
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,873
I didn't know about it.

482
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:34,877
Are you sure
there's a ghost next to you?

483
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,172
Why? Why is it doing this to me?

484
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,841
Is it because I didn't write
a fake diagnosis?

485
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,344
Gosh, it's no big deal.

486
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,683
"Gosh, it's no big deal."

487
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,477
Then why?

488
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:53,854
Why are you hanging around him?

489
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,856
Right. That one.

490
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,857
There's something

491
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,152
only he can do for me.

492
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:03,572
What?

493
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,535
What is it?

494
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,579
Please tell me what he says.

495
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:12,081
Why is he doing this to me?

496
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,668
So there's something
only you can do for him.

497
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,129
What is it?

498
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,176
Please tell my mom

499
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:25,803
that I didn't

500
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:28,931
kill myself.

501
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:36,647
He knows that it wasn't a suicide.

502
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,276
What does he say?

503
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,820
What is it? What?

504
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,990
Ms. Mi-dong,
I need a simultaneous interpretation.

505
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,783
I can't wait.

506
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,328
I'm very anxious.

507
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,901
It must've been fun

508
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:30,826
to see how much I loved her
like some kind of an idiot.

509
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,919
No, it wasn't like that.

510
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,382
Do you know what I said?

511
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:49,887
That I'm curious about her
for looking like Seo-woo's mom.

512
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:52,932
That I'm envious

513
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,851
because she looks like Seo-woo.

514
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,647
I had no idea.

515
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:02,900
I was like a fool.

516
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,165
You should've told me first.

517
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,798
That's what you should've done.

518
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,602
It has been a while

519
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,857
since you looked so happy

520
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,820
when you were around other people.

521
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,116
I was afraid

522
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,953
you would get hurt.

523
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,337
I'm sorry.

524
00:41:16,932 --> 00:41:18,601
Before caring about my happiness,

525
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,021
you should care about yours.

526
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,734
Before seeing my wound,

527
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,236
you should take care of yours first.

528
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,909
You're a mess.

529
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,631
Why do you keep torturing yourself
like that?

530
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:19,745
-Is everything going well for lunch?
-Yes.

531
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:21,914
Director.

532
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:25,376
Is Seo-woo here yet?

533
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:28,462
She should be here by now,
but I haven't seen her yet.

534
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,131
Seo-woo is not coming today.

535
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,634
Why not? Is she sick?

536
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,010
No.

537
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,930
She will stay home with her mom today.

538
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:39,807
I see.

539
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:41,892
Okay.

540
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:54,238
I'M SORRY

541
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,664
CONTACTS

542
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,626
CHO GANG-HWA

543
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,662
Why do you always say
everything is all right?

544
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:47,207
It's not all right at all.
You aren't all right.

545
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,584
Why are you always

546
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,297
sorry and fine?

547
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,515
Before seeing my wound,

548
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:05,976
you should take care of yours first.

549
00:44:07,936 --> 00:44:09,605
You're a mess.

550
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,918
OPERATION SCHEDULE

551
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,143
So he's not doing this?

552
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,939
He's getting counseling.

553
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,400
But why isn't he doing this?

554
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,986
He should go to the place
where he got traumatized.

555
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,865
I guess he's afraid to bring up things
that he's been avoiding and correct them.

556
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:11,375
What was it? The exposure therapy?
I'll do it.

557
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,043
OPERATION SCHEDULE

558
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,045
Why?

559
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:22,678
You said you wouldn't do it.
What made you change your mind?

560
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,305
I can't keep living like this.

561
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,392
I just need to observe the operation?

562
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,435
For now.

563
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,312
We gradually expose you
to the place you're afraid of

564
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:33,522
so you get used to it.

565
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,065
Okay.

566
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,739
I think Doctor Cho will get better.

567
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,657
What he said is a good sign.

568
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,118
He said, "I can't keep living like this."

569
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,245
Not "just because."

570
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:56,378
Of course, she's angry at me.
I lost her kid.

571
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,883
Still, I don't have much time left.

572
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,677
I really need to see Seo-woo.

573
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,183
Should I go beg for forgiveness?

574
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,400
Mom!

575
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,696
Hey.

576
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,490
Where are you going?

577
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,493
I have a doctor's appointment.
I'm going to the hospital.

578
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,244
Right, it's Monday today.

579
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,163
How did you know that?

580
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:34,041
Well, Yeon-ji told me.

581
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:35,626
Can I come with you?

582
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,919
-You want to?
-Yes.

583
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:20,712
Your heart starts racing
whenever you see a crosswalk.

584
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,745
I thought I was getting better,

585
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:59,001
but seeing a crosswalk would always get
my heart racing.

586
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:02,004
I didn't try to remember it or anything,

587
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,840
but my body must have remembered it.

588
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,217
I'm okay now.

589
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:11,054
Wouldn't it be strange
if I didn't change at all

590
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,806
after what happened?

591
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:14,808
I'm only human after all.

592
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,781
What's with him?

593
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,494
Doctor Gye.

594
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,996
Gosh, you startled me.

595
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:39,374
What is it? What do you need?

596
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:41,293
Why are you not in your office?

597
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:47,049
There are lots of people here.

598
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,425
Pardon?

599
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:54,765
Well, you know...

600
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,143
Someone asked me a favor,

601
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,271
but I'm not sure if I should say yes.

602
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,857
Say yes if it isn't something
extremely difficult.

603
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,276
It's not like a dead person
asked you a favor.

604
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,320
-It's from a dead person.
-What?

605
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,822
Nothing. Never mind.

606
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,324
It's nothing.

607
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:15,702
Shouldn't you go check on Dr. Cho?

608
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,121
Cho Gang-hwa? Why? Should I?

609
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,083
He's attending Dr. Jang's surgery today.
Everyone is fussing.

610
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,000
What?

611
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:35,514
Gang-hwa, you're attending surgery?

612
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:36,848
Exposure therapy?

613
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,058
Yes.

614
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:40,394
Will it be okay?
I don't think you're ready.

615
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,437
It can't be that bad.

616
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,733
If you start hyperventilating,
remember to take deep breaths.

617
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,944
Get out if it starts getting bad, okay?

618
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,566
RESTRICTED AREA

619
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:05,020
Mom, why did you stop going to Gang-hwa?

620
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:07,230
He knows your heart better than anyone.

621
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,399
My condition is nothing serious.

622
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:12,861
What's the point of seeing him regularly

623
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:15,572
and reminding him of his pain?

624
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,993
I thought it'd be best
to stop seeing him altogether.

625
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,164
Ms. Jeon Eun-suk.

626
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:26,875
-I'll be right back. Stay here.
-Okay.

627
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:36,426
What happened?

628
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:38,804
I heard Doctor Cho attended surgery today.

629
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,890
-Again?
-Only ten minutes in,

630
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:43,934
his symptoms appeared, and he rushed out.

631
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:45,060
My gosh.

632
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,154
Gang-hwa.

633
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,864
Where is he?

634
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,741
I'm not sure. He rushed out.

635
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,201
I don't know where he went.

636
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,703
How was he? Did he handle it okay?

637
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:04,621
No.

638
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:09,042
-Go look for him.
-Okay.

639
00:52:32,357 --> 00:52:33,567
Have you seen Dr. Cho?

640
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,985
-No.
-Gosh.

641
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,867
Gang-hwa, look at me.

642
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:29,623
Breathe.

643
00:53:30,498 --> 00:53:31,625
It's okay.

644
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,168
It's okay.

645
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,046
It's okay. Breathe slowly.

646
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,309
It's okay.

647
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,518
Everything's okay.

648
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:50,787
Breathe, okay?

649
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:01,840
Breathe.

650
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,678
Breathe.

651
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,818
Gang-hwa, are you okay?

652
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:23,862
Breathe.

653
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:37,417
Go ahead and breathe.

654
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,050
Why did you do that?

655
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,430
Why did you do that?

656
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:55,101
Why? Why did you leave me all alone?

657
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,232
Why did you?

658
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,819
Why did you do that?

659
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,032
Why?

660
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,869
We have to operate on him first.
Otherwise, he's going to die!

661
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:15,372
I said, no! Transfer him.

662
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,166
I'm ready! Why can't I operate on him?
I can save him!

663
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,918
The other patient is a VIP!

664
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,836
Do as you're told.

665
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,089
I can't cover for you anymore.

666
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:27,217
Go to the other operating room.

667
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,304
I can't.

668
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:36,518
Get him.

669
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,229
-Get him!
-Yes, Doctor.

670
00:56:45,026 --> 00:56:46,027
Lock the door.

671
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,028
Pardon?

672
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:51,199
-I said, lock the door.
-Well. Okay.

673
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,076
-Intercoms off.
-Okay.

674
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:59,582
Don't open the door or answer your phone
until the surgery is over.

675
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:05,463
The door is locked.

676
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,465
That punk.

677
00:57:10,927 --> 00:57:13,513
Doctor,
a pregnant, traffic accident patient.

678
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,098
Please come with us.

679
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:31,948
Call Gang-hwa.

680
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,158
Pardon?

681
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,326
I said, call Gang-hwa! Right now!

682
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,882
Where's Gang-hwa? You couldn't reach him?

683
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,300
No.

684
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,803
If we wait any longer,
we'll lose both mother and child.

685
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,148
Doctor.

686
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,233
My baby...

687
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:10,570
Please save my baby first.

688
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,572
My baby...

689
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,451
Please save her.

690
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,995
Please save her first.

691
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,749
-Doctor Cho.
-Yes?

692
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,250
Your wife

693
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:26,711
had an accident.

694
00:58:59,702 --> 00:59:00,828
Yu-ri, wake up.

695
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,373
Yu-ri!

696
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:11,923
Why did you do that?

697
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,384
Why?

698
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,298
You should have lived.

699
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,594
You should have...

700
01:00:00,346 --> 01:00:02,015
You should have lived.

701
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,226
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

702
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,894
I'm sorry for everything.

703
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,691
Stop blaming yourself.

704
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,568
It's not your fault.

705
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:29,584
Resentment, guilt, and regret...
All those emotions are entangled.

706
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:32,295
But mostly, he feels guilt.

707
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,340
He'd think things would've been different

708
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,092
if he hadn't been in surgery that day.

709
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,970
So he blames himself?

710
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:42,430
Yes.

711
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,725
And the person who caused
all these emotions is gone.

712
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,809
She died.

713
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,063
So he had to bottle everything up
and got sick as a result.

714
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,955
PICK-UP HELPER DO-YEON
I'M SORRY.

715
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,313
You'll damage your stomach.
Have some food too.

716
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,364
It's a start.

717
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,491
Ten minutes is impressive.

718
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,410
It'll only get better.

719
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,415
Where were you?

720
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,125
They couldn't find you anywhere.

721
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,251
Well...

722
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,170
I was where I always go.

723
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:41,549
So what made you want
to receive treatment?

724
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:51,184
She wants me to let her go.

725
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:53,853
And I think

726
01:02:54,979 --> 01:02:56,522
it might be time

727
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,441
to let her go

728
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,778
since she came back to life.

729
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:04,405
What are you talking about?

730
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,452
Can't you try to keep

731
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,498
only the good memories
and forget the sad ones?

732
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,295
Only the good memories...

733
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:21,839
Only the happy memories...

734
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,884
If I kept only those,

735
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,595
I wouldn't be here right now.

736
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,222
Why not?

737
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,229
I'd miss her too much.

738
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:42,860
I'd miss her too much.

739
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,738
When I missed her like crazy,

740
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,827
she wouldn't even show up in my dreams.

741
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,027
Yu-ri?

742
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:26,195
Yes.

743
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,491
I got there when I heard
he rushed out in a panic,

744
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,410
but Yu-ri was there.

745
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:33,995
How did she know where...

746
01:04:36,914 --> 01:04:38,916
-Oh...
-She watched him for five years.

747
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,377
She saw how much he suffered too.

748
01:04:44,797 --> 01:04:45,631
That's right.

749
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:47,675
How did she watch all that?

750
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:48,593
I know.

751
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,846
She watched him suffer because of her.

752
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:56,100
She cried, apologizing to him.
It was too painful to watch.

753
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:59,520
Why would she apologize?
She is the most unfortunate one.

754
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:34,263
FAMILY AND HYEON-JEONG

755
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,137
I want to live too.

756
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,113
What are you doing?

757
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,491
Do you know

758
01:06:37,201 --> 01:06:38,661
what's more desperate

759
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:41,747
than saying, "I want to die"?

760
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:43,374
What is it?

761
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:47,712
"I want to live."

762
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,090
What are you talking about,
all of a sudden?

763
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:53,509
Yu-ri says

764
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,388
she wants to live.

765
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,560
Shouldn't she live if she wants to?

766
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,437
I don't know what you mean.

767
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:07,106
That's so random of you.

768
01:07:08,232 --> 01:07:09,483
And Yu-ri is alive.

769
01:07:11,944 --> 01:07:12,820
Yu-ri...

770
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:19,910
Yu-ri

771
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:23,664
is going to die soon.

772
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,377
She's going to die again soon.

773
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,506
What does that mean?

774
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:43,934
What did you say?

775
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:48,773
Yu-ri is

776
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:52,735
going to die?

777
01:08:06,207 --> 01:08:07,458
Why is Yu-ri dying?

778
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:13,339
Why is Yu-ri dying again?

779
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,469
What did you say?

780
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:20,763
Can I

781
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:23,099
live?

782
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,021
I want to live.

783
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:30,856
I want to live, Ms. Mi-dong.

784
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:33,859
What did I do so wrong?

785
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:36,987
Is everything my fault?

786
01:08:38,697 --> 01:08:39,990
I wanted to live,

787
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:41,867
and I still do.

788
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:45,955
Seo-woo, Mom, Dad...

789
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,541
I want to be with them for a long time.

790
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:58,801
Yu-ri.

791
01:09:00,094 --> 01:09:00,928
Yes?

792
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:02,763
In the past five years,

793
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,892
when were you the most frustrated

794
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,186
and wished you were alive?

795
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,529
Right now.

796
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,450
I've never wished for it
more than I do right now.

797
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,039
Can I

798
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:32,001
live?

799
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:50,102
VIP patients? They get surgery first?

800
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:55,107
Yes, it's been going on secretly
for years.

801
01:09:55,524 --> 01:09:57,985
Everyone knows it's wrong,
but no one spoke up.

802
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:01,530
And you're trying to change it now?

803
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:04,533
Yes, he's going to submit
a petition signed by all the doctors.

804
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,368
What if you get fired or something?

805
01:10:06,452 --> 01:10:10,164
Don't worry. That's never going to happen.
I'm the best surgeon at our hospital.

806
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:11,582
All right.

807
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:14,919
Surgery should be performed
based on urgency.

808
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:17,922
Money shouldn't decide
who gets treated first.

809
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,550
That's my husband. Isn't he amazing?

810
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:22,676
He really is.

811
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:25,095
My son-in-law is a true doctor.

812
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,223
You're the best.

813
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,976
DOCTOR CHO, THANK YOU SO MUCH

814
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,479
WITHOUT YOUR HELP THAT DAY

815
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:36,148
MY HUSBAND WOULDN'T BE ALIVE TODAY

816
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,901
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU

817
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:29,702
Gang-hwa.

818
01:11:33,122 --> 01:11:33,998
I'm sorry.

819
01:11:34,456 --> 01:11:35,291
I'm sorry.

820
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:37,334
I'm sorry.

821
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:40,587
I'm sorry.

822
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,007
It's not your fault, you idiot.

823
01:11:44,049 --> 01:11:45,676
They said it was too late.

824
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:47,511
Even if they'd reached you,

825
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:53,892
it would've been too late to save Yu-ri.

826
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,232
I'm sorry.

827
01:12:00,649 --> 01:12:03,444
This misfortune that struck you
out of the blue

828
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,405
is not your fault.

829
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:09,867
I'm sorry.

830
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:45,235
