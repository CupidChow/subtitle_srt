1
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,462
He can be a doctor his whole life,

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,006
but he will never
get used to his patients dying.

3
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,091
Besides,
he treated this patient for a long time.

4
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,761
Gang-hwa must be having a hard time.

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,722
Geun-sang couldn't even talk to him.

6
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:09,736
YANGSEO 12

7
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,809
YU-RI

8
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:44,771
Honey, you'll cause several sinkholes
at that rate. Look up.

9
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,484
Or do you want to walk backwards?

10
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:04,082
Come on.

11
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:09,796
Why are you here? How long
have you been following me?

12
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,845
You're supposed to come and hug me, idiot.

13
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,682
How long have you been following me?

14
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,350
Let's see.

15
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:24,018
Since the hospital?

16
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,856
-Are you a stalker?
-A stalker?

17
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:31,609
There was a time when I could light him up
when things were dark for him.

18
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,821
So he wouldn't wander around
in the darkness for long.

19
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,115
So he wouldn't be in despair.

20
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:17,298
Watching your loved one lose
the light of his life.

21
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:21,135
Someone needs to shine a light for him
because he's wandering in the dark,

22
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,846
but that person can't be me anymore.

23
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,557
When I realized that,

24
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,686
I was in despair.

25
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,952
You should eat something solid.

26
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,033
-Ma'am, two bowls of noodles, please.
-Okay.

27
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,872
I can't be seen eating alone here,

28
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
by myself this late at night.

29
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,796
Don't you want to eat with me?

30
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,467
What? Okay. But I don't want any food.

31
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,303
-Ma'am, instead of two bowls--
-Wait. That's...

32
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,890
Both of them are for me.

33
00:05:53,811 --> 00:05:55,980
-Just give us two bowls of noodles.
-Okay.

34
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,667
Did you skip meals for a few days?
Take your time with that.

35
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:20,046
The portions here are small,
so everyone eats two bowls.

36
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,339
I see.

37
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:23,216
Hey, this is a lot.

38
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:40,400
Jeez.

39
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,277
I saw that coming.

40
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:46,864
Here.

41
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:06,759
Is it good?

42
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,639
This is my first meal of the day.
I didn't have any food.

43
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:12,723
I see.

44
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,976
Do you want some?

45
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:28,990
And he started to light up again.

46
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:52,054
EPISODE 9:
GOODBYE AND HELLO TO YOUR LIGHT

47
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,610
ABDUCTION PREVENTION PROGRAM

48
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:12,658
How many times do I have to tell you
we can't show up in front of her?

49
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,827
Do you think this is easy for me?

50
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,412
I miss them so much...

51
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,916
that it tears my heart out!

52
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,711
Hyeon-jeong.

53
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,796
All I want...

54
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,592
is for Gang-hwa not to cry.

55
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,886
That's all I want.

56
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:14,739
Yu-ri.

57
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:17,825
Okay.

58
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,829
Yu-ri, I understand.

59
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,226
Ms. Jeon.

60
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,489
Mom.

61
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,213
HYEON-JEONG

62
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,054
Yes, Hyeon-jeong. Why do you keep...

63
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,933
What?

64
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,605
Okay. I'm on my way now.

65
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,243
Where are you going?

66
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,537
I just got a call from the hospital.

67
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,165
-At this hour?
-Yes. Sorry. Go to sleep without me.

68
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,221
She's fine.

69
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,183
She just hyperventilated for a moment.
She'll be fine.

70
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,352
What should we do? Mom has a weak heart.

71
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,904
The grieving period for parents
is three years as well.

72
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,742
I believe it is time for you
to let her go.

73
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,414
I only fed her good food.

74
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,752
I only gave her good clothes
when I raised her.

75
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:20,841
There was so much I could do for her.

76
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:28,098
But is letting her go
the only thing I can do for her now?

77
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:31,477
Death is the law of this world.

78
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,984
That is one nasty law.

79
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,906
I had her in me for ten months
and raised her for thirty years.

80
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,242
How can I let her go in three years?

81
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,205
When I think about her,

82
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,042
my heart still melts in pain.

83
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,213
I miss her.

84
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,508
Just once.

85
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,637
I want to see her just once more.

86
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,724
I desperately want to see my daughter.

87
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,252
Take the X-ray again
and call Radiology.

88
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:01,942
-I'm all right.
-Ms. Jeon.

89
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,528
You know,

90
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,575
I saw someone.

91
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:13,120
It was...

92
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,989
Is that really you, Yu-ri?

93
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,450
Mom!

94
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,169
Goodness. It really is you, Yu-ri!

95
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,213
My gosh. Yu-ri.

96
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,839
-Mom.
-Yu-ri.

97
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,426
Yu-ri.

98
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,476
Mom, I've missed you.

99
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,356
Mom.

100
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,193
Where's the patient, Jeon Eun-suk?

101
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,695
Over there.

102
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:33,993
Mom.

103
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:35,369
My daughter.

104
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,013
My gosh. I couldn't stop crying.

105
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,640
They should have reunited from the get-go.

106
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,477
It was bound to happen.
Was she going to hide forever?

107
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,812
You cried too, right?

108
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,944
Hyeon-jeong.

109
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,913
Why do you keep crying?

110
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,003
Hyeon-jeong.

111
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:15,094
What's wrong?

112
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:18,305
Yu-ri reunited with her parents.
It all worked out.

113
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:19,640
Don't cry.

114
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,851
She can get her life back
one day at a time now.

115
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,396
What about Seo-woo?

116
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,690
What about Gang-hwa?

117
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,943
They were...

118
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,447
Yu-ri's family first.

119
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,033
Yu-ri belongs with them.

120
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,287
Well...

121
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,039
I mean...

122
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,416
that's...

123
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,256
Baby steps. She'll take baby steps
and sort it out one day at time.

124
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,635
She won't do it.

125
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,430
She doesn't want her life back.
She just...

126
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:03,892
Just...

127
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:11,400
Hyeon-jeong.

128
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,611
Did something happen with Yu-ri?

129
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,620
Gang-hwa loves her, doesn't he?

130
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,956
You know that.

131
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,792
What would be more important than that?

132
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,756
Gosh, don't cry. Come here.

133
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,887
Don't cry now.

134
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,373
-Hey, you're back.
-Yes. I'm sorry.

135
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,125
Sleep.

136
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:44,618
Mom.

137
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,037
Yes?

138
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,500
Mom.

139
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,503
Yes.

140
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:58,757
Can you see me?

141
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,260
Can you hear me?

142
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,016
Yes.

143
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:09,768
I can see you.

144
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:12,145
I can hear you, too.

145
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,444
Mom.

146
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,951
Eun-suk.

147
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,038
Can you please look at me?

148
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,420
Your daughter is right here.

149
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,669
Yu-ri?

150
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,921
She's right here.

151
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:21,715
Okay.

152
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:29,056
Where's Yu-ri?

153
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,685
I'm holding on tight to her,
so she can't leave.

154
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,395
Okay.

155
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,782
Hey, scoot over. Let me hug her, too.

156
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,910
-Hey.
-My gosh. You should get off the bed.

157
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:52,704
-Goodness.
-My gosh, it hurts.

158
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,955
-Oh, no.
-Dad.

159
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,335
-My gosh.
-That was loud.

160
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,170
Are you okay?

161
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,464
Gosh, you're so cruel!

162
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,384
Oh, my.

163
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,054
There you go again.

164
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,640
Jeez.

165
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,810
-Let me join you.
-Gosh.

166
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,229
-Come on. Get off the bed.
-Hey!

167
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,398
You're so strong.

168
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,404
With the installed camera,
it goes around the vast farmland.

169
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:28,281
-In order to evaluate how ripe...
-Mr. Ma.

170
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,367
Mr. Ma!

171
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:36,832
Mr. Ma.

172
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,001
I'm about to die of boredom.

173
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,212
Can you put on a TV show
that is actually fun?

174
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:45,382
Mr. Ma, switch the channel
to Comedy Big League. Mr. Ma.

175
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,762
Dad. He's falling back to sleep.

176
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,847
Damn it.

177
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,475
Come on. What's so fun about the news?

178
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,185
Why does he keep watching it?

179
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,146
That's what I'm talking about!

180
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,983
The news is useless to us,
but he keeps putting on the news all day.

181
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:04,443
Here's your next news.

182
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,821
The death of the late
baseball player, Kang Bin,

183
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,823
has resurfaced recently.

184
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,701
He was being investigated
for the match-fixing scandal.

185
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:15,537
And he ended his own life
as an attempt to prove his innocence.

186
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:18,582
He didn't have a lot on his mind.

187
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,041
He didn't think much...

188
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,337
I mean, he was positive
and cheerful to be around.

189
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,508
Well, they said they found a suicide note.
That's heartbreaking.

190
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,803
He was under investigation,
so he had a hard time with that.

191
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,055
But he wasn't the type to end his life.

192
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,266
What? What is it?

193
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,311
He tested normal
both for depression and bipolar disorder.

194
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,480
As for the mental state
the patient was in,

195
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,774
I assessed that he was stable enough
not to make such a decision.

196
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,776
So I did not prescribe any medication.

197
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:50,489
I thought you committed suicide.

198
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,616
-Pardon?
-He didn't show any signs...

199
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,533
Yes.

200
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:57,120
You must've been rash
after you got drunk, right?

201
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,163
That's what I remember.

202
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,873
Yes.

203
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,466
Seriously? Wouldn't you have
to be depressed

204
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,135
to commit suicide
even if you were intoxicated?

205
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,347
Come on. We've seen a lot of ghosts
who committed suicide.

206
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,973
What's his deal?

207
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:24,606
What? What is it? I killed myself.

208
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:27,609
Forget about that.
Are you really gay? Is that true?

209
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,070
-I'm more curious about that.
-Why?

210
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,073
People are always curious
about rumors, you know.

211
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,492
Rumors about being gay,
dating, or getting divorced.

212
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:36,868
And rumors about suicide.

213
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,121
I guess that was a rumor, too.
So are you gay?

214
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,414
My gosh.

215
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,293
Why aren't you telling me?
Is it such a big secret?

216
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,702

CHA YU-RI

218
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,128
MARCH 13TH, 2011
BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS ON THE STREET

219
00:26:34,801 --> 00:26:36,678
They should've thrown all this away.

220
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:27,479
Yu-ri.

221
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,399
What is it, Mom?

222
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:35,362
I was wondering where you were.

223
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,369
Mom.

224
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,121
Yes, what is it?

225
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:49,125
Well, I want to eat some fern brake.

226
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,543
Really?

227
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,463
All right, I'll go buy some
and make it for you right away.

228
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:10,855
Oh, no. I'm late!

229
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,826
CHO GANG-HWA
PATIENT: JEON EUN-SUK

230
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,411
-Thoracic surgery?
-Yes.

231
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,329
I heard it's really tough.

232
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,331
The doctors barely get any sleep.

233
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,166
You should choose an easier one.

234
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,046
Is it because of my mom?

235
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:37,966
It's best to have a doctor
do regular checks on the heart.

236
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,135
I'll take care of your mom from now on.

237
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,597
There's nothing else I want to do anyway.

238
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,191
-Make sure to take your meds.
-Right. Thank you.

239
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,234
All right.

240
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,404
Take care.

241
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,368
Okay, let's see...

242
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,626
-Hey.
-Let me see.

243
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,794
No.

244
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,839
She said she'd go to another hospital
if I keep showing you.

245
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:18,923
Just don't tell her, then.

246
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,218
Are these all the meds she's getting?

247
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,179
Yes, she's better so I reduced them.

248
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,600
Take another CT scan just in case
and show me.

249
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:30,143
All right.

250
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,896
But she really is incredible.

251
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,815
She's not letting you treat her
so you can get remarried.

252
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,654
-All right. Thanks.
-Right.

253
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,490
Bye.

254
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,579
DOCTOR: CHO GANG-HWA

255
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,370
Is she gone?

256
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,998
-Yu-ri!
-She's not gone.

257
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,251
She's coming back.

258
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,127
Mom, Dad.

259
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,505
I have lots of things to do,
so I'll be back in the evening.

260
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,426
You should've kept her here.

261
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,428
She left while I was taking a shower.

262
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:49,889
But Honey...

263
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,934
Are we dreaming?

264
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:58,773
I've been pinching my cheeks
over and over since last night.

265
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:00,733
We're not dreaming.

266
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,027
Right.

267
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,197
This isn't a dream.

268
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:09,576
But...

269
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,288
What about Seo-woo?

270
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,959
I don't think it would be good
for Gang-hwa,

271
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:21,963
but I want our daughter
to see her own kid.

272
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,175
She might not be saying anything,
but I'm sure she's curious.

273
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:28,011
And she'll want to see Seo-woo.

274
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,432
Seo-woo!

275
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,102
Should we take off your shoes?

276
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,812
All right.

277
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,442
Here you go.

278
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,570
Seo-woo, come here.

279
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:47,697
-I'll take that.
-Okay.

280
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,532
-Bye, Ms. Oh.
-Right.

281
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:50,617
Let's go.

282
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,749
Take good care of her for me.

283
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,375
Of course.

284
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,381
I'll be home around dinnertime,
so I'll see you then.

285
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,966
Okay.

286
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,886
Well, then...

287
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:16,893
-Hang on.
-Yes?

288
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:19,145
Just a minute.

289
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,785
Drink these.

290
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,539
-Both of them?
-Giving just one seems cold.

291
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,044
I don't like canned coffee.

292
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,214
I only drink Americanos.

293
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,384
No, I know you love those.

294
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,846
How would you know that?

295
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,016
Well...

296
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,187
I can just tell. Your face
says that you like sweets.

297
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,504
How would I know?
I saw her drink that every day.

298
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:30,049
She had boxes of canned coffee.
Americano, my foot.

299
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,636
She hardly knows me. How would she know?

300
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,807
-Is that so?
-Yes.

301
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,058
Ms. Oh!

302
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,313
I guess you just brought Seo-woo here.

303
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,315
Yes. Bye, then.

304
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,611
Why is she so cold?

305
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,155
Come on. Let's just go.

306
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:57,160
Anyway, I heard that the kitchen assistant
follows Seo-woo around everywhere.

307
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,411
Why, though?

308
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,329
Why only Seo-woo?

309
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,539
I don't know.

310
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:03,916
Don't Seo-woo and that kitchen assistant
look alike?

311
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,959
What?

312
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,254
-Well, I saw her playing with Seo-woo...
-And?

313
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,798
...and they both have huge eyes.

314
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,383
They really look similar.

315
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,816
Is he still not coming out?

316
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:30,943
No.

317
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:34,238
He's never been criticized
in his whole life.

318
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,492
I guess he was really shocked.

319
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,788
You've been bullied your whole life
while taking care of him.

320
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,998
Just leave him here and go by yourself.

321
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,584
And I heard it was because
you were overworked.

322
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,713
We've been together for a long time.
He didn't always just criticize me.

323
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,259
He may talk harshly, but he's a good man.

324
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,844
I doubt that.

325
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,388
If it weren't for Mr. Baek,

326
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:03,518
my daughter couldn't have had
a decent life.

327
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,645
What do you mean?

328
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,979
EMERGENCY CENTER

329
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,315
Please, come treat my girl!

330
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,691
-This way.
-Okay.

331
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:13,653
Don't cry.

332
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,322
-It was hot water...
-What happened?

333
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,241
-It was hot water.
-Get disinfectant!

334
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,201
Twenty million won?

335
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,079
How could we get such a huge sum?

336
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,248
Her whole leg has third-degree burns.

337
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,833
If she doesn't get surgery...

338
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,835
she'll keep living in that state.

339
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,759
Please, I promise I'll pay you back.

340
00:35:36,843 --> 00:35:39,387
I promise. Hello?

341
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,555
Please...

342
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,140
Please help us out.

343
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:45,893
Hye-su is just a little girl.

344
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,937
Hello? Are you there?

345
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,862
Honey, how did it go?

346
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,285
Hye-su...

347
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,872
Let's go home.

348
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,915
I'll...

349
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,169
order you some jjajangmyeon.

350
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,213
All right.

351
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,758
Let's go. Let's go home.

352
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,596
Where are you taking her?
We're getting the operation room ready.

353
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,683
What? Well, we don't have the money...

354
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,977
We received the surgery fee.

355
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,813
The sender's name was Baek Sam-dong.

356
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,772
What?

357
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,358
Mr. Baek...

358
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,402
Honey!

359
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,029
Is that so?

360
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,822
Thank you!

361
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:46,162
That jerk really did such a thing?

362
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:50,917
That sum may have been nothing
to Mr. Baek,

363
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,919
but he's a savior to me.

364
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,047
I was born a human,

365
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,926
but if I forget things I should
be grateful for,

366
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,677
I won't be a human anymore.

367
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,054
I guess you're right.

368
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,765
Even if he seems rude to us,

369
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,852
you two must have
gone through a lot together.

370
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:14,565
I guess you should
take him with you, then.

371
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:16,817
Right?

372
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,402
My goodness.

373
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:27,954
Hyeon-jeong cried?

374
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,413
Yes.

375
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,416
She said you and Seo-woo are Yu-ri's.

376
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,503
She's not someone to say such things.

377
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:36,963
Doesn't it seem strange?

378
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,423
I guess something did happen yesterday.

379
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,601
What are you doing? It's so annoying.

380
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:53,604
Gosh, this won't do.
Hey, take some photos for me.

381
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,606
You know. Just the body below my head.

382
00:37:56,357 --> 00:38:00,027
I've been so preoccupied
with you and Yu-ri these days

383
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,322
that I didn't get to upload
my photos. That's enough.

384
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,658
These are good.

385
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,536
But look at this guy. Gang-hwa. Look.

386
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,872
It took so long to get
all these followers,

387
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,416
but it only took him two months.

388
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,709
Do you think that makes sense?

389
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,627
-Yes, it does.
-Damn it.

390
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,463
I've seen things
that really don't make sense.

391
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,800
Anyway, so I was going to upload this

392
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,553
when I got about 200 thousand
followers, but...

393
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,936
The guy with a sexy brain.

394
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,065
Intelligence is what
completes fashion, you know.

395
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,277
Even if you buy expensive
limited editions,

396
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,821
you can't match a man's sexy intelligence.

397
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,284
"O. O. T. D.

398
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,870
It's a bit embarrassing,
but I'm revealing this now."

399
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,247
-You're embarrassing me.
-"My daily outfit."

400
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,665
You're so embarrassing.

401
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:55,916
All right.

402
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:57,960
I think I'll get up to...

403
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,755
about 300 thousand followers today.

404
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:06,927
I am now really showing off.

405
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:11,891
All right.

406
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,020
-Geun-sang.
-Yes?

407
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:20,149
-I wasn't sure about this...
-Yes?

408
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,443
But now I'm sure that you're crazy.

409
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,445
All my doubts just disappeared.

410
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:28,741
You have no right to call me crazy.
Doesn't Yu-ri start working today?

411
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,914
You should go home as late as you can.

412
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,333
-Go after Yu-ri leaves.
-Of course.

413
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,127
But why would Min-jeong
hire a pick-up helper?

414
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,337
Was it tough for her?

415
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,964
She said she's going to start work again.

416
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,176
Right. She didn't work for a while.
I guess she'd want to work.

417
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,136
-Right.
-What will you do about Yu-ri?

418
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,680
She's met her family now.
You should do something.

419
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,519
She just met her parents.

420
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,354
What could I do about it?

421
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,867
I guess you're right.
What could you possibly do?

422
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,495
Gang-hwa, wait for me!

423
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:17,832
Wait up!

424
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,760
Hey, that's the interview I did yesterday.
What do you think?

425
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:32,221
You look like a madman
who's doing an interview.

426
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:38,102
Oh, my gosh! What's wrong with him?

427
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,271
-He's a judge.
-What are you doing?

428
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,023
#DAILY OUTFIT #HANDSOME

429
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,568
Gang-hwa, he's a judge.

430
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,944
You're crazy.

431
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,654
Why does he have to be a judge?

432
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:53,200
Shouldn't a judge be busy judging?
Isn't he working?

433
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:55,786
YOU HAVE A NEW COMMENT

434
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,205
I found the psychiatrist quack!

435
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:00,541
You're that doctor who killed Bin, right?

436
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,584
What's all this?

437
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,170
You said he wasn't someone
who'd kill himself.

438
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:05,337
But he did!

439
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,548
-He was always slacking off.
-You murderer!

440
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,133
Let's go and teach him a lesson.

441
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,634
Bring back our Bin!

442
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:11,886
What is this?

443
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,181
The person you are calling
is unavailable right now.

444
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,432
Please try again later.

445
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,688
My gosh, Cha Yu-ri...

446
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:32,281
What are you thinking about?
You didn't even notice me.

447
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,243
Well, just this and that.

448
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,078
Are you heading somewhere?

449
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,373
I'm like a job-seeker these days.

450
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,917
I'm trying to start work again.

451
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,419
Oh, you are?

452
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,132
I hope it works out well for you.

453
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,556
You know...

454
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:01,018
The young kitchen assistant...

455
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,814
Are you close with her?

456
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,069
Yes, we're close.

457
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,112
Very close.

458
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,952
She's going to be Seo-woo's
pick-up helper, so I'm curious.

459
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:24,750
You were close
with Seo-woo's biological mom too, right?

460
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,340
She just looks...

461
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:34,385
a lot like her.

462
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,432
Well, then.

463
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:45,312
Thank you for this.

464
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:49,400
The assistant gave me that.

465
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,113
I wanted to share it.

466
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,880
HYEON-JEONG

467
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:28,731
Oh, right. The red beans.

468
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,441
Where are they?

469
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,871
Seo-woo.

470
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,998
A pick-up helper is coming for you,
starting today.

471
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,753
Seo-woo, shall we go?

472
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,631
Her mother said a pick-up helper
would come for her.

473
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,215
That's me. The pick-up helper.

474
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,260
Let's go, Seo-woo.

475
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,143
She kind of seems like
Seo-woo's stalker now.

476
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,978
Don't you think?

477
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,189
My goodness.

478
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,524
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

479
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,486
Ta-da! Seo-woo, what is this?

480
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:18,322
It's a carp!

481
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,283
It looks so tasty, doesn't it?

482
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,786
Good girl.

483
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:26,622
You're so adorable. Is it good?

484
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,416
Your kid looks just like you.

485
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,001
Pardon?

486
00:44:31,085 --> 00:44:32,544
She's so pretty.

487
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:37,257
Her facial features are all
exactly the same as yours.

488
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:52,189
Seo-woo.

489
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:57,945
Can you see that man standing over there?

490
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,488
Yes, the man with the hat.

491
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,870
I guess she can still see them
because of the ghost at home.

492
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:14,461
I'm sorry. I'll make sure
you stop seeing things like that.

493
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,464
I'll get rid of that jerk.

494
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,466
Let's go home now.

495
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,473
What is it, Seo-woo? We should go home.

496
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,895
CARP BREAD

497
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:40,654
Please take Seo-woo
to her English academy at three.

498
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,033
Right. She should learn English.

499
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,078
She shouldn't fall behind
in the global society.

500
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,664
Hey, Seo-woo.

501
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,667
Seo-woo.

502
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,836
-Thank you.
-Bye.

503
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,547
Did you do well? Let's go home now.

504
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,511
Take her to the piano academy at 4:30.

505
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,600
Right. She should learn the piano.

506
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,478
She might be slow at talking,
but she might be a musical genius.

507
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:14,772
That's right!
She may become the next Schubert.

508
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,734
She's done.

509
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,278
Seo-woo, let's go.

510
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:30,996
Again?

511
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,837
When can we go home?

512
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:49,181
Are you done, Seo-woo?

513
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,353
What is this? Are you giving this to me?

514
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,149
Yes. It's you, pretty Auntie.

515
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,986
Thank you.

516
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:04,947
Thank you, Seo-woo.

517
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,454
BAEK SAM-DONG

518
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,501
Hey...

519
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:19,253
Sam-dong.

520
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:21,964
Baek Sam-dong.

521
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:28,053
Baek Sam-dong!

522
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,516
-Are you mad?
-Oh, my gosh.

523
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,726
Mr. Baek, you're here.

524
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,112
You don't have anything left
in the human world now.

525
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,114
Just come with me.

526
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,577
Don't be ridiculous.

527
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,705
That might be the case for you,
but not me.

528
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:59,793
You lived your life doing and having
whatever you wanted.

529
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:01,962
Do you still have lingering desires?

530
00:48:02,045 --> 00:48:05,007
Just because I did everything
I wanted to do...

531
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:08,886
doesn't mean I have no lingering desires.

532
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:12,514
There were so many things
that didn't go as I wanted.

533
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,979
So give me the shares
that you stole from me!

534
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,939
How dare you talk like that to me!

535
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:24,735
I took care of everything
while you were studying abroad.

536
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,155
Why would I give all that hard work away?
I earned it all.

537
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,407
What did you just say?

538
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,413
Take it.

539
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,709
What? Right. I'm sorry, sir.

540
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,047
-Hello?
-Where are you, Dad?

541
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:47,007
Why aren't you home yet?

542
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,636
Sorry, I'm going to be a bit late today.

543
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,555
Where are you?
You might miss the last bus.

544
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,098
Should we come pick you up?

545
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,683
No, it's fine.

546
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,353
I promise I'll take a cab home.
Don't worry.

547
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:02,314
Okay. Oh, right.
Bring chicken on your way home!

548
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:06,026
All right. I should go now. Bye.

549
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,700
Do you know why I bullied you?

550
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,913
I was jealous.

551
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:20,791
I know.

552
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:24,044
I've known you for a long time, you know.

553
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:29,174
Everything I left behind
was just useless trash.

554
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:34,554
Everyone is fighting over
the money I left behind,

555
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,431
and my kids are growing up

556
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,852
as terrible people, gaining things
with the honor I left behind.

557
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:44,731
All I left in this world is trash.

558
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,943
Why would you think that?

559
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,782
You helped my daughter Hye-su
get a better leg.

560
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,350
I mustn't break the egg you gave me,

561
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:22,602
so I'll be careful
and take good care of it.

562
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:26,773
But, Seo-woo...

563
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:29,359
Whose is that?

564
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,864
Mom!

565
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,199
You'll fall. Slow down.

566
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,670
Did you draw this at the art academy?

567
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,445
How was it today?

568
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:16,865
She had a lot of classes today,
so it must've been tiring.

569
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,868
A little.

570
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,205
It was okay.

571
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,754
You can go home now.
I'll take her backpack.

572
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,965
I still have some time left to work.

573
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,717
I'm sure you have to make dinner.

574
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,512
I'll go in with you
and babysit her while you do that.

575
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,055
It's okay.

576
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,225
I see. I guess you're okay.

577
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:48,438
Okay.

578
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:56,571
Goodbye, then.

579
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:09,167
I didn't even get to see that ghost.

580
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:13,964
Do you want...

581
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,344
a tour of my house?

582
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,888
Yes!

583
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,732
Let's go, Seo-woo.

584
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,383
What are you doing over there?

585
00:53:42,052 --> 00:53:43,929
Putting the shoes together.

586
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:49,559
Putting Seo-woo's shoes together,
and these shoes.

587
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,897
My shoes, too.

588
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:58,318
Good.

589
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,862
Looks great.

590
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:05,367
She's Seo-woo's pick-up helper.
You know her, right?

591
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:10,705
Yes, of course. I know her well.

592
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,042
What? Wait, what?

593
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,962
I just know her.

594
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:21,925
Right, I have something to research,
so I'll be in my study.

595
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,812
Her kindergarten stuff is in her room,

596
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,564
and her snacks are in the veranda.

597
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:53,665
Why are you still here, Yu-ri? Why?

598
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,210
My gosh, what am I going to do?

599
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,589
What am I going to do now?
This is driving me insane.

600
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,341
Forget it.

601
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:07,637
I'll just stay here.
Forget it. Don't go outside.

602
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,932
I don't have to go outside.
Then everything will be fine.

603
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:13,101
Forget it. It's okay.

604
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,854
Let's get some sleep.

605
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,857
I'll get some sleep. It'll be fine.

606
00:55:29,326 --> 00:55:30,910
Did I look like an idiot just now?

607
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:34,289
No, that was pretty smooth...

608
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,457
Not.

609
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,016
I'm sure that ghost is still here.

610
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:54,893
I'll get you if I find you.

611
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,189
Over there.

612
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,243
You bastard.

613
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:14,996
Me?

614
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:20,043
Goodness, fruit flies.
There are fruit flies in here.

615
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:23,213
Goodness, these jerks.
They cause that thing, you know...

616
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,257
Right, atopic disease.
We have to catch these jerks.

617
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,677
Gosh, thank you.

618
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:33,973
It's winter. There are fruit flies?

619
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,017
Darn it, where did it go?

620
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,623
-Did she leave?
-She did.

621
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:42,750
What are you going to do, man?

622
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:44,836
It really isn't good
to see them together at home.

623
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,130
Gosh, whatever. I'm starving.

624
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:49,382
You idiot.
Just die of starvation, will you?

625
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:57,724
Goodness, I didn't get to do anything
before I left.

626
00:57:58,558 --> 00:58:00,643
Where is that thing hiding?

627
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,901
Seo-woo, let's say goodbye to Ms. Jeon.

628
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:10,195
Say, "See you tomorrow."

629
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:16,075
Goodbye, Seo-woo. See you tomorrow.

630
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,919
She has no classes tomorrow.
You can play with her in the playground.

631
00:58:26,002 --> 00:58:27,921
-I'll babysit her at home.
-What?

632
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,423
Oh, I mean, it's...

633
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:32,425
The fine dust situation is awful.

634
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,761
And kids have weak bronchial tubes.

635
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:39,641
Gosh, even adults get choked up like this.

636
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,185
Kids shouldn't be outside these days.
It'll be really bad.

637
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:44,729
I've been getting this feeling
for a while,

638
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:48,900
but it looks like
you adore her more than I do.

639
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,152
What?

640
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:52,529
Is Seo-woo

641
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,656
that precious to you?

642
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,115
Then...

643
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:58,493
You can be Seo-woo's mom.

644
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,751
The director said

645
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:10,713
you only follow Seo-woo around
at the kindergarten, too.

646
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,715
Right, that's...

647
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,677
She's just that adorable.

648
00:59:16,302 --> 00:59:17,387
I'm sorry.

649
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:19,681
You don't have to apologize.

650
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,521
Thank you...

651
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,691
for cherishing her.

652
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,738
Goodbye.

653
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:38,700
Let's go home, Seo-woo.

654
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,131
Seo-woo's present.

655
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:07,770
Hey, I tried my best to come home
as late as possible.

656
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,772
But she was still here. What can I do?

657
01:00:09,856 --> 01:00:11,858
This isn't good.
I'm signing up for night duty.

658
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:14,694
Did you forget?
You're still on suspension.

659
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:17,905
My gosh, that darned suspension.

660
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,287
All good. It's all good.

661
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,307
What are you eating in the midst of this?

662
01:00:44,724 --> 01:00:47,644
Are you hungry?-- My goodness!

663
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,439
-What is this?
-Why? What's going on?

664
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:53,650
No idea.

665
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,610
What is this?

666
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,280
My gosh, why? Egg...

667
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,198
Why is that egg...?

668
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:03,368
Egg... Why is someone
throwing eggs at my car?

669
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,462
KANG BIN

670
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:24,931
Who are they?

671
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,975
Gang-hwa, hang up for a minute.

672
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:32,271
Why are you coming? Why? What is it?

673
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,899
Why? What? What is it?

674
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,235
Why? What?

675
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,028
What? What's with him?

676
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,826
What is this?

677
01:01:50,581 --> 01:01:51,708
What's going on?

678
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,460
Why is this so good?

679
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,171
Is it because I am hungry?

680
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:04,971
These were fertile eggs. That's why.

681
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,473
These are expensive.

682
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,397
Hey, Doctor. Come on out.

683
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:19,736
Let's have a talk, Doctor!

684
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,531
What? Why are they doing this?

685
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,200
What? What is it?

686
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,035
Who are you?

687
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,913
You'll get a good scolding from me!

688
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:36,586
-Why? What?
-Get out so we can talk!

689
01:02:36,669 --> 01:02:39,255
If you did that interview on him,
why can't you talk with us?

690
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:40,423
"That interview"?

691
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,343
Wait, Kang Bin?

692
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:48,389
-What's with you?
-You said he was fine.

693
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:52,852
If he was fine, why did he
visit a psychiatrist and kill himself?

694
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,980
He didn't do it right, that's why.
"Counseling"?

695
01:02:56,147 --> 01:02:58,775
If you had done it right,
he wouldn't have died!

696
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,568
You murderer!

697
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:03,321
-"Murderer"?
-Come out! Get out!

698
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,073
-My gosh, no!
-You murderer!

699
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,950
Gosh, please stop.

700
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,161
Throw! Keep throwing!

701
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,579
What am I going to do?

702
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:14,415
My gosh! Why are you doing this?

703
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,169
Goodness, what's going on?

704
01:03:19,545 --> 01:03:22,757
My gosh, what are they doing
in front of my restaurant?

705
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,681
What are they doing?

706
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,740
You gave it to me as a present,
but I forgot.

707
01:03:47,907 --> 01:03:49,200
I'm sorry.

708
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,577
You could just pick it up tomorrow.

709
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:56,082
But still,
it was Seo-woo's first gift to me.

710
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,708
I should take it home.

711
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:58,918
Right?

712
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:31,534
All right, all done. I've peeled it all.

713
01:04:57,435 --> 01:04:58,561
Gang-hwa.

714
01:04:58,644 --> 01:04:59,687
You!

715
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,885
I didn't even get to see that ghost.

716
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:35,181
Do you want...

717
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,977
a tour of my house?

718
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,438
Yes!

719
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,366
Let's go, Seo-woo.

720
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,249
Hello, my light.

721
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,703
Where does she keep going to?

722
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:22,413
I only have a few days left.

723
01:07:22,496 --> 01:07:24,248
I have to make sure she doesn't see them.

724
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:25,374
You're dead.

725
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:27,001
-Are you a shaman, too?
-Yes.

726
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:28,002
Peek-a-boo.

727
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,545
Stop right there, you brat!

728
01:07:29,628 --> 01:07:31,547
Min-jeong likes her
because she looks like Yu-ri?

729
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:33,799
Is Min-jeong by any chance a pervert?

730
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,092
I'm here...

731
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:37,928
Your wife is Seo-woo's mom, too.

732
01:07:38,012 --> 01:07:40,014
Even after you die,
your children will always be...

733
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,849
-What is it?
-...your homework.

734
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:43,642
-Mommy!
-I can do it.

735
01:07:43,726 --> 01:07:46,187
So let me. Let me be Seo-woo's real mom.

736
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:52,234
