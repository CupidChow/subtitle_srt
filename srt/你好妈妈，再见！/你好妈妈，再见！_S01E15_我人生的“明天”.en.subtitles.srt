1
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,673
December 19th.

2
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,967
My dear Yeol-mu.

3
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,022
Did you do a kick, Yeol-mu?

4
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,990
You're doing dozens of kicks today again.

5
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,701
I guess you might become a soccer player.

6
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,329
It'll be tough being an athlete.

7
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,707
No. You can do anything you want.

8
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:27,170
You've grown so well for ten months.

9
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,423
When you come out to the world,

10
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:32,926
I'll let you have anything in the world.

11
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,929
I'll let you dream of having anything

12
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:38,723
and becoming anything you want.

13
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,142
I'll see you soon, my baby.

14
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,651
Since the day I can see you
is arriving soon,

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:53,196
I'm looking forward to tomorrow
more than today.

16
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:11,965
EPISODE 15:
MY LIFE'S TOMORROW

17
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,594
What did you say?

18
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:18,596
Can I

19
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,099
live?

20
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,898
I want to live.
I want to live, Ms. Mi-dong.

21
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,609
What did I do so wrong?

22
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:32,777
Is everything

23
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,946
my fault?

24
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,907
I wanted to live,

25
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,617
and I still do.

26
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,705
Seo-woo, Mom, Dad...

27
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,249
I want to be with them for a long time.

28
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,221
What did you just say?

29
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,976
Yu-ri

30
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,105
is going to die?

31
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,620
Why is Yu-ri dying?

32
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,334
Why is Yu-ri dying again?

33
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,471
Hyeon-jeong.

34
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,348
Gang-hwa, hang on.

35
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,892
Hyeon-jeong, what are you talking about?

36
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,018
Yu-ri...

37
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,896
Yu-ri didn't just come back to life?

38
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,198
Tell me.

39
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,076
Tell me everything you know.

40
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,041
All right.

41
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:13,753
Yu-ri...

42
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,511
dies again in 49 days.

43
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,058
And there aren't

44
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,185
that many days left now.

45
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,023
Why?

46
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,278
Why would she die again?

47
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,739
Why would she die?

48
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,785
They sent her here

49
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,914
to find her place within 49 days.

50
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:52,667
Then she'd be able to live.

51
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,336
"Her place"?

52
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,051
Her place as Gang-hwa's wife.

53
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:06,431
Her place

54
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,266
as Seo-woo's mom.

55
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,817
If she does, she can live.

56
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:21,779
But she says she won't.

57
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:27,869
She says she won't because
she can't do that to you and Min-jeong.

58
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,456
She says she's already dead,

59
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,291
so

60
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,501
she'll just leave again.

61
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,441
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

62
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,987
Why are you telling me this now?

63
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,052
Maybe...

64
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,764
A vacation as a reward.
Maybe I got something like that.

65
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,100
For about 49 days.

66
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:35,770
No, just 49 days.
Just leave me be for 49 days.

67
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,563
I'm not here to ruin your life.

68
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,981
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,527
I shouldn't have come. I'm so sorry.

70
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,653
Yu-ri.

71
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,183
She wants to live?

72
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,604
I told you she would.

73
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,276
Even for a ghost
who's given up everything,

74
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,197
it would be impossible not to want life
when they can have it again.

75
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,828
So I can go to her daughter now, right?

76
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,668
Why

77
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,464
are you doing this to me?

78
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,260
-Cho Gang-hwa.
-Were you

79
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,138
thinking of staying here for 49 days

80
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,686
and dying again?

81
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,692
How did you find out?

82
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:33,781
So it's true.

83
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:44,709
When I was

84
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,507
missing you so much that my heart hurt

85
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,011
that I wanted to carve it out,
you weren't here.

86
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,266
And

87
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,188
when I thought I could do anything

88
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,525
to just touch you one more time,
you never answered me.

89
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:15,197
Then you appeared out of the blue, and now

90
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,242
you're going to die again?

91
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,413
What will I do if you leave like that?

92
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,628
How can I live?

93
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,176
If you decide everything on your own
and leave like that, then what about me?

94
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,512
If I have to lose you twice,

95
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,848
how can I live?

96
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,267
You should've told me!

97
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:47,021
"I don't have time. Why did you remarry?

98
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,149
I want my place back."
You should've talked to me!

99
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,568
Was I supposed to lose you again

100
00:10:53,694 --> 00:10:55,029
without knowing anything?

101
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,281
You wanted me to do that?

102
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,118
You should've told me, Yu-ri!

103
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,830
How could I have said that?

104
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,793
My place is gone already.

105
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,631
You should've lived a great life then!

106
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,258
This wouldn't have happened
if you were happy!

107
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,596
I hated seeing you live a miserable life,

108
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,141
so I was planning on going up
after seeing you remarry.

109
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,020
I was about to leave everything behind

110
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,731
and go up and live my next life!

111
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,902
But you're the one
who didn't let go of me.

112
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,199
You kept holding onto me,
and made me torture you!

113
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,453
You're the one who held onto me

114
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,539
and made me feel sorry
so I couldn't leave!

115
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,333
You're the one who stopped me
from leaving.

116
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,843
You're right.

117
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,682
I held onto you.

118
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,063
I held onto you more on purpose.

119
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,234
I endured one day.

120
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,029
I could live through it.

121
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,119
Then I endured another day

122
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,872
and lived through it.

123
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,503
But I hated that I could.

124
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,340
I felt guilty,

125
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:41,469
but I kept on living.

126
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,725
So I felt sorry again.

127
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,446
If you get your place back,

128
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,157
can you live?

129
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,994
Can you really live?

130
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,540
What will you do if I can?

131
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,085
What about your wife?

132
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,129
Will you let her go?

133
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,341
Just tell me if you can or not.

134
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:21,550
Can you

135
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,513
really live?

136
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:32,770
Then live.

137
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,316
Why would you die?

138
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:03,342

You were first in line,

but I was busy sending up
some useless spirits,

161

so you gained some time.

Let go of me.

-Did you just say "useless spirits"?

How dare you call my parents that!

167
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,485
What's this? Why are you
carrying around a cane?

168
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,112
Do you want to get beaten up with this?

How dare you do this
in such a sacred place?

I...

Please.

I'm sorry about last time.

180
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,531
A shaman was saying something
unbelievable, so I--

181
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:23,120
No, it's fine. I was talking
without thinking.

182

00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:32,671
Yu-ri?

186
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:37,301
Well, I guess maybe about
five or six years?

187
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,052
-Five or six years?
-Yes.

188
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,471
Then you knew her before the accident.

189
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:45,517
You must know about what happened, then.

190
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,561
Well, yes.

191
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:59,531
I don't really know
how this happened, though.

192
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,536
Is that so?

193
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,664
Anyway, I'm sorry about yelling
at you last time.

194
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,375
-It's okay.
-Well, then. Bye.

195
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,501
Bye.

196
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,570
I already told Min-jeong

197
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,573
-that you're Cha Yu-ri.
-What?

198
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,493
Why did you tell her?

199
00:21:26,952 --> 00:21:28,203
Why would you do that?

200
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,331
You couldn't tell her you're
Seo-woo's mom and you kept feeling sorry.

201
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,625
And Min-jeong didn't have a clue.

202
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,130
That was painful to watch.

203
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:39,589
Oh, no.

204
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,218
What do I do?

205
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm sorry.

206
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,650
I'm the one who told Gang-hwa.

207
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:01,945
I guessed.

208
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,573
You're the only one who knew.

209
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,123
What did Gang-hwa say?

210
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,590
He told me to live.

211
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,307
You're thinking the same thing, right?

212
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,104
Oh Min-jeong.

213
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:38,732
What should I do about her?

214
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,153
No.

215
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,323
This is the right thing.
Saving you comes first.

216
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:49,034
If you leave again,

217
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,037
Gang-hwa won't be able to live properly.

218
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,457
Right?

219
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,918
He won't just feel guilty.

220
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,670
He won't be able to endure it.

221
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,591
Right.

222
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,052
I'm sure he won't.

223
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,141
Yu-ri.

224
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,354
When you told me everything

225
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,899
and said you wouldn't get your place back,

226
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,276
do you know how I felt?

227
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,492
"Because you were

228
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:36,331
around us for five years,
unable to make a sound,

229
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,627
that made you learn to give up."

230
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,091
That thought broke my heart.

231
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,179
Don't give up because

232
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:54,224
you feel sorry about hurting
Gang-hwa and Min-jeong.

233
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,267
Grab that chance.

234
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,394
It's your life.

235
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,365
Hyeon-jeong.

236
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,786
I wasn't giving up.

237
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,124
I was accepting

238
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,210
that my life was over.

239
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,381
I was just

240
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,259
accepting that for five years.

241
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,189
Yu-ri.

242
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:45,942
You're going to find your place,

243
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,236
right?

244
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:33,633
Min-jeong.

245
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,512
I haven't

246
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,057
gotten my thoughts organized yet.

247
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,687
Just wait until I do.

248
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:16,760
KANG BIN

249
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:19,054
KANG BIN (KANG SANG-BONG)

250
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,638
KANG BIN FOUND DEAD

251
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,643
If it's not suicide, why did he die?

252
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:36,154
What?

253
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,282
He says his best friend killed him

254
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:43,036
and made it look like a suicide
to frame him for the match-fixing.

255
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:43,953
What an asshole!

256
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,914
Then we should catch that person!

257
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,248
And my friend

258
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,918
committed suicide later from the guilt.

259
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:53,546
He says his friend committed suicide
after that from the guilt.

260
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,634
But I heard they found his will.

261
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,802
Well...

262
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,305
I was told to write

263
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,933
a letter of apology
for the match-fixing scandal.

264
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,476
When I was talking about leaving,

265
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,354
I meant retiring, not dying.

266
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,357
I was exhausted, so I wanted to retire.

267
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,859
But that's when I was killed.

268
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,156
It was a letter of apology
for the scandal.

269
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,618
And he got killed
while he was writing that.

270
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,121
I don't need anything else.

271
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,665
Just tell my mom.

272
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,042
Can you just tell my mom

273
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,003
that I didn't die because of her?

274
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:36,506
-Your mom?
-His mom?

275
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:37,882
What about her?

276
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,385
My mom

277
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:43,680
thinks I died because of her.

278
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,059
HE SINKS HIS HEAD AND TRAILS OFF
WHEN I ASK HIM ABOUT HIS FAMILY

279
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:52,063
THE PATIENT SEEMS TO WANT
TO RESOLVE HIS ISSUES WITH HIS PARENTS

280
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:08,455
Your eyes, nose, and lips.

281
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,834
You look exactly like her in the photo.

282
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:14,878
How could I not figure that out?

283
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,673
I'm so stupid.

284
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:25,597
Sorry.

285
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,599
I'm sorry.

286
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,771
Why are you so sorry?

287
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,024
That you came back to life?

288
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,110
That you deceived me?

289
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,571
Everything.

290
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,782
I'm sorry about everything.

291
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,371
If you keep apologizing to me,

292
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:54,834
what am I supposed to do?

293
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,049
I want to ask you

294
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,595
why you deceived me and lied to me,

295
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,848
but you keep apologizing to me.

296
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:11,810
What should I do then?

297
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:25,156
Instead of apologizing to me, demand me
to give back Gang-hwa and Seo-woo

298
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:29,035
because they are your family.

299
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,580
Why do you keep saying you're sorry?

300
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,625
I can't do anything if you do that.

301
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,973
It's because I was grateful.

302
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,397
I was grateful

303
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,440
for everything.

304
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,111
That's why I just wanted

305
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,613
to see Seo-woo quietly

306
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,408
and be done with it.

307
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,289
You just wanted to see Seo-woo?

308
00:31:15,331 --> 00:31:16,332
Is that even possible?

309
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,462
That's all you want?

310
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,299
To me,

311
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:27,677
being able to do that was
something to be grateful for.

312
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,605
This would've been better

313
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,317
if you were mean.

314
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,200
I could have used that as an excuse

315
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,996
and done whatever I wanted.

316
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,795
I had the same thought.

317
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:31,759
-Min-jeong.
-I will

318
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,434
leave you.

319
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:46,065
The hand tremor isn't

320
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,068
why you can't operate.

321
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,488
I knew why,
but I pretended that I didn't know

322
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:55,992
because I didn't

323
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,121
want to be jealous of a dead woman.

324
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,126
But now, she's not dead anymore.

325
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,257
You were her family, to begin with.

326
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,134
You

327
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:14,927
and Seo-woo.

328
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,056
You weren't my family.

329
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,697
I am

330
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,203
going to leave you.

331
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:00,932
I'm sorry.

332
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,218
-Yu-ri.
-Yes.

333
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,303
Mom.

334
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:24,390
Do you want to go for a walk
around the area?

335
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,766
Yes, I'll join you.

336
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,110
Now,

337
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,529
the weather has gotten warm.

338
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,866
Yes, flowers are blooming, too.

339
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:46,078
Right.

340
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,209
I should go and see the flowers
with my daughter.

341
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,672
Yu-ri.

342
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:58,925
Yes?

343
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:00,885
Aren't you disappointed?

344
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,221
About what?

345
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,850
It has been only five years,

346
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,394
but nothing is yours now.

347
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,066
I have you.

348
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,946
You are mine and will be mine forever.

349
00:37:21,822 --> 00:37:25,284
I had you when I was born,
alive, and dead.

350
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,954
You had always been mine.

351
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,207
Right.

352
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,127
And you will be mine forever, too, right?

353
00:37:37,171 --> 00:37:39,715
Should we count your dad and Yeon-ji, too?

354
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,758
Shall we?

355
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,686
Gang-hwa was very sick.

356
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,648
I prayed a lot,

357
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:58,526
so he could remarry quickly.

358
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,280
Really?

359
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:08,703
I didn't pray that
for the sake of Gang-hwa or Seo-woo.

360
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,122
But I did it for you.

361
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,501
I thought about how you would feel
if you were watching

362
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,254
and how painful it would be for you.

363
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:24,844
Well done.

364
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,557
Are you sure that was the right thing?

365
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,935
Yes. You were great.

366
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,106
You're the only one who understands me.

367
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,742
Why don't we sit for a while?

368
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:48,826
Sure, Mom.

369
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,212
I always sit on this bench.

370
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:07,762
And Gang-hwa's wife usually sits
on the bench over there.

371
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,521
Was it last year or two years ago?

372
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,692
Seo-woo was playing out here.

373
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:25,488
I pretended to be passing by
and sat on this bench.

374
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,491
You'll fall. Be careful.

375
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,851
Seo-woo, do you want to play
in the playground before we go home?

376
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,144
Yes.

377
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:53,701
Strangely, ever since that day,

378
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,246
Seo-woo was always playing
in the playground around that time.

379
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,750
The day after that,
and the day after that.

380
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,630
At first, I just thought
it was a mere coincidence.

381
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:12,011
Strangely, they only came
whenever I was sitting on this bench.

382
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,305
And

383
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:20,352
they wouldn't leave the playground
until I left.

384
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,608
And then, I figured out

385
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,443
that

386
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,779
she knew who I was.

387
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:34,200
She instinctively knew who I was.

388
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,246
You should have asked.

389
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:46,545
Some relationships are better off
when they are not pursued.

390
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,466
Keeping that boundary was the best.

391
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:53,052
Someone whom I was grateful for.

392
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:54,887
That was it.

393
00:41:57,598 --> 00:42:00,559
That way, I wouldn't want more from her.

394
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,269
Can you give me a glass of beer?

395
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:23,142
Right.

396
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:25,978
I

397
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,732
shouldn't come here now, right?

398
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,699
I'm sorry.

399
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:40,784
Sorry.

400
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,556
Why is everyone

401
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:05,768
apologizing to me?

402
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,480
Why do you all say you're sorry?

403
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,067
If you keep apologizing,

404
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,112
what am I supposed to do?

405
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,075
What should I do?

406
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,561
Gang-hwa has made up his mind.

407
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:53,524
Yes, saving Yu-ri comes first.

408
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,359
I would do the same.

409
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,403
I don't think

410
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,280
he told everything to Min-jeong.

411
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,741
Telling her everything
won't do her any good.

412
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,535
That won't change anything, anyway.

413
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,539
It might be better for her to curse
him out and make him the villain.

414
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:11,875
Right.

415
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:15,045
My gosh, I don't know anymore.

416
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:19,299
You startled me. Why did you fling that
to the table without a warning?

417
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,010
What's wrong with you these days?
You get so easily startled.

418
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,350
Hyeon-jeong.

419
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,063
Never mind.

420
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,108
I just have a problem. That's all.

421
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:37,317
What problem?

422
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:40,362
Did your followers unfollow you?

423
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,489
Are you serious?

424
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,575
What do you take me for?

425
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:48,829
I'm going through something crazy
that has never happened

426
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,539
in my life.

427
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,040
Did you know that?

428
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:53,459
You know nothing.

429
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,877
What's the matter with you?

430
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,921
A ghost is following me.

431
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,006
What?

432
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,885
A ghost is following me. I'm scared.

433
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,096
Do you know how scared I am?

434
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,433
Even now,

435
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,603
somewhere in our restaurant,

436
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:15,939
he might be watching us. I'm scared.

437
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,567
I'm so scared.

438
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,196
Right.

439
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,947
I'll do him that favor.

440
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,368
I'll do it.

441
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,537
Really?

442
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:40,047
Will you leave me alone
if I do this for you?

443
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:45,052
If you do this for me,
I'll stop following you. Okay?

444
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:48,514
Can't you hear me? I'll stop
following you. I'll leave you alone.

445
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,182
You have to keep your promise.

446
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,851
If you don't, I'll call my aunt.

447
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,144
My aunt...

448
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,979
What are you doing, Doctor Gye?

449
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,192
-You're alone here.
-Should I call her or my uncle?

450
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:01,777
It's my mother's birthday next week.

451
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,530
My aunt is not married,
so I should just call her, then.

452
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,032
-What is it?
-Please come in.

453
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,286
Hello.

454
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:12,663
Mom?

455
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,335
Hello.

456
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:21,255
I'm Kang Sang-bong's mother.

457
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:23,966
You wanted to see me.

458
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:25,717
What is this about?

459
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:26,885
Yes, I did.

460
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,764
Well...

461
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,228
Take a look at this.

462
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,188
What

463
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:39,982
is this?

464
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,278
This is your son's medical record.

465
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,030
I thought you should take a look.

466
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:49,825
What?

467
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,374
Unlike what you said in your interview,

468
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,835
was he sick?

469
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,461
No.

470
00:48:04,506 --> 00:48:07,134
Ma'am, could you take a look first?

471
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:13,265
KANG SANG-BONG

472
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:16,476
HE SINKS HIS HEAD AND TRAILS OFF
WHEN I ASK HIM ABOUT HIS FAMILY

473
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,646
THE PATIENT SEEMS TO WANT
TO RESOLVE HIS ISSUES WITH HIS PARENTS

474
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,859
What

475
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,070
is this?

476
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,159
That's Kang Bin's mental state
before he died.

477
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,665
Is this true?

478
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,837
He didn't

479
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,635
resent me until his last breath?

480
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:54,765
That's what I thought.

481
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:58,977
My mom

482
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:04,358
blames herself that I killed myself
because of her.

483
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,487
I came out to my family
for the first time when I was in college.

484
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,531
It took a lot of courage
for me to tell them,

485
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:13,200
but my parents didn't say anything.

486
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,202
They didn't believe me.

487
00:49:15,702 --> 00:49:17,829
That can't be true. No.

488
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,457
No. No, my son.

489
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:21,708
That can't be true.

490
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:26,213
Can you think about this again? Please?

491
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,386
I was really disappointed back then.

492
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,347
It felt as if she denied my existence.

493
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:43,814
So as soon as I joined the team,
I moved out of the house.

494
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,982
And I dodged all of their calls.

495
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:48,985
I didn't visit them, either.

496
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,197
-That's what I did.
-My gosh.

497
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,075
Because I stopped seeing my family,

498
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,203
I couldn't call them afterward at all.

499
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,249
When I decided to resolve our issue,

500
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,795
it seemed too late.

501
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:10,757
During the session with this doctor,

502
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,759
actually,

503
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,430
I asked him how I could resolve
this issue with my family.

504
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,308
That's why I went to him.

505
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:25,230
And after his session, I gathered up
my courage and decided to visit my family.

506
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,898
I bought a present for my mom

507
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,818
-and one for my dad.
-Here you go.

508
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,486
-I bought presents for them.
-Thank you.

509
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:32,696
Bye.

510
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,198
But that night, I died.

511
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,910
ENDLESS LINE OF VISITORS

512
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,245
It was too late.

513
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:47,669
YOU'RE THE BEST IN THE WORLD

514
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:49,045
But after I died,

515
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,591
my mom thought I killed myself

516
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,469
because of what she said back then.

517
00:50:55,552 --> 00:50:56,803
I'M SORRY, MY SON

518
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,222
She kept blaming herself.

519
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:03,101
I can understand that.
That's understandable.

520
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,604
I found out after I died.

521
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,274
When I came out to my family,

522
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,111
my mom

523
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,199
wasn't denying my existence.

524
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,453
She just felt sorry for me.

525
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,539
That's why she said that.

526
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,710
She was just so shocked.

527
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,925
I realized that too late.

528
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:41,473
I wanted to tell

529
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,186
my mom that I don't

530
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,982
resent her.

531
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,777
THE PATIENT SEEMS TO WANT
TO RESOLVE HIS ISSUES WITH HIS PARENTS

532
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:57,823
Ma'am.

533
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,160
The patient didn't resent
any of his family.

534
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,621
It was quite the opposite.

535
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:14,965
Really?

536
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,218
I see.

537
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,018
I'm sorry, Mom.

538
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:31,273
I regretted it too late.

539
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:20,697
What are you doing?

540
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,325
Taking a tour of my room.

541
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,535
Everything is here.

542
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,620
What do you mean?

543
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:31,458
My life as a teenager,
in my 20s, 30s, and up to this day.

544
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:34,920
Right. We've been living
in this house for over 20 years.

545
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,965
After you passed away,
Mom brought all of your stuff

546
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:41,176
from Gang-hwa's house to this room.

547
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,385
Right.

548
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,472
Yu-ri, why don't you start
making glass art again?

549
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,016
You won a lot of awards
and had several exhibitions.

550
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,601
And it was your dream, too.

551
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,940
It's not my dream anymore.

552
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,566
It changed.

553
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,818
Is there a new career you want?
What is it?

554
00:54:01,488 --> 00:54:02,489
Seo-woo.

555
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,707
Yu-ri, come on out!

556
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,298
What brings you here again?
Are you here to drop off Seo-woo?

557
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:25,345
No, I came here for Yu-ri.

558
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,223
We need to go somewhere.

559
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,101
With Yu-ri? Where?

560
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,103
Seo-woo.

561
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,148
Go change your clothes.
We should get going.

562
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:39,567
Go where?

563
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,324
Let's just go and get some fresh air
with Seo-woo.

564
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,662
Well...

565
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,645
What's gotten into Gang-hwa?

566
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,397
Did something happen?

567
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:21,192
This isn't like him.

568
00:55:40,795 --> 00:55:42,338
Where are we going?

569
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,506
What?

570
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:47,844
I'm not sure.

571
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:51,973
Seo-woo, where should we go?
Where do you want to go?

572
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,600
An amusement park.

573
00:56:00,398 --> 00:56:03,777
Welcome. Please show me
your ticket. Have a great day.

574
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:06,488
Please show me your ticket. Have fun.

575
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,323
Let's say hello to the bear.

576
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:10,325
Hi.

577
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,619
-My gosh, you look like a princess.
-A princess?

578
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:14,287
Do you want to see yourself in a mirror?

579
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,246
All right.

580
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,166
Ta-da.

581
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,044
You look beautiful, right?

582
00:57:42,709 --> 00:57:45,295
Wow, it's a clown.
Do you know what a clown is?

583
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,382
Right.

584
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,060
Thank you.

585
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,147
-Seo-woo, say goodbye.
-Goodbye.

586
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,822
She must've been tired to be outside.

587
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,324
Right.

588
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,078
She's so cute.

589
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,498
You know what?

590
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:25,502
She wriggles her mouth from time to time
while she sleeps.

591
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:29,881
That's you.

592
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,842
You wriggle your mouth when you sleep.

593
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:37,847
You're right.

594
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,019
That was my habit.

595
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,772
It was times like these

596
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,483
when I'd be

597
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:51,319
reminded of you

598
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,655
through Seo-woo.

599
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,742
I began to see bits of you

600
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,620
as Seo-woo grew up little by little.

601
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:04,791
It's not that I held onto you.

602
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:07,794
I couldn't help but hold onto you

603
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:11,506
because you left me with something so big.

604
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:18,513
But even if

605
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,182
I went back in time,

606
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:23,977
I still would have saved her.

607
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,580
You know who I am, don't you?

608
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:37,216
I guess you knew instinctively.

609
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:42,347
It's not easy to hide one's heart.

610
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:01,574
I knew it.

611
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,912
I thought it was odd. It happened.

612
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:08,915
I guess he told you.

613
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,255
Seo-woo's mom.

614
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,726
Why are you surprised?
You're Seo-woo's mom.

615
01:01:38,152 --> 01:01:41,489
Just as you know Seo-woo the best,

616
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,952
I know my daughter the best too.

617
01:01:47,161 --> 01:01:49,664
So I can tell you this for sure.

618
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:54,335
What you're worried about

619
01:01:55,336 --> 01:01:57,088
won't happen.

620
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:24,991
Thank you for minding me too.

621
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,914
That's something
I really wanted to tell you.

622
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,210
Seo-woo, did you have fun today?

623
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,377
Yes.

624
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,548
I had a lot of fun too.

625
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,260
Thank you for playing with me.

626
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:29,931
Thank you.

627
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,447
Mom!

628
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:47,949
-Seo-woo.
-Seo-woo.

629
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:52,912
I'm sorry.

630
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:56,874
Seo-woo.

631
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,502
My goodness.

632
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,674
Ms. Mi-dong might end up
hurting her knees.

633
01:04:47,925 --> 01:04:50,595
She hasn't had a drop of water
since this morning doing that.

634
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:51,971
What's going on?

635
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,222
It's Yu-ri.

636
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,767
She's determined to find out
why Yu-ri was the only one

637
01:04:57,351 --> 01:04:59,353
who was sent back here.

638
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,584
Yu-ri.

639
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:26,172
You should quit
working at the kindergarten too.

640
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:30,384
First, you can get your place back
as Seo-woo's mom,

641
01:05:30,468 --> 01:05:32,094
then we'll bring back everything.

642
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,640
I told the hospital
that I'm taking a few days off.

643
01:05:36,724 --> 01:05:38,726
Let's all stay with Seo-woo
starting tomorrow.

644
01:05:44,482 --> 01:05:45,775
You need to stop, Gang-hwa.

645
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,445
You've done enough.

646
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:51,864
That's enough.

647
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,200
What?

648
01:05:58,788 --> 01:05:59,789
I won't

649
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:02,249
take my place back.

650
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:06,837
No, I can't.

651
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:11,050
What do you mean
you can't take your place back?

652
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,892
I've never

653
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:24,855
loved anyone else
more than I loved myself.

654
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:27,692
It was the first time

655
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,945
I had someone
who was more precious than myself.

656
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:35,491
My daughter.

657
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,160
Our Seo-woo.

658
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,957
What about her? What about Seo-woo?

659
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:47,003
If I live,

660
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:50,047
Seo-woo will end up

661
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:53,342
seeing ghosts for life.

662
01:06:58,514 --> 01:06:59,348
You...

663
01:07:00,141 --> 01:07:01,642
You said she won't see them.

664
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,979
That she'll stop seeing them soon.

665
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:08,816
I want to live.

666
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:10,985
I want to live, Ms. Mi-dong.

667
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:26,083
I was wondering
why you didn't spill out your heart yet.

668
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,545
You held out for a long time.

669
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:36,844
Live. You can live.

670
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,765
But if you don't go back up,

671
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:46,187
I can't keep my promise that
your daughter will stop seeing ghosts.

672
01:07:50,775 --> 01:07:51,984
What are you talking about?

673
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,778
If you live,

674
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,406
she'll see ghosts for life.

675
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,285
What?

676
01:08:01,368 --> 01:08:04,038
Your body isn't in this world anymore.

677
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,501
You're neither a human being
nor a ghost right now.

678
01:08:11,170 --> 01:08:12,254
Wait.

679
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,384
Then does this mean

680
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,348
she had been seeing them all along
because of me?

681
01:08:24,016 --> 01:08:25,351
I only found out recently.

682
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:28,062
I can't believe this.

683
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,861
Then why was I brought back to life?

684
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:40,032
That judgment or whatever.
Why was I told to take my place back?

685
01:08:41,325 --> 01:08:43,244
I can't let my daughter see ghosts

686
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:45,496
so that I can live.

687
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,498
Goodness.

688
01:08:47,998 --> 01:08:49,166
What is this nonsense?

689
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:58,968
No. I thought she'd stop seeing them,

690
01:09:00,261 --> 01:09:01,387
but no.

691
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:04,056
As long as I stay here,

692
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:07,726
she'll keep seeing them

693
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,187
all her life.

694
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,695
It all started because of me,

695
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:19,738
so I have to put an end to this too.

696
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:25,411
I wanted to

697
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:28,372
let Seo-woo dream of anything.

698
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:32,126
I wanted her to want to become anything
and do everything she wants.

699
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,675
So I can't let her

700
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,095
keep seeing ghosts
just so that I could live.

701
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,809
Wait.

702
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,235
We might be able to fix that.

703
01:09:59,528 --> 01:10:01,614
There could be a way, Yu-ri.

704
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:06,493
After I had Seo-woo,

705
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,788
my tomorrow was always filled with her.

706
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,750
"Will she walk tomorrow?

707
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:14,835
Will she run tomorrow?

708
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,380
How much more will she grow tomorrow?"

709
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,051
I can't ruin

710
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,428
her tomorrow like this.

711
01:10:24,845 --> 01:10:28,641
I can't let Seo-woo be afraid
and tormented because of me.

712
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,353
How can I live with that?

713
01:10:35,522 --> 01:10:36,649
She's only

714
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:38,943
six years old.

715
01:10:41,111 --> 01:10:42,154
My daughter.

716
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,676
My goodness.

717
01:11:39,545 --> 01:11:41,505
WISHING PAPER

718
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:57,438
I WANT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER ONCE MORE,
WRITTEN BY JEON EUN-SUK

719
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:04,153
Goodness. It's okay, Mom.
It won't kill me.

720
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:10,659
Okay. I'll finish it quickly,
and go straight home.

721
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:11,744
Okay.

722
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:22,713
Yeol-mu, should we just go home?

723
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:25,591
Should we?

724
01:12:45,319 --> 01:12:46,945
-What's going on?
-Sir.

725
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:49,031
-He was hit.
-Are you all right?

726
01:12:49,990 --> 01:12:51,450
Call 911!

727
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:55,120
What happened? Oh, gosh.

728
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,539
If your life hadn't stopped,

729
01:12:58,332 --> 01:13:00,250
what kind of tomorrow would we have lived?

730
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:09,802
Gosh, Seo-woo. Give me a second.
I'm all done.

731
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,847
Daddy is coming. Shake well. Hurry.

732
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:16,934
Okay, Seo-woo. He's coming.

733
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:20,479
You must be hungry.
Goodness, you poor thing.

734
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:24,650
Seo-woo, it's okay. Don't cry.

735
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:26,652
Cho Gang-hwa! What are you doing?

736
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,736
Okay, coming!

737
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,655
She's crying. Hurry.

738
01:13:29,988 --> 01:13:31,281
Seo-woo, Daddy is here.

739
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,784
-Daddy is coming.
-It's all right.

740
01:13:36,537 --> 01:13:40,416
Come here. Why are you so sad?

741
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,459
Come here.

742
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,296
Look at that.

743
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,806
She's going. She's going to walk.

744
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:57,349
-Come here.
-Go, go!

745
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:00,602
-You did it!
-My gosh. She must be a genius.

746
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:01,895
Seo-woo!

747
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,820
Let's go to China.

748
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:12,030
Let's go to the States.

749
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:13,490
Is it fun? Is it?

750
01:14:13,574 --> 01:14:14,992
Let's go to Japan.

751
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,327
-Dad, are you okay?
-Exactly.

752
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,170
Yesterday or today,

753
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,380
my tomorrow

754
01:15:10,881 --> 01:15:12,758
had always been you.

755
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,626
