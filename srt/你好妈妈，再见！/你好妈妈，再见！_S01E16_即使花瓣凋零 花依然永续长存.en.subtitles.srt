1
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,466
You need to stop, Gang-hwa.

2
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:52,886
You've done enough.

3
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:55,305
That's enough.

4
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:57,640
What?

5
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,229
I won't

6
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,690
take my place back.

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:10,195
No, I can't.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,532
What do you mean
you can't take your place back?

9
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,124
I've never

10
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:28,296
loved anyone else
more than I loved myself.

11
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,132
It was the first time

12
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,427
I had someone
who was more precious than myself.

13
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,890
My daughter.

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:41,601
Our Seo-woo.

15
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,397
What about her? What about Seo-woo?

16
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,568
If I live,

17
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,196
Seo-woo will end up

18
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,699
seeing ghosts for life.

19
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:02,622
You...

20
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,958
You said she won't see them.

21
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:08,586
That she'll stop seeing them soon.

22
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,555
Are you finished?

23
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,015
Gosh, this is great.

24
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,475
Did you draw our home?

25
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,436
Who

26
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,021
is this here?

27
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,189
Uncle.

28
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,315
"Uncle"?

29
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,609
This uncle...

30
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,321
-Who is he?
-He's not here anymore.

31
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,715
YU-RI

32
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:56,968
The kindergarten and your house are safe

33
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,680
Soon she won't see ghosts anymore.
Don't worry.

34
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,270
No. I thought she'd stop seeing them,

35
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,106
but no.

36
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:13,026
As long as I stay here,

37
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,613
she'll keep seeing them.

38
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,073
For life.

39
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,581
It all started because of me,

40
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,625
so I have to put an end to this too.

41
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,339
I wanted to

42
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,383
let Seo-woo dream of anything.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,095
I wanted her to want to become anything
and do everything she wants.

44
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,603
So I can't let her

45
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,731
keep seeing ghosts
just so that I could live.

46
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,737
Wait.

47
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:07,121
We might be able to fix that.

48
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,458
There could be a way, Yu-ri.

49
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,463
After I had Seo-woo,

50
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,549
my tomorrow was always filled with her.

51
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,636
"Will she walk tomorrow?

52
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,638
Will she run tomorrow?

53
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:27,267
How much more will she grow tomorrow?"

54
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,520
I can't ruin

55
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,106
her tomorrow like this.

56
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,777
I can't let Seo-woo be afraid
and tormented because of me.

57
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,239
How can I live with that?

58
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,493
She's only

59
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,662
six years old.

60
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:50,999
My daughter.

61
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:16,524
No, Yu-ri.

62
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,068
There has to be a way.

63
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,864
There must be.
That's probably how you came back to life.

64
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,116
Right?

65
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,996
You said you could live
if you got your place back.

66
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,706
You said you could live, Yu-ri!

67
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,792
You can't do anything about this.
It's my problem.

68
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,297
Like that day five years ago,

69
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,091
it's my decision.

70
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:48,723
You did everything you could.

71
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,270
Gang-hwa.

72
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,733
Thank you.

73
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,929
I didn't want to
make you feel guilty again.

74
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,481
So I was going to leave

75
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,192
after 49 days.

76
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,278
But you found out

77
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,322
about everything.

78
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,911
It was all my decision,

79
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,832
but I was afraid
you'd think it was your fault again.

80
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:36,998
Did I

81
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,667
do the right job

82
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,003
by telling Gang-hwa?

83
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,421
Of course.

84
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,965
If he had found out

85
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,050
after Yu-ri was gone,

86
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:51,262
not just the OR, but life itself
wouldâ€™ve become terrifying to him.

87
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,722
Losing her

88
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,265
after not having done anything

89
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,976
and at least having tried something
would be different.

90
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,061
You did the right thing.

91
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:02,982
If you leave again,

92
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:05,943
Gang-hwa won't be able to live properly.

93
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,570
Right?

94
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,363
He won't just feel guilty.

95
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,116
He won't be able to endure it.

96
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,453
Right.

97
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,122
I'm sure he won't.

98
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,965
Yu-ri.

99
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,552
You're going to find your place,

100
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,721
right?

101
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,730
That must be it.

102
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,607
-What?
-Gang Hwa.

103
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,275
To make him do something...

104
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,362
After she's gone,

105
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,365
she doesn't want him to feel guilty.

106
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:55,284
-What?
-I think

107
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,746
Yu-ri is going to leave.

108
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,957
I think

109
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,210
she's just going to leave.

110
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:20,643
I WANT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER ONCE MORE,
WRITTEN BY JEON EUN-SUK

111
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,256
I want to see

112
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,427
my daughter

113
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,429
once more.

114
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,849
I want to see her.

115
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,477
Just once.

116
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,523
Please just once.

117
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,152
I really want to see my daughter.

118
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,576
That was it.

119
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,663
That's why they sent Yu-ri.

120
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:36,844
Pine tree, pine tree

121
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:43,351
Your light is evergreen

122
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,732
On a lonely autumn day

123
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:55,446
And even in a snowstorm

124
00:10:56,072 --> 00:11:02,328
Pine tree, pine tree

125
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:09,627
Your light is evergreen

126
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,097
Everyone ran away

127
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,681
and went up.

128
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,394
It's empty.

129
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,563
Ms. Mi-dong hadn't been able to
send them up for ten years,

130
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,567
but the exorcist took care of them
in a few days.

131
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:40,324
By the way, weren't you
the first one on the list?

132
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,450
Why are you still here?

133
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,123
Instead of me,

134
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,126
Kang Sang-bong went up first.

135
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,546
He said he had no more regrets.

136
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,428
You must be sad
because your friend is gone.

137
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:16,152
What's wrong? Was your son here again?

138
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,948
Your son who comes over here drunk
every time his business fails?

139
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,993
He's been coming to you
quite often lately.

140
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:27,746
I guess something's not going well.

141
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,167
It's not easy to make a living.

142
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:35,212
He's going flat out,

143
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:39,508
but life is just tough.

144
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,844
Come to think of it,
life has always been tough.

145
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:46,724
People just struggle
to support their families.

146
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,562
I feel really bad for my son.

147
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,119
Yu-ri.

148
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:08,954
Mom.

149
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:11,832
What are you doing?

150
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:13,751
Well...

151
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,045
I'm clearing up my stuff here.

152
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,506
They are old, and I don't even use them.

153
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,965
They just take up a lot of room.

154
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:24,970
I see.

155
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,448
Mom.

156
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,492
Yes?

157
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,454
Why did you leave my room untouched?

158
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,249
You were sad whenever you saw it.

159
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,920
I guess I knew you'd come back.

160
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:05,970
My daughter is in this room.

161
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:09,932
Me?

162
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:10,891
Yes.

163
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,856
My daughter who entered school

164
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,317
with a bag that was
almost as big as herself.

165
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,656
My teenage daughter

166
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:29,159
who would giggle
over rolling leaves on the street.

167
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,830
My daughter who wept sadly

168
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,457
as if her life was over
when she failed the college exam.

169
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,841
If this room was gone,

170
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,846
it would've felt like
you weren't even here to begin with.

171
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:53,601
So I couldn't get rid of your stuff.

172
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,578
It's okay

173
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,372
even if I'm not in this world.

174
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,379
I'm living in your heart all the time

175
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,924
That's all that matters.

176
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,640
You're right.

177
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,770
It's okay as long as you live in my heart.

178
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,037
What's wrong?

179
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:39,790
What?

180
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,458
Why?

181
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:43,210
What are you thinking about?

182
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,756
Nothing.

183
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,386
Did you have the dream again last night?

184
00:16:58,392 --> 00:16:59,393
Yes.

185
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
I still think it's not right.

186
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,030
There must be a way. I'll find it.

187
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:55,449
There is no way.

188
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,035
First, just live.

189
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:00,704
-As for Seo-woo, I'll--
-Don't you remember

190
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:03,165
the time she was locked in the freezer?

191
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,961
She

192
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,713
almost died then.

193
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,883
This isn't just about being scared
because she sees ghosts.

194
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,934
I've been dead already.

195
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,728
Being alive like this

196
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,731
is the weird part.

197
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:31,944
Yu-ri.

198
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:37,032
Anyway, you can live. Try to live.
You should do something, Yu-ri.

199
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,992
Since you already died once, should I say,

200
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,286
"Okay. Bye.
You've been dead already anyway"?

201
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,246
Does that make sense?

202
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,039
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,883
Yu-ri.

204
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,652
What is this?

205
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:16,947
Your mom's wish.

206
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,700
The reason why you came back to life.

207
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,917
I WANT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER ONCE MORE,
WRITTEN BY JEON EUN-SUK

208
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,462
Is this it?

209
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,715
Is this why I came to life?

210
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,342
Yes.

211
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:49,479
I WANT TO SEE MY DAUGHTER ONCE MORE...

212
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,634
She prayed every single day.

213
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,429
I thought she was praying
for her daughter's peace,

214
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:24,514
but that wasn't it.

215
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,726
She was praying

216
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,937
to see her daughter one more time.

217
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,156
So this is it.

218
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:44,409
I had no idea.

219
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,329
I only cared about my daughter.

220
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,206
That's what everyone does.

221
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,584
I also chose to live like this

222
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:55,379
because my son would've done it
if I didn't.

223
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,631
But he wouldn't let me come close to him

224
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,424
because his son is still young.

225
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,510
That's what

226
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,971
all children do.

227
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,432
I would've done the same thing to my mom.

228
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,019
Then what about the judgment?

229
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,188
What's the deal with the judgment?

230
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,650
Whether you will be greedy or not...

231
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,527
I think that's the judgment.

232
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,405
I can be greedy,

233
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,826
but if I do, I will have to switch
my life with Seo-woo's.

234
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,996
I won't do that.

235
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,748
I'll go up no matter what.

236
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:35,168
I'll just

237
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,756
make the most out of the remaining time.

238
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,183
At first, I wasn't even sure
if this was a reward or a punishment.

239
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,894
I didn't understand
why this was happening to me.

240
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,605
It's neither of them.

241
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,607
What is it then?

242
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,320
A gift.

243
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:13,665
Hi.

244
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,418
Hey, Seo-woo.

245
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,804
Is that really you, Yu-ri?

246
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,182
Mom!

247
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,005
Come to think of it,

248
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,800
I died all of a sudden

249
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,219
without getting to hold my kid

250
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,679
and say goodbye to her.

251
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,516
I guess I got this gift
because I was too pitiful.

252
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,189
If I went up there just like that,
I would've been really upset.

253
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,943
But I'm fine now.

254
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,697
I will just enjoy the time I have left

255
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,118
and say goodbye to Seo-woo before I leave.

256
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,456
You've changed.

257
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,918
What do you mean?

258
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,588
You've become stronger.

259
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,841
You are a real mom now.

260
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,233
Right.

261
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,695
It's a blessing for you to
settle your affairs

262
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,030
before you leave.

263
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,502
What are you talking about?

264
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,676
Are you leaving?

265
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,345
No. Yu-ri.

266
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,055
No.

267
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,435
What if you were me?

268
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,729
If it makes Ha-jun's life miserable,

269
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,231
would you still want to live?

270
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:45,984
No, but...

271
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:54,075
I was supposed to leave
in the first place.

272
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,578
And I was going to.

273
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,081
You know it.

274
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:03,501
Gosh, what's all this?

275
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,464
Why is everyone being so mean to you?

276
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:08,673
Why on earth...

277
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,855
Hyeon-jeong.

278
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,400
Can't you help me?

279
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,866
Please help me.

280
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,038
I...

281
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,165
want to leave with a smile.

282
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,045
Please help me do that.

283
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,682
Do you...

284
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,434
Do you

285
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,607
really have to leave?

286
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:16,700
Yes.

287
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,354
Yu-ri.

288
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,240
I'm sorry.

289
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,367
I...

290
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,662
I'm really...

291
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,707
I'm so sorry.

292
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:02,847
I do understand how you feel,

293
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,725
but you might regret

294
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,478
wasting time like this later.

295
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:14,984
Who are you?

296
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:23,034
You know something, right?

297
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,912
You know Yu-ri, right?

298
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,457
I know

299
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,502
just as much as you do.

300
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,673
That Yu-ri has to leave.

301
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,760
Is there a way for her to stay?

302
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,056
Then your daughter will have to see ghosts

303
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,811
for the rest of her life.

304
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,705
I'll see ghosts instead of Seo-woo.

305
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,708
No, I'll go up instead of Yu-ri.

306
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,252
I'll do anything. Please.

307
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,352
There's nothing you can do.

308
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:36,775
CHA YU-RI

309
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,249
Sending someone away in a proper manner

310
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,419
can be a way of showing respect.

311
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,301
What is this?

312
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,095
Min-jeong gave them to me.

313
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,014
They're for you and me.

314
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,061
She came here,

315
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,814
cried the whole time, and left.

316
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,237
And?

317
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,490
Did she say anything else?

318
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,537
She's divorcing Gang-hwa.

319
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,832
What?

320
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,419
Why?

321
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,254
Is it because of me?

322
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,299
No, she can't divorce him.

323
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,343
I'll go talk to her.

324
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,013
It's between the two of them.

325
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,015
It's none of your business.

326
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,392
-It's all my fault!
-No, it isn't.

327
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,979
They have to either get divorced
or work on their marriage anyway.

328
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,439
No.

329
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:23,816
They shouldn't get divorced.

330
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,152
Don't you know

331
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:29,322
how much Min-jeong loves
Gang-hwa and Seo-woo?

332
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,575
Gang-hwa needs her too.

333
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,697
Seo-woo.

334
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,949
You're pretty.

335
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,660
So pretty.

336
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,828
Does Mommy look sick?

337
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,459
Thanks.

338
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,855
I'll talk to her.

339
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,732
Wait for now.

340
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,741
-Let's play.
-Come here.

341
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,909
Seo-woo.

342
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,120
-Miss.
-Yes?

343
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,872
When did Seo-woo get here?

344
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:43,956
Who dropped her off?

345
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,041
Pardon?

346
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,754
Seo-woo's mother dropped her off
just a while ago.

347
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,842
Seo-woo.

348
00:34:54,967 --> 00:34:56,094
Seo-woo!

349
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,386
What is it?

350
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,846
Are you okay?

351
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,432
-Seo-woo!
-Seo-woo, what's wrong?

352
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,892
-Goodness.
-What's going on?

353
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:03,935
Quickly.

354
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,812
Take her to the hospital
and call her mother.

355
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,314
-Take her to the hospital.
-I'll do it. I'll carry her.

356
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:09,982
Seo-woo.

357
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,485
Hurry.

358
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,949
Be careful.

359
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,370
Excuse me! Doctor!

360
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,913
This way, please.

361
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,668
Goodness.

362
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,420
Seo-woo.

363
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,224
What's wrong with her?

364
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,727
It's an acute enteritis.
She's okay now, so don't worry.

365
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,413
Ms. Oh, you're here.

366
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:18,467
Is Seo-woo okay?

367
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,803
Yes. She has acute enteritis.

368
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,432
I see.

369
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,111
Ms. Oh.

370
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,422
Min-jeong!

371
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,483
Don't go.

372
00:37:22,490 --> 00:37:23,324
Then,

373
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,577
what do you want me to do?

374
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:32,166
You came.

375
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,670
Seo-woo's real mom is here.

376
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,965
What do you

377
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,801
want me to do?

378
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:46,555
I have to leave.

379
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,849
I must.

380
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,815
Seo-woo and Gang-hwa

381
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,109
need you.

382
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:01,320
Please don't go.

383
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,869
What brings you here?

384
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,583
I need to look into something.

385
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:00,921
What is it?

386
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,924
Do you feel anxious?

387
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,471
I'm afraid

388
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,725
it'll all disappear.

389
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,436
I'm afraid

390
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,355
Yu-ri

391
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,525
will be gone again.

392
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:29,909
Gang-hwa.

393
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,080
Ever since Yu-ri came back,

394
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,249
I've been having the same dream every day.

395
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,420
In my dream, Yu-ri says goodbye

396
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,882
and leaves.

397
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,762
When I wake up and see Yu-ri in my arms,

398
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,847
I get relieved.

399
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,474
"She didn't leave.

400
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,559
She's still here."

401
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,231
But strangely enough,

402
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,568
I have that dream every single day.

403
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,952
Then this thought came to my mind.

404
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:15,704
Perhaps my daughter who is here right now

405
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,167
actually came back to say goodbye.

406
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:25,005
Is she saying farewell in my dream
every day

407
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:28,092
to prepare me

408
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,303
for the real moment of parting?

409
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,889
So I thought,

410
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,810
if that's the case,

411
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,108
when that day comes,

412
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,027
I'll say goodbye

413
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:52,158
to my daughter with a smile.

414
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,017
Gang-hwa.

415
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,854
I didn't want to
make you feel guilty again.

416
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,147
I'm sorry.

417
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,398
I'm so sorry.

418
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,358
I'm sorry for everything.

419
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,654
Stop blaming yourself.

420
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,823
It's not your fault.

421
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,179
Leave?

422
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,098
Where are you going?

423
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,104
I didn't come back from the dead.

424
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,274
I'm back here only briefly.

425
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,944
For only 49 days.

426
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,743
That's why I asked Gang-hwa
not to tell you.

427
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,704
Because I have to leave

428
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,665
anyway.

429
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,707
Wait a minute.

430
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,876
You're back

431
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:27,920
only briefly?

432
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,673
Does that mean

433
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,635
you'll die again?

434
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,644
Does Gang-hwa know

435
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,146
that you have to leave?

436
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:59,243
I don't know what Gang-hwa said,

437
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,120
but he didn't mean it.

438
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,205
That's him feeling guilty toward me.

439
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,167
Because he blamed himself

440
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,045
for my death five years ago.

441
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,594
He

442
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,471
likes you a lot.

443
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,308
Nobody else might notice,

444
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,351
and even Gang-hwa may not realize it
himself,

445
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,270
but I do.

446
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,737
Don't you hate me?

447
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:45,914
Why don't you hate me?

448
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,502
If I were you, I'd hate me a lot.

449
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,756
Why...

450
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,261
I

451
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,599
hurt Gang-hwa
and turned him into a thorny cactus.

452
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,811
You're holding him
without knowing that you're bleeding.

453
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:12,149
Also,

454
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,779
you're Seo-woo's favorite person
in the world.

455
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,537
I was so relieved.

456
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,461
"Thank goodness, she's Seo-woo's mom."

457
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:35,381
That's what I thought to myself every day.

458
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,132
Why would I hate you?

459
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,554
Can't you

460
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:46,642
just stay?

461
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,812
Isn't there a way you can stay?

462
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:53,607
No.

463
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,419
We're taking Seo-woo
to the hospital because she's sick.

464
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,045
Please call us when you see this.

465
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:57,379
Thank you.

466
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,342
Do you know what you said the most

467
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,888
while we were living together?

468
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:09,057
"I'm sorry.

469
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:10,392
Thank you.

470
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,352
It's all right."

471
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,442
You said, "thank you"
when I combed Seo-woo's hair.

472
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,945
You said, "thank you"
when I tucked her into bed.

473
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,864
I did

474
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,159
what was a natural thing to do as a mom.

475
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,578
But you kept thanking me.

476
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,873
Like I was a stranger.

477
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,753
I had

478
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,590
planned to file for divorce.

479
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,222
Because you were too nice.

480
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,060
You were being too considerate.

481
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,398
I didn't want to have regrets again.

482
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,985
"I should've been nicer.

483
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,242
I should've done what she asked.

484
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:09,743
I should've

485
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,204
held back."

486
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,083
I didn't want to have those regrets again.

487
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,253
Like I did with Yu-ri.

488
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,257
You're finally opening up.

489
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,767
Why are we having this talk now?

490
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,728
After we've gone through

491
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:39,815
a messy and bloody time.

492
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:00,085
Cha Yu-ri.

493
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,379
Yu-ri.

494
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:10,929
Give her a good send-off.

495
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,850
Put your heart into it
and do the best you can.

496
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:18,854
Have no regrets.

497
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,737
Let's talk about our divorce

498
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,573
after that.

499
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,590
She prayed every single day.

500
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,676
I thought she was praying
for her daughter's peace,

501
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:51,928
but that wasn't it.

502
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,307
She was praying

503
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,768
to see her daughter one more time.

504
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:14,576
Goodness.

505
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:16,495
What are you doing?

506
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,039
I want to look at you closely.

507
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:23,001
Goodness, are you a kid?

508
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,587
Yes, I'm your kid.

509
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,343
When I'm done folding laundry,

510
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,220
I have something to give you.

511
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:44,815
Mom.

512
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:47,067
What are you waiting for? Eat.

513
00:49:49,111 --> 00:49:50,070
Here.

514
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,657
It's wild seaweed, so it's really soft.

515
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,033
Go ahead and try it.

516
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,081
You should eat too.

517
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:04,751
Should I?

518
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,025
Eat.

519
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,377
It's tasty.

520
00:51:02,726 --> 00:51:04,060
Was it tasty?

521
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:05,270
Yes.

522
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,856
I'd bought

523
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,526
so much seaweed,

524
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:14,196
thinking I'd give it to you
when you gave birth.

525
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:17,115
The whole sink was filled with seaweed.

526
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:21,995
Finally, I got you to eat it now.

527
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,997
It was really tasty.

528
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,586
Yu-ri.

529
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:36,092
Can I ask you something?

530
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:40,806
Sure.

531
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,648
Were you

532
00:51:52,442 --> 00:51:53,443
with me

533
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,656
the whole time?

534
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,083
Were you?

535
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,463
Tell me, were you?

536
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,094
Mom.

537
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:30,981
So you were.

538
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,193
You were.

539
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,366
I thought

540
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,371
you put Seo-woo's stuff away
because you missed her.

541
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:55,589
But it was because of me, right?

542
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:05,891
So that was it.

543
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,105
You were with me the whole time.

544
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,027
I had no idea.

545
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,742
I'm sorry I suffered too much.

546
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,537
You must have felt so sad.

547
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,076
Don't cry.

548
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:10,121
Mom, don't cry.

549
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,858
It's okay, Mom.

550
00:54:41,903 --> 00:54:44,072
Did you miss me a lot?

551
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,118
Yes.

552
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,123
I wished I could see you
just one more time.

553
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,251
There was something

554
00:54:57,502 --> 00:55:01,256
I really wanted to say to you.

555
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,851
I'm sorry.

556
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,690
Why are you sorry?

557
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,067
Why would you say that?

558
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,033
You cried even when you just

559
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,535
cut your finger a little.

560
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:36,207
To think that you suffered
on that cold ground alone.

561
00:55:38,084 --> 00:55:40,378
To think how scared you would have been.

562
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,884
I could never seem
to let go of that thought.

563
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,639
I'm sorry I couldn't be with you.

564
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,392
I'm sorry I left you alone, my baby.

565
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:01,107
I wasn't scared at all.

566
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:06,571
I stayed strong to the end.

567
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,199
I wasn't alone.

568
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:13,119
I was with Seo-woo, Mom.

569
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:16,456
That's why I could stay strong.

570
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,834
I wasn't scared.

571
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,475
Mom.

572
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:39,771
Mom.

573
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,902
Her son is here again.

574
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,487
Mom.

575
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,072
He comes here every time he drinks.

576
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,366
He's been coming here often lately.

577
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,037
I guess he has a lot of trouble
to drink for.

578
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:59,666
Making ends meet isn't easy.

579
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:01,835
Even when you get old,

580
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:05,922
you can't help but miss your mom.

581
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,219
When you're at that age,

582
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:16,141
you don't have anywhere to go
to cry all you want.

583
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,517
That's the age

584
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:20,186
you miss your mom the most.

585
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:25,859
I miss my mom, too.

586
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:28,653
Mom.

587
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,741
My baby.

588
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,660
It's okay.

589
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:36,995
It's all right.

590
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,498
There.

591
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,666
It's okay.

592
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:45,670
It's all right.

593
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,631
Mom.

594
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,717
It's okay.

595
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:51,843
It's all right.

596
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,433
My baby.

597
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,812
Goodness. My baby.

598
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,574
Is there

599
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,702
really no way?

600
00:58:18,953 --> 00:58:19,787
No.

601
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,539
There isn't.

602
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:26,878
Do you

603
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:31,007
really want to leave?

604
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,180
Yes.

605
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:52,028
If only I had known a little earlier...

606
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:55,823
Then I would've

607
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:58,117
let you see Seo-woo more often.

608
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:01,829
I acted like a fool.

609
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,498
No.

610
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,167
I was a ghost,

611
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:08,294
so these moments were
really precious to me.

612
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:11,506
I could touch Seo-woo.

613
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:14,384
I could hold you when you were hurting.

614
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:15,635
To me,

615
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,595
it was like a gift.

616
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,984
How can I let you go again?

617
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,324
I'm sorry, Gang-hwa.

618
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:41,452
I'm sorry about five years ago

619
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:42,745
and now.

620
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,124
I'm really sorry

621
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,792
for leaving.

622
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,378
No, I'm sorry.

623
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:53,131
I'm sorry about everything.

624
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,799
Why are you sorry?

625
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,554
When you've given me so much.

626
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,851
Thank you

627
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:09,355
for loving me while we were together.

628
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,233
That's enough for me.

629
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:38,569
Seo-woo.

630
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,996
The pretty auntie

631
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,290
is actually

632
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,087
your mom

633
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,341
who gave birth to you.

634
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,680
Your mom

635
01:02:10,476 --> 01:02:12,353
must love you a lot.

636
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,190
No.

637
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,154
She loves you a lot.

638
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:42,508
Will you

639
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:45,011
forgive me

640
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,559
someday?

641
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:28,596
THINGS I WANT TO DO

642
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:49,534
KEEP MY PROMISE WITH MY FRIENDS

643
01:03:51,285 --> 01:03:52,662
You said you'd do me a favor,

644
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:54,330
but you never showed up.

645
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:55,581
And now you're leaving?

646
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:59,001
You know I've been really busy.

647
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:00,711
I'm here now, aren't I?

648
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,713
Is grilled pork belly all you want?

649
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,882
Isn't this too simple?

650
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:07,385
Are you all right?

651
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,095
Yes, I'm fine.

652
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,225
Hey.

653
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:16,394
Hurry up.

654
01:04:16,477 --> 01:04:18,396
-Quickly.
-Okay.

655
01:04:18,479 --> 01:04:19,730
I'm going to faint.

656
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,982
Just wait.

657
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,234
Ta-da.

658
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,946
GHOST PARK HYE-JIN

659
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:40,334
Eat slowly.

660
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:41,961
-It's good.
-Indigestion can last a year.

661
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:45,131
Is this really all you want?

662
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,966
I have no other favor to ask you.

663
01:04:47,508 --> 01:04:50,553
I don't want my kids to know
that I'm still here as a ghost.

664
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,973
We're going to go up there soon.

665
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,893
Thanks for keeping me company
for five years when I was a ghost.

666
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:59,020
There's always a way to survive.

667
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,438
Even when you're dead,

668
01:05:01,105 --> 01:05:04,275
you make friends and carry on.

669
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:05,401
Even ghosts

670
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,238
have to say goodbye.

671
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:14,827
Whether you're alive or dead,
life is always about parting.

672
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,495
You have to say goodbye

673
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,205
to meet again.

674
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:19,999
You're right.

675
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,711
Let's reborn as people
and meet again in the next life.

676
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:24,670
Yes,

677
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,047
let's meet again!

678
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:27,423
-All right.
-All right.

679
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:30,551
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

680
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:41,479
RETURN FAVORS

681
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,737
Well, he's a family friend.

682
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:51,322
He hasn't had a home-cooked meal.

683
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:53,824
I owe him.

684
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,913
Yes, she does owe me, but

685
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,040
do you know my family?

686
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,084
You probably didn't know this,

687
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:04,335
but I do.

688
01:06:04,835 --> 01:06:09,590
Make yourself at home at eat up.
This is what we usually eat.

689
01:06:09,674 --> 01:06:10,633
Thank you.

690
01:06:17,348 --> 01:06:23,020
ENJOY EVERYDAY LIFE LIKE OTHER MOMS

691
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:26,649
Seo-woo, try this.

692
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,318
Is it good?

693
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,113
-That was really something.
-Is that what you did?

694
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:34,573
-I had fun.
-Did you have fun?

695
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,367
Ha-jun had fun.

696
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:37,702
Goodness.

697
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:39,870
My goodness.

698
01:06:39,954 --> 01:06:42,748
SAY GOODBYE TO MY FAMILY

699
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:45,042
-This is so nice.
-Try this, Dad.

700
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:45,960
What?

701
01:06:46,043 --> 01:06:47,545
-What is it?
-It's pork.

702
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:48,879
-It's good.
-Isn't it?

703
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,173
Seo-woo, Grandma's tired.

704
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,174
Seo-woo.

705
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,134
-Come and eat.
-Okay.

706
01:06:54,969 --> 01:06:56,470
-You're so good.
-Good job.

707
01:06:56,554 --> 01:06:58,723
-Goodness.
-Seo-woo.

708
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,433
-Come here.
-Come to Auntie, Seo-woo.

709
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:01,809
Goodness.

710
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,020
-In the middle.
-I want to be next to Seo-woo.

711
01:07:04,103 --> 01:07:05,146
Goodness.

712
01:07:05,229 --> 01:07:06,480
It's warm.

713
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:17,867
SAY GOODBYE TO MY CLOSEST ONES

714
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,910
Seo-woo. Ha-jun. Are you happy?

715
01:07:19,994 --> 01:07:20,828
-Yes!
-Yes!

716
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:23,205
Do you know where we're going?

717
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,374
-Camping!
-Camping!

718
01:07:25,458 --> 01:07:26,542
-Let's go!
-That's right.

719
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:28,627
-Let's go camping!
-Let's go!

720
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,801
Hey, play some music or something.

721
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,720
What music? Let's just go.

722
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:43,934
Go right next to them.

723
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,022
-Why?
-I want to see Yu-ri. Drive up.

724
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:49,899
Gosh.

725
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:57,865
Hey, roll down the window.

726
01:07:57,948 --> 01:07:58,783
Roll it down.

727
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,787
Yu-ri!

728
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:05,206
Yu-ri! I'm bored!

729
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:08,250
-I want to be in that car.
-Yu-ri, roll it up.

730
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:11,253
-Dad!
-I can sit between...

731
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:13,464
Don't go!

732
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:14,632
What's wrong with him?

733
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:16,175
He must be really bored.

734
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,344
Don't go!

735
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:19,887
Yu-ri!

736
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,473
I bought a lot of meat this time!

737
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,436
All right.

738
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:29,814
There.

739
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,232
Run!

740
01:08:33,692 --> 01:08:35,444
-Run along.
-Ha-jun, pass it to Daddy.

741
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:40,199
She's good. Ha-jun, the ball!

742
01:08:40,282 --> 01:08:42,576
Get the ball!
Let's see who can kick better.

743
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:47,832
The dad just got his daughter.

744
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,250
Seo-woo, are you okay?

745
01:08:54,421 --> 01:08:56,048
They're so excited.

746
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,307
What's this?

747
01:09:06,725 --> 01:09:07,893
Min-jeong

748
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,770
stopped by the restaurant.

749
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:11,647
She left this for you.

750
01:09:17,820 --> 01:09:19,405
She even asked me for a favor.

751
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,199
What favor?

752
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,537
She asked me to send you off well...

753
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,081
With Gang-hwa.

754
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,585
She said it'd make her feel relieved.

755
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,135
Min-jeong is too nice.

756
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,098
Will she

757
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:47,975
divorce him?

758
01:09:48,058 --> 01:09:49,351
I don't know.

759
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:55,149
I told you. It's not your fault.

760
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,236
It wasn't really
working out between them anyway.

761
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:02,907
They were too thoughtful and considerate

762
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:06,202
because they found each other pitiful,
but that made them distant.

763
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,369
That's not good.

764
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:10,831
It worked out rather well.

765
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:13,792
Because they found out they had a problem.

766
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,090
You have enough worries of your own.

767
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:21,383
Smile.

768
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:24,845
I told you to smile.

769
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:26,222
Okay? Smile.

770
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,600
-Aren't you going to smile?
-Gosh.

771
01:10:30,434 --> 01:10:31,602
Goodness.

772
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:34,188
Well done.

773
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:39,902
-Kick it this way.
-Gosh.

774
01:10:42,446 --> 01:10:43,739
Goodness.

775
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:45,699
Ha-jun, run!

776
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,786
Good. Kick it.

777
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,371
One more time.

778
01:11:03,717 --> 01:11:04,635
Hi.

779
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:06,720
Kitchen lady.

780
01:11:07,471 --> 01:11:08,639
Pick-up helper.

781
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:10,641
Yu-ri.

782
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,102
Seo-woo's mom.

783
01:11:14,019 --> 01:11:16,272
I have no courage to see you,

784
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,274
so I'm sending you a letter.

785
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,610
Come to think of it,
I'm angry not only because

786
01:11:23,070 --> 01:11:26,240
you and Gang-hwa lied to me,

787
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,577
but also because
I'm sad to lose a friend.

788
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:32,705
I must say

789
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,082
thank you so much

790
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:37,501
for being my friend.

791
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,170
Because there is

792
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,965
no next time for you.

793
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,176
I'm really glad

794
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:48,262
that you are

795
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,514
Seo-woo's mom.

796
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:54,351
Also, I'm glad

797
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:57,896
that I met you.

798
01:12:06,905 --> 01:12:08,699
Have a good time.

799
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,076
Goodbye,

800
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,704
my friend.

801
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,587
Don't worry too much about Seo-woo.

802
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,423
I'll protect her

803
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:26,884
with all my heart.

804
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:06,048
-You know this, right?
-Okay.

805
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:07,383
Clap.

806
01:13:08,842 --> 01:13:09,676
Ha-jun, clap.

807
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:11,678
Ha-jun, dance.

808
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,060
1, 2, 3, 4.

809
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:21,146
-As you live in this world
-As you live in this world

810
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:25,901
-You'll find that there is
-You'll find that there is

811
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:30,697
-something more valuable than money
-something more valuable than money

812
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,533
-The game of love
-The game of love

813
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:35,160
-isn't that important
-isn't that important

814
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,996
-As you live in this world
-As you live in this world

815
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:42,584
-You'll find that there is
-You'll find that there is

816
01:13:43,168 --> 01:13:45,087
more happiness

817
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:47,589
than sadness

818
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:49,425
Life is about

819
01:13:49,508 --> 01:13:52,719
-what and how you do
-How?

820
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,482
What are you thinking?

821
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,529
I'm thinking

822
01:14:12,072 --> 01:14:13,073
that this is so nice.

823
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:17,327
Are you happy?

824
01:14:18,704 --> 01:14:19,538
Yes.

825
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,832
When I was a ghost,

826
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:24,001
I was sad because I could only watch,

827
01:14:24,084 --> 01:14:27,171
and I had to leave without anyone knowing.

828
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:31,300
But now I get to leave
laughing and smiling.

829
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,135
I'm happy.

830
01:14:35,387 --> 01:14:36,513
Don't you have any regrets?

831
01:14:36,597 --> 01:14:37,598
Regrets?

832
01:14:45,772 --> 01:14:47,232
Do you know

833
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:49,568
what I could count on the most
when I was alive?

834
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:52,279
What was it?

835
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:53,822
Mom.

836
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:56,533
My mom.

837
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:02,831
She always had my back.

838
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:06,293
So I could do anything
without getting scared.

839
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:10,672
To Seo-woo,

840
01:15:11,381 --> 01:15:13,800
I wanted to be a mom like that.

841
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:17,346
Someone she can count on the most.

842
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:22,768
It's a shame that I can't be that.

843
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:30,484
I'll pass it over to you now.

844
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,071
You can be a dad she can count on.

845
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:38,492
Okay.

846
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:41,954
I will.

847
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,836
What did you miss the most after I died?

848
01:15:57,511 --> 01:15:59,680
Not being able to grow old with you.

849
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,433
We probably would've argued every day,

850
01:16:04,226 --> 01:16:06,979
but I wanted to be with you every day.

851
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:10,816
I wanted to see Seo-woo go to college,

852
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,484
see her get married,

853
01:16:13,193 --> 01:16:14,528
and have children.

854
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,240
That's what I wanted in life.

855
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:23,579
When we would've gotten old and gray,

856
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,540
I would've held your hand

857
01:16:28,041 --> 01:16:29,251
and said thank you

858
01:16:31,503 --> 01:16:33,005
and that we did a great job.

859
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:37,926
I had been dreaming

860
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:40,345
of that day to come.

861
01:16:44,516 --> 01:16:45,726
That's the biggest regret.

862
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:49,479
I also

863
01:16:49,813 --> 01:16:52,065
wanted to live like that with you.

864
01:16:58,113 --> 01:16:59,281
But

865
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:04,578
you left Seo-woo with me.

866
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:06,913
So thank you.

867
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:10,334
She the biggest gift

868
01:17:11,668 --> 01:17:13,045
you gave me.

869
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:17,466
You have to live

870
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,427
the rest of your life to the fullest.

871
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:23,847
For Seo-woo,

872
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:26,433
live happily.

873
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:32,439
I will.

874
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:36,735
If you ever think of me,

875
01:17:37,694 --> 01:17:39,571
don't cry, but smile.

876
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:42,866
Don't be sad.

877
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:44,368
Please smile.

878
01:17:53,251 --> 01:17:54,378
I will.

879
01:18:07,349 --> 01:18:08,892
I'll remember you.

880
01:18:12,646 --> 01:18:14,648
I'll only cherish

881
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,859
the happy memories.

882
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:21,530
I'll do that.

883
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,659
Thank you.

884
01:19:18,795 --> 01:19:19,921
Seo-woo.

885
01:19:21,006 --> 01:19:22,674
My pretty Seo-woo.

886
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:31,391
Always be joyful.

887
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,770
Always smile.

888
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:49,910
In the next life,

889
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:51,995
please

890
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:53,288
come to Mommy again.

891
01:19:54,289 --> 01:19:55,248
Okay?

892
01:20:16,228 --> 01:20:17,979
Bye, Mom.

893
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:54,724
My dear, Ms. Mi-dong.

894
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,060
Thank you.

895
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:58,979
Don't mention it.

896
01:21:00,021 --> 01:21:01,648
Are you trying to

897
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:03,650
make me cry?

898
01:21:08,738 --> 01:21:09,823
Did you

899
01:21:10,490 --> 01:21:12,284
say goodbye to everyone?

900
01:21:13,577 --> 01:21:14,578
Yes.

901
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:16,496
That's your blessing.

902
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:19,916
Not everyone gets to say goodbye
before they die.

903
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,336
The one up there must like you a lot.

904
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,674
Didn't you say it was a punishment?

905
01:21:27,757 --> 01:21:28,925
You're leaving.

906
01:21:29,092 --> 01:21:30,343
Let's not fight.

907
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:31,970
Okay.

908
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:37,225
You should say goodbye

909
01:21:37,851 --> 01:21:38,977
to yourself now.

910
01:21:47,736 --> 01:21:49,863
Though it's not your perfect body,

911
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:52,699
you should say goodbye.

912
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:14,012
Cha Yu-ri.

913
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:17,724
Goodbye.

914
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:36,368
Bye.

915
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,011
Gang-hwa.

916
01:22:55,470 --> 01:22:56,346
Seo-woo.

917
01:22:57,263 --> 01:23:00,725
When you go to Heaven,
God will ask you two questions.

918
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,769
If you answer yes to both questions,

919
01:23:03,353 --> 01:23:05,772
you can be reborn as a human
in your next life.

920
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:10,068
One question is,
"Were you happy with your life?"

921
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:12,404
The other question is,

922
01:23:12,862 --> 01:23:15,949
"Were other people happy because of me?"

923
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,285
Let's be reborn as humans

924
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,871
and meet again in the next life.

925
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,845
I LOVE YOU AS ALWAYS

926
01:24:11,171 --> 01:24:13,423
My baby,

927
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:16,551
will you remember that I was with you?

928
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:26,352
PETALS FALL, BUT THE FLOWER ENDURES

929
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,772
-Seo-woo.
-Cho Seo-woo.

930
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,817
Mom! Dad!

931
01:24:33,651 --> 01:24:35,403
SCRIPT CHO SEO-WOO

932
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:48,416
Don't you have any surgery today?

933
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:49,793
No.

934
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,586
That's new.

935
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,713

936
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:57,675
He ran here to see the cherry blossoms
with you before they were gone.

937
01:24:58,051 --> 01:24:59,177
Really?

938
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:02,138
Goodness.

939
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,642

940
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:08,269
The scent remained in the world

941
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:10,522
and permeated

942
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:12,107
our memory deeply.

943
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,243
PETALS FALL, BUT THE FLOWER ENDURES

944
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,011
