1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,881
THE YEAR 2013

2
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,675
It's so good.

3
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,762
How can you eat that? Isn't it spicy?

4
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,097
It is. That's why it's good.

5
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:58,224
-Do you want some?
-No.

6
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,351
Hold on.

7
00:01:08,318 --> 00:01:09,652
Gosh, capsaicin.

8
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,696
That's not for people.

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,323
I know it'll give me diarrhea.

10
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,325
You get used to it.

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:17,160
Spicy food relieves stress.

12
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,787
Why would you get used to it?

13
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:22,540
I'd rather not eat it.
I don't understand why people eat that.

14
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,334
Forget it.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,919
You'll never know this pleasure.

16
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,545
Anyway...

17
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:31,841
look how much steamed offal I got.

18
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,511
-She knows I love it.
-Because you're a regular.

19
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,221
-It's starting.
-Okay.

20
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,597
-Is it the last episode?
-Yes.

21
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,559
-It's me, Hae-ram.
-That kid is a good actor.

22
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:43,812
I go to kindergarten...

23
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,271
THE SPICIEST CHICKEN FEET

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:49,234
Come out and have some chicken feet.

25
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,736
You should've bought something else.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,988
That's going to give him diarrhea.

27
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,241
Chicken feet.

28
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,744
This is really spicy, isn't it?

29
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,538
Yes, it's delicious.

30
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,666
Will it be too spicy for you?

31
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,961
Yes, of course.
He's going to die if he eats this.

32
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,212
I'll give it a try.

33
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,391
Hey!

34
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,981
Is it too spicy?

35
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,945
It is...

36
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,614
but I can take it.

37
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,283
Doesn't it relieve your stress?

38
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:39,993
Yes.

39
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,495
It's good.

40
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:46,124
Will you watch the news?

41
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,625
I'll turn the TV on.

42
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,435
Min-jeong!
I bought some really spicy chicken feet.

43
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,937
-Really?
-Yes.

44
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,315
It's a place next to the hospital.

45
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,900
People say it's the best.

46
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,653
I guess you're into spicy food now.

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,239
It looks good.

48
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,120
How is it? Is it spicy?

49
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,414
Is it?

50
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,210
It's spicy and yummy.

51
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,794
-Really?
-Yes.

52
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,215
How is it?

53
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,093
It's not spicy.

54
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,304
I think it's okay.

55
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,641
Throughout my life,

56
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,102
I believed that
nothing around me would change.

57
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,687
I put in extra since you're a regular.

58
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,022
Thank you.

59
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,398
-Please come again.
-Okay.

60
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:57,779
SPICY AUNTIE'S TTEOKBOKKI

61
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:02,533
CLAW CRANE SHOP

62
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,994
One, two, three.

63
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,288
One, two, three.

64
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,017
Hey, I told you not to smoke.

65
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,145
However, even when I was being forgotten,

66
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,440
the world kept on turning every day
without fail,

67
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,318
and many things were changing.

68
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:42,323
EPISODE 12:
THE DAYS I WAS FORGOTTEN

69
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,954
Ta-da. Where should we put this?

70
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,082
Hey.

71
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,543
Where are you going, Seo-woo?

72
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,007
Why did you bring that?

73
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,516
Gosh, great job.

74
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,560
Did you want to put it there?

75
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,230
But Seo-woo, who is this?

76
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,732
Cha Yu-ri.

77
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,903
Seo-woo.

78
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,782
-Who?
-Cha Yu-ri.

79
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:31,956
Cha Yu-ri.

80
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,795
Seo-woo, who is that?

81
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,301
The pretty auntie.

82
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,356
The pretty auntie.

83
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,251
What?

84
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,045
What did you say?

85
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,005
Seo-woo...

86
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,135
knows your name.

87
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,224
That's impossible.

88
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,476
How could she know my name?

89
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,852
There's no way.

90
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:38,272
She clearly said Cha Yu-ri.

91
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,028
That's impossible.

92
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,260
What is this?

93
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,264
Seo-woo put that sticker on there.

94
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:17,019
She said...

95
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,314
that is Cha Yu-ri.

96
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,026
Gosh, you're so good.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:25,361
Is it fun?

98
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,612
-Gosh, it's so fun.
-Cha Yu-ri!

99
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,197
What?

100
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,242
-We need to go.
-Where?

101
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,414
I guess Dad won't be coming home today.

102
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,916
Let's have the cake first.

103
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,643
Let's get up.

104
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,118
Yu-ri, what's wrong?

105
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,828
What is it?

106
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:22,168
Seo-woo has been watching me.

107
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,171
That's why...

108
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,304
Are you the pick-up helper?

109
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,139
You can take her.

110
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,057
Sorry?

111
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,900
Seo-woo, you don't know who I am, do you?

112
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,318
I do.

113
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,111
You do?

114
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,532
Who am I?

115
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,824
I don't know.

116
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:56,512
She must've heard Hyeon-jeong
calling my name.

117
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,015
I'm sorry.

118
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,480
She shouldn't say my name
in front of Min-jeong.

119
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:07,898
What should we do?

120
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,571
-Gang-hwa, you should--
-Why are you doing this?

121
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,283
Stop it now.

122
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,368
You should...

123
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:21,787
see Seo-woo as her mom.

124
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,457
I'll tell Min-jeong.

125
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,374
No.

126
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:31,255
Why not?

127
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,468
Don't.

128
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,559
Then should we just...

129
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:48,981
let your heart break
and keep Min-jeong in the dark?

130
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:52,943
Is this the right thing to do?

131
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,323
I'm sorry.

132
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,241
I'm really sorry.

133
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,785
But...

134
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,080
No. You can't tell her.

135
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,540
Why not? What's the reason, Yu-ri?

136
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,213
Yu-ri.

137
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,387
Yu-ri.

138
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,139
You...

139
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:28,396
You gave up everything to save Seo-woo.

140
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,691
Didn't you?

141
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,031
Please save my baby.

142
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,283
Help.

143
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,577
Why did you do this to me?

144
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,083
What should I do now?

145
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,003
What am I supposed to do?

146
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,595
You and I,

147
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,015
we saved Seo-woo.

148
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,768
You're Seo-woo's mom. Why are you hiding?

149
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,695
No, I can't.

150
00:13:55,876 --> 00:14:00,422
Even when I'm lonely or sad

151
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:06,720
I'm going to take 50,000 won

152
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,890
50,000 won

153
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,852
Someone put the till in the celery...

154
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,603
I mean, someone put a celery in the till.

155
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,063
Hi, Hyeon-jeong.

156
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,608
What's wrong?

157
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,528
You lost.

158
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,029
You did.

159
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,531
My Hyeon-jeong lost.

160
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,200
You wouldn't look like that if you'd won.

161
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,827
You'd have your shoulders pulled back.

162
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,413
"I'm Go Hyeon-jeong. How dare you?"

163
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,585
What's wrong?

164
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,549
But come to think about it,

165
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,096
I love him too much.

166
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,735
Hyeon-jeong.

167
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,577
Hyeon-jeong.

168
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,875
-Gosh! You scared me!
-Goodness.

169
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,001
Damn you!

170
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,629
Did my good looks scare you?

171
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,714
Pull yourself together.

172
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:26,133
You win some, you lose some.
You can't always win.

173
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:27,593
Do you think I lost?

174
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,970
No. You probably killed them all.

175
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,348
Good job.
I'll take care of the settlement.

176
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,557
Well done.

177
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,035
What the...?

178
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,624
Wait. Hey.

179
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,833
Hey.

180
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,460
You.

181
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,755
Hey!

182
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,015
Who are you?

183
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,060
I'm here for your daughter.

184
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,694
Guk-bong!

185
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,571
Let's not be so unethical!

186
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,615
Ms. Mi-dong.

187
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,496
Who is that?

188
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,331
Is he talking about Seo-woo?

189
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:46,046
Take a break, Ms. Mi-dong.

190
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,965
I said I'd take care of them.

191
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,216
Until when?

192
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:53,470
When every exorcist in the country
swarms to this place?

193
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:54,805
What is he talking about?

194
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:56,473
Ms. Mi-dong.

195
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,559
Snap out of it.

196
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,687
She's not your friend. She's your job.

197
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,402
Next time,
I'll see you with your daughter,

198
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:10,487
Cha Yu-ri.

199
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,668
What does that mean?

200
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,087
He's here to take Seo-woo?

201
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,298
Why would shamans
and exorcists swarm here?

202
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,510
Ms. Mi-dong?

203
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,806
Your daughter still sees ghosts.

204
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,184
Yes.

205
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,230
I got rid of all the local ghosts,
but she still sees ghosts.

206
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:48,108
Why would she see them
when they are not around anymore?

207
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,110
Well... That's...

208
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,238
I don't know.

209
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,158
Anyway, if your daughter keeps
seeing ghosts like that,

210
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,619
she will have to live like me
or the exorcists you just met.

211
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,746
No. Not a chance.

212
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,458
Well...

213
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,003
Maybe that's because she still
has the energy of the local ghost.

214
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,506
She won't see them in a few days.

215
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:14,134
I'll make sure to keep ghosts
away from her during my time here.

216
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,306
Do you still not want
to get your place back?

217
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,855
No.

218
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,983
I don't.

219
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,193
Why not?

220
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,905
Anyone else would do anything
to get their place back.

221
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,741
You have a chance to stay alive.

222
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:45,499
Do you know what Seo-woo likes the most?

223
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,293
What is it?

224
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,131
Her mom.

225
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,473
Do you know when Seo-woo
wears the broadest smile?

226
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,562
When she runs to her mom.

227
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,027
It's so pretty.

228
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,114
This is your favorite princess doll.

229
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:21,076
Mom.

230
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:23,745
Mom?

231
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,290
Do you like your mom?

232
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,208
Mom is my favorite.

233
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,711
Seo-woo.

234
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,921
Mom!

235
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,548
Seo-woo, are you all right?

236
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,678
-Don't run.
-Mom.

237
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,056
I told you not to run. Are you all right?

238
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,730
Seo-woo loves her mom so much.

239
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,233
She can't live without her mom.

240
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,737
I can't take that away from her.

241
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,408
My gosh.

242
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,995
I'll go. I'll disappear.

243
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,997
Then Seo-woo will be fine, won't she?

244
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,498
She won't have to see ghosts.

245
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,042
I don't know that for sure.

246
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,211
I'll go up there and beg.

247
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,255
I don't have to be reincarnated.

248
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,924
I'm willing to fall under.

249
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,723
I was dead anyway.

250
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,184
I have no regrets.

251
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,731
Only those who can't
give up anything have regrets.

252
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,650
I've given up everything already.

253
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,110
I have no regrets
or lingering attachments.

254
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,491
Fine.

255
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,285
I get it.

256
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:50,290
A mom can even kill herself
if it's for her child.

257
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,876
There's nothing that can stop you.

258
00:20:56,213 --> 00:21:00,926
Stay by your daughter and protect her
until the 49th day.

259
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,387
That exorcist will be back.

260
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,764
He will make your daughter live like us.

261
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,768
There's no way it will happen.

262
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,020
I will protect my daughter myself.

263
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,570
Oh, right. Well...

264
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,366
How did you make me stick to this earlier?

265
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,536
I'm a human now.

266
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,079
What?

267
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,331
Well...

268
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,918
It's not like you're a complete human.

269
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,921
You're neither one nor the other.

270
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,265
If you would do this,

271
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,310
why did you send her in the first place?

272
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,492
-Where's Yu-ri?
-I guess she's in her room.

273
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,161
-I'll go get her.
-No.

274
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,620
I'll go see her. I will.

275
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,584
That exorcist?

276
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,503
Don't you dare mess with my daughter.

277
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:22,799
My baby.

278
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,177
Mom.

279
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,386
Come and have breakfast.

280
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,637
Okay.

281
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,410
Yu-ri. Try some of this, too.

282
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,537
You like potatoes.

283
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:54,498
She likes rolled omelets more.

284
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,500
She likes potatoes, too.

285
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,252
I bought a lot of potatoes
when you guys were young.

286
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,254
You did? Did he do that?

287
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,839
I like everything.

288
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,842
I like potatoes and rolled omelets.

289
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,179
She will eat what she wants to eat.

290
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,723
Stop making a fuss and eat your food.

291
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,643
She might feel too pressured to eat.

292
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,938
Mom, don't you think you're being

293
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,690
unfair to us with the soup?

294
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,284
Your dad and you have had a lot of it.

295
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,454
Make sure to eat it all up.

296
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,415
Okay.

297
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,293
-Go ahead and eat.
-Let's eat.

298
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,393
Hang on.

299
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,312
-No.
-Let me say that again.

300
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,897
-You can't.
-Again.

301
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,566
-Let's do this again.
-Okay. Fine.

302
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,820
-So you're...
-Me?

303
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:09,865
-thirty-eight years old.
-Right.

304
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,702
-I'm thirty-eight.
-And you're forty-four.

305
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,204
Gosh, that's a lot.

306
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,331
-Hey!
-What are you talking about?

307
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,875
Gosh, I can't believe this.

308
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,003
This is why we shouldn't
hang out with young girls.

309
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:24,504
She's young and pretty.

310
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,506
She's pretty, and she's even young.

311
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,341
I really hate you.

312
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:31,511
I just hate pretty girls.

313
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:34,389
I will just call you by your names.

314
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,893
-Whatever you want.
-Hyeon-jeong.

315
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:42,981
Do-yeon.

316
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:49,488
This is nice. I got some friends.

317
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,199
She said she left others out.

318
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,035
Is this her first time
to make real friends?

319
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,704
-Yes, you're right.
-What did you say?

320
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:59,956
She was like a voluntary outcast.

321
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,458
Excuse me.

322
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,543
You guys are having fun.
Can I take a photo of you?

323
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,754
-No.
-Yes!

324
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:09,090
-Let's do that.
-One, two, and three.

325
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,761
I bet it will look cool.

326
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,221
Let me see.

327
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:15,931
Let's see who looks prettiest here.

328
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,807
Let me see.

329
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,520
Gosh, there's nothing.

330
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,438
It's so strange.

331
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,275
There's nothing here.

332
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,818
What's wrong with this?

333
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:54,844
Seo-woo has been watching me.

334
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:57,889
That's why...

335
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,230
What was she looking at?

336
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,175
Are you leaving?

337
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:35,510
Yes.

338
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,101
We've become very close, right?

339
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,562
I think so.

340
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,898
Do you like it?

341
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:50,942
Yes.

342
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,320
I laugh a lot when I'm with them.

343
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,824
-I'll see you later.
-Gang-hwa.

344
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,120
It might rain today.

345
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,456
I have one here.

346
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,468
You need a bigger one not to get wet.

347
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,179
I see.

348
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,056
You're right.

349
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,268
Don't look at me like that.

350
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,855
I said I'd stop being considerate.

351
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,524
This isn't being considerate?

352
00:27:32,108 --> 00:27:35,153
No. I'm just doing what I want to do.

353
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,530
And you shouldn't be considerate of me.

354
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,949
I wasn't so considerate
in the first place.

355
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,118
See you.

356
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,001
Min-jeong.

357
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,044
Yes?

358
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:53,963
Let's...

359
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,511
get a new pick-up helper.

360
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,691
You darn exorcist.
You'd better stay away from us.

361
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:18,571
Good.

362
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,412
Seo-woo.

363
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,374
What are you doing here at this hour?

364
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:32,877
I was out taking a walk.

365
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,588
I happened to be passing by,
so I thought I'd walk with you.

366
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,340
Okay. Come with us.

367
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,593
Let's go, Seo-woo.

368
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,769
Seo-woo, you look even prettier today.

369
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,230
I don't think you like all kids.

370
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,356
What?

371
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,066
You only care for Seo-woo.

372
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,026
Oh, well...

373
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,279
I do like a lot of kids.

374
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:02,365
Seo-woo is just adorable.

375
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,871
Isn't it that you want to be a mom?

376
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,000
What? Mom?

377
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,793
Why are you so surprised?

378
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,713
If you like a kid of her age,

379
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,214
it means you want to get married.

380
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,551
Oh, I see.

381
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:23,595
You're not married yet.

382
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,765
Yu-ri.

383
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,650
Seo-woo, it's okay.

384
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,486
It's been fine these days.

385
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:44,908
Are you all right?

386
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,286
It's strange,

387
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,955
but dogs used to bark
at Seo-woo until recently.

388
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,586
Stop it. Seo-woo is terrified.

389
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,046
Go away!

390
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,507
Stay quiet! My gosh.

391
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:02,634
Stop!

392
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,640
But that doesn't happen anymore.

393
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,017
Is it because she got bigger?

394
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,990
I just realized something amazing, Dad.

395
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:28,201
Something amazing? What?

396
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:32,205
Popo is a genius dog.

397
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,083
-All of a sudden?
-Think about it.

398
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,168
It barks at everyone but our family.

399
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:40,296
It even barks at the delivery guy
who comes every day.

400
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:45,301
But it even didn't bark at Yu-ri  once.

401
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:47,929
You're right.

402
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,640
Come to think of it,

403
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,935
we bought Popo after Yu-ri left.
Popo didn't see her before.

404
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,770
My point.

405
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,147
It knows that she's our family.

406
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,568
Isn't it genius?
Do you think it should be on TV?

407
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,444
-Make a call.
-Okay.

408
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,739
It's unbelievable.

409
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:00,627
Honey.

410
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,048
About Yu-ri.

411
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:10,136
Don't you think
she needs to see Seo-woo once?

412
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:16,559
Don't worry.
She's been seeing Seo-woo already.

413
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,645
Did she see her? When?

414
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:20,480
Did Gang-hwa let her meet Seo-woo?

415
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,484
I'm glad to hear that.

416
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,195
No.

417
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,031
Is it a good thing?

418
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:38,039
She must've been
devastated to see Seo-woo.

419
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,710
Now that Yu-ri's back,

420
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,545
don't you think
we should bring Seo-woo back?

421
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,881
What are you talking about?

422
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:49,842
It's not like she's a thing.
Why would we bring her back?

423
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,846
I mean, Dad and you want to see her too.

424
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:54,847
Forget it.

425
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,225
I can't tell a six-year-old kid

426
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,019
that Yu-ri is her real mom
just because of my greed.

427
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,941
There is no end to the greed of people.

428
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,490
I know she misses Seo-woo, too.

429
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,955
I'll walk fast and get there before you.

430
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,915
I'll win. I'll be the winner.

431
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,458
I'm winning.

432
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,419
-Hyeon-jeong.
-I'll walk faster than...

433
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:26,921
Hyeon-jeong.

434
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,467
-Hello, Seo-woo.
-You were like this earlier.

435
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:34,053
It sounds like you've never
said your friend's name before.

436
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,763
It sounds really awkward.

437
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,140
What did I do?

438
00:33:37,223 --> 00:33:40,351
"Hyeon-jeong." It's not awkward at all.

439
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:43,187
Hyeon-jeong, let's just go.

440
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,189
-Okay. Let's go.
-Okay.

441
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,691
-Let's go, Min-jeong.
-Okay.

442
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,153
It did sound awkward, though.

443
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,156
Okay.

444
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,034
-This is all your fault.
-What did I do?

445
00:33:56,117 --> 00:34:00,038
Now I understand
a stray cat that lost a fight.

446
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,749
-Hey.
-Why would you take it out on me?

447
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,668
I don't know. Let's just go.

448
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,721
It's really strange.

449
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:18,765
How did Yu-ri know that?

450
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,516
I don't know.

451
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,602
She said she just got the feeling.

452
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,313
Feeling? What feeling?
Is she a detective or what?

453
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,816
What could she feel? Even a doctor
wouldn't know that without a closer look.

454
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,318
My point.

455
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,780
I'm sure she's hiding something.

456
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:36,115
Everything is so strange.

457
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,409
You knew all along that she was strange.

458
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,079
It was strange that Yu-ri asked you
to stay quiet for 49 days.

459
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:43,581
And it was strange
that she knew about Min-jeong.

460
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,585
Don't sigh.

461
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,670
Please stop sighing.

462
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:52,465
I didn't sleep a wink
because of that sigh.

463
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,758
Why?

464
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,220
Is it about Hyeon-jeong?
Hey, did she say anything?

465
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,930
Hey.

466
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,682
Hyeon-jeong didn't say anything.

467
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,810
But...

468
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,313
-I just think...
-Think what?

469
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,234
I think she's crazy.

470
00:35:11,317 --> 00:35:12,151
She has to live.

471
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,534
That's right.

472
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,619
She can live, so she should.

473
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,955
She has to live. I'm going to save her.

474
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,876
Gosh, but they love each other.

475
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,712
She's not getting divorced.

476
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,342
I was out of my mind.

477
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,802
Why did I do that?

478
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,554
But I didn't know...

479
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,514
this would happen.

480
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,100
No. But she still has to live.

481
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,560
I'll make them divorce.

482
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,771
Then...

483
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,274
what about the kid?

484
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,200
Right. That's the word.

485
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,493
I'm sure she's crazy.

486
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:04,036
Didn't she say anything?

487
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:07,415
She seems to know something.

488
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,959
But she stopped talking
about Yu-ri at some point.

489
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,252
She just keeps sighing.

490
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,618
My goodness.

491
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,995
Are you being chased or what?

492
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,122
-Why are you walking so fast?
-What?

493
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,750
-Was it you guys?
-What's wrong?

494
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,920
Gosh, you startled me.

495
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,088
Her name? Are you insane?

496
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,799
Why would I
call out her name around Seo-woo?

497
00:36:58,883 --> 00:36:59,717
You're right.

498
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:01,594
I knew you didn't.

499
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,972
-Why?
-The thing is,

500
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:08,351
Seo-woo knows Yu-ri's name.
She said "Cha Yu-ri."

501
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,685
Isn't it strange?

502
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,438
I'm sure she's hiding something.

503
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,901
Everything is so strange.

504
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,113
What's strange?

505
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,327
At first, I just thought

506
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,705
she found out about my marriage
or Min-jeong somehow.

507
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:31,457
But come to think of it,

508
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,460
she wasn't even surprised
when she saw me for the first time.

509
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,170
She just...

510
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,799
looked as if she'd got caught.

511
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,768
I don't know. It's all strange.

512
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,361
You know something.

513
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,280
I'm sure you do.

514
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,739
She does.

515
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,116
I can tell she knows something.

516
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,243
This is how she looks
when she knows something...

517
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,206
Hyeon-jeong.

518
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,418
Hyeon-jeong, what's wrong?

519
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,423
Why are you crying?

520
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,258
Hyeon-jeong.

521
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,762
I don't know.

522
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,099
What should I do?

523
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,935
I don't know what to do.

524
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,062
What's going on?

525
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,565
What's the matter?

526
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,819
All right. Fine. Don't cry.

527
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,280
Stop crying.

528
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,578
LAW FIRM

529
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,004
JW LAW FIRM
DIVORCE ATTORNEY

530
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,238
What are all these?

531
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,449
This is an expandable baton.

532
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,534
You can expand it

533
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,787
by swinging it with a wrist snap.

534
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:35,706
And this is a self-defense alarm.
It rings if you pull this.

535
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:38,584
If someone tries to take Seo-woo,

536
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,419
pull this pin out

537
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,546
and spray this in their eyeballs, okay?

538
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,091
Is someone taking Seo-woo?

539
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,843
I mean, there might be an abductor.

540
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:49,595
There are a lot of abductors these days.

541
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:51,180
They are dressed in black.

542
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:55,643
And they kidnap kids of Seo-woo's age.
Make sure to carry them around with you.

543
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:57,770
Okay.

544
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,501
All right.

545
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:23,546
All your classes are over now.

546
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,006
You are the best.

547
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,137
Seo-woo, do you have fun in the classes?

548
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,221
Yes.

549
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,683
I'm glad to hear that.

550
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,491
You know who I am, right?

551
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,580
You've seen me the whole time, right?

552
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,165
Yes.

553
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,301
I had no idea.

554
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,389
I've been with you all along.

555
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,685
You must've been terrified.

556
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,231
I'm sorry.

557
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:29,380
Gang-hwa?

558
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,260
What are you doing here?

559
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,555
I was passing by.

560
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,021
Raise your head
and keep your shoulders back.

561
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,524
You didn't do anything wrong.

562
00:42:48,607 --> 00:42:50,568
Just be a man.

563
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:54,405
I'm totally lost.

564
00:42:55,447 --> 00:42:58,367
I don't know what to do, Father.

565
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,668
Just live your life

566
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,712
like you used to.

567
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,131
We'll live our lives.

568
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:14,091
You being like this

569
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:17,553
makes us feel bad about Yu-ri coming back.

570
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,806
So...

571
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,767
brazen it out,

572
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,520
okay?

573
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,161
About Seo-woo...

574
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,249
Thanks for raising her to be so sweet.

575
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,752
I'm grateful to your wife as well.

576
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:16,862
Yu-ri.

577
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,407
Yes?

578
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:23,577
Why don't you quit

579
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,455
being their pick-up helper?

580
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:33,295
Mom.

581
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,222
Seo-woo...

582
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,392
is just as lovely as you are, isn't she?

583
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:56,360
After...

584
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,488
raising you for 30 years,

585
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,115
I still adore you so much.

586
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,327
I can't imagine how much you'd adore

587
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:07,287
that munchkin
you never got to hold in your arms.

588
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,045
Still,

589
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,925
you can't go on like this,

590
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,010
fooling that innocent woman.

591
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,809
Just tell Gang-hwa's wife the truth

592
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,187
and ask her to let you see Seo-woo
from time to time.

593
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:39,987
I can't do that, Mom.

594
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:41,989
Why not?

595
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:54,710
Why is my girl being like this?

596
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,965
I'm sorry.

597
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:03,469
You must miss your granddaughter, too.

598
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,304
I'm sorry.

599
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,972
Not at all.

600
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,393
I missed you a lot more.

601
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:30,746
You being here doesn't stop

602
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,540
Guk-bong from taking you away.

603
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,834
Go back to your urns.

604
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:39,254
I'm too scared to go back.

605
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:43,091
Who would have known this would happen?

606
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,846
Where is Hye-jin, by the way?

607
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,014
Since she killed herself,

608
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:51,683
she's supposed to be sent up first.

609
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,269
I'm sure she's hiding somewhere.

610
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:56,772
Gosh.

611
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:00,484
COMPANY EDGE CAUSED
A HOPEFUL YOUNG WOMAN TO DIE

612
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,787
Mom.

613
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,209
Mom.

614
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,046
Do you know

615
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,674
what the biggest regret of my life is?

616
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,428
Killing myself.

617
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:31,723
Why did you kill yourself?

618
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:33,308
I was bullied.

619
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,644
I was bullied at work.

620
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,438
-You could have quit.
-I know.

621
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,983
I know that now.

622
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,486
Back then, I couldn't think of that.

623
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,536
It was my dream since childhood

624
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:54,538
to be a fashion magazine editor.

625
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,748
I worked my butt off

626
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,084
to enter this company.

627
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,753
Continue working.

628
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:05,007
Wow, impressive.

629
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,258
Do you have a second?

630
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:07,551
Can you take a look?

631
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:10,345
But the reality was completely different
from what I had imagined.

632
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:12,264
My coworkers were mean.

633
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,432
Hello.

634
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:16,184
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

635
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,686
My bad.

636
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,607
I couldn't stand it.

637
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:24,860
I was lost and couldn't seem to fit in.

638
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,030
I became an outcast.

639
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,574
In the end...

640
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:33,994
But the thing is,

641
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:39,416
the moment I killed myself,
I regretted it.

642
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:07,569
Mom, I'm sorry.

643
00:49:12,074 --> 00:49:13,241
My dream...

644
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,995
wasn't all I had.

645
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,917
Mom, Dad, my friends...

646
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,545
I had them in my life, too.

647
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,173
I thought my dream was all I had.

648
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,890
Why do people always regret things
when it's too late?

649
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:38,850
Are we idiots?

650
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:41,311
If we only did things we'd never regret,

651
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:43,063
we'd be deities.

652
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:41,830
It's me. If you're busy today,

653
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,332
I can babysit Seo-woo all day.

654
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,801
What difference does it make
if I bring Seo-woo here

655
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,178
instead of the playground?

656
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:01,683
No, don't worry.

657
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:16,114
CHO GANG-HWA

658
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:20,994
Seo-woo.

659
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:27,292
Something came up unexpectedly.

660
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,461
Can you babysit her for a moment?

661
00:51:29,544 --> 00:51:32,839
No. Actually, I might be a while.

662
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,966
Is that okay?

663
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,096
Of course.

664
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,528
Seo-woo, I'll pick you up later.

665
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,696
Have fun.

666
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,826
See you, Seo-woo.

667
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:38,655
Oh, sweetheart.

668
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,035
My sweet girl.

669
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,715
Come here, sweetie.

670
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,550
What's going on?

671
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:00,343
What is Seo-woo doing here?

672
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:03,555
-Gang-hwa asked us to babysit her.
-Really?

673
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,599
-Yes.
-Seriously?

674
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,058
Why didn't you wake me up?

675
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:09,019
She'll be here for a while.

676
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,562
She's all yours.

677
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:12,480
Really? She's all mine?

678
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,774
Seo-woo, do you want some apple?

679
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:17,402
Here. Good girl.

680
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,904
Chew it carefully.

681
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,572
Does it taste good?

682
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:23,783
Seo-woo, we've met before, right?

683
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,869
You remember it, right?

684
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,663
-Give her some tangerine, too.
-Okay.

685
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:32,042
Here you go. You don't want it?

686
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,919
Should I eat it then?

687
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,632
You don't like tangerines?

688
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,509
Do you want more apple?

689
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:42,928
-Eat more apple.
-Yes.

690
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,638
Do you want to finish this?

691
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:49,851
It seems like you don't like tangerines.

692
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,021
You don't want any tangerine?
Should Auntie eat all of it?

693
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:55,023
You can't give her such a big piece.

694
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,316
I'll eat it.

695
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,496
Here are two grapefruit juices.

696
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,914
Thank you.

697
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,293
You did a nice thing.

698
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,713
With Yu-ri back,
Ms. Jeon can finally see Seo-woo, too.

699
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,049
She must have wanted to see
Seo-woo so badly.

700
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,301
I told Min-jeong
we're taking the kids somewhere.

701
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,511
Make sure Hyeon-jeong knows.

702
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:26,346
Okay.

703
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,683
T.Y.

704
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:34,229
"T.Y."? Is that a swear word?

705
00:54:34,312 --> 00:54:35,981
Why would "T.Y." be a swear word?

706
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:37,440
What does it mean?

707
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,443
Yes, it is a swear word.

708
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,156
What is this?

709
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,327
I'm not cheating on my wife,
but I'm still lying to her. Gosh.

710
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:52,497
If you think of Min-jeong and Yu-ri
separately,

711
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,791
there's nothing morally wrong with it.

712
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,751
You're not cheating on anyone.

713
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,421
If you think about it,
both of them are your wives.

714
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,925
Still, that's what it looks like.

715
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,636
-What?
-It sounds like you are cheating on her.

716
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,929
Gosh.

717
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,147
What are you doing?

718
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,442
I can't get the grapefruit out.

719
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:26,990
Oh.

720
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,787
How did you get into medical school?

721
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:38,752
It's so fresh.

722
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:40,587
You're smart.

723
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,214
-And you look like a cheater.
-Gosh, come on.

724
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:46,051
-See you.
-Bye.

725
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,182
You're so excited. Are you happy?

726
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:55,935
You went grocery shopping?

727
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:59,230
Yes. What is Ha-jun doing here?

728
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,441
What? Well...

729
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:04,277
He's been clinging to me all day.

730
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,862
Is Seo-woo at home?

731
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,113
Pardon?

732
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:10,075
Well, yes.

733
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:13,286
Seo-woo, sit here.

734
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,829
Why don't you pack a lunch?

735
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,706
Are you going to eat out?

736
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,208
Well, don't worry.

737
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:21,544
Geun-sang is packing lunch for us, too.

738
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,132
Seo-woo, you must be excited
to spend the day with Ha-jun.

739
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,302
Next time, let's all go together.

740
00:56:29,844 --> 00:56:31,012
What?

741
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:33,932
With Ha-jun's family, the six of us.

742
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,185
Sure, let's do that.

743
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:15,765
YU-RI

744
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,269
Hi, Yu-ri.

745
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,193
Daddy is here, Seo-woo.

746
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,906
Hi, Seo-woo. Did you have fun?

747
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,910
She could have stayed longer.

748
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:37,912
No, we're fine.

749
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,998
Min-jeong must be waiting.

750
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,627
How are your parents?

751
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,464
They're happy. Very happy.

752
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,134
That's good.

753
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:53,553
That's really good.

754
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:59,184
Seo-woo, let's go home now.

755
00:58:02,103 --> 00:58:04,230
Well. Don't stop by anywhere.

756
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,273
Go straight home.

757
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,067
Hold Seo-woo's hand at all times.
Be careful.

758
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:09,319
Okay?

759
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:12,030
Sure, of course.

760
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,284
It's cold. Go inside.

761
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,912
-Okay.
-Let's go, Seo-woo.

762
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:25,668
Gang-hwa.

763
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,467
Thank you.

764
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,883
Where are you?

765
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:59,596
MIN-JEONG

766
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,017
Seo-woo.

767
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,709
Who are you?

768
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,219
I said, "who are you?"

769
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,893
I'm Yu-ri's friend.

770
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:51,481
What?

771
01:00:59,947 --> 01:01:02,533
You woke up, and you were
at a charnel house?

772
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:04,952
I remember that I died.

773
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:07,163
But I woke up, and it's the present.

774
01:01:07,246 --> 01:01:10,124
She says I'm nice. Isn't that weird?

775
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,210
Yu-ri said that? How would she know?

776
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,253
It's not easy to know that
if you aren't close.

777
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:18,091
But I feel like Yu-ri has known Min-jeong
for a long time.

778
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,301
Is it just me?

779
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,390
You don't know who Cha Yu-ri is?

780
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:30,603
She's been following
you and your kid around.

781
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,313
She's a ghost.

782
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,610
-What?
-For five whole years.

783
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:40,196
Creepy, right?

784
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:52,250
A ghost?

785
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:56,379
Yu-ri has been a ghost for five years?

786
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,381
And she's been following Gang-hwa around?

787
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,465
Yes.

788
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,179
Are you crazy?

789
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,141
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

790
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,018
I only found out  recently.

791
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,608
My gosh.

792
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:20,611
If Gang-hwa finds out,

793
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:26,117
how is he going to handle it?

794
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:40,631
What's wrong?

795
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,551
What's the matter, Gang-hwa?

796
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,016
Did something happen?

797
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:53,060
You've been...

798
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,903
next to me the whole time...

799
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,716
You...

800
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:31,766
saw everything?

801
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:37,939
How...

802
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,697
could you stand it?

803
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,949
What if I like her?

804
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,370
What's next? What do I do next?

805
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:55,164
Date her?

806
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,083
Marry her?

807
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:05,591
See you.

808
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:07,093
Bye.

809
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:34,120
What's going on?
Why do you look so pretty today?

810
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:12,408
Do you want to dance?

811
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:13,910
-Okay.
-Dance.

812
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:17,788
-Do you want to fly?
-Yes!

813
01:05:17,872 --> 01:05:19,206
One, two, three.

814
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,460
One more time. One, two, three.

815
01:05:25,046 --> 01:05:26,631
One, two, three.

816
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,175
One, two, three.

817
01:05:31,093 --> 01:05:32,929
How could you stand it?

818
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,363
You saw...

819
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,121
all of that?

820
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:17,014
THE YEAR 2015

821
01:06:22,687 --> 01:06:25,439
Hey, go take a shower and shave.

822
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,858
I know it's the weekend,
but you look gross.

823
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:42,123
I told you to squeeze toothpaste
from the bottom!

824
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:50,506
Dry your hair in the bathroom.

825
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,717
Otherwise, your hair will get everywhere.

826
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,927
You're forgetting your umbrella again.

827
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,187
Even while you were gone,

828
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,023
the world kept spinning.

829
01:07:51,108 --> 01:07:53,235
The time we spent together

830
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,572
was changing me desperately.

831
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:37,279
