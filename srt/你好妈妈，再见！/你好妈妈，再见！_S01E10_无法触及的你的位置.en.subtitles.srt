1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,335
OH MIN-JEONG

2
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,757
-You're applying to nursing school?
-Yes.

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,093
With your grades,
it'll be difficult to get in.

4
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,387
From now on, I'll study

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,473
really hard.

6
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,184
Quit?

7
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:00,435
Why?

8
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,230
After we marry,
I'll have to look after Seo-woo,

9
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,357
and I want a break from work.

10
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,650
No, Min-jeong.

11
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,279
It's okay. I'll keep taking Seo-woo
to daycare myself,

12
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,323
and use the pick-up helper.

13
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:16,493
Don't worry. You can do whatever you want.
It's okay, really.

14
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,578
It's not okay for me.

15
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,582
I can do it.

16
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,877
So let me.

17
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,631
Let me be Seo-woo's real mom.

18
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,596
Back then,

19
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,516
I was cocky enough to think that

20
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,561
there was nothing I couldn't achieve

21
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,355
with effort and passion.

22
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,576
You are up.

23
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,166
Open wide.

24
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,503
Yummy, right?

25
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,548
Open wide.

26
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,801
Good girl.

27
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,262
Do you want to try this too?

28
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,515
BRIGHT HAEMIL KINDERGARTEN

29
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,351
-Hello.
-Hello.

30
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,979
I'll take that. Hi, Seo-woo.

31
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,021
All right.

32
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,399
There.

33
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,902
Bye, ma'am.

34
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,279
Bye, Mommy.

35
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,489
Let's go.

36
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:52,589
Don't you think Seo-woo
doesn't look like her mom?

37
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,008
She isn't her real mom.

38
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,634
She's her stepmom.

39
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:58,845
-Really?
-Yes.

40
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:02,348
I knew it. How did you find out?

41
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:06,227
But there is a place in life

42
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:09,147
that I can't achieve or reach
with my efforts

43
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,691
and enthusiasm alone.

44
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,113
Are you her guardian?

45
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,574
Her temperature is back to normal.

46
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:46,935
EPISODE 10:
YOUR PLACE WHERE I CANNOT REACH

47
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,744
All right, all done. I peeled it all.

48
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,004
Let's go.

49
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,050
-Gang-hwa!
-You!

50
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,349
Why you...

51
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,689
Wait...

52
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,380
Stop! Stop it!

53
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,757
Guys, wait.

54
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:01,426
Please stop.

55
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,802
Hey!

56
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:20,945
It's Hyeon-jeong.

57
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,031
It's her.

58
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:24,866
My Hyeon-jeong!

59
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,367
It's my Hyeon-jeong!

60
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,411
Hyeon-jeong, help me!

61
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,247
Who are you guys?

62
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,130
Who the hell are you?

63
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,090
Just be on your way.

64
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:43,593
Me?

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:49,098
I'm the master of the owner
of that car you ruined.

66
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,023
I'll make it short.

67
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:00,818
Get lost.

68
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:06,657
There she is. Bruce Lee of Yeouido.

69
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,953
YEOUIDO BRUCE LEE

70
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,040
What?

71
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,877
I said just leave, lady!

72
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,522
Hey, throw the eggs.

73
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,731
Throw them!

74
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,526
-Hey!
-Oh.

75
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,004
Girls, run away.

76
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,426
You stupid fans.

77
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,697
Are you okay?

78
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,948
Goodness.

79
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,825
She's going to kill them.

80
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,916
Don't you dare.

81
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,877
-Hey.
-Yes.

82
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,336
-Yes.
-Just because a doctor writes

83
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,713
a lot of social media posts

84
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,381
doesn't mean he doesn't do his job right.

85
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,008
-Of course not.
-No.

86
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:49,969
Don't ever come back.

87
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,846
Answer me. Don't come again, okay?

88
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:54,015
-Okay!
-Okay!

89
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,308
Does your mom know about this?

90
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,143
-No.
-Honey.

91
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,565
Never again. Okay?

92
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:06,944
Don't cry.

93
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:09,864
You're crazy.

94
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,824
You're out of your mind!

95
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:16,579
Gang-hwa, that idiot.
He must have a hollow leg.

96
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,499
Why did he have to eat that?

97
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,375
Why did you eat that?

98
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:27,381
Well, I thought it was just a scribble.

99
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,800
I didn't think it was a drawing.

100
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,014
For a six-year-old,
a scribble is a drawing.

101
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,349
Exactly.

102
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,309
You're exactly right.

103
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,103
She drew so well.

104
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,608
Anyway, she was...

105
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,903
She didn't have to get mad like that.

106
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,281
She even yelled at you.

107
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,868
It was something to get mad about.

108
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,620
Of course, it was.

109
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,872
If I were her, I would've gotten mad, too.

110
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,542
I would've done more than just yelling.

111
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,835
I would've cursed probably.

112
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,756
How could you eat it then?

113
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,593
Exactly. I know.

114
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,312
Yeouido Bruce Lee.

115
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,982
Yeouido Bruce Lee isn't dead yet.

116
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,026
You only needed three eggs.

117
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,529
You finished them all.

118
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,781
Finished them all, my foot.

119
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,534
Before I finish you, you better explain.

120
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,660
Yes, ma'am.

121
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,248
So,

122
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,919
they're acting like that
because you didn't counsel Kang Bin well.

123
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:48,170
Right.

124
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,715
He wasn't depressed. He was normal.

125
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,466
I checked many times.

126
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,759
Then why did he kill himself?

127
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,720
It looks like a suicide.

128
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,431
Wasn't he under investigation

129
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,308
-for match-fixing?
-Yes.

130
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:01,892
They found his suicide note, too.

131
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,352
Gosh.

132
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,771
I don't understand.

133
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,321
You're still here.

134
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,239
Yes.

135
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,033
Okay.

136
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,077
Doctor Gye.

137
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:22,872
Yes?

138
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,791
Can't you diagnose me with depression

139
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,377
or manic depression?

140
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:29,795
No.

141
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,423
Because you don't have those.

142
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:33,341
Right.

143
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,508
What?

144
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:37,470
My club wants it.

145
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,182
Just for show, you know.

146
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:42,224
If I do that show,

147
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,810
I'll have to show my face
on the 9 o'clock news.

148
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:46,729
Never mind then.

149
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,106
Guess I came here for nothing.

150
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,741
He didn't show any signs of suicide.

151
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,410
What really happened?

152
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,622
KANG BIN, I LOVE YOU

153
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,499
KANG SANG-BONG

154
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,049
She's been coming here every day.

155
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,509
Of course.

156
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,010
Her son died.

157
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,554
She must be inconsolable.

158
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,351
Stay away from my mom!

159
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:26,727
Don't stand too close!

160
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,396
My goodness.

161
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,190
I guess he's worried about his mom.

162
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,441
-Leave!
-Goodness.

163
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,318
-This is absurd.
-Let's go.

164
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:35,694
-Let's leave.
-We won't hurt her.

165
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,571
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

166
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:09,145
I'M SORRY. MOMMY'S SORRY, SON

167
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:14,483
"'Of course. I'll go all the way
to the end of the world,

168
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,986
then return home.'

169
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,448
The baby bear
said this in Mommy bear's arms

170
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:24,285
as he closed his eyes softly."

171
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,966
BABY BEAR WHO WENT TO TOUCH THE MOON

172
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,804
What are you doing over there?

173
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,395
She says I'm nice. Isn't that weird?

174
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,982
But I feel like Yu-ri have known Min-jeong
for a long time.

175
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:37,942
Is it just me?

176
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,410
Is Seo-woo asleep?

177
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:49,828
Yes.

178
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,427
Min-jeong.

179
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,513
Yes?

180
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:12,268
The pick-up helper,

181
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,728
when did you first see her?

182
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,230
Well...

183
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,650
On the day we saw her together
at the daycare.

184
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,609
Seo-woo.

185
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:28,993
Gang-hwa.

186
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:31,996
I see.

187
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,251
We saw her for the first time there,
together.

188
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:39,670
Yes. That's right.

189
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,005
We did.

190
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:45,759
What about her?

191
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,389
Should we find someone else?

192
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,433
Oh, no.

193
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,646
Why would we find someone else?

194
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,610
Because she looks so much
like Seo-woo's mom.

195
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,240
I knew you'd be bothered

196
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,993
by that.

197
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,871
I don't know.

198
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,999
I'm drawn to her.

199
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,795
I guess it's because

200
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,173
she looks like Seo-woo's mom.

201
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,264
Min-jeong.

202
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:39,355
You're Seo-woo's mom, too.

203
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,568
Yes, that's right.

204
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:46,987
You should go to bed.

205
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,037
I haven't done anything,
but half of my days are gone already.

206
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,208
Gosh, why does time go by so quickly?

207
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,545
It went by so slowly
when I was a ghost though.

208
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,841
Is this what you've been hiding?

209
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,759
That you'll die again in 49 days?

210
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:52,136
You can live.

211
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:54,179
You just have to take your place back.

212
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:56,140
So why?

213
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,279
Yu-ri?

214
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,243
-Yeon-ji.
-Yes?

215
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,164
Where did your sister go?

216
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,415
She went out this morning.

217
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,541
Where to?

218
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,835
I don't know. I only saw her leave.

219
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,757
Where does she keep going to?

220
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,613
Where did everything go?

221
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,387
The front door pin number is 0222.

222
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,349
Please play with her at home
after daycare.

223
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:23,018
You're dead.

224
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,319
They're gone.

225
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,914
Thanks to Chairman Baek and Mr. Kim,

226
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,083
you avoided a zero track record.

227
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,585
Anyway, I wonder
if they went up there safely.

228
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,295
Of course, they did.

229
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,505
You guys should go up, too.

230
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,758
It'd be nice to go up there
and be born again.

231
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,676
Gwi-sun.

232
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,721
I'm hard of hearing these days,

233
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,973
and my vision's blurry.

234
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,766
-All of a sudden?
-What?

235
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,226
Do you have a hearing problem?

236
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,853
Me too. Let me go with you.

237
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,688
Where are you going? Yeong-sim!

238
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:09,064
What...

239
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,983
Where are you guys going?

240
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,192
Damn it.

241
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Gosh.

242
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,115
I guess you've been chewed on recently.

243
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,576
You are nagging us more frequently.

244
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,618
What?

245
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,495
You guys get to stay here

246
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,247
because I'm in charge of this area.

247
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,665
With this performance,

248
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,001
I might be replaced with a new shaman.

249
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,085
I know that.

250
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,423
If we didn't have you,
we would've been sent up there by now.

251
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,552
Once things get better
for my son, I promise

252
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,596
I'll go up there.

253
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,806
Damn it. Enough of your son.

254
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,017
I will just send you right away...

255
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,059
What?

256
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,269
Why?

257
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,315
-Isn't it in there?
-Gosh, she did it again.

258
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,860
Damn it. Cha Yu-ri!

259
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:02,075
I will have it out
with the damn ghost today.

260
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,286
He should go to his remains.

261
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:07,581
What is that moron doing here?

262
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,167
Oh, right. He lost his remains.

263
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:13,629
What an idiot. Why would he
lose his remains in the first place?

264
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:17,758
Anyway, I'm going to teach him a lesson.

265
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,670
Gosh, where is the punk hiding?

266
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,798
I'm sure he's somewhere in here.

267
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,577
Go tuck Seo-woo in.

268
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,871
She might catch a cold.

269
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:33,208
Seo-woo kicked off the covers.

270
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,752
Why don't you go to Seo-woo's room?

271
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,587
Hey, you should go check Seo-woo.

272
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,964
Go to her room and tuck her in.

273
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,590
I don't want her to catch a cold.

274
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,509
That's right. This way.

275
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,094
Get into the room.

276
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,847
Go to Seo-woo's room. This way.

277
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,349
Hey! Damn it.

278
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,686
Hey, you want to go to Seo-woo's room.

279
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,105
Go ahead and get into the room.

280
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,481
Hurry. Go in.

281
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,025
To Seo-woo's room...

282
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,068
I can't believe this.

283
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,423
Damn it.

284
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,682
I'm sure he came this way.

285
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:48,408
What? He's not in here.

286
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,537
Damn it. I lost him again.

287
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,967
-I got you.
-What? Who are you?

288
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,678
I guess this is why
Ms. Mi-dong likes to shake the bells.

289
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:10,806
It just feels great.

290
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,057
Why do you have that thing?

291
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,391
None of your business.

292
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:15,602
I told you not to stay here.

293
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,021
Why are you still hovering around here?

294
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:20,899
-This is all your fault.
-Damn it.

295
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,568
Who are you? Are you a shaman?

296
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:24,736
Let go of me.

297
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,822
Who is she?

298
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,240
Who are you?

299
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:31,743
I knew there was
someone else in this house.

300
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,121
Why is this place full of ghosts?

301
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,498
Hey, who are you?

302
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,250
How long have you been here?

303
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,417
Are you a local ghost?

304
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,002
A local ghost?

305
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,671
Don't you dare compare me to that idiot.

306
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,548
-Damn it.
-Me?

307
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,509
I'm a virgin ghost.

308
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,055
I thought I finally found a guy
whom I can gratify my desire with.

309
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,891
Since he's married,
I don't even have to seduce him.

310
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,518
But that damn wench...

311
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:03,859
My gosh, there's something
different about him.

312
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,112
One.

313
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,823
Two.

314
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,868
Three... It's over.

315
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,453
Gosh.

316
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:18,874
Don't put it on.

317
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,919
I'll be right there.

318
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,382
Wait for me.

319
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:31,845
Let me borrow your body.

320
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,767
Gosh, I slipped.

321
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,980
What was that?

322
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:48,820
What's wrong?

323
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,740
His wife is so strong-minded

324
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,658
that it's hard to possess her.

325
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,659
Damn it.

326
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,953
Gosh, I'm not the problem.

327
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,496
She is. You should take her.

328
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,666
How dare you try to sponge off Gang-hwa?

329
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,543
What? Gang-hwa?

330
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,921
Who are you? Are you his mother?

331
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,465
-Or his sister?
-Why do you even care?

332
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,177
I just can't take this anymore.

333
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,012
How dare you show your faces around here?

334
00:25:14,721 --> 00:25:17,349
Why are you so upset, pretty lady?

335
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,269
You know what? You're really pretty.

336
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,188
Can I borrow your body just for a day?

337
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:24,689
What?

338
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,401
-Please?
-What is she talking about?

339
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,588
SEAWEED FROM WAN ISLAND

340
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,176
Yu-ri.

341
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,136
Mom.

342
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,269
Mom.

343
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,941
3 TIMES A DAY, 30 MINUTES AFTER MEALS

344
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,542
Mom.

345
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,755
Do you think Yu-ri
got rid of Seo-woo's stuff?

346
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,883
Yes.

347
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:37,929
Do you think she saw Seo-woo?

348
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,850
I think Gang-hwa knew

349
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,019
that she came back to life all along.

350
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,354
So I wonder if he let her meet Seo-woo.

351
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,983
-Take it.
-Make them take one.

352
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,110
I'm warning you.
Something crazy is about to happen.

353
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,778
Gang-hwa.

354
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,157
Yeon-ji.

355
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,827
-Everything's okay?
-It looks like something happened to you.

356
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:03,204
Did you guys have a visitor?

357
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,497
It's...

358
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,084
Well...

359
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,919
He's married now.

360
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:11,671
There's nothing we can do about him.

361
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,674
But Seo-woo is different.

362
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,469
She's Yu-ri's kid.

363
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,561
Mom, where are you going?

364
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,815
Bean sprouts soup.

365
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,651
-Good for you.
-Why?

366
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,070
You drink every day.

367
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,404
My gosh.

368
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,489
And... Gosh.

369
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,616
Damn it. I'm not eating it.

370
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,659
I don't want to eat eggs!

371
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,328
Those damn eggs!

372
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,705
Chicken eggs. I hate them!

373
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,415
I will eat stir-fried spicy pork though.

374
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,752
-What's wrong with him?
-Doctor.

375
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,545
-Yes?
-What's wrong?

376
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,880
Nothing.

377
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,057
Min-jeong likes her
because she looks like Yu-ri?

378
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,809
Did Min-jeong really say that?

379
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,019
Yes.

380
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,063
What's in her head?

381
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,941
She's supposed to hate
your dead wife's look-alike.

382
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,567
She wouldn't want to be involved.

383
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,277
My point.

384
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:17,654
Hey.

385
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,365
Is Min-jeong by any chance

386
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,243
a pervert?

387
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,455
How dare you say such a thing, you idiot?

388
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,665
I'm just kidding.

389
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,251
I just find it strange.

390
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,545
It's strange that Yu-ri knew Min-jeong.

391
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,255
Min-jeong is being weird too.

392
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:37,549
Gosh, everything's so ridiculous.

393
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,011
You're the one who's ridiculous.

394
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:45,682
I'm just saying that
because I worry about you.

395
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:49,352
Hey. Just finish your meal
and go to therapy.

396
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,604
Doctor Jang is coming back
from the seminar today.

397
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,482
He'd fret and fume again.

398
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:00,071
-I'm back.
-You startled me.

399
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,032
My gosh. Doctor Jang, you're here.

400
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,618
Did the seminar go well?

401
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:11,916
Do you even care
about my seminar, you fool?

402
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,959
Gosh.

403
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,726
The kitchen of the kindergarten?

404
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,519
Yes.

405
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,481
And she works
as a pick-up helper for Seo-woo.

406
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:46,284
I expected she would try to see Seo-woo.

407
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,204
But a pick-up helper?

408
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,831
Gosh.

409
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,796
Does your wife know about it?

410
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,797
No.

411
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,176
Yu-ri asked me not to tell her.

412
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,763
So my wife thinks
she's just someone who looks like Yu-ri.

413
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,599
She's seen Yu-ri's picture before.

414
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,357
I'm sorry.

415
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,984
I should...

416
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,863
I will have to do something...

417
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,033
What can you do?

418
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:32,372
-Pardon?
-There's nothing you can do.

419
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,000
I knew you'd be like this.
That's why I came here.

420
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,460
I was worried.

421
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,216
Now that Yu-ri's back,

422
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,303
you can't just take Seo-woo
from your wife for her.

423
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,850
Your wife is

424
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,645
Seo-woo's mom too.

425
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:58,815
Right.

426
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,527
Whether she works in the kitchen
or as a pick-up helper,

427
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,822
I'm just glad
that she gets to see Seo-woo.

428
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:10,451
Let's just take some time
to think about it.

429
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,204
It's not something
you can handle on your own.

430
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,212
I'm sorry I didn't

431
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,298
tell you sooner.

432
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:30,430
Raise your head.

433
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:38,271
Why would you apologize?

434
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,400
I'm sorry.

435
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,444
I really am.

436
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,186
Don't touch it.

437
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,732
Mom.

438
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,442
Leave it there.

439
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:27,987
It's for your sister.

440
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,614
Don't touch it.

441
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:05,269
It's moldy.

442
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,443
I'm sorry, Mother.

443
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,032
Why do you apologize?

444
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,078
I'm sorry.

445
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:23,830
I really am.

446
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,376
I'm sorry, Mother.

447
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,177
I'm sorry, Mother.

448
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:42,640
I'm sorry.

449
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:46,018
I'm really sorry.

450
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,314
I'm sorry.

451
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,499
SEO-WOO AT A KIDS' CAFE

452
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:10,209
FAMILY PICNIC

453
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,383
-Come here.
-My gosh.

454
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,968
It really hurts.

455
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,220
It hurts. Let go of it.

456
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,556
Wait. Gosh, where are we going?

457
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,809
If I let you go now,
you'll show up here again.

458
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,728
I should tie you up
so you can't move around.

459
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,563
I've been trying hard to avoid Seobinggo.

460
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,982
Where did she come from all of a sudden?

461
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,651
What? You fool.

462
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,070
-My gosh.
-Where are you running off to?

463
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,739
-I'm sorry.
-You're here.

464
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,240
Cha Yu-ri!

465
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:45,745
You wench. How dare you
tell me to come and go?

466
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,123
When did you take my bells?

467
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,833
What is this thing?

468
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,293
-Who is she?
-What?

469
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,922
I told you on the phone.
She's a virgin ghost nowhere to go.

470
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,424
It will help you improve your performance.

471
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,512
My gosh. Are you selling me off now?

472
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,806
What a shitty world.

473
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:06,974
What?

474
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,018
-Are you a shaman too?
-Yes.

475
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,728
Peek-a-boo.

476
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,482
Look who's here. So we finally meet.

477
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:18,402
Hey, it's been a really long time.

478
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:21,197
I heard you've been busy
trying to hunt me down.

479
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,574
So you lost some weight. Good for you.

480
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,409
What?

481
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,163
Wait. Stop right there, you brat!

482
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:31,916
Who is she?

483
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,501
Never mind.

484
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:35,253
She used to be a good shaman,

485
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:38,714
but she's having a hard time because of
some troublesome virgin ghost.

486
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,884
She's been looking for a virgin ghost,
so I brought her.

487
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,094
My gosh.

488
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:44,595
I guess it was her.

489
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,849
Oh, right. Did you
kick out the local ghost?

490
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:50,559
I sent him to someplace else.

491
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,981
It will be hard for him to settle in
unless the new place is haunted.

492
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,357
He settled down here

493
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,527
because you kept coming in and out
of this place in the first place.

494
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,737
So? Where did he go?

495
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,324
There's a place crowded with ghosts.

496
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,745
I've never seen you before.

497
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,039
Where are you from?

498
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,207
It doesn't matter.

499
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,918
What are you doing in my son's place?

500
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:16,877
Well...

501
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:18,546
It's not like that.

502
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,214
Someone sent me here.

503
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,759
-I don't care. Get lost!
-Who sent you here?

504
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:25,928
-Go away!
-How dare you come here?

505
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,555
You idiot.

506
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,724
Gosh, wait. Let go of me.

507
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,518
-How dare you...
-Wait.

508
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,894
Don't you dare come here again.

509
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,772
So you took care of a local ghost.

510
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,150
Are you going to kindergarten?

511
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,860
Yes. To pick Seo-woo up.

512
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,070
I can stay around her all day now.

513
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,364
I will stop all the ghosts
from coming near her.

514
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,783
You're unbelievable.

515
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,203
Then Seo-woo won't be
seeing ghosts anymore, right?

516
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,163
What?

517
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,792
I think so. I guess so.

518
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,004
Why do you sound so evasive?

519
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,299
I've been counting the days.

520
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,384
I have only a few days left.

521
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:07,511
I have to make sure she doesn't see them.

522
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:11,098
It wouldn't hurt to see some ghosts.

523
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,809
You're a ghost too.

524
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,061
Are you crazy?

525
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,229
Take it back right now.

526
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,647
What are you waiting for?

527
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,317
Happy now?

528
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:26,155
So I wonder...

529
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,115
What if...

530
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:30,618
What if

531
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,413
Seo-woo keeps seeing ghosts?

532
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,498
What will happen?

533
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:37,124
It's nothing serious.

534
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,920
She will be just like me.

535
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:42,421
A shaman?

536
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,341
That can't be right.
I can't let it happen.

537
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,448
MOTHERS OF SUNSHINE CLASS

538
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,659
There's a fraud who sells
fake home-school materials

539
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,953
in front of the kindergarten. Be careful.

540
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,753
MOTHERS OF SUNSHINE CLASS

541
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,797
Who would fall for such a fraud?

542
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,091
We're not fools. We will be okay.

543
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:36,642
Then I will have one set
of Writing materials.

544
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,227
-This one? Okay.
-Yes.

545
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:41,188
So you have an experienced eye.

546
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,316
With these books,
your child will soon begin to speak.

547
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,818
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

548
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:49,447
Late talkers are because
they don't have home-study materials.

549
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,033
Seo-woo studied a lot
with those materials.

550
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:57,538
Then I will have another set of these too.

551
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:58,706
-This one as well?
-Yes.

552
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,750
You're a great mother.

553
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,591
All right. Here you are.

554
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,843
-Thank you.
-Have a nice day.

555
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,858
Kitchen staff. A pick-up helper.

556
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,112
Are you happy to see your kid like that?

557
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,615
Yes.

558
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,118
I'm just thankful.

559
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,625
Just tell me the reason.

560
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,376
Why are you being like this?

561
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,920
Why...

562
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,386
Why do you want to die?

563
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:19,662
Seo-woo sees

564
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,872
ghosts.

565
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,999
What? What does she see?

566
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:26,252
Ghosts.

567
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,215
What are you talking about?

568
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,633
I was a ghost.

569
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,517
You said

570
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,895
you don't remember anything.

571
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:48,649
You said you just woke up
at the charnel house.

572
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:53,070
I was a ghost for five years.

573
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:57,616
I was around Seo-woo the whole time.

574
00:42:58,409 --> 00:42:59,660
For five years.

575
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,165
Because of me, Seo-woo sees...

576
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,092
Is that why

577
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,804
Seo-woo sees ghosts?

578
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,224
The ghosts that I know?

579
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:29,732
Hyeon-jeong. I don't want anything else.

580
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,484
You're a mom. You know how I feel.

581
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,196
I'm dead already.

582
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,532
And I have no regrets.

583
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:43,495
Just let me
take care of what I did before I leave.

584
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,042
There's

585
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,838
nothing I did for Seo-woo.

586
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,187
This is the only thing I can do

587
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,105
for Seo-woo, you know.

588
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,366
Seo-woo is going through all this
because of me.

589
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:23,369
It's all my fault.

590
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,612
What's all this?

591
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,924
Did she ask you to cook bracken?

592
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,635
-Yes.
-Yu-ri doesn't eat bracken.

593
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:25,305
Gang-hwa didn't like it either.

594
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,725
I know. It's strange.

595
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,771
She took all of it.
I guess it wasn't for her.

596
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:37,943
This kimchi is new.

597
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:40,696
I got it from someone.

598
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,781
I see. Who?

599
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,159
How is it?

600
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,705
It tastes healthy.

601
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,331
A little bland.

602
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,751
It tastes somewhat familiar.

603
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,712
I made new side dishes.

604
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,046
Do you like them?

605
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,548
-They are too bland.
-I agree.

606
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,341
This is bland too.

607
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,677
Bland tasting foods are good for health.

608
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,101
-Don't eat them.
-Why would you do that?

609
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:13,353
You can't do that while we eat.

610
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,397
What?

611
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,441
The pick-up helper.

612
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,775
I got it from her.

613
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:23,614
I wanted to eat this.

614
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:28,160
You don't like bracken, do you?

615
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,580
No.

616
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,293
You like it though.

617
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,753
Right.

618
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,933
So did you know the whole thing
about Min-jeong?

619
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:53,936
Yes.

620
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,355
I know her well.

621
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,623
You're done.

622
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:22,589
Let's watch TV.

623
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,362
Oh, no.

624
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,073
Seo-woo, you spilled everything.

625
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,324
Again?

626
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:04,131
At first, I just wanted to watch Seo-woo
for a little longer.

627
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:13,515
Why don't you try to become friends
with the other kids' moms?

628
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,727
I know they can be quite rude,

629
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,146
but wouldn't it be better
then being alone all the time?

630
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:23,692
Thank you for today.

631
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:27,237
Should I make some seasoned bracken
tomorrow?

632
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,323
No, thank you. My husband doesn't like it.

633
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,116
Ask her to make it.

634
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,368
You love bracken.

635
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,332
You're too nice.

636
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:43,170
After a while,

637
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,672
I ended up knowing better than anyone else

638
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:48,050
just how nice Min-jeong is.

639
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:51,970
She sure is nice.

640
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,807
I wish she was a mean person.

641
00:48:59,936 --> 00:49:01,563
-Hyeon-jeong.
-Yes?

642
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,981
I've never been more grateful

643
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,734
to anyone else in my life.

644
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,321
I've been watching everything
right next to her.

645
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,575
I'll never be able to pay her back

646
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,161
even after I die.

647
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,178
She sure is the spitting image of Yu-ri.

648
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,691
So please try to understand.

649
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,401
Wait, Yu-ri.

650
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,779
If you don't stop,
I'll just go up right now.

651
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,989
They're fake.

652
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,992
What are you talking about?

653
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,083
HOME-SCHOOL MATERIALS

654
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:05,877
What?

655
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,255
No way.

656
00:50:08,588 --> 00:50:11,258
-I paid 350,000 won for them.
-You're crazy.

657
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:13,510
They're supposed to make
a cooing baby talk.

658
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:15,887
My goodness. You bought all this?

659
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,472
They're fake.

660
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:19,933
-My gosh.
-That bastard.

661
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,102
How many are they?

662
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,230
Hello.

663
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:28,233
Do you want to have a drink with me?

664
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:31,528
What?

665
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,994
MISAENG

666
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,665
I'm here...

667
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,251
Leaving.

668
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,964
What's going on?

669
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,758
What did I just see?

670
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,520
What's with you? Are you coming in or not?

671
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:07,856
I can't stay here.

672
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,066
Why are the three of them here together?

673
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,113
I just wanted to thank you
for the side dishes.

674
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,532
This was the only way I could think of.

675
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,118
You two like drinking, don't you?

676
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,370
I think you like it more than we do.

677
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:25,791
You're right.

678
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,722
I guess you two really are close.
You were together again.

679
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,978
Oh, do you want me to leave you two alone?

680
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,231
No, not at all. I'm just envious.

681
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,110
Since I got married, I've had no friends.

682
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,737
I pushed everyone away.

683
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:57,614
I knew it.

684
00:51:58,281 --> 00:52:00,325
-Sorry?
-Nothing.

685
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:10,252
I wanted to become friends with you,

686
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,754
but Gang-hwa seemed uncomfortable.

687
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,506
He did?

688
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,300
That's understandable.

689
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,430
Gosh.

690
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:25,267
Why isn't he here yet?

691
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,269
What is it? What's the matter?

692
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:29,521
Gosh, you startled me!

693
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:30,939
Hey, Gang-hwa.

694
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,357
Gang-hwa.

695
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,317
-Gang-hwa.
-Get off me.

696
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:35,944
Gang-hwa.

697
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:40,407
I had no idea things would get this bad.

698
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,993
I had no idea I'd have to meet you
in the middle of the night.

699
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:46,288
-Guess who's at my diner right now.
-Who is it? A celebrity or something?

700
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:47,706
A celebrity, my foot.

701
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,040
Hyeon-jeong, Yu-ri...

702
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,250
So what?

703
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,210
-...and Min-jeong.
-What?

704
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,462
What is Min-jeong doing there?

705
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,720
Are you going out?

706
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,889
I have to meet someone. Go to bed.

707
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,265
Who?

708
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,856
A friend.

709
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,077
Do I make you uncomfortable?

710
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,415
What do you mean?

711
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:33,835
You were very close to Seo-woo's mom,

712
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:34,878
Yu-ri.

713
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:41,051
Well, why would I feel uncomfortable?

714
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,474
I feel grateful.

715
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,645
I really do.

716
00:53:55,815 --> 00:53:58,193
I guess you two were really close.

717
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,077
Does this person over here
make you uncomfortable?

718
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,961
No, she doesn't. I'm just

719
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,880
curious.

720
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,884
Like I'm curious about Seo-woo's mom.

721
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,642
Since I got married,
I've only seen a photo of her.

722
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:35,105
At first, I thought,
"So this is how she looked like."

723
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,983
And then I wondered

724
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:40,986
what kind of person she was,
how she talked,

725
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,823
and what kind of thoughts she had.

726
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,534
I became more and more curious

727
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,954
because Gang-hwa would never
tell me anything.

728
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,089
So when I see her,

729
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,466
I wonder

730
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,511
if Seo-woo's mom was like her.

731
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,393
I'm sorry. You might not know this,

732
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,937
but I'm not Seo-woo's real mom.

733
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,945
I'm making you uncomfortable.

734
00:55:24,529 --> 00:55:26,448
Let's drink.

735
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,283
Okay.

736
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:42,422
Gang-hwa, that jerk.

737
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:45,425
I'm 100 percent sure

738
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:48,011
it's Gang-hwa's fault.

739
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:49,596
I agree.

740
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:52,223
-Right?
-That bastard.

741
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,641
Listen.

742
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,937
-I mean, why?
-Exactly.

743
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,982
Why wouldn't he tell you anything?
He's only making you more curious.

744
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:03,193
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Yes.

745
00:56:03,401 --> 00:56:04,819
Does he think

746
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:07,739
I'll get jealous of a dead person
or something?

747
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:11,493
-I know.
-He's always like that.

748
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,871
Thinking he's being thoughtful,
he keeps everything to himself

749
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,581
and decides everything on his own.

750
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,833
Gosh, unbelievable.

751
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,169
That's exactly what I think.

752
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:24,798
-By the way,
-Oh, my.

753
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:26,674
do you know my husband well?

754
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:30,678
What?

755
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,351
No, I don't.

756
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:39,187
I don't.

757
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,106
She doesn't.

758
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:56,746
Anyway, you look

759
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,792
just like Seo-woo.

760
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,463
I'm jealous.

761
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,136
You know what?

762
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:18,143
All stepmoms in fairytales are evil.

763
00:57:18,226 --> 00:57:19,561
Why?

764
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,937
Why?

765
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:24,482
Why are they all evil?

766
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,485
Just because

767
00:57:27,944 --> 00:57:29,529
they're stepmoms?

768
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,866
Stepmoms are moms too.

769
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,244
But why do they have to be evil?

770
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,883
I was faster.

771
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,551
Gosh, you're incredible.

772
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,928
My goodness.

773
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,265
Good job.

774
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,895
-I did a good job, didn't I?
-You did.

775
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,856
You saved her.

776
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:08,985
My gosh.

777
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,783
Hyeon-jeong must be out of her mind.

778
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:16,993
She wants them to be friends?

779
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,828
Are they going to be best friends now?

780
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,622
She's crazy. She completely lost her mind.

781
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,874
Gosh, you're distracting me. Sit down.

782
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,292
You're the biggest problem here.

783
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,794
Why did you let Yu-ri
be your pick-up helper?

784
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,715
You obviously want to screw up your life.

785
00:58:37,388 --> 00:58:39,224
HYEON-JEONG

786
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:49,943
My bestie.

787
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,152
You're my bestie now.

788
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:52,654
-All right.
-What?

789
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,657
Hey, she's my bestie! She's mine!

790
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,116
She's mine.

791
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,244
-No, she's mine!
-Hey!

792
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,787
-Fine, I get it.
-She's my bestie.

793
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,997
Let go on three, you both.

794
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:05,166
One, two, three.

795
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:07,001
Did you let go?

796
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:10,296
-Let go!
-She's mine!

797
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,340
Don't take her from me!

798
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:14,551
All right. Gosh, that hurts.

799
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:15,969
That really hurts.

800
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:17,762
Unbelievable.

801
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,723
-I can't believe what I'm seeing.
-Fine, I get it.

802
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,517
-Do you see that too?
-Don't take her away.

803
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,018
That's enough.

804
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,437
Pull yourself together.

805
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,524
That's enough. I get it.

806
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,694
Gang-hwa.

807
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:35,029
My husband is here.

808
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:37,323
Hi.

809
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:41,869
Hyeon-jeong.

810
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:46,207
-You're mine.
-What happened to these two?

811
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,336
-Well...
-Why did you let them drink so much?

812
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:53,256
I drank the most.

813
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,924
I need to pee.

814
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:57,176
Gang-hwa, take Min-jeong home.

815
00:59:57,927 --> 00:59:59,887
-What about Yu-ri?
-I'll take care of her.

816
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:03,141
You're mine, Hyeon-jeong.

817
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:04,934
I get it, I get it.

818
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,437
Min-jeong, let's go home. Take my arm.

819
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,980
Hold here, honey.

820
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,691
I got you.

821
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:17,405
Let's go.

822
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:24,704
Hyeon-jeong,
please make sure Yu-ri is okay.

823
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,123
Don't worry and go home.

824
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,926
Gosh, you drink too much.

825
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,346
-The thing is--
-Cut it out. Come inside.

826
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:44,057
Geun-sang.

827
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,643
Geun-sang!

828
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,603
Wait...

829
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:57,612
Yu-ri.

830
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,074
Hyeon-jeong.

831
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:05,536
-Yu-ri.
-I'm so happy.

832
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,477
She can't stop sighing.

833
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,479
What happened?

834
01:01:33,898 --> 01:01:35,817
Her son must have been here.

835
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,360
That must be it.

836
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:38,778
Every time her son visits here,

837
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:42,490
she sits there for hours,

838
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,200
sighing constantly.

839
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,286
Even if her son was doing well,

840
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,747
it wouldn't be easy for her to go up.

841
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:54,919
Even after you die, your children
will always be your homework.

842
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,087
JANG-HWA AND HONG-RYEON

843
01:01:56,504 --> 01:01:57,714
CINDERELLA

844
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,342
KONG-JWI AND PAT-JWI

845
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:03,886
ANTS

846
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,096
SHIM-CHEONG

847
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,141
SNOW WHITE

848
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:19,694
What are these?

849
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:22,405
These books limit children's imagination.

850
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,241
-Pardon?
-"Stepmoms are evil and out to get you.

851
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:27,368
All children with stepmoms
should be pitied."

852
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:30,455
That's what these books teach children.

853
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,623
They make all stepmoms
look like bad people.

854
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:38,171
I see. I guess you have a point.

855
01:02:38,504 --> 01:02:40,256
So they should be put away, right?

856
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:41,716
Pardon?

857
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,772
HOME-SCHOOL MATERIALS

858
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,865
You bought them?

859
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,950
They're fake.

860
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,161
I already told her.

861
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:15,374
I bought them for Seo-woo.

862
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,835
For Seo-woo?

863
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:22,632
I see.

864
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:27,428
They can make a cooing baby talk?

865
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,055
That's nonsense.

866
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:32,308
What kind of moms fall for that?

867
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,353
You don't have to give them to me.

868
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:39,232
I already have them.

869
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:43,653
I was also tricked into buying them

870
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:45,279
last year.

871
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,168
EASY HANGUL

872
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:06,509
EASY HANGUL

873
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,346
Hey.

874
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:14,141
Min-jeong seems to get wasted
every time she drinks.

875
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:15,977
Is she okay?

876
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,061
Yes.

877
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:21,148
How is Yu-ri?

878
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,984
She seemed very drunk last night.

879
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:24,944
What?

880
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:27,446
Well...

881
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,577
Yu-ri doesn't get drunk easily.

882
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:34,996
So how much did she drink
to get so wasted?

883
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,249
She wasn't drunk.

884
01:04:38,332 --> 01:04:40,126
What are you talking about?
She was dead drunk.

885
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:43,796
She sobered up when Gang-hwa showed up.

886
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,840
No way. Are you drunk?

887
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:48,426
Are you saying
she pretended to be drunk...

888
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:00,563
Why does everything have to be

889
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:03,441
so sad between those two?

890
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:10,907
Of course, she's fine.

891
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:33,888
Come in.

892
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,599
-Hello.
-What's the matter?

893
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:40,186
Can you sign this?

894
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,187
What is it?

895
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,651
PETITION AGAINST PRIORITIZING VIP PATIENTS

896
01:05:50,321 --> 01:05:51,989
I'll pass.

897
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:55,034
I'm not supposed to sign any petitions
while on suspension, you fool.

898
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,829
We've been working on this
for three months.

899
01:05:58,913 --> 01:05:59,914
Please sign it.

900
01:05:59,997 --> 01:06:03,292
If things could change so easily,
they would already have.

901
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:06,629
All right. Hey.

902
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:08,965
Leave him out. Do you want me to sign it?

903
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,716
-I'll sign it.
-You already did.

904
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,094
I did? I can do it again.
I love signing petitions.

905
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:26,524
Again, Doctor Cho is the only one
who didn't sign it.

906
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:30,111
Otherwise, he might die.

907
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,779
I said no.

908
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:32,863
Send him over.

909
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:35,449
I can do this.
Why aren't you letting me do it?

910
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,451
I can save him, Doctor.

911
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,170
...INSOMNIA, HYPERAROUSAL, HAND TREMORS...

912
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,172
It's just like Doctor Gye's diagnosis.

913
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:51,841
Claustrophobia in operating rooms.

914
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,262
Is his treatment going well?

915
01:06:56,345 --> 01:06:57,555
Yes.

916
01:06:57,638 --> 01:06:59,974
So why wasn't he treated

917
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:01,892
earlier?

918
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,819
You still can't do surgery?

919
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,239
Why are you surprised?

920
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:16,824
I visit this hospital now and then.

921
01:07:17,491 --> 01:07:19,577
There's a way to find out things.

922
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:24,081
Are you still

923
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,876
scared of operating rooms?

924
01:07:31,255 --> 01:07:32,089
Yes.

925
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:34,800
Why? I thought you were getting better.

926
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:38,012
You were moving on.
You even got married again.

927
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,560
-Yes.
-Then why haven't you been treated?

928
01:07:51,859 --> 01:07:52,818
I feel guilty.

929
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:54,945
About what?

930
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,243
About getting better.

931
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:04,914
I feel too guilty.

932
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,259
He felt guilty.

933
01:08:18,469 --> 01:08:21,388
The more stable his new marriage got,

934
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,015
the guiltier he would've felt.

935
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:26,310
Even while laughing and feeling happy,

936
01:08:26,435 --> 01:08:29,188
he would've felt a sudden pang of guilt.

937
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,400
I think he didn't seek help earlier

938
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:36,487
because his symptoms were
the only reminder of what happened.

939
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,323
He didn't want to forget everything.

940
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,454
I can't believe we ran out of salt.

941
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,000
Still, I'd rather go to the supermarket
than peel carrots.

942
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,752
Definitely.

943
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:10,479
YU-RI

944
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:12,481
Hi, Yu-ri.

945
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,233
Gang-hwa.

946
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:15,943
-My goodness.
-Hello?

947
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,528
Yu-ri, what's wrong?

948
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,738
A car accident. Send her to the ER.

949
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:20,781
Hello?

950
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,199
Yu-ri!

951
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:24,034
Yu-ri!

952
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,168
What happened? What is it?

953
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,461
Gang-hwa, where are you going?

954
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,224
-Doctor Cho.
-Yes?

955
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,475
Your wife

956
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:51,228
had an accident.

957
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:22,593
A shaman?

958
01:10:23,385 --> 01:10:25,638
That can't be right.
I can't let it happen.

959
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:31,602
What's so wrong with being a shaman?

960
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,356
It's a way of living.

961
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:02,132
What are you doing here?

962
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,180
I never heard back from you,
so I came here

963
01:11:08,806 --> 01:11:09,848
to get her.

964
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:29,743
I've been watching everything
right next to her.

965
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,831
I'll never be able to pay her back

966
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:36,458
even after I die.

967
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:43,424
You don't want to live?

968
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:51,515
You don't want to live at all?

969
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,565
I do.

970
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:03,694
I really do, Hyeon-jeong.

971
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,922
I can't get out. What should I do?

972
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:28,177
Thank you.

973
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,179
Whose house is this?

974
01:12:32,473 --> 01:12:33,432
Is it your house?

975
01:12:33,932 --> 01:12:36,018
It looks so cute.

976
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:37,144
It's a living room.

977
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,771
-Okay.
-This is a bathroom.

978
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,022
It's a bathroom?

979
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:41,940
Seo-woo.

980
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,901
Seo-woo, Hi.

981
01:12:43,984 --> 01:12:45,611
Oh, no!

982
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:48,322
Three, four, five.

983
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:52,034
I counted to five. Good job, Seo-woo.

984
01:12:52,117 --> 01:12:54,244
You're good at sports, just like me.

985
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:57,706
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

986
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,375
Are you done?

987
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:02,211
-Not yet.
-Are you done now?

988
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:04,797
-Yes!
-I'll start looking for you.

989
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:10,719
I found you!

990
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:12,930
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

991
01:13:13,013 --> 01:13:14,807
-Are you done?
-Not yet.

992
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:16,517
No? Are you here?

993
01:13:17,726 --> 01:13:19,103
I found you.

994
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:20,604
Aren't you scared?

995
01:13:20,687 --> 01:13:22,731
Are you okay? That's good.

996
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:26,026
Higher and higher. You're flying.

997
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,946
Hold my hands. It's scary.

998
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,866
Mommy!

999
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:36,745
Did you have fun?

1000
01:13:46,505 --> 01:13:47,714
What did you do?

1001
01:13:47,798 --> 01:13:51,009
We played hide-and-seek, doctor,

1002
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:52,261
and the airplane game.

1003
01:13:53,637 --> 01:13:55,139
You played so many games.

1004
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,945
Seo-woo looks adorable
even when she's asleep.

1005
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:45,439
Your place where I cannot reach.

1006
01:14:46,523 --> 01:14:47,566
Mom.

1007
01:15:14,259 --> 01:15:17,513
I want to be friends with the woman
who looks like Yu-ri.

1008
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:18,931
She seems like a nice person.

1009
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,891
How many days does Yu-ri have left?

1010
01:15:20,974 --> 01:15:23,810
She belongs with her family.
Will that not work?

1011
01:15:23,894 --> 01:15:25,562
Is it really okay to let them hang out?

1012
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:28,690
Min-jeong never liked someone this much.

1013
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,067
A success rate of 99.9 percent.

1014
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,693
All the ghosts have been annihilated.

1015
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:32,945
Take a little break.

1016
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,530
What if I like her?

1017
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,782
Can I date her or marry her?

1018
01:15:36,865 --> 01:15:38,367
So she doesn't have to die?

1019
01:15:38,450 --> 01:15:42,204
What are you going to do
with Cha Yu-ri and Cho Seo-woo?

1020
01:15:46,250 --> 01:15:48,252
