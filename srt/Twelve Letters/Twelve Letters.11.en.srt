00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,280
How's it going? Is she back yet?

2
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,600
No.

3
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,519
Not yet.

4
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,960
Fengying

5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,199
has always been so kind.

6
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:29,519
How could she do that?

7
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,440
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

8
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:33,320
Leaving her child behind.

9
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,280
What terrible influence.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,120
How can they cope?

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,439
Right.

12
00:00:38,432 --> 00:00:39,328
Exactly.

13
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,239
Dad, what's wrong?

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,840
Do you know where your mother went?

15
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,680
No, Dad.

16
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,640
Did she say anything to you?

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,840
No.

18
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:45,560
You didn't go to school today?

19
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:48,199
I...

20
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,879
I wanted to go out to play for a bit.

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,680
Where's Mom?

22
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,159
You don't have a mom now.

23
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,680
Someone like her

24
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,640
isn't worthy to be your mom.

25
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:07,680
But... Mom...

26
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,240
She's not your mom!

27
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:10,879
Dad.

28
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,039
She isn't worthy!

29
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,520
She ran off with another man!

30
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,000
She abandoned us, understand?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:15,840
Understood.

32
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
Where's Grandma?

33
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:22,879
She is in the hospital.

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,800
Tang.

35
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,840
From now on, it'll be

36
00:02:33,159 --> 00:02:34,479
only us in this family.

37
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,879
Dad.

38
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,680
Your mom left us, understand?

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,520
Understood.

40
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,639
She's the one who abandoned us.

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,360
I got it, Dad.

The kidnapping case.

46
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,520
Wasn't everything clarified?

47
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,479
Why hasn't Tang Yixun been released yet?

48
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,479
We're still investigating this case.

49
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,159
How much longer will it take?

50
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,960
How are his injuries?

51
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,680
Focus on your recovery.

52
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,720
We'll inform the family of any updates.

53
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,360
I am his family.

54
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,439
Can you tell me where he is now?

55
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,400
The rain's stopped.

56
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,519
You should go home now.

57
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,519
If there's any news,

58
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,000
we'll contact you immediately.

59
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Okay?

60
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,720
When will there be news?

61
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:00,360
Why are you still here?

62
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,680
Go home and rest early.

Is everything okay now?

66
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,479
Yes.

67
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,520
Tang.

68
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,760
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,160
It's okay.

70
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,279
At worst, I'll just have a scar.

71
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,319
It'll make me look intimidating.

72
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,080
It's okay.

73
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,039
It's okay.

74

Okay, I won't pressure you.

127
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,559
My mom consulted the school,

128
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,919
but your detention record
disqualifies you.

129

130
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,519

00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,639
ask other schools for you?

132
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,479
No, no.

133
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:05,960
I've decided

134
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,519
to find a job.

135
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,399
Ye Haitang will go to college.

136
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,039
College costs a fortune.

137
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,080
I must save up for her.

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
You can work at my dad's nightclub.

139
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,600

140
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,440
to make you manager.

141
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,480
Stop it.

142
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:21,679
That is not

143
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,120
a reputable place.

144
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,840
I want honest labor

145
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:27,759
and clean money.

146
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,240
True, that den reeks of trouble.

147
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,919

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,720

150
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,440
I'll go to my mom.

Shen Xiaojun,

152
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,080
what's this about?

153
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,399
Think I'm a beggar?

154
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,359
No,

155
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,720
just my New Year money.

156
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,200
Not much. I want to thank you both.

157
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,040
No need at all.

158
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,240
Treat Ye Haitang well

159
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,519
at school from now on.

160
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,639
Don't worry.

161
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,759
In Meiwan High School,

162
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,639
if she loses a hair,

163
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:07,840
it will be my failure.

164
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,519
As long as I'm around,

165
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,200
nobody at Meiwan High School
will bully Ye Haitang.

166
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,719
Deal.

167
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,879
I never expected

168
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,440
we'd end up like this.

169
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
What twisted fate.

170
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,320
This will help you.

171
00:11:29,879 --> 00:11:31,840
My mom hired an expensive tutor.

172
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,600
Ye Haitang can join me.

173
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,159
Tutoring won't fix my grades,

174
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:38,360
but she's different.

175
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,559
She's already smart.

176
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:40,919
With extra help,

177
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,639
she'll get into a good college.

178
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,039
That works?

179
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,759
Absolutely.

180
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,919
Bring her tomorrow

181
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:47,960
to the tutor with me.

182
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:49,759
My mom's spent a lot on it.

183
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,919
May as well share it.

184
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,240
And I can slack off.

185
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,559
Great, thanks.

186
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,800
Really?

187
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,440
Shen Xiaojun offered himself.

188
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,360
Seems like

189
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:06,600
good karma is paying off.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,720
Blessing in disguise, right?

191
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,240
Now, I'll get into a top college.

192
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,040
Tang,

193
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,320
from now on, focus on studying.

194
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,799
I'll earn money.

195
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,759
No matter which college you enter,

196
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,639
I'll have your tuition covered

197
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:22,519
with plenty to spare.

198
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,639
You'll enter college in style.

199
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,360
Don't overwork yourself.

200
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,799
I'll go to a normal school.

201
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,360
I asked Miss Tan.

202
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,799
It is tuition-free

203
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:33,159
and offers living allowances.

204
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,080
Really?

205
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,719
That's fantastic.

206
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,080
Your money can fund
another year of high school.

207
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,799
College is still important.

208
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:40,799
Wouldn't it be better

209
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,480
to work after graduating?

210
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
What career interests you?

211
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,320
I...

212
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,399
I'm flexible.

213
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
I'll study whatever brings profit.

214
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,519
When I make money,

215
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
I'll take you traveling.

216
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,399
Any place you want to visit?

217
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,799
I want to see snowfall.

218
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,960
I've never seen heavy snow.

219
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,960
Me neither.

220
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,799
Then it's settled.

221
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,480
When I make money,

222
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,720
we'll go wherever snow falls.

223
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,200
Deal.

224
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,080
Thanks.

225
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:50,879
Young man,

226
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,360
you're too skinny.

227
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,600
Can you handle it?

228
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,120
Of course I can.

229
00:13:58,559 --> 00:13:59,399
I mean,

230
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
you're still young.

231
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,200
Too young for this.

232
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,399
Let me handle it.

233
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,840
Don't push your limits.

234
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,680
Listen.

235
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,480
Unload this truck, and you can go.

236
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,799
Wait, isn't there another ship coming?

237
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:11,720
You want to continue?

238
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,560
Yes.

239
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,440
Don't come crying if you collapse.

240
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:16,519
It won't happen.

241
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,840
And we get extra pay after 10:00 PM.

242
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:21,080
You're too eager for cash.

243
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:22,639
Listen.

244
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,519
There's a ship leaving for Shenzhen
at noon tomorrow.

245
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,240
They need one to manage cargo.

246
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:29,399
It takes a few days.

247
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,840
Interested?

248
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:31,999
Okay.

249
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,480
I'll go if the pay's good.

250
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
Money-hungry brat.

251
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:56,896
(Math problems)

252
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,080
Five yuan.

253
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,879
I hear there are
imported goods on that ship.

254
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,000
Next.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,960
I've gone to look.

256
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,519
I expected cigarettes or alcohol,

257
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,080
but when we opened the crates,

258
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,440
it was all snacks and drinks.

259
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,559
- Things for women and kids.
- Next.

260
00:15:23,559 --> 00:15:24,519
Not interested.

261
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,440
Let's get fish noodles and drink later.

262
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,280
Alright.

263
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,080
Tang Yixun.

264
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,840
15.

265
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,680
Thanks, Mr. Guang.

266
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:33,680
Thanks.

267
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:35,719
Next.

268
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,920
Huang Longshan.

269
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,840
Six yuan.

270
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,960
Young man,

271
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,919
only these items left.

272
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:53,799
What would you like?

273
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,559
Let me look.

274
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,160
What's this?

275
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,879
Imported biscuits.

276
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,240
(Danish Cookie)
Biscuits?

277
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,320
Cookies.

278
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:13,440
Better than biscuits.

279
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:15,039
Only two boxes left.

280
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:15,879
Want them?

281
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,639
Yes, I'll take both.

282
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,240
Ten yuan for two boxes.

283
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,080
Ten's fine.

284
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,039
Deal, no problem.

285
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,080
Ten yuan.

286
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,000
Here, thanks.

287
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,840
Good.

288
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:38,999
Tang.

289
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:42,919
Listen,

290
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,639
Shen Xiaojun got detention.

291
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,559
That's his usual routine.

292
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:49,840
What did you get?

293
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,280
This?

294
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,120
You'll find out at home.

295
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,480
You have a secret.

296
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,679
Tired today?

297
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,559
Not really.

298
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,519
Just some clothes today.

299
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,359
Easy stuff.

300
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,000
Good.

301
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,440
(Danish Cookie)
This is for you.

302
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,279
Biscuits in a box?

303
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,680
Not called biscuits.

304
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,319
It has a specific name.

305
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:14,159
Cookie.

306
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,280
Cookie.

307
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,200
Right. Look how amazing this is.

308
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,000
The cookies match exactly

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:24,880
with the packaging.

310
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,399
Exactly.

311
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,879
Cool, huh?

312
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,799
This looks so fancy.

313
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,759
Where did you get it?

314
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,640
It's expensive, right?

315
00:17:35,079 --> 00:17:37,079
How expensive can cookies get anyway?

316
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,799
Sailors bought these overseas.

317
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:41,400
They got extra stock and sold me some.

318
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,839
I figured with all your schoolwork

319
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,240
and exams tiring you out.

320
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,920
You'd need some sweets.

321
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,320
Try one.

322
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,320
Here you are.

323
00:17:58,319 --> 00:18:00,039
I can't bear to eat it.

324
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:01,680
Don't fuss. I bought two boxes.

325
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,520
Eat up. Hurry.

326
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,040
How is it?

327
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Delicious.

328
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,800
Really?

329
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,640
Try it yourself.

330
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,480
Okay.

331
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,599
The box is pretty.

332
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,800
Don't throw it away.

333
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,640
We'll keep it for storage later.

334
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,720
One for you and one for me.

335
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:29,159
Deal.

336
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,400
I wish that mailbox hadn't gone missing.

337
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:38,920
I want to tell Yu Nian

338
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,720
I'm taking the college exams soon.

339
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,440
We'll leave Meiwan shortly.

340
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,240
I also want to ask her

341
00:18:46,519 --> 00:18:47,920
if I ever find my mom.

342
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,800
Tang.

343
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,839
Something just occurred to me.

344
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,000
Didn't you say before

345
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,200
you had a secret code with your mom,

346
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,960
known only to you two?

347
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,039
Later, in the future,

348
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,359
you told Shen Cheng, right?

349
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,480
That must be it.

350
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,839
Here's the catch.

351
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,920
I keep wondering

352
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,480
why your son's surname is Shen.

353
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,119
I've been racking my brains.

354
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,960
We only know one Shen,

355
00:19:27,719 --> 00:19:28,559
Shen Xiaojun.

356
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,000
But you two aren't compatible.

357
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,319
You're like oil and water.

358
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,279
But it's different now.

359
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
You've gotten closer.

360
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,920
You even study with him daily.

361
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,039
Tang, in the future...

362
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:37,160
Stop talking nonsense.

363
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,240
I'm serious.

364
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,119
The letter says so.

365
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:40,720
Your future son's surname is Shen.

366
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,400
Shen Cheng, correct?

367
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,760
Xun.

368
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:45,319
That mailbox is already gone.

369
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,039
It might not be true.

370
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,359
I need to find that mailbox.

371
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:53,000
I must ask Shen Cheng directly

372
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
who his father really is.

373
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:55,480
And Shen Xiaojun.

374
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,640
He never studies.

375
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
Why does he need a tutor?

376
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,400
Exactly. Saying it out loud,

377
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,920
I find it suspicious.

378
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:03,519
Why would he get a tutor
if he doesn't study?

379
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,559
Shen Xiaojun's fishy.

380
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:06,759
We're impossible.

381
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,640
If that's impossible,

382
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,319
where did Shen Cheng

383
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,480
come from?

384
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,720
Why does he say you're his mom

385
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,280
and that he's your son?

386
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:15,440
Isn't it strange?

387
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,079
And he knows your secret code...

388
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,039
I'll go look for the mailbox

389
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,359
at dawn tomorrow.

390
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,640
Wait, why Shen?

391
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:38,959
Here.

392
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,279
Easy. Take it slow.

393
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:42,399
Turn it around.

394
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,240
That's enough for today.

395
00:20:51,439 --> 00:20:52,279
Wang.

396
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:53,759
Haul the scrap metal away

397
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,840
when you leave.

398
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,960
Got it.

399
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:57,000
Bye, Mr. Guang.

400
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,320
Sir,

401
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,080
I'll handle it.

402
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,960
You don't even know where the dump is.

403
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,000
Let me do it.

404
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,160
Don't worry. I can find it.

405
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,759
You rest. Let me handle it.

406
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,480
Take it easy, Tang.

407
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,320
It's okay.

408
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:32,960
Tang!

409
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,640
Tang!

410
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,080
Look.

411
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:45,599
You found the mailbox!

412
00:22:46,759 --> 00:22:47,599
I found it.

413
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,240
Don't move it alone. I'll come down.

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,240
Tang, let go. I'll do it.

415
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,679
Careful. You're not wearing gloves.

416
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:53,679
I'll do it.

417
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,799
How did you find it?

418
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,320
I found it

419
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:04,160
at a scrapyard.

420
00:23:05,119 --> 00:23:06,599
Why did you go to the scrapyard?

421
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:09,359
Wait for me.

422
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,599
I'll have some water and explain slowly.

423
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,640
I went to the scrapyard

424
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,559
to unload trash today.

425
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,920
Then I heard a cat meowing.

426
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,680
When I turned around, guess what?

427
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:32,680
It was that cat.

428
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,799
You know that cat, right?

429
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,519
When I approached,

430
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,279
the cat was standing
right on this mailbox.

431
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,599
Don't you find it magical?

432
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,359
It seems it's waiting for me.

433
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,720
Check this out.

434
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:54,079
How did it get so damaged?

435
00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:55,759
I think

436
00:23:55,759 --> 00:23:57,319
the recent heavy rain

437
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,359
knocked over the mailbox.

438
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:01,279
People thought it was abandoned,

439
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,799
so they threw it away.

440
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:04,919
Look.

441
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,920
It can't even stand upright.

442
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,399
Easy fix.

443
00:24:10,759 --> 00:24:11,599
Tang.

444
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,960
Go hold that side for me.

445
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,800
I'll handle this.

446
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,240
See?

447
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,520
Almost done.

448
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,759
You're amazing.

449
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,960
After we fix this mailbox,

450
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:34,039
let's keep it at home.

451
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,160
If left outside,

452
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,240
it may get damaged
by the weather or disappear again.

453
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,279
What then?

454
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,480
But what if the cat doesn't come?

455
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,440
Will the mailbox still work?

456
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,319
Putting it back is safer.

457
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,359
You're right.

458
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:07,328
(Sunshine Bookstore)

459
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,000
Why are you rushing, Tang?

460
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:31,960
Let me walk you home.

461
00:25:32,759 --> 00:25:33,599
I have things to do.

462
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,319
Xun will pick me up. You go back.

463
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:36,240
Alright.

464
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,080
Tang.

465
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:42,200
Xun, let's have dinner in a few days.

466
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,520
See you tomorrow.

467
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,079
See you tomorrow, Haitang.

468
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,480
Bye-bye.

469
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,000
Let's go.

470
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:52,559
Why is Shen Xiaojun

471
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,559
acting so strange?

472
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,039
He smiled at you

473
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,599
very happily.

474
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,240
Why was he smiling?

475
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,400
What are you implying?

476
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,759
Stop being petty.

477
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:06,880
Who's being petty?

478
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:08,800
Just asking casually.

479
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,359
No, he was really acting odd.

480
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,759
See how he smiled just now.

481
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,079
Was he like this before?

482
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,000
Shen Xiaojun

483
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,720
likes...

484
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,080
Wang Manyu.

485
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:25,519
Really?

486
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:27,119
He just told me himself.

487
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:32,319
That's nice.

488
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,440
You know Wang Manyu.

489
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,960
Good grades, a kind personality,

490
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:38,119
a pleasant voice,

491
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,400
and from a good family.

492
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:41,240
What do you mean?

493
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:45,000
Now, you're being petty, too.

494
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:49,160
I mean,

495
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,960
they make a good match.

496
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:55,599
Today, I told him to study hard

497
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,200
so that he can get into
the same university as Wang Manyu.

498
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,240
That's his best chance.

499
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,880
Shen Xiaojun...

500
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,160
Can he do it?

501
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,319
Of course he can.

502
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,799
He got excited once he heard it.

503
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:07,440
He didn't sleep during tutoring today.

504
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,759
Good, showing some backbone.

505
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,440
Did you bring the stationery?

506
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,760
Here it is.

507
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,559
(Dear Shen Cheng.)

508
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:23,279
(It's hard to describe my feelings,)

509
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:24,319
(but I believe)

510
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,640
(something miraculous
must have happened.)

511
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,119
(Tang Yixun is now my closest person.)

512
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,599
(Please trust he would never harm me.)

513
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,880
(Why would you say that?)

514
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:37,079
(Can you tell me in 2026,)

515
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:38,279
(what we'll be like?)

516
00:27:38,839 --> 00:27:40,079
(One more thing.)

517
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:42,279
(Is your grandmother Wu Fengying?)

518
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,480
I'll ask him something, too.

519
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,799
(What's your dad's name?)
Asking this?

520
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:56,000
I need to clarify it.

521
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,279
You turned your back on me.

522
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,440
Why?

523
00:28:04,999 --> 00:28:05,839
It's nothing.

524
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:07,519
Just casually asking about the future.

525
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:13,568
(Is he good to your mom?)

526
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,240
Done.

527
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:20,359
It's not time yet.

528
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:21,519
I'll put it in.

529
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:23,160
It'll be sent when the time comes.

530
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:39,639
W-What's wrong?

531
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,800
Tell me.

532
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:46,160
If the future turns out
different from what we imagined,

533
00:28:46,839 --> 00:28:48,599
can we still change it?

534
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:51,039
Of course we can.

535
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:54,200
We're literally communicating
with people from the future.

536
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,160
What else is impossible?

537
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,319
Don't worry.

538
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,759
I won't let you marry Shen Xiaojun.

539
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,839
Your son will never
take the Shen surname.

540
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,399
Tang.

541
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,839
What does
your imagined future look like?

542
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,119
In my imagined future,

543
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,720
by 2026,

544
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,960
we'd be in our fifties.

545
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,200
We'd have traveled to many places

546
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,640
and done countless things we wanted.

547
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,240
If we have no regrets,

548
00:29:34,759 --> 00:29:36,559
then life is well-lived.

549
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:37,399
What about you?

550
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:38,480
Ever thought about it?

551
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,040
I...

552
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:42,279
I want to stay with you

553
00:29:43,599 --> 00:29:45,079
and go wherever you want to go

554
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:46,880
and do whatever you want to do.

555
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,920
And I'll have no regrets.

556
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:58,279
If we finish what we want to do

557
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:00,640
by 50,

558
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,079
what will we do

559
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:03,279
with all the remaining time?

560
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,200
We'll just keep looking at each other.

561
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:13,599
Honestly, seeing you makes me happy.

562
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,000
Looking at each other.

563
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,279
Looking at each other.

564
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:42,799
Who are you looking for?

565
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:46,240
I'm Shen Xiaojun's father.

566
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,080
Shen Dashan.

567
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:53,759
Take this money.

568
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,480
Sir, we can't accept this.

569
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,680
Is your mother Wu Fengying?

570
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,759
Your mom and I are old friends,

571
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:05,640
so I'm your elder.

572
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,799
When elders give you money,

573
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,359
you must accept it.

574
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,880
You know my mom?

575
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,599
More than just knowing.

576
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,759
We are friends.

577
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,200
Your mom was such a good person.

578
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,599
When did you meet?

579
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:17,839
When I first came to Meiwan,

580
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,440
I was just a reckless kid then.

581
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,160
Determined to make it big.

582
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,400
But I had no real skills.

583
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,680
So I got bold.

584
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,640
The Fenghua Sugar Factory
was huge, right?

585
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,799
I thought there must be cash.

586
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,519
I planned to steal some money there.

587
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,839
Fate's funny.

588
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,559
Your mom was on duty that day.

589
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,680
She caught me red-handed.

590
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
She guarded the door fiercely,

591
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,280
telling me,

592
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,079
"Leave the money

593
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,759
and you can go free."

594
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,599
Just then, security showed up.

595
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,079
I thought, oh no.

596
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,480
I was caught with the money.

597
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,320
Right?

598
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,839
But then,

599
00:31:54,359 --> 00:31:57,599
your mom quietly put the money away

600
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,240
and told security

601
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,480
I was her cousin
picking her up from work.

602
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,000
So,

603
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,400
your mom was my savior.

604
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,440
But my mom...

605
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,119
She later took money from the factory.

606
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,440
When I first heard about this,

607
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
I simply couldn't believe it.

608
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,920
As my business grew more successful,

609
00:32:24,279 --> 00:32:26,160
I invited her to work at my company.

610
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:27,960
The pay would be much better,

611
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,039
but she refused.

612
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,119
I told her,

613
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,119
"If you face trouble,

614
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:33,319
come to me and I'll help however I can."

615
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,200
But she never asked me for anything.

616
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,760
All these years,

617
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,079
she's only accepted
two tins of malted milk.

618
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,000
Malted milk?

619
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:45,599
No, no. Just take this malted milk.

620
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:47,200
Mom.

621
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,240
My mom rode in your car back then.

622
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,599
You gave her that malted milk.

623
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,800
Right.

624
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,440
That was my fault.

625
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,880
Once,

626
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,880
she asked me
to get her two boat tickets.

627
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,759
Something must have happened to her.

628
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:06,240
If only I'd asked for more details...

629
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,599
My mother asked you
to buy two boat tickets?

630
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,599
When did that happen?

631
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,599
I don't recall the exact time.

632
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:14,519
But not long after she asked me,

633
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,559
that thing occurred.

634
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,079
I wasn't there,

635
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,240
but I specifically arranged for
someone to meet her at the dock.

636
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,640
I had supplies ready for her.

637
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:24,640
But they told me

638
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:26,759
your mom didn't board.

639
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,240
I returned a few days later and went

640
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:30,839
to your house to see your dad.

641
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,039
I arrived just as loan sharks
were cornering him.

642
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,359
He gambled

643
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:38,000
and lost over 1,000 in one night,

644
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,400
but he kept going

645
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,839
and borrowed more trying to win big.

646
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:43,400
So I...

647
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,680
I paid off his gambling debts.

648
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,400
1,000 yuan loss?

649
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,319
That was a huge sum

650
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,960
back then.

651
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,359
Living with him all these years,

652
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,039
you must've suffered plenty.

653
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,319
Tang

654
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,720
has already cut ties with him.

655
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,599
Good move.

656
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,080
From now on,

657
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,599
if you ever need help,

658
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:08,719
come to me.

659
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:10,599
Thank you.

660
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:12,320
- Nothing.
- Thank you.

661
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,440
But we really can't take

662
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,039
this money.

663
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,120
We really can't.

664
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,200
Alright.

665
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,720
Your mother

666
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,079
saved me once.

667
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,280
And you two

668
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,519
saved my son.

669
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,280
Our family owes you.

670
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,720
Truly.

671
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,920
Whatever difficulties you face,

672
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,440
just tell me.

673
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,320
We're family now.

674
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,320
What are you doing?

675
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,760
Xun.

676
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,999
Something's wrong.

677
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:46,999
What is it?

678
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,000
He said Ye Yibo lost 1,000 yuan.

679
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,599
How did he get that much?

680
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,440
Gamblers are all the same.

681
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,199
Flush with cash today,

682
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,599
broke tomorrow.

683
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,119
That director told my family

684
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:04,039
my mom stole
a large sum from the factory.

685
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,679
So you think

686
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,360
Ye Yibo's gambling money

687
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,159
was the same money your mom took?

688
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,320
I never believed my mom stole money

689
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,400
and ran off with someone.

690
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,199
She wasn't that type.

691
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,119
She asked for two tickets.

692
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:18,840
She must've wanted to take me.

693
00:35:55,328 --> 00:35:57,632
(Pushui, Ning'an)

694
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,280
Fengying!

695
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:14,280
Wu Fengying!

696
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,000
Coming.

697
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,480
Fengying, listen.

698
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,519
The director said

699
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:21,119
the supply cash arrived early.

700
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,920
He wants all accounts sorted

701
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,199
and cash brought
to the office before 11:00 AM.

702
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,320
11:00 AM today?

703
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,280
Not at the end of the month?

704
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,239
Who could've known?

705
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:31,159
The notice is issued.

706
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,559
Don't be late at 11:00 AM.

707
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:33,399
I'm leaving now.

708
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:02,280
Hurry up. We're late.

709
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:07,079
My girl.

710
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:09,719
What's the matter?

711
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,960
Do you want fish cakes?

712
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,480
I will go to Shiqiao
to buy you fish cakes today.

713
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,119
Remember to hide the fish cakes well.

714
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,639
Keep them all for yourself.

715
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,760
Got it?

716
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,000
Stop dawdling. We're late.

717
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,079

I used to blame her in my heart.

738
00:40:06,679 --> 00:40:08,800
Why couldn't she have waited longer?

she must have encountered trouble.

it was Ye Yibo?

Ye Yibo must have seen
my mom before she left.

743
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:19,840
He stole the money my mom took.

744
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,160
No.

745
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,599
It might not have been taken by my mom.

746
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,000
Ye Yibo told people

747
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,039
my mom stole the money

748
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:26,960
and left with a man.

749
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,000
He lied.

750
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:29,399
Tang.

751
00:40:31,239 --> 00:40:32,280
Don't worry.

752
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll go

753
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,280
confront him.

754
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,800
He won't admit it.

755
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:41,440
We have no evidence.

756
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,920
Did you look for your mom?

757
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:49,960
I did.

758
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:51,800
Whenever possible,

759
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,440
I'd ask about her whereabouts.

760
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,360
But nobody knows anything.

761
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,680
It's okay.

762
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:05,800
Wherever your mom went,

763
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:08,440
it's better than staying with Ye Yibo.

764
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:11,079
When you get into college,

765
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,000
we'll search together.

766
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,000
When we find her,

767
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,880
the truth will come out.

768
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,239
If that money

769
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,079
was indeed taken by Ye Yibo,

770
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:22,320
we'll report him

771
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:24,519
to clear your mom's name.

772
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:26,959
Don't worry.

773
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
You'll reunite.

774
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,119
(Tinghua)
Shen Cheng!

775
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,320
Shen Cheng!

776
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,119
Zhang Quan called.

777
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,280
We only have three days.

778
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,800
Come in and call him back.

779
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,320
Quan.

780
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:52,479
Zhang Quan.

781
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,280
Which company wants to remove it?

782
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,840
The Lingda Corporation.

783
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,960
They bought the land for redevelopment.

784
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,599
Not targeting the mailbox.

785
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,639
It'll all be demolished.

786
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:02,000
Got their leader's contact?

787
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:02,840
I'll talk with him.

788
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,800
I only have
our security leader's number.

789
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,880
He's just an employee.

790
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,800
He's probably no help.

791
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,760
Then find out more.

792
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,719
I'll try, but don't get your hopes up.

793
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:12,800
You better come back quickly.

794
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,559
Only Sun Miaomiao and I are here.

795
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:16,440
She stands there all day
with her big belly,

796
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,360
arguing with anyone.

797
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:18,719
We're completely passive.

798
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,960
Quan.

799
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,079
Please hold the fort for us.

800
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:22,320
We're coming back immediately.

801
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,199
Holding on. Hurry back.

802
00:42:24,199 --> 00:42:25,039
Alright.

803
00:42:25,759 --> 00:42:26,599
What are you doing?

804
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:28,719
Who are you people?
You can't go over there!

805
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,800
Quan.

806
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,720
Quan.

807
00:42:32,639 --> 00:42:33,479
No.

808
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,000
We need to hurry back.

809
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,280
We must tell them everything

810
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,679
before the mailbox is gone.

811
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,079
If they know in advance,

812
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:40,559
none of this will happen.

813
00:42:43,399 --> 00:42:44,920
What are you doing? Pack your stuff!

814
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:45,760
No time left.

815
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,840
Hurry up and pack.

816
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,599
Come on, pack your bag.

817
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:16,559
Waiting downstairs.

818
00:43:24,352 --> 00:43:27,936
(Waterspout Airport)

819
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:33,039
Got your ID on you?

820
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,439
Hello?

821
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:41,399
They found my dad.

822
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,280
Bed 63.

823
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,440
The investigation

824
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,039
has temporarily ruled him out.

825
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:48,000
You can go see him now.

826
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:50,000
Where did you find him?

827
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:50,880
How's he now?

828
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:51,800
Is he injured?

829
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:52,840
Initially,

830
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,280
we got a report from a cemetery.

831
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,840
An old man had been staying there,

832
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,760
refusing to leave.

833
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,000
When we arrived,

834
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,159
his condition was critical.

835
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:00,760
We rushed him to the ER for rescue.

836
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:01,840
Why rescue?

837
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,760
What happened to him?

838
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,039
Don't worry.

839
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,400
He's conscious now.

840
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,599
Why didn't they report earlier?

841
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,559
They said he visited
every year around this time,

842
00:44:11,559 --> 00:44:13,079
but this year, for some reason,

843
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:13,960
he refused to leave.

844
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
No persuasion worked.

845
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:15,999
It's okay.

846
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,320
Dad, it's fine now.

847
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,199
I'm here.

848
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:19,880
There's much I want to tell you.

849
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,360
It's all over now.

850
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:22,639
It's alright.

851
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:25,239
Where's Bed 63?

852
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,480
What happened?

853
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,360
I left briefly for medication,
and he vanished.
