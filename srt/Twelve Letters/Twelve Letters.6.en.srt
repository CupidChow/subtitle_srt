(2026, Beixing City)

2
00:00:19,879 --> 00:00:20,480
Let me do it.

3
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,800
Be careful.

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,280
Thank you.

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:23,679
Nothing.

6
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:24,800
It's nothing.

7
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,880
Thank you.

8
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,519
Kitty, don't run away.

9
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:27,760
Kitty, don't run away.

10
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,439
Where's the kitten?

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,200
Where's the kitten?

12
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:41,952

15
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,520
I always thought

16
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,240
these writings
came from genuine emotions.

17
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,599
Now that you mention it,

18
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,199
they do mirror our current situation.

19
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,680
Look,

20
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,159
daily fights and debt collection,

21
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,520
living in constant fear,

22
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,879
like weeds by the roadside.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,800
I really miss...

24
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,560
2026.

25
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll be in my fifties.

26
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:13,360
Why would I write this to you?

27
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,840
This is so bizarre.

28
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,560
No.

29
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:27,879
I need to figure this out.

30
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,520
Why did it happen suddenly?

31
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:38,960
It all started with
that mailbox appearing.

32
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,719
After that mailbox showed up,

33
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,479
the love letter came,

34
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,280
then my suicide note,

35
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,800
Yu Nian's reply...

36
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,120
That mailbox is the key.

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,439
Where did that mailbox come from?

38
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,439
An old man collecting scrap.

39
00:03:57,479 --> 00:03:58,680
He pulled a flatbed cart

40
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:01,479
with that mailbox on it.

41
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,039
Not sure if it's the same one

42
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:04,080
we know now.

43
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,560
But the day after he left,

44
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,840
the mailbox appeared.

45
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,719
An old man with a cart?

46
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,199
Was his hair gray?

47
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:15,599
Yes.

48
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,319
And very thin?

49
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,319
Extremely thin.

50
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:18,000
With a cat?

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,560
Yes.

52
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,959
I saw him at your doorstep, too.

53
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,560
Pulling a cart

54
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
with a mailbox on it.

55
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,319
Also red-colored.

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,759
Strange. Why aren't we getting letters?

57
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,279
Maybe the time has passed?

58
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,720
No longer September on their end?

59
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,519
But if they don't reply,

60
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,439
we won't have

61
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:56,360
stationery to write on.

62
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,079
If the time over there

63
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,240
has pasted September 23rd,

64
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,120
what would they reply?

65
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,480
They'd call us scammers.

66
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,319
So it must not be

67
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:08,800
the time on their end.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,279
Don't worry. Let's wait longer.

69
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,480
When will we get replies then?

70
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:15,920
This defies all logic.

71
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,759
There's no clear timeline at all.

72
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Now you believe in science.

73
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:28,959
Officer Hu?

74
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,120
We just got word.

75
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,959
Near a gas station in Wangjialing,

76
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:32,759
a car was found.

77
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,120
An elder with dementia was inside.

78
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:35,319
It's perhaps your father.

79
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:36,519
Go check immediately.

80
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:37,839
Okay. I'm coming now.

81
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,839
Seems they found my dad.

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:39,839
Found who?

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,360
My father.

84
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,519
Quan,

85
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,639
do you have a car?

86
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,040
Your dad?

87
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,079
An old man,

88
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,600
thin with gray hair.

89
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
Pulling a cart

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,040
with a cat.

91
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,439
Probably a scrap collector.

92
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,079
A cat?

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,360
I've never seen anyone matching that.

94
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,680
Fully Gray-haired.

95
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:00,879
Nope.

96
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,279
No one that old here.

97
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,519
Any other recycling plants

98
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,360
nearby?

99
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,079
Mine's the only one in town.

100
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,800
I've never seen that person.

101
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,959
Try somewhere else.

102
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,120
Thank you.

103
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,600
I regularly sell paper scraps.

104
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,920
It's always been that middle-aged man.

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,160
I only saw that old man once.

106
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,199
Maybe that old man

107
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,240
doesn't live in our town?

108
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,160
Both of us have seen him.

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,519
The letters in the mailbox
all have our names.

110
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,199
This whole thing
is definitely targeting us.

111
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,279
Honestly,

112
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:41,360
I still can't believe this is real.

113
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:43,160
Even if it is real,

114
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,959
what does that even prove?

115
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,839
If they really are from the future,

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,439
I want to ask them

117
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:52,759
if I can get into college

118
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,120
and leave Meiwan.

119
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,639
You don't need to ask them.

120
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,639
Just ask me.

121
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,959
You'll definitely get in.

122
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:04,160
What about you?

123
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,680
I just want to know

124
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:10,199
if you will be doing well in the future.

125
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,079
What about yourself?

126
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,839
I haven't thought much about it.

127
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,319
But I always feel like the future

128
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,600
can't be anything good.

129
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,759
Even if bad things happen,

130
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,399
knowing in advance helps us avoid them.

131
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,519
You have a point.

132
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,720
Who exactly is Yu Nian?

133
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,519
I think she

134
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,240
might not know our future selves.

135
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Hard to tell.

136
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,720
From the tone of her letter,

137
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,639
I can sense

138
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,800
this communication
is crucial for her too.

139
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,680
Somehow, I instinctively trust her.

140
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,040
Like that love letter.

141
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,600
It didn't feel fake.

142
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:06,120
The car for hauling vegetables.

143
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,680
Awesome.

144
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,879
Don't damage the vegetables.

145
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,519
Got it.

146
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,680
Drive slowly.

147
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,600
There are many narrow roads.

148
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,000
Watch out for big trucks.

149
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:14,199
Drive fast.

150
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,360
It's over 70 kilometers away.

151
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Be careful.

152
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,639
Let's talk when we're back.

153
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:20,800
Safe travels.

154
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,639
What are you doing?

155
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:30,199
I can't drive a manual.

156
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,320
Get out!

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,679
Why sit here if you can't drive?

158
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,039
Officer.

159
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:49,720
Officer.

160
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,720
Where's my dad?

161
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:51,519
In the car.

162
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,279
Dad.

163
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,039
Dad.

164
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:02,879
Not my father.

165
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,720
Not the one we're looking for.

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,879
Call 120.

167
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:07,600
On it.

168
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,360
Here.

169
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,480
It's cold.

170
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,240
Is my dad like that old man,

171
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,879
unable to say his own name

172
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:14,519
or where his home is?

173
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,279
On such a cold day,

174
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,840
is he dressed warmly enough?

175
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,559
Where did he go?

176
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,720
What if something happened?

177
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,840
Why did I argue with him?

178
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,200
Why did I have to argue with him?

179
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,879
Dad.

180
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
Where are you, Dad?

181
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,240
Why did I argue with him?

182
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,080
Dad.

183
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:02,440
Where are you, Dad?

184
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,639
Where are you, Dad?

185
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,519
It's so lively here.

186
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:42,879
Cha.

187
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,320
What are you here for?

188
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,120
Bao's worried about you guys.

189
00:11:57,399 --> 00:11:58,480
He sent me to check in.

190
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,559
We brought fruits.

191
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,320
Hope you don't mind

192
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
if we share some fruits.

193
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,559
He's too kind. You can leave.

194
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,559
Cha.

195
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,279
Why say that?

196
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,919
This little shop

197
00:12:16,919 --> 00:12:18,240
isn't worth continuing.

198
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,639
Bao said it.

199
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:21,639
We'll let bygones be bygones.

200
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,879
We're still in the same boat together.

201
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,399
Let's keep making money.

202
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,399
We're just battered soldiers now

203
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,879
and can't board your boat.

204
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:32,240
We don't want to hold you back.

205
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,919
You're complaining
we went too hard on you?

206
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,320
My leg's still lame.

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,000
I didn't blame you.

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,120
You don't understand?

209
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,879
Fine.

210
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,320
Let me put it simpler.

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,639
From now on,
we'll just run the pool hall

212
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:52,559
to make a living.

213
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,600
Your business has nothing to do with us.

214
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,519
Clear?

215
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,799
Want to do legitimate business now?

216
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,440
Good.

217
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,600
I wish you a thriving business

218
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,759
and great prosperity

219
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:20,600
in advance.

220
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:27,440
Let's go.

221
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:29,799
Go, Fat Dog.

222
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:41,200
Enough.

223
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:47,639
Cha,

224
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,159
they really walk away like this?

225
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:53,879
We'll see.

226
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,799
At least, they can't force us.

227
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,200
Anyway, remember this.

228
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,519
Don't provoke them when you see them.

229
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:02,080
It's okay.

230
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,399
It's okay.

231
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:05,960
Back to work.

232
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,919
Xin.

233
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:18,759
Zhenzhu.

234
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,519
Miss Tan.

235
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,559
Have a seat.

236
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,080
You don't have to stand.

237
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,440
No. I'll just look around.

238
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,279
How about a drink?

239
00:14:44,679 --> 00:14:45,639
No, thanks. You sit.

240
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,879
I'll just say a little.

241
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,679
Sit.

242
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,720
Tang Yixun.

243
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,519
Miss Tan.

244
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,559
To return to school,

245
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:01,600
agree to two conditions.

246
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,320
I agree.

247
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,480
I haven't told you.

248
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,840
I'll accept anyway.

249
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:08,039
First,

250
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,960
study hard at school from now on.

251
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,759
Don't cause me any more trouble.

252
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:14,399
Tang promised me

253
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,320
she'd tutor you.

254
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,159
You two will improve together.

255
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
Deal. No problem.

256
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:21,519
Second,

257
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:24,879
no fighting outside school.

258
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,080
No associating

259
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,759
with punks.

260
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:28,960
If discovered,

261
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,799
instant expulsion.

262
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,679
Why are you looking at me?

263
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:45,840
I'm a decent person.

264
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,440
Do you accept?

265
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,440
Yes.

266
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:51,320
Good.

267
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,039
I told the school.

268
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,399
Come back tomorrow.

269
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

270
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,200
- Thanks.
- No problem.

271
00:15:58,039 --> 00:15:59,120
Carry on with your work.

272
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,840
I'm leaving.

273
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:00,919
Tang, tutor him.

274
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,559
Go home early.

275
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,360
Miss Tan.

276
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:05,519
Please stay.

277
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,039
Stay and try our boss's cooking.

278
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:09,879
He's an excellent cook.

279
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:10,840
Yes, Xin.

280
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,440
Stay and dine with us.

281
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,799
If it's good, eat a lot.

282
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,399
You and your silver tongue.

283
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,960
Spend time studying instead.

284
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,200
Xin.

285
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:25,360
Cha.

286
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:26,399
She's gone.

287
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,759
Long gone now.

288
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:29,519
What idiots!

289
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,919
Like I need your advice!

290
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,919
He's the shyest one.

291

Tang Yixun.

292
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:03,039
Didn't you go home to do homework?

293
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:05,920
Ye Yibo's back?

294
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,119
You're returning to school tomorrow.

295
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,400
I'll cut your hair.

296
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,480
Can you?

297
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,240
Of course I can.

298
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,279
I cut my own hair all the time.

299
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,079

and Ye Yibo.

349
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,160
Grandma left me the house.

350
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,119
She wanted me to sell it
after getting into college

351
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:47,359

352

You're different.

362
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,039
You'll get into college.

363

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
recognize myself anymore.

387
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,400
You did a great job.

388
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,559
Thanks.

389
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,319
If what the letter says
about the 23rd is true,

390
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:47,960
let's ask Yu Nian

391
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:49,799
if we can get into the same college.

392
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:52,640
That...

393
00:21:52,839 --> 00:21:54,119
No need to ask about this.

394
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:57,119
I won't get into your target university.

395
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,119
Another letter?

396
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:32,240
No.

397
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,960
This one's from me to you.

398
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,079
I'm going in.

399
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:40,920
Ye Haitang.

400
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,720
Tomorrow morning,

401
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,359
I'll pick you up.

402
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:48,759
Okay.

403
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,519
(To Tang Yixun)

404
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,119
(May we have the courage
to journey through mountains and seas)

405
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,440
(and the luck to witness the aurora.)

406
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:19,960
(Ye Haitang)

407
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:29,480
Ye Haitang.

408
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:31,920
Ye Haitang.

409
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:36,640
Ye Haitang.

410
00:25:25,632 --> 00:25:31,248
(Meiyu Building)

411
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,480
I bought this for you. Eat.

412
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:35,039
Got a haircut?

413
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,119
Wow.

414
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,119
I thought you'd dropped out.

415
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,480
You stepped on my shoes!

416
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:47,000
My bad.

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,720
I didn't see them.

418
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
That's all?

419
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,200
You know how much they cost?

420
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:50,920
The only pair!

421
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,960
You can't pay for them!

422
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,599
I can't,

423
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,359
so I won't.

424
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,799
And don't mess with me.

425
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:57,960
You can't handle me.

426
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,200
You're threatening me?

427
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,720
Shen Xiaojun,

428
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:04,920
listen,

429
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:06,799
from now on,

430
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,480
let's get along well at school,

431
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,839
so we can graduate smoothly.

432
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,960
But after school,

433
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,200
it's hard to tell.

434
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,319
This part is meant to scare you.

435
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:19,759
Remember this.

436
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,240
Has Ye Haitang not arrived?

437
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,759
She might be here soon.

438
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,119
Class dismissed.

439
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:44,559
Stand up.

440
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,880
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

441
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,720
Alright, goodbye.

442
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,200
Miss Tan.

443
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,359
Why didn't Ye Haitang come today?

444
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,079
She took a few sick days.

445
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:07,960
Sick leave?

446
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:09,720
What sick leave?

447
00:27:10,039 --> 00:27:10,960
Her dad requested it

448
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:11,839
this morning.

449
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:12,920
Her father?

450
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,519
Where are you going?

451
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,519
I'm taking leave, too.

452
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,680
It's your first day back today.

453
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,400
Tang Yixun!

454
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,519
Ye Haitang!

455
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:28,720
Ye Yibo!

456
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,400
Ye Yibo!

457
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:32,680
Ye Yibo!

458
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:47,720
Ye Yibo!

459
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:55,559
What's your problem?

460
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:56,440
Who? What's going on?

461
00:27:57,519 --> 00:27:58,119
Ye Yibo?

462
00:27:58,519 --> 00:27:59,200
Haven't seen him.

463
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,279
Was he here recently?

464
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,400
With unpaid debts

465
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,559
and new ones now,

466
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,240
how could he come?

467
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:05,720
Three against one?

468
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:06,839
This.

469
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,160
Hello.

470
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,640
Is this the Fenghua Sugar Factory?

471
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,319
May I speak to Ye Yibo?

472
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,119
I... I am...

473
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm his relative.

474
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,240
He's on leave?

475
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:21,839
When?

476
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:23,160
Okay.

477
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:23,960
Thank you.

478
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:30,039
Sir.

479
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:40,759
(Meiwan Police Station)

480
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:41,680
Take it easy.

481
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,319
Speak slowly.

482
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,440
What are you to Ye Haitang?

483
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,559
Classmate.

484
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:46,799
Classmate?

485
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,079
Yeah.

486
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,839
Does the school know

487
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:49,559
she's missing?

488
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,160
Her dad asked for leave,

489
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,440
but he's suspicious.

490
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,039
What's wrong with her father?

491
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:55,680
Give this to Liu.

492
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:56,319
Got it.

493
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:00,920
You are the girl's classmate

494
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
from last time, right?

495
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:02,720
Yes.

496
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:03,880
What's wrong?

497
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,440
He reported his classmate missing,

498
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,240
but

499
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,200
the parent already notified the school.

500
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,240
Same girl as before?

501
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:11,680
Yes.

502
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,240
Did her dad take her to the hospital?

503
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,559
They say she has delusions.

504
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,759
Treatable.

505
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,839
Many tell me to send her
to a psychiatric hospital.

506
00:29:28,599 --> 00:29:29,240
Mr. Chen!

507
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,920
Let me borrow your bike.

508
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:31,880
Let me use it.

509
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:32,759
Alright.

510
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,359
Calm down.

511
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:36,319
Return it tonight, Xun.

512
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:36,880
Okay.

513
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:40,680
Make way.

514
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:17,408
(Mental Rehabilitation Center)

515
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,799
Tang.

516
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,160
Don't blame me for being harsh.

517
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,519
It's for your own good.

518
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:26,880
They'll feed you.

519
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,039
Focus on getting better.

520
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:30,319
Wait till I sell the house

521
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,240
and win big.

522
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,160
I'll come back for you.

523
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:44,680
Tang.

524
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,119
We're here now.

525
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,039
Go along.

526
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,960
Let me untie you.

527
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,119
No more outbursts, okay?

528
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:51,240
Work with the doctors.

529
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,400
Stay still. Isn't this better?

530
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,559
I'm fine, really.

531
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,359
My child is ill.

532
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,319
Why hit me again?

533
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,400
It's okay.

534
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,160
My child is ill.

535
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,319
I'm here with you.

536
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,920
It's alright.

537
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:08,839
We're here.

538
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:09,400
We're here.

539
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,559
We're at the hospital.

540
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,240
Ye Haitang!

541
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:13,559
Ye Yibo!

542
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,359
We're here.

543
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Ye Yibo!

544
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,559
Raising your hand against me?

545
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:32,960
Ye Yibo!

546
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:34,759
Ye Yibo!

547
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,480
You're an animal!

548
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:40,960
You hit me?

549
00:31:42,759 --> 00:31:43,680
I'm her father!

550
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,160
I make the rules!

551
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:46,640
I'll do whatever I want!

552
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:47,680
You can't stop me!

553
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,400
Ye Yibo!

554
00:31:52,319 --> 00:31:53,279
What did she do wrong?

555
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,759
Why treat her like this?

556
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,920
She tried to stab me!

557
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,799
She tried to kill me!

558
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,039
To stab me to death!

559
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:04,519
Go ahead! Kill me!

560
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:09,759
Come on, Ye Yibo!

561
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,039
- Stop it!
- Stop!

562
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:13,880
No more fighting!

563
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,839
He will die!

564
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:15,640
Ye Yibo!

565
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:16,839
He will die!

566
00:32:17,319 --> 00:32:17,960
Let go!

567
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:19,480
Stop fighting!

568
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,160
Ye Yibo!

569
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,839
You beast!

570
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:23,720
Do it! Kill me!

571
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,640
Ye Yibo!

572
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,720
My own daughter tried to stab me!

573
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,799
She brought

574
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,799
this punk to kill me!

575
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Come on! Kill me!

576
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,759
Don't you run!

577
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,960
Stay right there!

578
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,799
You beast!

579
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:36,640
Ye Yibo!

580
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,400
Stop!

581
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,200
Don't run away!

582
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,240
Get lost!

583
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,559
Ye Haitang.

584
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:54,720
I'm sorry.

585
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,359
I'm sorry.

586
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:05,839
I'm sorry.

587
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,279
I'm sorry.

588
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:22,640
Let's go home.

589
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,599
Let's go home.

That monster.

601
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:03,519
You're his daughter.

602
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:04,440
How can he do that?

603
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,079
He resents my mom.

604
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,840
He said she was promiscuous

605
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,679
and seduced men.

606
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:13,519
Still want fish cakes?

607
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,639
It's too far.

608
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,320
I will make tomato egg noodles tonight.

609
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,639
Your mom will be back soon.

610
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,599
Mom.

611
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:46,800
Ye.

612
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,239
Why are you home today?

613
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,440
Day off today.

614
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,239
Coming back to cook.

615
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,280
Go ahead.

616
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:53,079
Alright.

617
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:01,920
Where are you going?

618
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,719
Explain yourself today!

619
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,159
You sold yourself
for a can of malted milk?

620
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:08,920
Mom.

621
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,960
Bo.

622
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,679
What are you doing now?

623
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,960
Mom, stay out of this!

624
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,519
Speak clearly!

625
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:14,960
Tang.

626
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,880
Mom!

627
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,760
Let's go.

628
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,719
Mom!

629
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:19,239
I saw it today.

630
00:36:19,559 --> 00:36:21,559
You got out of his car
at the alley entrance.

631
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:22,880
Have you no shame?

632
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,039
All for a can of malted milk?

633
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,840
Ye Yibo, stop talking nonsense.

634
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:28,920
We're just ordinary friends.

635
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,400
He gave me this just to show

636
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,079
his gratitude.

637
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:32,719
Mom!

638
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:33,920
Was it that man?

639
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,639
The malted one?

640
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,480
Is it him?

641
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,079
Ye Yibo, stop talking nonsense!

642
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:40,000
Out with it!

643
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:44,840
Mom, I'm home.

644
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:46,039
Give me your dress.

645
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:47,719
Who paid for it?

646
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:48,760
I bought it.

647
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,960
But I've never seen it.

648
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,280
I bought it.

649
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,239
Where did you get the money to buy this?

650
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:57,360
Who gave you the money?

651
00:36:58,119 --> 00:36:59,400
Who paid for this?

652
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,239
Who?

653
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,559
I saved it myself.

654
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:03,400
Mom.

655
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,199
You seduced another man, right?

656
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:06,199
Who did you seduce?

657
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:06,920
Get inside!

658
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,519
Mom!

659
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:10,360
Explain yourself!

660
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,079
Go out with me.

661
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:11,760
Go, hurry.

662
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,159
Which man did you seduce this time?

663
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,079
I didn't.

664
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,559
Go.

665
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,519
Mom.

666
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:16,280
You didn't?

667
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,400
My mom wasn't that kind of person.

668
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,239
He's the mentally ill one.

669
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,719
Whenever my mom spoke to other men,

670
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:23,760
he'd fly into rage.

671
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:25,639
Later, he gambled.

672
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:27,639
When he lost,

673
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,199
he'd come home
and beat my mom even worse

674
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,960
until she couldn't bear it

675
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,039
and ran away from home.

676
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,760
He couldn't find her,

677
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:40,079
so he took his anger out on me.

678
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,039
Didn't the factory leaders intervene?

679
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:43,760
Didn't you

680
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,119
think about talking to them?

681
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,599
They worked at the same place.

682
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,199
My mom was the cashier.

683
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,880
She took the factory funds
when she left.

684
00:37:58,599 --> 00:37:59,519
Ye Yibo cried and said

685
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:00,840
he'd repay this money.

686
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,400
The factory leaders were moved.

687
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,559
Tang, it's still hot.

688
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:06,559
Wait for it to cool down.

689
00:38:09,559 --> 00:38:10,599
I don't mind,

690
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,760
but she needs to eat.

691
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,039
Ye.

692
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:17,519
This isn't a small amount of money.

693
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:18,679
Director Wei,

694
00:38:18,679 --> 00:38:19,840
I'll repay this money.

695
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,360
I've discussed it with Secretary Liu.

696
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,719
I'll write an IOU.

697
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:25,280
Deduct it from my wages later.

698
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,360
I won't default.

699
00:38:26,519 --> 00:38:28,480
Then how will you and your family eat?

700
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,239
No, I...

701
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,039
I can manage the hardships.

702
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,039
Tang and I eat simply.

703
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,679
Just let me keep a little

704
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:36,800
for my mom's medical bills.

705
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,679
There's been no news
of Wu Fengying at all?

706
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:44,480
Her hometown relatives are all gone.

707
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:47,159
I don't know where to look for her.

708
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,159
How about this?

709
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Write me an IOU.

710
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:51,719
If you can repay the money,

711
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:53,599
the factory won't press charges.

712
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:57,639
Director Wei,
I'll definitely repay this.

713
00:38:58,199 --> 00:38:59,800
I'll come to your office tomorrow.

714
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:00,360
Thank you.

715
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,079
I'll be going.

716
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,320
Take care of the child.

717
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,000
Goodbye, Ye.

718
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,679
Take care.

719
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,599
He never spoke ill of my mom

720
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,239
in front of others.

721
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:46,159
He always said it was his poverty

722
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,920
that made her suffer so much.

723
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,400
All these years, everyone

724
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,440
saw him repaying

725
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,880
the debts, raising me through hardships,

726
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:59,559
and caring for
my grandma in the hospital.

727
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,360
When the sugar factory caught fire,

728
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,719
he rushed into the flames alone,

729
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,920
saving over a dozen people.

730
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:11,800
The factory paraded in with an award.

731
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:14,119
He stood in the hall,

732
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,199
wearing a red flower,

733
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:16,920
solemnly vowing to be

734
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,960
a just and courageous man.

735
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,519
Whenever my neighbors needed help,

736
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:23,360
if he was home,

737
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,360
he'd assist them.

738
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:27,199
Those who tried matchmaking for him

739
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:28,280
all got turned down.

740
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,360
He said he'd not let me be mistreated

741
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:31,440
by a stepmother.

742
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,599
I told people Ye Yibo was a bad person.

743
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,280
Who'd believe that?

744
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:47,360
Scum.

745
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,360
Worse than an animal.

746
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,519
Every time I fought back,

747
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,639
it only made things worse for me.

748
00:41:00,159 --> 00:41:01,920
I ran out and told people many times,

749
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,079
but he always claimed
I was mentally ill.

750
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,480
He even consulted doctors

751
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,679
and learned a term called

752
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:08,840
delusional disorder.

753
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,760
Everyone said my mom ran away.

754
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:12,039
I was insane.

755
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,239
Since childhood,

756
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:19,840
I've never seen my father.

757
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,280
My mom told me then

758
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:26,960
she'd go find my dad

759
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,519
and come get me when she found him.

760
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:32,800
But after that day,

761
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,960
I never saw her again.

762
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,039
I was only 4 years old then.

763
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,280
I was in our house,

764
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,480
nearly starving to death.

765
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:50,719
Then I went out

766
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,679
to scavenge food from trash bins.

767
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:03,960
Later on,

768
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:05,880
I got sent to an orphanage.

769
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,360
My parents left me nothing.

770
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,599
Not even a proper name.

771
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,199
I only knew myself as Xun.

772
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,559
My current name

773
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,960
was given by Chubby Auntie
at the orphanage.

774
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,039
Chubby Auntie is Miss Tan's mother.

775
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,159
That was when I realized

776
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,639
my birth parents

777
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,159
never cared about me at all.

778
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:52,039
So whether I become a wolf

779
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,199
or a dog,

780
00:42:55,159 --> 00:42:56,519
I have to survive.

781
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:01,559
Did you ever go back to search?

782
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:04,639
Maybe your mom
came back looking for you?

783
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,199
Of course I went back.

784
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,440
But the old house had collapsed.

785
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,400
She never came back at all.

786
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,519
Without Chubby Auntie,

787
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:20,736
I would have starved to death.

788
00:43:22,519 --> 00:43:24,559
No wonder Miss Tan
worries about you so much.

789
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:31,119
Both Miss Tan and Chubby Auntie

790
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,320
have always told me

791
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:34,960
to study hard

792
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:36,599
and gain more knowledge,

793
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,239
so I could succeed in the future.

794
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:42,719
But I did study hard.

795
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,920
My classmates all looked down on me.

796
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:49,880
They called me a stray dog

797
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,840
and threw my books in the toilet.

798
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,039
I couldn't take it,

799
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:56,480
so I fought back.

800
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,280
Then I got sent to reform school.

801
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,079
Xin never gave up on me.

802
00:44:08,239 --> 00:44:08,920
Through her,

803
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,280
I met Cha.

804
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,719
But Xin always thought

805
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,119
Cha was a bad influence.

806
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:17,079
She felt guilty about it

807
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,800
and kept pushing me to return to school

808
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,880
and focus on studies.

809
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,960
Were they together before?

810
00:44:25,559 --> 00:44:26,039
Yes.

811
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:28,960
Xin used

812
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,639
to attend a normal college in the city.

813
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:33,199
Cha would bike

814
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:34,360
to visit her every week.

815
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,760
Riding a bicycle

816
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:37,960
for five or six hours.

817
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:40,559
But later,

818
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,119
Xin thought Cha took the wrong path

819
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:45,800
and was crooked,

820
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,039
so they broke up.

821
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:57,719
Cha isn't that bad.

822
00:44:58,639 --> 00:44:59,119
Right?

823
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,840
He's a good person.

824
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:07,440
He just never got proper schooling.

825
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
He's uncultured,

826
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:10,480
so he

827
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,039
couldn't find decent work.

828
00:45:14,039 --> 00:45:16,360
He can only do what he knows how to do.

829
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,519
Same with Rat.

830
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:19,840
He's not bad.

831
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,079
His dad was a murderer.

832
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,480
When his dad got locked up,

833
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,599
he and his mom
became outcasts in the village.

834
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:38,400
His mom couldn't take the bullying

835
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,840
and killed herself.

836
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,239
As for Rat,

837
00:45:51,239 --> 00:45:53,360
he's lived feeling ashamed,

838
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:55,039
like he's inferior to others,

839
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,280
so he doesn't go to school.

840
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,880
Just wandering around.

841
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:08,159
Why are there
so many unfortunate people in the world?

842
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:13,159
Living like weeds,

843
00:46:13,159 --> 00:46:14,760
easy to be crushed underfoot.

844
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:22,920
You asked me before

845
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,880
why I grabbed your knife.

846
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:32,960
No reason.

847
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:35,599
Just to help you.

848
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:37,320
I wanted you to live.

849
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,039
We hopeless folks

850
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:44,960
are still hanging on.

851
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,199
You did nothing wrong.

852
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,360
And you've tried so hard.

853
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:54,320
So you deserve to live well.

854
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,519
Thank you

855
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,159
for keeping me alive.

856
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,599
When I was injured before,

857
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,360
you kicked at my door.

858
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,440
Seeing how worried you looked

859
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,159
made me think

860
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:23,239
this must be
what having family felt like.

861
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:31,960
Ye Haitang.

862
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:38,159
I want to be your family,

863
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,360
if you let me.

864
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,199
Let's live well.

865
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,320
Okay.

866
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,360
We'll live well.

867
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:58,639
Okay.

868
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,079
Live well.

869
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:04,519
Live well.

870
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,719
Millet porridge.

871
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:29,480
Any else?

872
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:32,159
Corn.

873
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:44,840
Seek for.

874
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:46,519
Both mean "seeking".

875
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:47,400
What's the difference?

876
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,840
"In search of"

877
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,199
means seeking hard.

878
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:52,000
It emphasizes the active effort.

879
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,199
What follows it?

880
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:55,320
In search of a job.

881
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,320
Or what you all crave.

882
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,639
In search of freedom.

883
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,960
After the examination,
you'll all be free.

884
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:05,119

By Euclidean geometry,

911
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:02,039
AC squared equals AD multiplied by AB.

912
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:04,320
Given AD is 3 units

913
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,679
and AB is 4 units,

914
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:09,079
so AC squared is 3 multiplied by 4.

915
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,679
So x squared equals 12,

916
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,440

00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,480
Is it tomorrow or the day after?

961
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,400
Or beyond?

962
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,199
Just not today.

963
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:21,960
Look!

964
00:52:22,119 --> 00:52:23,079
There's a dragon!

965
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:24,960
Such a huge dragon!

966
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:26,159
What's going on?

967
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,320
Have you ever seen this before?

968
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:42,960
(Hello, Yu Nian,)

969
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:44,039
(at our local dock,)

970
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:45,800
(a waterspout phenomenon did occur.)

971
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,840
(Now is)

972
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:48,920
(September 23rd, 1991.)

973
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,360
(I can't believe I'm writing)

974
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,000
(to a person from 2026.)

975
00:53:53,639 --> 00:53:55,280
(I did receive a letter,)

976
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,760
(but it wasn't from Yu Zhiyong.)

977
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,000
(And I don't know him.)

978
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:00,440
(I'm sorry the letter was already torn.)

979
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,519
(I don't know where Beixing City is.)

980
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,199
(At midnight,)

981
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,760
(when a cat jumps
onto the mailbox, letters arrive.)

982
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,280
(Please explain what all this means.)

983
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:10,440
(Ye Haitang)

984
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:11,519
(1991)

985
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:12,639
(September 23rd)

986
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:15,440
Are you sure

987
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:17,719
she's your mother?

988
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,280
I can't confirm yet.

989
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,280
She mentioned receiving a letter before,

990
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,119
but it wasn't from your father.

991
00:54:31,159 --> 00:54:31,960
Exactly.

992
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:33,960
How could my dad write a love letter?

993
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,239
The mailbox connects two timelines.

994
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,960
May be others also discovered it.

995
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,280
We aren't the only ones.

996
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:48,480
Maybe others are doing the same?

997
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:49,239
Or perhaps

998
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,599
not just two mailboxes?

999
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,000
You mean it could be crossed?

1000
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:55,559
Right.

1001
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:57,480
So perhaps

1002
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,039
others could join this correspondence.

1003
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:02,239
If that's really the case,

1004
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:03,599
things just got more complicated.

1005
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:06,920
I need to first

1006
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,079
confirm if she is my mom.

1007
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,360
Stay out of this reply.

1008
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:13,239
Why?

1009
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:14,880
Even now,

1010
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,679
you don't trust me?

1011
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,239
I apologize for doubting you before.

1012
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:20,960
I hope you understand how I felt then.

1013
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,760
To verify if the sender

1014
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,960
is truly Ye Haitang,

1015
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:25,440
I'll ask something

1016
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,880
only my mom and I would know.

1017
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,800
So I'll write this letter alone.

1018
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,119
I'll mail it myself.

1019
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,199
Okay?

1020
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:36,559
Fine.

1021
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:56,599
Coming!

1022
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,800
Well? Did it work?

1023
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,639
Did it work?

1024
00:56:10,599 --> 00:56:11,880
Explain what happened.

1025
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,320
I'm going to Pushui.

1026
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:15,760
They found my mom.
