00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,290
(Meiwan Town, 1991)

2
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:30,600
(Grandma,)

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,039
(I'm going to join you.)

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,799
(I really can't hold on any longer.)

5
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,920
(I've tried so hard,)

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,520
(exhausting every possible method.)

7
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,280
(But I can never escape Meiwan Town)

8
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,079
(or get away from him.)

9
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,920
(I'm so tired.)

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,039
(I only have this last bit
of strength left.)

11
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,520
(So I chose this path.)

12
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,920
(Right now, I don't even know
whom to say goodbye to.)

13
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,320
(Then let it be
my nineteen-year-old self.)

14
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,439
(If my life could start over,)

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,560
(I wish
I could have a chance to choose.)

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,359
(To Ye Haitang, September 3, 1991)

17
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,040
(Goodbye.)

18
00:01:19,089 --> 00:01:23,565
(Beixing City, 2026)

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,840
Who's it? What are you doing?

20
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:54,480
Stop!

21
00:01:57,239 --> 00:01:58,560
I can see you.

22
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,560
Listen up.

23
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,400
This pitchfork here won't show mercy.

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,208

=Episode 1=
=The Letter Writer=

26
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,599
Sir,

27
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,719
if you come in daily and won't leave,

28
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll lose my job.

29
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,879
Have some pity on me, will you?

30
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,039
Just do your work.

31
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:15,719
What work?

32
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,439
My main job is keeping people
from wandering in,

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,560
specifically keeping you out.

34
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,759
I need to get you out.

35
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm just a security guard.

36
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,199
This job wasn't easy to get.

37
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:26,400
Go to my supervisor

38
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,479
if you need anything, okay?

39
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,599
Stop torturing me.

40
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,360
What's today's date?

41
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,919
Dunno. I can't remember either.

42
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,439
Want some?

43
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,088
We've known each other

44
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:41,879
for two months.

45
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,560
That counts as some friendship, right?

46
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:46,919
Be honest with me.

47
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,719
What are you doing

48
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:50,039
sitting here every day?

49
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:54,599
Waiting for a letter.

50
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,599
A letter?

51
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,039
You mean this?

52
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,919
It contains no letters.

53
00:04:00,919 --> 00:04:02,479
Nobody writes letters these days.

54
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:06,479
It's fake, isn't it?

55
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,800
What are you saying?

56
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:09,199
It's real!

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,120
Okay, it's real.

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,639
But they're closing for today.

59
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:14,840
Come mail tomorrow, okay?

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,599
You go ahead.

61
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:18,920
Fine.

62
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,199
Wait all you want then.

63
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,360
Go see a doctor.

64
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:24,639
Such a nuisance.

65
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,800
Ma'am, can you please
keep an eye on your dad?

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,639
They're tearing the place down.
No trespassing.

67
00:04:31,879 --> 00:04:33,639
My coworker and I
fought him this morning.

68
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:35,519
Just watch your dad, alright?

69
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:39,319
Let's go home.

70
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,720
I'm not going.

71
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,439
Let's go home, Dad. It's freezing.

72
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,600
It's not time yet.

73
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,560
What 'time'?

74
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:46,040
Come home with me.

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,240
Why?

76
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,079
Why did you come back here again?

77
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,560
You won't stop
until they call the police, will you?

78
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,920
Sir,

79
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,680
you're back.

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,360
I'm not moving.

81
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:01,600
Dad.

82
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,240
Sir, we agreed...

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,279
Let's talk.

84
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,439
I'm really sorry.

85
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:09,199
My dad just came from the hospital.

86
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,560
His heart's acting up bad.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
The doctor said it's serious.

88
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,600
Why's he
always 'back from the hospital'?

89
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,120
Yes.

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,680
Can you move out in the next few days?

91
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,319
My boss said...

92
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,360
We'll definitely move.

93
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,199
I bought the tickets already.
We'll move.

94
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,600
About the terms we agreed on,

95
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,920
I've sorted them out. Look.

96
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,560
Thank you.

97
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,199
Then sign here.

98
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:25,888
- Okay.
- The pen.

99
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,000
How about this?

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,360
Let me check with my dad first.

101
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560
Then I'll sign it immediately

102
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,560
and bring it to you.

103
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,439
I know it's been hard for you guys,

104
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,360
coming over here.

105
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,000
It's freezing cold today.

106
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,680
You guys head back to rest first.

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,560
Make it quick.

108
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,600
- Sure.
- This is urgent.

109
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,480
My dad needs his meds.

110
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,120
It's his heart.

111
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
Just wait.

112
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,600
Update me soon.

113
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,439
Absolutely.

114
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,439
Thanks. I appreciate it.

115
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,560
Here.

116
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,800
I need your ID card for the tickets.

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,439
Your ID card.

118
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:56,920
Fine.

119
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,120
Miaomiao,

120
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,920
can you get me a car?

121
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:10,399
My dad and I are going

122
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:11,120
to Beijing.

123
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,480
No need to be big.

124
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,319
Tomorrow or the day after.

125
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,199
Make it fast.

126
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:17,360
Thank you.

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
I'm not leaving.

128
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,560
Either

129
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,800
we go to Beijing,

130
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:25,680
or

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,480
we'll both stay in this dump

132
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,639
and rot here forever.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
I need to call Mingxiao

134
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,240
to have him talk to you.

135
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,560
Why call him?

136
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,879
I broke up with him ages ago.

137
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,560
Why?

138
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:39,439
Why?

139
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,839
Because he thought I was a burden.

140
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,560
You won't go to Beijing.

141
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
If anything happens here,

142
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,120
I have to rush back.

143
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,680
If you keep making a fuss,

144
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,560
I'll even lose my job in Beijing.

145
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,439
I'll take my meds.

146
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,279
Wait.

147
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:57,120
Why are you taking meds now?

148
00:06:57,439 --> 00:06:58,600
You refuse to see a doctor.

149
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,120
What good are these meds alone?

150
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,120
Yu Zhiyong,

151
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,680
let's settle this today.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,160
You keep saying
you're waiting for letters.

153
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,680
Who's actually writing to you?

154
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,800
Not waiting.

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,360
I'm sending letters.

156
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm sending letters.

157
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,800
I'm done with your nonsense.

158
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,240
Tomorrow,

159
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,360
we're leaving.

160
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:19,600
No delay.

161
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,000
Nian,

162
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:21,920
I take the meds.

163
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,560
Go away.

164
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,360
The meds.

165
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,759
The meds.

166
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,600
The meds.

167
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,240
I'm taking the meds.

168
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,879
Miaomiao.

169
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,639
10 AM works.

170
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,079
Send me the driver's number.

171
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,560
Don't come.

172
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,959
We'll move by ourselves.

173
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,800
I'll message you when we reach Beijing.

174
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,240
Dad,

175
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
what would you like?

176
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,200
Dad,

177
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:47,360
you...

178
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,000
Where did you go?

179
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,639
(I don't want to leave.)

180
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,799
(I don't want to burden you)

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,320
(or make you angry.)

182
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,840
(For me, this illness)

183
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,320
(is not all bad.)

184
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,639
(I need to do something important.)

185
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,320
(When it's done,)

186
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,200
(I'll come back on my own.)

187
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,960
This is my dad.

188
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,440
Officer, this is my dad.

189
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
See? I told you
he was still at the factory.

190
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:30,919
Let's keep searching.

191
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,799
Wait, are you sure it's him

192
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,039
just from that back view?

193
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:35,039
I'm sure.

194
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,440
That's what he was wearing.

195
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,320
He's been showing up
around here a lot lately.

196
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,039
The factory was checked.

197
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,000
He's not here.

198
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,600
How about this?

199
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,039
We'll head back to the station,

200
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,399
review the nearby surveillance footage,

201
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:48,039
and keep searching with patrol cars.

202
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,840
Don't panic.

203
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,039
Officer, here's the thing.

204
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,720
My dad sometimes

205
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,840
gets confused.

206
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,200
I'm very worried about him

207
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,639
now that he's out there alone.

208
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,639
You knew about your dad's condition

209
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:59,519
and you provoked him?

210
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,320
Yeah, that was my fault.

211
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,200
Head back first.

212
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,679
We'll call you if anything comes up.

213
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,559
(Security Room)
Okay.

214
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:05,200
Bye, officers.

215
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,440
Call me immediately
if there's news, officers.

216
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:08,919
Okay.

217
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:10,639
Thank you.

218
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,759
Ma'am? Ma'am?

219
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,600
Ma'am?

220
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,440
Do you need something?

221
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:28,440
Hello.

222
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,399
I'm Zhang Quan,

223
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,200
a security guard.

224
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,159
Do you remember me?

225
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:34,080
You picked up your dad from me.

226
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,679
I gave him a band-aid that time.

227
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,919
I remember you.

228
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,000
Do you need something?

229
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,240
Your dad's missing, isn't he?

230
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,440
Have you seen him?

231
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:43,799
Let me be clear first.

232
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:45,080
I'm not crazy.

233
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,200
I'm telling the truth.

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,440
If you believe me, I'll tell...

235
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,960
I believe you. Go ahead.

236
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,200
That night,

237
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,639
I was at my post doing my job...

238
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,320
Fine! You want to play it this way?

239
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,399
Sneaking over while I was asleep.

240
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,600
Sir, you're back again.

241
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,080
Why not come inside for dumplings?

242
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:23,519
You're late today.

243
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,279
What? Expecting letters again?

244
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,039
I'm mailing a letter.

245
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:35,679
Mailing now, huh?

246
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,200
Alright. Leave after mailing it, okay?

247
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,039
Go home, okay?

248
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:44,200
Just go.

249
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:49,440
Sir?

250
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,639
What now?

251
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,679
Playing hide-and-seek?

252
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,399
I see you there.

253
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:07,559
Sir?

254
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:11,559
This is getting creepy.

255
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,039
What? Did he crawl into the mailbox?

256
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,440
So you're saying

257
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,480
the letter just disappeared?

258
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:41,559
The letter's gone.

259
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,039
And so is he.

260
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,200
Stop talking nonsense, will you?

261
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,320
If you did see my dad,

262
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,080
try to remember which direction he went.

263
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,159
So I can tell the police
for them to search properly.

264
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:55,279
Why are you like this?

265
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,679
Didn't I just tell you?

266
00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:57,200
You said

267
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,496
you believed me, so I told you.

268
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,919
What would I gain from lying?

269
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,080
Ma'am, let's stop talking here.

270
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,720
This place feels creepy. Let's go.

271
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:05,799
You go.

272
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:07,600
You won't leave? Fine.

273
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,679
Stay here by yourself then.

274
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,799
You are both nuts.

275
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,519
The letter's really gone?

276
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,440
Dad,

277
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,440
please come home.

278
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:23,159
I was wrong before.

279
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,279
I shouldn't have pushed.

280
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,159
Come back.

281
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:27,600
We won't move.

282
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,200
Whatever issues we have,

283
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,679
let's discuss them properly.

284
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,559
Was that the cat?

285
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,120
Ma'am, don't be scared.

286
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,080
The cat meowed, right?

287
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,279
The same cat you mentioned?

288
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,279
Yes.

289
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,440
Don't be afraid.

290
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,000
Hurry.

291
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:54,960
Get up.

292
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:09,960
Ma'am,

293
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,440
last time after this happened,
your dad disappeared.

294
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,399
There's really a reply letter.

295
00:14:44,992 --> 00:14:50,752
(To Ye Haitang, September 3, 1991)

296
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:00,864
(Meiwan Town, 1991)

297
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,799
Cha.

298
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:38,200
Did you check the boat?

299
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,960
Yes.

300
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:42,080
We're still way short on cash.

301
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:43,799
Need over ten thousand.

302
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,799
Buying a big boat isn't easy.

303
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:52,256
Both jobs are west of the bridge.

304
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:54,919
Don't mess up.

305
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,720
When you're done,

306
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:58,200
meet Bao tonight.

307
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,000

Today's the 7th-day memorial.

337
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,519
My condolences.

338
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,640
This is Ye Yibo's IOU.

339
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,759
(IOU)
1,000 yuan.

340
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:15,720
We're collecting it.

341
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,599
I don't have money.

342
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:19,519
So you don't have to pay?

343
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,079
Ye Yibo owes you the money.

344
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,000
Go to him.

345
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,519
Take the stuff.

346
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,359
There's nothing here.

347
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,440
What are you doing?

348
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,079
We'll just take some stuff
as collateral.

349
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,359
When your dad comes home,

350
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,599
have him bring the money to me.

351
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,792
Today's my grandma's 7th-day memorial.

352
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,519
Please leave.

353
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
No money, you said?

354
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,599
There's over 100 here.

355
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,759
Perfect.

356
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,440
No need to take anything.

357
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,119
It was my grandma's money.

358
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,440
Put it back.

359
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,960
To honor your grandma,
we won't take anything.

360
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:58,720
But tell Ye Yibo

361
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,440
he must pay next month.

362
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:12,440
Give it back.

363
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,039
What's this?

364
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,000
Give it back!

365
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,839
We're just doing our job.

366
00:19:21,319 --> 00:19:22,160
We want no trouble.

367
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,720
So cut it.

368
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:25,599
You won't like how this ends.

369
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,759
Xun, time to work.

370
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,359
That girl's actually pretty pitiful.

371
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,440
Having a dad like that.

372
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Aren't you pitiful?

373
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,200
Xun, hurry up.

374
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,000
Sorry. Sorry.

375
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,680
It's fine.

376
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:02,960
Thank you.

377
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,720
Let me help.

378
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,480

What's wrong, Mr. Wang?

382
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:41,640
Tired?

383

Hurry up.

513
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,160
Stay away.

514
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,279
You didn't finish senior year

515

This time, focus on
completing the year properly.

517

College is another story.

518
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:22,720
Get a high school diploma first

519
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,119

after class, take him
to get teaching materials

551
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:09,000
and

552
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,640

553

Okay.

554
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,799
Okay, class begins.

555
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,039
Stand up.

556
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,039
Good morning, teacher.

557
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,039
Good morning, everyone.
Sit down, please.

558
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,279
Open the book.

559
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,279
Turn to page eight.

560
00:31:30,839 --> 00:31:32,039
'Ahead of'

561
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,640
means preceding in position,

562
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,559
superior to, or taking the lead.

563
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:36,680
It's different from

564
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,519
our familiar

565
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:38,359
'in front of'.

566
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,519
It carries

567
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:41,559
the connotation of excelling in ability.

00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:48,039
Let's hang out.

570
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,599
Stop studying.

571
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,160
What's happening?

572
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:22,519
What do you want?

573
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:25,279
Where's your old school?

574
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,640
Third High School.

575
00:32:30,359 --> 00:32:32,199
You hang around Old Street,
west of the bridge?

576
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:33,480
I live there.

577
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,519
Know Qiang from Old Street?

578
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,960
No.

579
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,839
I'm Shen Xiaojun.

580
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,599
Come to me if you need anything.

581
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,519
His older brother works with Qiang.

582
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,079
He's got connections there.

583
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:47,079
Got it.

584
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:48,920
Do you play ball?

585
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:49,960
Let's play for a bit.

586
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:51,359
I need to go.

587
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:51,920
Next time.

588
00:33:02,119 --> 00:33:03,480
He's so pretentious.

589
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:05,799
Where could he possibly need to go?

590
00:33:07,872 --> 00:33:12,960
(Meiwan High School of Fu'an County)

591
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,759
- What's this?
- Return the money.

592
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,079
Or I'll call the police.

593
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:31,424
I don't have it.

594
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:32,880
You're in cahoots.

595
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,656
You won't escape if I call the police.

596
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:39,079
Your dad owes money.

597
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:42,160
And debts must be paid, you know?

598
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:42,960
If you don't pay,

599
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,279
I'll report to the school

600
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,440
that you robbed me.

601
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,799
Your schooling will be over.

602
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:48,359
Go ahead then.

603
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,039
It was my grandma's.

604
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,039
You have to return it.

605
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,200
Tang.

606
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:02,160
If your dad had paid his debt,

607
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:05,240
nothing would've happened.

608
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,000
What did he say?

609
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,800
Just asked about the schedule.

610
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,360
By the way,

611
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:18,920
we heard he's a hooligan.

612
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,239
Zhou Peng saw him
at the Old Street pool hall.

613
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,760
Doesn't look like one.

614
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,440
I don't go to Old Street much.

615
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,320
Just keep your distance.

616
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:34,272
(Sunshine Bookstore)

617
00:34:48,501 --> 00:34:51,681
(Your wishes will shine into reality
like the northern lights.)

618
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:57,719
Sir.

619
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,519
These mosquitoes are vicious.

620
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,480
Tang,

621
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,320
here's your last month's wages.

622
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,199
Count it.

623
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,079
Thank you, sir.

624
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:10,519
No problem.

625
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Since we've

626
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,800
stocked new postcards

627
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,119
and stationery supplies recently,

628
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,119
my wife wants to run an event.

629
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:19,079
Can you organize it?

630
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,159
What kind of event?

631
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,519
Something like

632
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,880
writing to your future self

633
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,280
to share thoughts.

634
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,079
So you can read it

635
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,159
to revisit those thoughts.

636
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,199
Okay.

637
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,639
Refine the idea.

638
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:30,800
Think of a catchy title.

639
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,480
I'm on it.

640
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:44,920
Cha,

641
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:46,519
got any work today?

642
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,280
You're in school now.

643
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,280
Can you still do it?

644
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:50,840
I can.

645
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,320
Alright.

646
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,760
Let's go to the dock.

647
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,599
Okay.

648
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:05,000
(Art Design)

649
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,760
Tang.

650
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,280
Take these cardboard boxes

651
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,400
to sell yourself later.

652
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:12,480
Thank you, sir.

653
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:12,800
Sure.

654
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,639
Take a look.

655
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,639
You're done?

656
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:18,480
Write a letter to your future self.

657
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,599
The title's good.

658
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,280
When people write letters,

659
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,519
how should we handle them?

660
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,639
Should we mail them?

661
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,119
We're just running an event.

662
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,320
Our main goal is to sell products.

663
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
My wife learned this

664
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,079
from people in the city.

665
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,079
Consider it like writing a diary.

666
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,280
So it's fake.

667
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,880
You're missing the point.

668
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,480
What's a diary's purpose?

669
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,320
To express feelings, right?

670
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:40,800
The feelings are genuine.

671
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:42,599
And we'll properly

672
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:43,920
store the letters.

673
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,119
They can view or retrieve them

674
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,039
anytime.

675
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,119
I'll write one.

676
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:48,760
And you too.

677
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:49,400
Okay.

678
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,800
For those postcards, stationery,
and envelopes,

679
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,960
take whatever you like.

680
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:53,840
Alright?

681
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:55,960
I'm picking up Hu. See you later.

682
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:56,880
Thank you, sir.

684
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:10,760
Miss.

685
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,719
Miss.

686
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,159
You don't need the cardboards, right?

687
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,639
Do you take cardboards?

688
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:19,599
Can...

689
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,880
can you give them to me?

690
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,079
Fine, you can have them.

691
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,320
Great, thanks.

692
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,960
I'll put them on your cart.

693
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:28,920
Okay.

694
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:30,400
Thank you.

695
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,920
Thank you.

696
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:36,679
No worries.

697
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,199
Thank you.

698
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:44,760
No worries.

699
00:38:06,197 --> 00:38:10,848
(Buddies Billiards)

700
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,880
It was tough.

701
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,320
You were quick-witted.

702
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,360
Or he would've escaped.

703
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,440
You okay, Xun?

704
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,119
I'm fine.

705
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,760
You know what?

706
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,800
The guy we beat today with the mustache

707
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,199
is from Bao's hometown.

708
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:36,960
You think he'll tell Bao?

709
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,920
Bao wouldn't have given us the IOU

710
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,639
if he actually cared.

711
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,280
But if Bao finds out

712
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,840
we beat that guy up like that,

713
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,719
he might get pissed.

714
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,719
So what?

715
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,000
Our job was never about

716
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,880
being polite.

717
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:49,960
I did the math.

718
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,480
In at most one month,

719
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,960
we can buy a boat.

720
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,440
A ten-meter trawler that can sail

721
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,039
at least 50 nautical miles.

722
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,320
Then we'll leave
this crap business to Bao

723
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,000
and make some decent money.

724
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,360
Awesome.

725
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,400
I've hated those guys for ages.

726
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,760
Then we can transport

727
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,320
something like clothing or stuff.

728
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,960
We'll make a thousand per trip.

729
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:10,360
Nice.

730
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:11,480
But won't Bao think

731
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,639
we're stealing his business?

732
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,079
He's got people

733
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,400
working on boats too.

734
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:16,519
Don't forget.

735
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,320
We'll run a legitimate business.

736
00:39:18,679 --> 00:39:20,119
Bao doesn't own the sea.

737
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,800
If he does 1,000, I'll do 800.

738
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,960
If he does 800, I'll do 500.

739
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,159
So what if we undercut him?

740
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,679
I'll even do 300.

741
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,320
Come on.

742
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,760
By the way,

743
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:37,360
forget about Ye Yibo's uncollected debt.

744
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,320
Why?

745
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,119
Nothing particular.

746
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,199
Let Bao's men handle those small jobs.

747
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,440
We only take big deals.

748
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,639
Then Ye Yibo's daughter will suffer.

749
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,119
Bao's crew collects debts
with brutal methods.

750
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,159
A bunch of scumbags.

751
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,079
Good morning, sir.

752
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:15,840
Morning.

753
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:20,159
Where did this mailbox come from?

754
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,000
No idea.

755
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,199
No idea who left it.

756
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,119
Right.

757
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:25,639
It has a letter for you.

758
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,440
For me?

759
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:27,480
Yes.

760
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,760
I found it inside it.

761
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:30,360
Who'd write me a letter?

762
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,840
(To Ye Haitang)
No idea.

763
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,760
Who did this?

764
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,840
Why did they put a crappy mailbox

765
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:35,639
before my shop?

766
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:37,920
Thank you.

767
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:38,920
No worries.

768
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,320
We're running an event.

769
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,119
This mailbox can help.

770
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,079
We can have people put the letters here.

771
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,239
Okay then.

772
00:40:53,239 --> 00:40:54,079
You go get a lock.

773
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,119
Lock this up.

774
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,559
I...

775
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,119
The school.

776
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,000
I'll get it.

777
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:57,800
You go to school.

778
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:32,832
(Meiwan High School of Fu'an County)

779
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:54,039
Didn't we just pay this last semester?

780
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,000
Why are we paying again?

781
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,159
Miss Tan decides class fund usage.

782
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,639
Go to her if you have issues.

783
00:41:59,239 --> 00:41:59,800
Wow.

784
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:02,119
You're really her pet.

785
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,679
So you're the class monitor.

786
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,880
Do you get a cut from the class fund?

787
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,920
Three yuan for class fund.

788
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,719
Fine, monitor.

789
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:09,679
How about

790
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,920
I give you ten yuan,

791
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,239
and you make me vice monitor?

792
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:15,119
Here's your seven yuan.

793
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:17,400
Ask the teachers
about becoming the monitor.

794
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:19,960
She gave you seven yuan.

795
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,199
Does that mean a 'no'?

796
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:22,880
Why are you so nosy?

797
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,559
Three yuan for class fund.

798
00:42:45,719 --> 00:42:46,800
Come out.

799
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:03,960
What are you doing?

800
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:04,800
Unlike you,

801
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,239
Ye Haitang surely did her homework.

802
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:08,719
Stop messing with her belongings.

803
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:10,360
What's wrong
with studying her math paper?

804
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:12,320
Shen Xiaojun, why are you so annoying?

805
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,880
She'll scold you when she's back.

806
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,719
I don't fear her.

807
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:24,360
What?

808
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:26,800
I'm warning you.

809
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:28,599
Don't think

810
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:29,800
you can bully me freely.

811
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,239
If you write me that stuff again,

812
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:33,000
I'll just

813
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,880
call the police.

814
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:35,719
What did I write?

815
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,880
What are you saying?

816
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:39,760
I'm not afraid of you guys.

817
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,320
Explain yourself clearly.

818
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:48,599
Tang,

819
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:51,960
we're both people
who crawled out of the muddy pit.

820
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,320
No one understands better than us

821
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:57,079
how pathetic and insignificant we were.

822
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,280
Stop laughing.

823
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,960
The next part's even cornier.

824
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,280
I can't even read it aloud.

825
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,880
Tang, no matter how much time passes,

826
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,920
I still deeply yearn for you.

827
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,840
I've never forgotten

828
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,679
our time together.

829
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:13,280
Shen Xiaojun!

830
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,400
Give it back!

831
00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:26,000
Tang, I'll never forget you.

832
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:27,719
Xun.

833
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,800
Who's Xun?

834
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,559
You can guess.

835
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,119
Look, Xun's here.

836
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:39,719
- Xun!
- Xun!

837
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:43,840
Why did you kick me?

838
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:50,400
What is this?

839
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,800
Tang Yixun, can't you read?

840
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,960
You wrote this love letter.

841
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,000
Don't you know?

842
00:44:56,519 --> 00:44:57,519
Don't tear it.

843
00:44:57,519 --> 00:44:58,440
Are you feeling shy?

844
00:44:58,559 --> 00:44:59,599
What are you doing?

845
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:05,440
Tang Yixun,

846
00:45:06,159 --> 00:45:07,239
you came here days ago.

847
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:08,599
What did you promise me?

848
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:09,840
I didn't write it.

849
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,000
Then who did?

850
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,960
How would I know?

851
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,440
I definitely didn't write it.

852
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,119
Tang, you speak.

853
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,000
Don't be afraid. Just say the truth.

854
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,559
He gave it to you, didn't he?

855
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,119
Explain quickly.

856
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,000
Hand off. Stand still!

857
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,079
Say something!

858
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:26,719
Tell her

859
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:28,079
who wrote this to you.

860
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:33,000
You go back first.

861
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:42,519
Tang Yixun,

862
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,119
I enrolled you here to study,

863
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,440
not to get involved in this nonsense.

864
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:48,280
I didn't do it.

865
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,079
Isn't this

866
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:51,559
your handwriting?

867
00:45:52,199 --> 00:45:53,440
The writing looks like mine.

868
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:54,440
But I didn't do it.

869
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,000
You didn't?

870
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:55,960
Then who did? Me?

871
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,519
What other 'Xun' is there?

872
00:45:58,199 --> 00:45:59,559
Still refusing to admit it?

873
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,280
When did you become like this?

874
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,320
Go and write a self-criticism.

875
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,400
I won't write it.

876
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,400
I didn't write this letter.

877
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:10,559
Why self-criticism?

878
00:46:14,709 --> 00:46:16,519
(Zihua Pavilion)

879
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:17,159
Class dismissed.

880
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:17,880
Stand up.

881
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:21,639
Goodbye, sir.

882
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,440
Goodbye.

883
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:25,719
Leaving first.

884
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,159
Bye.

885
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,719
What are you doing?

886
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:58,320
Where did the letter come from?

887
00:46:58,719 --> 00:46:59,719
Ye Haitang's backpack.

888
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,960
Did you do this?

889
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,079
It wasn't me.

890
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:03,320
Your name was on it.

891
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,440
Besides, I can't write that well.

892
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:09,519
Listen to me.

893
00:47:10,519 --> 00:47:12,559
If I find out you're involved in this,

894
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,440
I'll break your arm.

895
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:17,880
Tang Yixun,

896
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:20,719
what are you doing?

897
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:22,079
Let go.

898
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:28,519
Let go.

899
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:29,840
Let go!

900
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:41,880
When I arrived at noon today,

901
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:44,199
I heard several parents
discussing this matter.

902
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,280
How could you
make such a mistake at school?

903
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,199
Thankfully Miss Tan caught it in time.

904
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:52,880
Tang,

905
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:55,559
you've made me and Miss Tan worry.

906
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,000
It isn't Tang's fault.

907
00:47:58,519 --> 00:47:59,840
As her homeroom teacher,

908
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
I'm responsible too.

909
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,599
No.

910
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:04,199
The responsibility lies entirely
with me as her father.

911
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:05,880
Because of my job,

912
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:07,760
I've neglected Tang's upbringing.

913
00:48:08,199 --> 00:48:09,280
I've failed the school

914
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,280
and failed her.

915
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:11,880
Please don't say that.

916
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:13,599
We're not here today to blame

917
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,880
anyone for responsibility.

918
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:18,199
Miss Tan, as you know,

919
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,719
Tang's always been sensible.

920
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:23,280
Her grandma's passing

921
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:25,079
hit her very hard.

922
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:27,960
And I've been away from home so long.

923
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,079
Given their age,

924
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:32,079
I believe

925
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,239
they're just trying to make friends.

926
00:48:34,239 --> 00:48:35,000
Right.

927
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:35,880
I hope you

928
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,719
can give them a chance to correct this.

929
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:40,079
I'll talk to her properly at home.

930
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,320
This won't happen again.

931
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:45,519
But please don't be hard on her.

932
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:46,760
This really isn't Tang's fault.

933
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,880
Senior year is stressful.

934
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,079
And girls are more sensitive.

935
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,079
She might need more attention at home.

936
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,639
We appreciate your kindness.

937
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:55,440
Not at all.

938
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,480
So he is the...

939
00:48:58,639 --> 00:48:59,639
the boy?

940
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:03,760
Stand up.

941
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:06,840
What's your name?

942
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,440
His name is Tang Yixun.

943
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,880
Tang.

944
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,400
Look at you, such a fine young man.

945
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,079
Focus on your studies.

946
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,880
I'm not against you making friends,

947
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,960
but don't let this
affect your schoolwork.

948
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,559
And you mustn't do anything

949
00:49:29,559 --> 00:49:30,960
that goes against student ethics.

950
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:32,440
Don't you agree?

951
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:36,079
Who are you to lecture me?

952
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:38,559
And that letter

953
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:40,360
has nothing to do with me.

954
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:41,440
Tang Yixun!

955
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,880
Miss Tan.

956
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,280
Haven't we already settled this matter?

957
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,280
I'm not trying to give you a hard time.

958
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:49,119
I just hope that this incident

959
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:51,519
can be treated as a joke this time.

960
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:52,719
But you have to promise me

961
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,079
there absolutely

962
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:57,079
won't be a next time.

963
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:03,079
Don't worry. There won't be a next time.

964
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:05,679
Miss Tan,

965
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:06,960
where's that letter?

966
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:08,960
It was a joke.

967
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:09,840
I've thrown it away.

968
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,960
Let's just let this matter pass.

969
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:17,199
Okay, let's drop it then.

970
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:18,719
Thank you for coming.

971
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:19,599
Let me walk you out.

972
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:21,079
Alright.

973
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:25,239
Let's go home, Tang.

974
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,519
(Tang,)

975
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,679
(I wanted to free you
from this endless suffering.)

976
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:53,079
(But I never imagined)

977
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,039
(I was opening another abyss.)

978
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,039
(The abyss is worse than a pit.)

979
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,280
(Because demons)

980
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:03,679
(lurk in the abyss.)
