1
00:00:16,839 --> 00:00:17,280
Cat!

2
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:17,760
Look!

3
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:18,879
Watch this.

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,519
Did you hear that?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,880
What's that sound?

6
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,640
Give me the key.

7
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,560
You saw when I locked it earlier, right?

8
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:28,319
There was nothing inside, right?

9
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,439
Right.

10
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,239
I saw nothing earlier.

11
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:32,719
Then how did this appear?

12
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,920
What?

13
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,439
There's no mechanism here.

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,400
What's this?

15
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,799
The letter I told you about.

16
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,799
I put it in the mailbox,
and it disappeared.

17
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,000
The envelope's gone.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,719
Where did this letter come from?

19
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:08,439
First I received a love letter.

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,680
Then my letter vanished.

21
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,000
Now it suddenly reappeared
in the mailbox.

22
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,759
This mailbox seems to

23
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:15,840
collect and send letters.

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,319
What if that love letter appeared

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
the same way in the mailbox?

26
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,759
Impossible.

27
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,479
But you saw it yourself.

28
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,080
How's this possible?

29
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,039
Other people's letters are fine.

30
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,080
Is this mailbox

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,360
meant for just the two of us?

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
That doesn't make sense.

33
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,520
The empty envelope is fine.

34
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:37,639
Yeah.

35
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,080
How did it appear then?

36
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,159
It's the paper.

37
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:55,159
The love letter used the same one.

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,400
The same anchor mark.

39
00:03:27,008 --> 00:03:30,720
=Twelve Letters=

40
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,480
=Episode 5=
(Hello, Stranger)

41
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,960
Where's it?

42
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,759
Are you sure you put it in?

43
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
You saw me put it in.

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,400
Are you blind?

45
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:51,960
Do you believe me now?

46
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,159
You saw everything.

47
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:53,960
I wasn't lying.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,280
Where mountains coil lies a test.

49
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,960
Each coil marks another gate.

50
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:00,759
Quan.

51
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,879
Eight perils guard the deep.

52
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,379
Zhang Quan.

53
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:05,080
- Each coil marks another gate.
- Zhang Quan.

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,840
The paper with the anchor mark
was here earlier.

55
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,439
Sold out?

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Where are all the sheets?

57
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,319
If that mailbox

58
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,759
can truly send and receive letters,

59
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,000
let's write back.

60
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,279
We don't know
where the letters come from

61
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:27,560
or go to.

62
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
But someone must've written them.

63
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
You wrote the suicide note.

64
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
And someone wrote that love letter.

65
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,279
Who wrote it?

66
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,439
And why?

67
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,600
That's why we need to reply and ask.

68
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:37,839
There's no new paper.

69
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,079
Let's use the same sheet.

70
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,560
Never mind if it works.

71
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,480
Let's just try.

72
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:43,319
Okay.

73
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,360
You timed it well.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,879
You brought me here just before midnight

75
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,720
and used a cat to distract me.

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:52,839
And him.

77
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:55,199
He is a pro.

78
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,160
A dedicated one.

79
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,920
You're bad at much else,

80
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,160
but I'll admit

81
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,920
your magic tricks are quite good.

82
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:01,879
I...

83
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,600
What nonsense?

84
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,759
That's harsh coming from you.

85
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,800
I, Zhang Quan,

86
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,360
properly passed multiple interviews

87
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
to get the temp security position

88
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,839
in Group 3 of my factory.

89
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:16,959
I'm protecting your safety

90
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,199
as part of my security guard

91
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,199
duties and obligations.

92
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,160
What's that?

93
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,560
Are you saying I'm fooling around

94
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,879
like some street performer?

95
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,448
A guard with a peachwood sword?

96
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:26,439
We're in a special situation.

97
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,600
Your team issued this too?

98
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't touch it.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,160
It's for warding off evil.

100
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,439
I can't believe you.

101
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,079
Enough.

102
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,319
I know the first time

103
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,600
seeing this is the hardest.

104
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,920
When I first saw it,

105
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:40,319
I was shocked too.

106
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:41,759
But all of this is real.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,720
A letter is a concrete physical object.

108
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,600
Matter's state may transform,

109
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,000
but no matter how it transforms,

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,639
it won't just vanish into thin air.

111
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,759
Didn't you see

112
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,560
what happened?

113
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,279
Science now, huh?

114
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:53,199
Didn't you see?

115
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,240
What?

116
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,639
Come on.

117
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,439
Make the phone disappear.

118
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,000
Come on.

119
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,040
You do it.

120
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,879
No, the conditions must be met.

121
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,839
Midnight with the cat's meowing.

122
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,079
Just ignore him.

123
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,959
You saw it yourself
and still don't believe?

124
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,279
You're so stubborn.

125
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:10,920
He's insensible.

126
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,519
Ma'am.

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,920
What's our next plan?

128
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,439
What plan can we have?

129
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,399
The letter's gone.

130
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:18,399
Where to?

131
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,519
Home. It's freezing here.

132
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,519
You're right.

133
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:26,560
Bro, don't get frozen out here.

134
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,120
Come to my place.

135
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,519
Where are you going?

136
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:44,480
Where are we?

137
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,319
Home. Where else?

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,160
Does anyone even live here?

139
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Nobody lives here.

140
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,399
It's a scammer's den.

141
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,720
Stop, or I'll call the police.

142
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,920
You've been to my home.

143
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,360
And I'll visit yours.

144
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,079
Seems fair, right?

145
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:01,639
I told you,

146
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:02,959
until I find my mom,

147
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,199
I go where you go.

148
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,399
Following a scammer is dangerous.

149
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:09,800
Maybe I'll make you disappear
with a magic trick later.

150
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,240
Make me disappear.

151
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,079
Do it and I'll believe you.

152
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,839
It's a wardrobe before you.

153
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,800
Open it and check.

154
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,680
There's a bathroom here.

155
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,759
You haven't checked it.

156
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:42,959
Are you done?

157
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:44,959
What about the bed?

158
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,519
Here's a sofa too.

159
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,480
Let me lift it for you.

160
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,439
I wasn't lying.

161
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,519
Your mom's not here.

162
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,279
If what you said is true,

163
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,319
they must know each other.

164
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:09,800
So now you believe me?

165
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,920
What's their relationship?

166
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,560
What happened
that made them both disappear?

167
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:16,759
Let's put aside our prejudices

168
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,560
and share what we each know.

169
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:20,800
No more secrets.

170
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Deal?

171
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,759
Later we had a fight.

172
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,519
He left a note and disappeared.

173
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,279
Said he had something to do.

174
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,960
I don't know exactly what.

175
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,200
I checked everywhere possible.

176
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,519
I even called the police.

177
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,639
But the police told me...

178
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,639
Let me be clear first.

179
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,879
My dad's not a bad person.

180
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:45,600
What did they say?

181
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,159
Household registration records show

182
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,039
my dad died over twenty years ago.

183
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:55,360
What?

184
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,440
The file says my dad's name
was Yu Zhiyong.

185
00:08:58,159 --> 00:08:59,360
But it's not the same person

186
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,200
who has been living with me.

187
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,639
So this missing dad of yours

188
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,440
is an imposter?

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,879
Who said he's an imposter?

190
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,360
He just has a different name.

191
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,279
There's no way to know

192
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,159
his real name now.

193
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,879
I never saw his ID card.

194
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,120
No photos are left at home either.

195
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,320
But I found that biscuit tin.

196
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,600
Let me show you.

197
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:27,399
See?

198
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:30,320
I wasn't lying.

199
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,639
Exactly the same tin.

200
00:09:32,096 --> 00:09:34,154
(Danish Cookie)

201
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:41,279
But I don't know the connection

202
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,120
(Train tickets)
between them either.

203
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,320
So I couldn't explain it properly

204
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,240
to the police.

205
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:47,639
Why keep insisting he's not bad?

206
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,360
Does not being Yu Zhiyong make him bad?

207
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:51,600
But something is definitely not normal

208
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,679
about your missing 'dad'.

209
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:54,120
Would he just disappear if it is?

210
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,600
Your mom disappeared too.

211
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,559
What about her?

212
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,759
We agreed to drop prejudices.

213
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,679
You attacked first.

214
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,639
I apologize.

215
00:10:05,824 --> 00:10:06,784
Tell me about your mom.

216
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,600
Why did she divorce your dad?

217
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,679
When was that?

218
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:12,360
I moved to England with my dad at 10.

219
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:13,600
She refused to come.

220
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,480
She wouldn't go, so they got divorced?

221
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,919
What kind of reason is that?

222
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,840
There are tons of long-distance couples.

223
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,559
They stay married.

224
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,519
There must be some unknown reasons.

225
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:22,720
Such as?

226
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,320
Poor relationship.

227
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,240
Eight out of ten couples divorce

228
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
due to relationship issues.

229
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,679
My mom is not like that.

230
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:31,000
Then it's your dad.

231
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,159
Alright.

232
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:35,600
I'm just analyzing possibilities.

233
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,000
Did your mom remarry later?

234
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:44,679
No.

235
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,000
Did she date?

236
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,039
How would I know?

237
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,480
You know nothing.

238
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,559
Are you even her real son?

239
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:50,320
Enough with my mom.

240
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,519
Now yours.

241
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,399
I never met my mom.

242
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,480
She died giving birth to me.

243
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,440
So your dad never remarried.

244
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,480
Look.

245
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:23,200
Is there this possibility?

246
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,080
The two of them

247
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,879
have identical cookie tins.

248
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,240
These are clearly vintage items.

249
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,080
Your mom was in Pushui.

250
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,320
And my dad

251
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,519
has so many train tickets to Pushui.

252
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,320
Plus I received a letter from 1991.

253
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,240
You actually believe that letter's real?

254
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,559
What if it actually is?

255
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,320
Could you not interrupt me?

256
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,679
Go ahead.

257
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:47,200
They disappeared
around the same time too.

258
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,240
There are too many coincidences.

259
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
With all this evidence before me,

260
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,000
my conclusion is

261
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,080
they likely

262
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,399
had a past relationship.

263
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,200
Your dad is the third wheel?

264
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,120
Your dad is the third wheel!

265
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,639
My mom died long ago.

266
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,559
Your mom was married to a husband.

267
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,960
Think about it.

268
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,399
It's the same.

269
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:14,159
Your dad caused my parents' divorce.

270
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,759
Impossible.

271
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:17,320
My dad stayed in Beixing.

272
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,039
I grew up living with him.

273
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,799
Even if he wanted to,

274
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:21,519
how could he?

275
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,399
Online? He can't even use the internet.

276
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:24,679
The letters.

277
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,440
So you don't know much
about your dad either.

278
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:37,159
It's the letters.

279
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,480
That mailbox holds clues.

280
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,399
Where's that letter?

281
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,559
Didn't it vanish?

282
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,519
If we can receive letters,

283
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:46,960
we can send them too.

284
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:48,679
Let's write and send one.

285
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,360
If the recipient's Ye Haitang,

286
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,519
that's your mom.

287
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,039
Okay.

288
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,759
But I'll mail it this time.

289
00:12:57,824 --> 00:12:59,960
(Sunshine Bookstore)

290
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,840
What to write?

291
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:04,799
Ask him...

292
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,600
Ask him who he is

293
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,840
and why he wrote you
a love letter in my name.

294
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:10,879
Okay.

295
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,399
But we still don't understand

296
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:19,200
how that mailbox works.

297
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,080
What if he doesn't get it?

298
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,519
What if the letter goes to someone else?

299
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:33,799
How about this?

300
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:36,000
Ask him directly

301
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:38,480
what the deal with this mailbox is.

302
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:45,248
(Did you write this?)

303
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,960
It's fixed.

304
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,799
Drop it.

305
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,320
Done.

306
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,159
There's no sound.

307
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,679
Right.

308
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,120
It's the lock.

309
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:19,960
Let me try.

310
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,620
I'll do it.

311
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,600
Maybe mailing letters is silent.

312
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:49,440
It is?

313
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,960
Why can't we send it out?

314
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:01,840
Maybe the timing's wrong.

315
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:04,919
How do you know it's wrong?

316
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,679
When we first received the suicide note,

317
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:08,559
it was midnight

318
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,600
when the clock chimed.

319
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,759
And a cat ran by.

320
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,440
These conditions might be required.

321
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,639
So both receiving and sending letters

322
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:21,760
must happen at midnight.

323
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,159
And we need a cat.

324
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:24,919
I'm not sure.

325
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,200
Let's try again tomorrow at midnight.

326
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:29,519
I'll meet you at the bookstore then.

327
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,399
Let me walk you home.

328
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,440
When you mail the letter,

329
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,840
put all these into the mailbox.

330
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,879
See if they can be sent.

331
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,720
What trick are you pulling now?

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,679
I'm testing the mailbox's mechanism.

333
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,519
I've figured out the midnight timing

334
00:15:58,519 --> 00:15:59,519
and the cat.

335
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm unsure if other items

336
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,600
can be sent.

337
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:02,519
So I want to try.

338
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:06,799
Fine.

339
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:09,679
I'll do it.

340
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:12,519
What did you write?

341
00:16:17,159 --> 00:16:17,960
Nothing.

342
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:29,279
Wait.

343
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,720
Put this cat food next to the mailbox.

344
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:33,720
Why?

345
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,080
We need the cat

346
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,879
to send the letter.

347
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,840
If that cat
can really perform such magic,

348
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,360
do you think it's an ordinary cat?

349
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,039
It's definitely not ordinary.

350
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:42,480
So I bought premium cat food.

351
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,960
Is the cat food the key point?

352
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,320
The key is the cat.

353
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,480
The key is you.

354
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,960
If you don't believe me,
why did you come?

355
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,440
Get that guard here.

356
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,080
Neither of you can leave tonight.

357
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,759
Will it work without the cat?

358
00:17:10,519 --> 00:17:11,160
Let's try.

359
00:17:15,697 --> 00:17:18,778
(Recording)

360
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:34,880
What's that?

361
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,720
He's setting up his phone

362
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,599
to record video.

363
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,839
Just wait. He'll get scared soon.

364
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,200
He is acting crazy.

365
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,039
Mail the letter through the top slot.

366
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,240
Don't come closer.

367
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,119
Stop.

368
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,240
It's not time yet.

369
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:51,519
Wait a second.

370
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,079
Five.

371
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,319
Four.

372
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,039
Three.

373
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,720
Two. One.

374
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,200
Drop it.

375
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,400
What's happening?

376
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:25,039
Why hasn't it disappeared?

377
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,519
It's gone!

378
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:29,880
Now let's wait.

379
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Okay.

380
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,400
What's going on?

381
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,200
What did you do?

382
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:37,359
The cat. Did you see it?

383
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:38,200
The cat's crucial.

384
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,559
The cat.

385
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:39,720
The cat's gone?

386
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
The magic trick failed.

387
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,920
This isn't a magic show!

388
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,480
When we put the letters in,

389
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
they disappeared.

390
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,720
Then why did mine stay?

391
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,279
Why did you send blank paper?

392
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:54,680
Shen Cheng, are you joking?

393
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,720
Why is it blank?

394
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,839
What's wrong with that?

395
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,319
You weren't sincere.

396
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,279
Such things have spirits.

397
00:19:00,279 --> 00:19:01,359
And there are rules.

398
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:02,079
I told you,

399
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,720
you'll anger the spirits like this,

400
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,839
so the letters won't send.

401
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:07,079
And this phone.

402
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,880
It has electromagnetic interference.

403
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,559
You two are so primitive.

404
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,160
Listen to yourselves.

405
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,680
Does any of this make sense?

406
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,680
If you want to scam me,

407
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,000
at least try to be professional, okay?

408
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,599
- No one is scamming you.
- No one is scamming you.

409
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,839
What exactly

410
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:23,839
did I scam you out of?

411
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,240
Listen, Shen Cheng.

412
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,920
I'm here to find my dad.

413
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,759
If you break this mailbox,

414
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:29,839
you're not leaving.

415
00:19:30,599 --> 00:19:31,319
Threatening me?

416
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:32,079
So what if I am?

417
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,480
What's wrong with threatening you?

418
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,319
Huh?

419
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:35,640
Why are you fighting? Stop.

420
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,960
He's insane!

421
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:38,119
No, no, no.

422
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,279
Ma'am, aren't we on the same team?

423
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:42,200
I'll explain what happened. Calm down.

424
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:44,720
The thing is,

425
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:46,599
this mailbox works in a special way.

426
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,920
If we write on this letter,

427
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,200
will it be sent away?

428
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,599
Not necessarily.

429
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:52,160
Not always...

430
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,680
Don't bother explaining to him.

431
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,920
He thinks we're scammers.

432
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:56,000
Shen Cheng,

433
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,240
if you think we're scammers,

434
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,119
call the police.

435
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,640
Go ahead and get us arrested.

436
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:00,960
Ma'am, wait.

437
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,079
Don't go yet.

438
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,240
Take your magic props with you.

439
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:25,400
Ma'am, we got a reply.

440
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,839
You don't believe it.

441
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,400
(Hello, stranger.)

442
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,440
(I'm Ye Haitang.)

443
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:36,079
(I found a strange love letter
in the red mailbox)

444
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:38,000
(outside Sunshine Bookstore.)

445
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:39,839
(Was it from you?)

446
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:41,960
(My letter somehow disappeared)

447
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,279
(in the mailbox too.)

448
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,160
(Then it reappeared in the mailbox)

449
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,480
(last night at midnight.)

450
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,640
(Do you know how this happened?)

451
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,279
(I don't know you.)

452
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,480
(But I'm writing this letter
to give it a try.)

453
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,440
(If you receive this,)

454
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,799
(please reply to me.)

455
00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:57,319
(I'll be waiting.)

456
00:20:58,759 --> 00:20:59,960
What are you doing?

457
00:21:04,119 --> 00:21:04,960
Impossible.

458
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Absolutely impossible.

459
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:15,880
The camera captured nothing.

460
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,720
A letter materialized out of thin air

461
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,920
and vanished into thin air.

462
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,839
It's impossible.

463
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,279
That's not the point.

464
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,720
The point is, she replied.

465
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,599
We're actually communicating now.

466
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
1991?

467
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:43,039
Can this mailbox really

468
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,960
connect different timelines?

469
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:54,359
Where is the reply?

470
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:58,000
I told you,
it won't come before midnight.

471
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,680
I just wanted to confirm.

472
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,880
I'm heading to school then.

473
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:07,559
Okay.

474
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,599
Right.

475
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:14,039
Can you ask Miss Tan to meet me?

476
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,160
Tell her I'll wait by the school gate

477
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,279
during morning break.

478
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,200
Are you ready to go back to school?

479
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:20,799
Yes.

480
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,000
I must speak with Miss Tan properly.

481
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:24,559
Alright.

482
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,160
I'll wait for you here tonight.

483
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:26,839
Okay.

484
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:42,464
(Zihua Pavilion)

485
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:54,920
Miss Tan.

486
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,839
What do you want?

487
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:58,799
You've learned?

488
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,440
Xin,

489
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:03,799
I was wrong.

490
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,160
About what?

491
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,799
I shouldn't have been so impulsive.

492
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,240
I want to return to school.

493
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,799
You think you can just waltz back in?

494
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:20,519
Have you decided?

495
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,319
Yes.

496
00:23:22,759 --> 00:23:23,319
Got it.

497
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:24,599
Go back now.

498
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:27,039
Xin.

499
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,039
What?

500
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,240
Could you...

501
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:36,559
Could you go to see Cha?

502
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:39,880
Why should I see him?

503
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:41,799
To avenge you people?

504
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,440
It wasn't Cha's fault.

505
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,480
Rat and I caused the trouble.

506
00:23:48,759 --> 00:23:50,400
Cha only got bullied by Bao

507
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,480
as he tried to protect us.

508
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:53,759
Bao took all of Cha's money

509
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,039
that he saved for the boat.

510
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,440
Cha's locked himself

511
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,200
in the shop

512
00:23:58,519 --> 00:23:59,400
and won't let us in.

513
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,160
Xin, maybe you should...

514
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,720
Worry about yourself first.

515
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:49,284
(Food fuels the body.
We'll buy you chicken tomorrow.)

516
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,160
When I heard you took over the shop,

517
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,480
I was very happy.

518
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:33,680
I thought you'd changed

519
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,359
and were ready to do proper work.

520
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:40,759
I was wrong.

521
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,319
You used to fight on the streets.

522
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,440
Later, you opened a pool hall
to gang fight.

523
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:49,200
Wanting to be the boss?

524
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,480
Trying to make it through violence?

525
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,319
Why not call the police?

526
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,720
Street disputes stay on the streets.
It's the street code.

527
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,599
Street code?

528
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,480
You're all petty thugs.

529
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,839
There's no honor among you.

530
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:18,000
Li Chadong, you're thirty.

531
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,400
You're perfectly capable.

532
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,400
You know better.

533
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,759
Becoming a higher-level gangster

534
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:27,519
and parading around
with lowlife lackeys.

535
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:28,680
Is this what you want?

536
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:31,160
Your shop was trashed.

537
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,200
Why still run with them?

538
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Do you have no pride?

539
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:34,720
I have none.

540
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:36,859
The shop's ruined.

541
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,000
My buddies got beaten.

542
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,240
I can't fight or strategize.

543
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm trash, and I admit it.

544
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:51,319
So why are you here?

545
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:55,319
To lecture me or mock me?

546
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,480
I just want to ask you.

547
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,359
Did you choose this path yourself?

548
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,000
Yes.

549
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,680
You're giving up?

550
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:24,279
The shop

551
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,279
can be fixed.

552
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:28,319
People

553
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:30,160
can heal.

554
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,359
Money can be earned again.

555
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,319
Why are you hiding here?

556
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,279
Waiting for those thugs to mock you?

557
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:53,880
Take it.

558
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,440
Rebuild this place.

559
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:05,359
Make it better.

560
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:12,799
The Li Chadong I know

561
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:15,799
wouldn't give up

562
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,279
after one beating.

563
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:22,759
It's a loan.

564
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,000
Pay me back.

565
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,279
Can the video parlor stay open?

566
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,079
The video parlor.

567
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,160
Can it stay open?

568
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,759
If not, so be it.

569
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,680
I don't feel safe with you working here.

570
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,920
Then what can I do?

571
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,000
You can do anything.

572
00:29:59,079 --> 00:29:59,680
I mean it.

573
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,319
Trust me.

574
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:18,880
It'll be fine.

575
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,119
It will all be fine.

576
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,359
I'll stay with Grandma these days.

577
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,200
Okay.

578
00:30:37,839 --> 00:30:39,480
We'll figure things out when you return.

579
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,720
Rat.

580
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,839
Rat, come down.

581
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,200
It's Cha. He's calling me.

582
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,279
Go quickly.

583
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,640
I'll clean up later.

584
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,880
Cheer up.

585
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,680
Take care.

586
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,279
Okay.

587
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:06,799
Done.

588
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:09,799
Cha, I'll get some drinks.

589
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:11,039
Not now. Sit.

590
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:12,319
Okay.

591
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,160
I gathered you here today

592
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,039
to say a few things.

593
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,400
I've thought a lot these days.

594
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,359
What happened

595
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:26,759
isn't all your fault.

596
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:28,960
Cha.

597
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,000
I mean it.

598
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,400
You wouldn't have been beaten

599
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,480
if I were capable.

600
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:37,960
But it's not all bad.

601
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,559
You both know

602
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,839
what Bao is like.

603
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,279
If we stay with him,

604
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,359
we'll end up badly.

605
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,960
Better to cut ties early.

606
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,720
So no more working for him.

607
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,599
Let's rebuild the billiards hall

608
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,599
and earn back slowly.

609
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,319
Once we buy the boat,
we'll have the means to stand up to him.

610
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:54,839
Okay.

611
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,160
Revenge is a dish best served cold.

612
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,119
We must vent this resentment.

613
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,759
Renovating the billiards hall
must cost a fortune, right?

614
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,920
Miss Tan

615
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,720
lent us some money.

616
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:15,880
Xin really came through for us.

617
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,880
She considered your years of friendship.

618
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:19,559
Rat,

619
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,359
if I can't make something of myself,

620
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I won't pursue her.

621
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:25,880
Understood.

622
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,519
Cha, I have some money saved up.

623
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,960
I'll go get it later.

624
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:30,759
No need.

625
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,559
Focus on your studies.

626
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,240
Besides,

627
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,480
the money just needs
to cover basic renovations

628
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,079
for the shop.

629
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:37,880
Got it.

630
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,880
We can't let Bao keep

631
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,559
trampling us.

632
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,319
Let's start working after we eat.

633
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,640
Let's eat.

634
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,039
We'll get it done tonight,

635
00:32:46,039 --> 00:32:47,079
no matter how late.

636
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,160
What, Xun? Are you busy later?

637
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,559
No.

638
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,680
Eat.

639
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,559
Eat up.

640
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,400
No worries.

641
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:05,880
I've got one.

642
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,079
Look.

643
00:33:08,119 --> 00:33:08,759
On the afternoon

644
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:09,759
of September 23rd, 1991,

645
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,680
(The Waterspout in Meiwan Town, 1991)
the Meiwan Wharf of Fu'an County,

646
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,599
Pushui City, Nanjiang Province

647
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,160
witnesses a rare waterspout phenomenon.

648
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,039
We can tell her this news.

649
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:19,079
If she can verify its authenticity,

650
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,599
she'll believe we're from the future,

651
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,720
in 2026.

652
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,599
Nine days passed between
her writing two letters.

653
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,759
But from your first received letter
until now,

654
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:38,920
it's four days.

655
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:39,559
Right.

656
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,720
Clearly time flows differently.

657
00:33:43,319 --> 00:33:44,039
You can't be sure

658
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:45,960
she'll receive the letter
before September 23.

659
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:47,160
You're saying

660
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,880
one day here equals over two days there?

661
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:50,720
We only got two letters.

662
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,039
It's not enough to confirm.

663
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,279
But what's certain is

664
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:55,119
time moves faster

665
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:56,319
on their side than ours.

666
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:58,400
Here's an idea.

667
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:00,359
Let's write about the waterspout

668
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,200
for now.

669
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,480
If the dates don't align,

670
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,759
we'll find other events later.

671
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:04,680
Right now,

672
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,839
only this sheet of paper

673
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:07,720
can be mailed.

674
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,800
So we have to write on it too.

675
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,280
Drop it.

676
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:35,320
Tang Yixun.

677
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,760
What are you doing here?

678
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,559
Sorry.

679
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,840
I got held up earlier.

680
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,119
They replied.

681
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,199
Really?

682
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,639
They wrote what?

683
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:52,320
Haven't read it.

684
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,119
I waited for you.

685
00:35:59,119 --> 00:35:59,880
Cha,

686
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:01,639
I need to go.

687
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:02,280
I'll be back.

688
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,920
(Dear Ye Haitang,)

689
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:07,400
(my name is Yu Nian.)

690
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,239
(I got your letter)

691
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,760
(in the red mailbox of Beixing City's)

692
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,800
(Northern Shipbuilding.)

693
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,280
(We tested to find)

694
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,639
(only this paper)

695
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,000
(can be sent via the mailbox.)

696
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,559
(Perhaps this is truly)

697
00:36:17,559 --> 00:36:18,800
(the cross-time communication.)

698
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,800
(I'm writing from November 12,)

699
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,760
(2026.)

700
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:23,760
(If you're truly in 1991,)

701
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,760
(you can verify a future event.)

702
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,960
(On the afternoon
of September 23, 1991,)

703
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,039
(a waterspout phenomenon
will occur at Meiwan Wharf.)

704
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,400
(The wharf
will be renamed Waterspout Wharf.)

705
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:37,039
(Also, I didn't write the love letter.)

706
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,119
(Do you know Yu Zhiyong?)

707
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:39,920
(Has he sent you any letters?)

708
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:42,159
(Please reply. Thank you.)

709
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:43,480
This mailbox

710
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:46,079
actually works.

711
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:50,039
Wait.

712
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,400
So Yu Nian

713
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,719
didn't write the love letter.

714
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,840
She also asked

715
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,800
if we received
any letters from Yu Zhiyong.

716
00:37:03,159 --> 00:37:05,199
Does that mean Yu Zhiyong
wrote the love letter?

717
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,119
Do you know Yu Zhiyong?

718
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,519
I don't.

719
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,360
What about Yu Nian?

720
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,480
Nor do I know her.

721
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:18,519
What's this '2026' she wrote?

722
00:37:18,519 --> 00:37:19,679
And Beixing City.

723
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,360
Where is Beixing?

724
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,840
2026?

725
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,920
We're in 1991 now.

726
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,239
That's 35 years from now.

727
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,920
35 years from now...

728
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,400
35 years from now.

729
00:37:37,239 --> 00:37:38,840
Are they from the future?

730
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,159
Wait.

731
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:47,760
2026.

732
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,519
Are you saying

733
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,159
that mailbox connects to the future,

734
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,239
and someone in the future

735
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,719
wrote you that letter in my name?

736
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,119
Today's the 13th.

737
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,400
Let's wait until the 23rd

738
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,440
to see if that waterspout
she mentioned happens.

739
00:38:16,072 --> 00:38:17,852
(Xun)

740
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,159
Ye Haitang.

741
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,760
Ye Haitang.

742
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,079
Ye Haitang.

743
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,440
Why are you here?

744
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,679
I've found something.

745
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,199
Look at this.

746
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,519
Why are there two love letters?

747
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,599
Look closely.

748
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:01,199
Don't you think

749
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:03,320
the same person wrote these letters?

750
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,480
Take a look.

751
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:09,760
The same handwriting.

752
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,760
This one's just messier.

753
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:14,440
They can be from one person.

754
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:15,800
This letter

755
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,440
is my replica.

756
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,800
Look here.

757
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,519
The Xun character.

758
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,719
It has a circle.

759
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,719
I also make a circle here

760
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:26,480
(Xun)
when writing it.

761
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,239
The writing matches mine exactly.

762
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,679
But I didn't write this love letter.

763
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,239
I thought someone was pranking me.

764
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,519
But later

765
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,119
when Yu Nian sent another letter,

766
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:52,239
I reconsidered the love letter

767
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:55,079
and realized there's more to this.

768
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,519
Yu Nian is from 2026.

769
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:03,400
Time-space communication...

770
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,360
So this letter's from the future.

771
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,480
The future you wrote it?

772
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,840
If the mailbox thing is true,

773
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,719
this love letter

774
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:21,119
must have been written by the future me

775
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,079
to you.
