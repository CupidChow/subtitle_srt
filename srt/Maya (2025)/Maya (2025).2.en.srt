1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,002
You've been staring
at my dad for a while now.

2
00:00:02,602 --> 00:00:03,603
Do you need something from him?

3
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:05,839
I just want to get to know him.

4
00:00:06,373 --> 00:00:08,241
I know we got engaged

5
00:00:08,541 --> 00:00:11,011
for business reasons.

6
00:00:11,378 --> 00:00:12,679
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:14,114
If you have any dignity left,

8
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:15,715
don't do this.

9
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:16,916
You won't get me in the mood.

10
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,519
I know for a fact that Kongkwan

11
00:00:19,719 --> 00:00:21,121
used to be a prostitute as well.

12
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:22,856
I want you

13
00:00:23,223 --> 00:00:24,524
to help me get there as well.

14
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:26,693
I look forward to the day

15
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:28,628
you fall into my trap.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:46,146
Thank you very much

17
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:48,148
for your help just now.

18
00:00:50,116 --> 00:00:51,117
It was excellent.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,222
But I'm surprised.
It's been ten years or so.

20
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:57,624
I figured you were too young
to remember.

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,460
I saw it in the news.

22
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:03,530
And how did that make you feel?

23
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:06,833
I felt...

24
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:09,202
that someone like you

25
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,504
wouldn't do what the rumors
accused of you doing.

26
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:15,108
You said in an interview

27
00:01:15,709 --> 00:01:17,610
that you're fascinated
by classical music.

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,580
Someone who's musically inclined

29
00:01:21,514 --> 00:01:23,483
probably wouldn't be capable of
doing something so evil.

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,255
But doing good things

31
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,791
can also atone
for all of the bad things.

32
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,561
Would you like to organize

33
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,797
a music therapy session
for the needy?

34
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,166
If you're keen,

35
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:42,268
I'm happy to help however I can.

36
00:01:44,738 --> 00:01:45,739
That does sound interesting.

37
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:50,543
Don't you think?

38
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,444
Yes.

39
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,481
We'll have to arrange another time
to discuss this.

40
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,017
I have a meeting today.

41
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,886
Excuse me, Maya.

42
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,590
No problem, It.

43
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:05,625
I'll see you again.

44
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:10,597
Catch up with me at the meeting.

45
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,432
Yes, Dad.

46
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,479
See?

47
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:29,249
I'm not a stranger anymore.

48
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:31,417
Stop right now!

49
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:33,319
Stop! Be careful of the crook!

50
00:02:33,687 --> 00:02:35,188
Stop right there!

51
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,557
Hey!

52
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,058
- Darn it!
- Don't!

53
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:40,994
- No!
- I hope you all burn!

54
00:02:41,261 --> 00:02:42,262
You lied to me!

55
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,230
- Don't get involved!
- You burned down my house!

56
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,666
Then you opened
this infernal shopping mall!

57
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:48,967
- Let go of me!
- Don't!

58
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:50,636
You killed my wife and kids!

59
00:02:50,637 --> 00:02:51,638
Don't!

60
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:53,473
I'm going to be an evil spirit

61
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,509
- and haunt you!
- Calm down!

62
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:57,877
Hey, don't!

63
00:03:05,318 --> 00:03:06,319
What should we do?

64
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:07,854
Emergency!

65
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,222
Emergency! A man killed himself!

66
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,291
Emergency! It's a suicide!

67
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,299
Another person has died.

68
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,534
What do you mean?

69
00:03:24,604 --> 00:03:25,772
Maya? Maya!

70
00:03:26,673 --> 00:03:27,674
Maya!

71
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:32,746
Maya!

72
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,503
You fired all of my security guards?

73
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:05,438
I did.

74
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,707
They made two mistakes.

75
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,777
They let that insane man
cause a scene.

76
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,979
Then they let him off himself
in front of our guests.

77
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,315
Why would we keep
stupid people around?

78
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:17,517
But they're my people.

79
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,284
It's my right.

80
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,353
It's also my right

81
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,256
to fire anyone. I'm the chairperson.

82
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,192
You were slow.

83
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:27,794
You didn't handle
that moron promptly.

84
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,929
You kept asking questions.

85
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,698
If you let the police
deal with him right away,

86
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,767
this wouldn't have happened.

87
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,139
You too.

88
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:41,708
Was this your best effort?

89
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:43,777
Was it?

90
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,513
Is this the best the head of PR
can do?

91
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,248
Is it?

92
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,551
Why did you let Maya
who's basically a stranger

93
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:52,952
perform to cover it all up?

94
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:55,989
Maya?

95
00:05:56,623 --> 00:05:58,725
- That's right.
- You know each other well now?

96
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,628
You let a stranger to do something
random in front of the journalists

97
00:06:02,629 --> 00:06:04,798
and then claimed that it was
our company's performance.

98
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,836
My team and I are
planning things carefully.

99
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,105
We're not doing things at random.

100
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:15,642
And when will I see a good plan
coming out of your brain?

101
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,447
Tell me. How are you going to
put a spin on

102
00:06:20,613 --> 00:06:21,915
someone jumping to his death?

103
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,383
And what do you want me to do?

104
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,384
Everyone has a phone
in this day and age.

105
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,121
All the videos they took are
already out there. What can I do?

106
00:06:28,254 --> 00:06:29,289
I asked you what to do.

107
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:32,025
I didn't want you to ask me back.

108
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:34,260
Use your head.

109
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:37,030
If you or your team are incapable
of coming up with a solution,

110
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:39,599
then I'll fire the lot
like the security guards.

111
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,373
Go on. Get lost.

112
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:48,942
Just hurry up.

113
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,348
Kin.

114
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,752
Prove to everyone

115
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:00,987
you're capable of becoming the CEO.

116
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:03,990
Do you know

117
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:05,725
everyone's eyeing this position?

118
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:10,263
And I will never
let the company fall.

119
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,966
I built it with my own hands.

120
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:15,535
If you can't prove yourself,

121
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:19,372
I'll find someone
to replace my son.

122
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,504
How are you doing?

123
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,375
I didn't expect him to do
something like that.

124
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:58,845
Me neither.

125
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,448
Dad had the shopping mall
closed for the time being.

126
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:04,617
We'll have to figure out a solution.

127
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,319
Excuse me?

128
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,254
Someone just killed himself.

129
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,190
And your only concern is work?

130
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:12,425
No, that's not what I meant.

131
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,829
I just have to figure out
the next step.

132
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,233
Sorry.

133
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:23,970
It was the shock talking.

134
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:37,984
Are you okay?

135
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:45,625
I don't think...

136
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:49,362
I can drive myself back.

137
00:09:01,007 --> 00:09:02,008
You seem better now.

138
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,412
I wasn't that bad
in the first place.

139
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:06,880
I was only a bit shocked.

140
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,053
Anyway, thank you very much

141
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,822
for your concern and offering to
drive me home.

142
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,859
You're quite lovely, actually.

143
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:22,595
You're joining me for drinks too.

144
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,064
Are you worried I'd be upset?

145
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:25,932
I just don't want
anyone to accuse me

146
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,802
of not taking good care of our
shopping mall's patron.

147
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,272
And what if...

148
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,341
your patron

149
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:36,876
wants you to take care of her more?

150
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,650
You seem to enjoy

151
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,086
saying suspicious things.

152
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,855
What do you actually want from us?

153
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,927
Nothing, really.

154
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,964
I just want to find out,

155
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,234
between you and your dad,

156
00:10:01,968 --> 00:10:03,370
who's going
to take better care of me?

157
00:11:14,174 --> 00:11:15,775
Get dressed. I'll drive you home.

158
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,053
You're aware

159
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:29,255
you have no right to demand
anything from me, aren't you?

160
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,827
You must have
a lot of repressed stress.

161
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,996
That's why
you hurt yourself like that.

162
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:39,866
A lot of my clients

163
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,768
do the same.

164
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:47,674
Sex can help

165
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:49,476
to a certain extent.

166
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,046
But music can also help

167
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,981
if you want me to help you.

168
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,586
I don't know what you want from us.

169
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,757
If it's money,
then I can give it to you.

170
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,227
But please stay away from my family,

171
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:09,829
especially my dad.

172
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:15,001
And I hope my dad will
stay away from you too,

173
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,704
once he finds out
you've slept with me.

174
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,223
Is this Maya, the music therapist?

175
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,359
Hm. She's quite pretty.

176
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,496
Hey!

177
00:12:43,663 --> 00:12:44,731
What are you doing?

178
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:46,466
That's mine, you little brat.

179
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,600
Why did you compliment her?

180
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:52,471
She's just a stereotypically
beautiful woman.

181
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:53,473
You can find one anywhere.

182
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,142
She said she's a music therapist.

183
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,814
But in reality,
she's just a lowly busker.

184
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,850
It will never pay any attention
to such a lowly woman.

185
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,720
If someone hears you

186
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,321
and that tongue of yours,

187
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,889
what will they think of you?

188
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,293
That's why It is so fed up with you.

189
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,162
Look around! There's no one here!

190
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,133
Keeping up appearances is
too much work.

191
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,470
Darn it. It's so uncomfortable.

192
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,639
I helped you become a model

193
00:13:27,207 --> 00:13:28,574
and a famous movie star

194
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,777
who looked so posh and glamorous

195
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:33,146
that you got to marry
a rich man like It.

196
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:35,015
So how did it turn out?

197
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:36,950
He knows your true colors now,
doesn't he?

198
00:13:37,417 --> 00:13:39,686
Is that why he keeps seeking out
other women?

199
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:43,690
And you're so incompetent.

200
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,993
You couldn't even land the CEO
position from It.

201
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,031
If you can't get Akin and Risa
to marry each other,

202
00:13:51,464 --> 00:13:53,733
then there's barely a reason
for him to keep you around.

203
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:57,037
Let me tell you something.

204
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:01,808
It isn't fond of your
super young wife either.

205
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,344
She's of no use
to our business at all.

206
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:09,549
You're also

207
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,951
as incompetent as I am.

208
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:21,795
You dare to insult me?

209
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:24,731
Didn't you come this far
thanks to me?

210
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,401
It's because of your stupidity.

211
00:14:28,835 --> 00:14:30,170
That's why we're in this mess.

212
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,772
Don't do anything stupid again.

213
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,808
Defuse the situation.

214
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:36,576
Otherwise,

215
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,245
that simple musician

216
00:14:39,746 --> 00:14:42,349
might be good enough
to be It's new wife.

217
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,219
Right now, I think

218
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:49,255
you should go and lick Risa's boots.

219
00:14:49,956 --> 00:14:51,157
It might help you in the long run.

220
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,639
Dad went overseas and
will miss my birthday.

221
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,576
He's acting as if my birthday
isn't important.

222
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,847
I don't think that's what he thinks.
Trust me.

223
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,883
He probably has something important
to attend to.

224
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,989
Everyone seems
more important than me lately.

225
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,659
Kin's never available to have dinner
with me either.

226
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,929
I don't even know
if he'll remember my birthday.

227
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:31,297
Risa,

228
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,634
he'll never forget the birthday of
someone as important as you.

229
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,773
Should we do it this way?

230
00:15:40,473 --> 00:15:43,243
I'll throw you
a birthday party this year.

231
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,681
We don't have to invite as many
people as in previous years.

232
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:51,217
Just people close to you.

233
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,521
There will be
a special surprise for you.

234
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,458
You'll want to record it
so you can brag about it later.

235
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:00,960
Sound good?

236
00:16:02,228 --> 00:16:03,229
Okay.

237
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:12,539
I'm home.

238
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,018
Shopping was so much fun.

239
00:16:25,385 --> 00:16:29,322
Thank you so much for sending people
to help carry my stuff.

240
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,161
Don't you see how well
I take care of you?

241
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,163
Don't be mad at me

242
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,799
for being a little too rough.

243
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,801
Don't be mad, okay?

244
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:45,705
And you left me home all alone

245
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,841
for so long today.
I missed you so bad.

246
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,520
Ah!

247
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,689
My phone went into the water!

248
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:07,227
Can I get a new phone?

249
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,462
The most expensive model there is

250
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:12,699
with a lot of storage
so I can take lots of photos.

251
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:20,940
And I want a new bag from Italy too.

252
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:23,043
It's a limited edition.

253
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,512
It's not in stores here yet.

254
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,648
But I've already pre-purchased one.

255
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,317
Thank you so much.

256
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,521
And whatever you want to do to me...

257
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,727
be my guest.

258
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,945
- Oh, wow!
- Here.

259
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:01,614
The bag you asked me to...

260
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,316
The bag I bought for you.

261
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:06,619
It really suits my outfit.

262
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,755
- Thank you, my dear.
- You're welcome.

263
00:18:10,023 --> 00:18:13,326
Right. Were you two close?

264
00:18:18,965 --> 00:18:19,966
Me and Mayawee?

265
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,138
I mean, me and Maya?

266
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:27,540
We used to be roommates.

267
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,110
We went to the same uni
but different faculties.

268
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,212
I don't have to explain

269
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,546
what kind of things
we went through together.

270
00:18:34,147 --> 00:18:35,148
It was a lot.

271
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:38,051
Anyway, let's stick to the present.

272
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:42,355
The three of us are going to be
the spiciest socialite gang.

273
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,326
You like that, don't you?

274
00:18:46,426 --> 00:18:48,461
- Of course.
- Miss Socialite.

275
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,696
Okay, okay.

276
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,464
Cheers.

277
00:18:56,836 --> 00:18:57,837
Huh?

278
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,439
Did Saksit do that?

279
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,581
It's worth it, isn't it?

280
00:19:09,182 --> 00:19:11,685
Bags, accessories,

281
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,353
diamond rings,

282
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:15,388
shoes, phones.

283
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:17,390
And you'll get to be

284
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:20,160
the owner of a beauty clinic
at It's shopping mall.

285
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,695
Are you still going to say
it's not worth it?

286
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,298
Hey, don't get dramatic.

287
00:19:26,066 --> 00:19:27,367
Where could we find this on our own?

288
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,637
- Okay.
- Right?

289
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:33,373
It is worth it.

290
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:37,009
Maya, Sofia told me

291
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,280
you want me to help you get close
to It and Akin?

292
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,318
You're ambitious.

293
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,820
It already has a wife.

294
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,422
And Akin's engaged.

295
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,158
You're not into men

296
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,393
unless it's a sin.

297
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,161
Why does it have to be these two?

298
00:19:55,228 --> 00:19:56,896
And why should I care about morals?

299
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,366
- Ooh!
- Goosebumps!

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,668
- Great.
- Rich people

301
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:03,636
also live their lives
without a care in the world.

302
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:05,605
- Wow.
- Besides,

303
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:08,308
if I go to hell, I won't be lonely

304
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,210
because you two are coming with me.

305
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,746
Oops. That's harsh.

306
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,850
To the greatest among us.

307
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,062
Let's wait upstairs.

308
00:21:18,845 --> 00:21:19,846
Thank you.

309
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:25,018
Okay.

310
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:28,487
Oh? You look nice.

311
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,256
You dolled up so pretty today.

312
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,058
You picked a good color.

313
00:21:35,362 --> 00:21:37,630
Go and wish her a happy birthday.

314
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:39,065
Come on.

315
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,202
Risa,

316
00:21:42,602 --> 00:21:45,372
do you mind if my friends join
your birthday party?

317
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,444
Hi, Risa.

318
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,413
Happy birthday.

319
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,255
Hi, Parnkeaw.

320
00:22:05,225 --> 00:22:06,226
How is it?

321
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,094
Is the food okay?

322
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:09,496
- How's the traffic?
- Let's go.

323
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,464
It's good.

324
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:15,335
What about the traffic?

325
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:21,173
Let's make a toast.

326
00:22:21,174 --> 00:22:22,174
All right.

327
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,376
Thank you, everyone.

328
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,249
It seems nice to be
the daughter of a minister.

329
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,685
Everyone brings you expensive gifts.

330
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,020
Hey, do I look lovely?

331
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,756
Pouty lips, puffy cheeks.

332
00:22:39,592 --> 00:22:41,995
But how many of them won't
expect anything in return?

333
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,099
Do you think she's got
any real friends at this party?

334
00:22:54,808 --> 00:22:56,509
Why isn't her fiance here yet?

335
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,814
I'm just curious what kind of
surprise he prepared for her.

336
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:03,383
- Nosy.
- Oh?

337
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,478
She seems intrigued by him.

338
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,893
He's quite handsome,
but I think he's a faker.

339
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:49,629
Look at that.

340
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,197
A total stereotype.

341
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:54,768
A nice and gentle guy.

342
00:23:55,235 --> 00:23:56,569
And her present is

343
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:00,140
a special rendition
of happy birthday.

344
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,943
As for Risa's role, she has to act
as if she didn't know.

345
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:05,778
She didn't know he was coming.

346
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,880
Does she have to make herself small?

347
00:24:07,047 --> 00:24:08,048
Like this.

348
00:24:10,383 --> 00:24:13,820
She has to act all innocent, like
she didn't know he was coming.

349
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,655
So happy.

350
00:24:16,356 --> 00:24:17,557
But she'd be mad if he didn't show.

351
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,459
Ugh, annoying.

352
00:24:19,893 --> 00:24:21,161
Do you think the diamonds are fake?

353
00:24:31,271 --> 00:24:32,272
Thank you.

354
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,343
I'll notify you once we're open
for business again.

355
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,780
It should be within three days.

356
00:24:43,717 --> 00:24:44,718
Of course.

357
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,121
Oh, feel free to send it over.

358
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,091
Okay. Thank you very much. Bye.

359
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:56,796
What are you really doing here?

360
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,666
To congratulate
your fiancee, of course.

361
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,401
Why?

362
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:03,536
Do you think I'm here
for something else?

363
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:06,940
Don't worry.

364
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:10,010
No one will know what happened
between us that night.

365
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:15,548
Even if you did tell someone,

366
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,550
do you think they're
going to believe you?

367
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:19,686
Is that so?

368
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,621
What are you doing?

369
00:25:55,989 --> 00:25:56,990
Sorry.

370
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,725
I might've had

371
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:00,660
too much to drink.

372
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,247
Oh? Risa?

373
00:26:22,015 --> 00:26:23,016
You're here.

374
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,721
Yes.

375
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:30,790
And what have you been up to?

376
00:26:33,326 --> 00:26:34,994
Your lipstick's smudged.

377
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:37,797
Oh, really?

378
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:39,199
Thank you for the heads up.

379
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,873
You're a pretty woman.
Are you seeing anyone?

380
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,845
If not, do you want me
to introduce you to someone?

381
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,349
I know rich and handsome men

382
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,318
who are still single.

383
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,421
Plenty of them.

384
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,959
So you can stay from those
who are already taken.

385
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:11,831
Or people might accuse you
of being desperate.

386
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,934
That you can't even find a guy.

387
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,370
That's why you have to steal.

388
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,575
Thank you for your good intentions.

389
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:25,178
But I already have someone in mind.

390
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:29,449
Who is it?

391
00:27:31,551 --> 00:27:32,552
Do I know him?

392
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,223
If there's an opportunity,

393
00:27:38,324 --> 00:27:39,759
I'll introduce you to him.

394
00:27:47,901 --> 00:27:49,469
I saw what you did to Kin.

395
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:53,139
But I felt nothing.

396
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:55,842
Do you know why?

397
00:27:58,211 --> 00:27:59,212
You and I,

398
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,414
we're from different classes.

399
00:28:04,117 --> 00:28:05,352
We're so different.

400
00:28:05,552 --> 00:28:07,854
So different I don't even
have to be bothered.

401
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,393
What you're trying to do

402
00:28:16,996 --> 00:28:17,997
isn't that easy.

403
00:28:18,932 --> 00:28:19,933
Oh dear.

404
00:28:20,767 --> 00:28:23,403
Did you see what happened just now?

405
00:28:24,971 --> 00:28:26,239
I'm sorry.

406
00:28:26,439 --> 00:28:28,074
I didn't mean it.

407
00:28:29,275 --> 00:28:30,844
The thing is,

408
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:34,381
Akin looks just like
the guy I'm seeing.

409
00:28:35,181 --> 00:28:37,484
And I was a bit woozy.

410
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,953
So I did what I did.

411
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,922
But I've apologized to him.

412
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,258
He laughed

413
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:47,193
and told me it was fine.

414
00:28:49,195 --> 00:28:50,530
Didn't he tell you?

415
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:52,799
I thought he did.

416
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,303
But you,

417
00:28:58,171 --> 00:28:59,639
you're very kind.

418
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,541
I hope you don't mind.

419
00:29:19,392 --> 00:29:21,394
Cheers!

420
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:25,198
We'll be pretty ladies
who are also very rich.

421
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:26,799
Okay?

422
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,234
- Whoo!
- Shh!

423
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,703
Mind your manners!

424
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,071
Well, I'm happy.

425
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:35,375
You don't suit the bag
you're holding at all.

426
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,243
That's so harsh.

427
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:39,012
It's embarrassing.

428
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:43,249
Hey, girls.

429
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,851
I have to go now.

430
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:45,951
Why?

431
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:47,554
Saksit has someone take me home.

432
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:49,656
He has someone follow you?

433
00:29:52,392 --> 00:29:53,393
Hang in there.

434
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,328
Take as much as you can.

435
00:29:56,529 --> 00:29:57,864
Repeat to yourself, it's worth it.

436
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,166
It's worth it. It's worth it.

437
00:30:00,633 --> 00:30:01,668
All right.

438
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,004
But call me if he hurts you.

439
00:30:05,438 --> 00:30:06,439
Mm.

440
00:30:06,506 --> 00:30:08,708
Smile. You're about
to go see a client.

441
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:10,176
You look like a bum.

442
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:12,011
I have to go now.

443
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:13,013
Bye.

444
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,119
What about you?

445
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,421
Did you find another sugar daddy?

446
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:25,158
Huh?

447
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,094
Whose posh car is that?
You never told me about it.

448
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,863
You have a lot of secrets.

449
00:30:30,263 --> 00:30:31,698
And you don't share the goods.

450
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:34,367
No comment?

451
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:36,169
You don't have to say it.

452
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,104
Just drop me home.

453
00:30:39,773 --> 00:30:40,774
Sure.

454
00:30:47,147 --> 00:30:48,148
Hello. What's the matter?

455
00:31:26,486 --> 00:31:27,487
Aw,

456
00:31:27,987 --> 00:31:28,988
I thought you had the guts.

457
00:31:29,622 --> 00:31:31,725
Didn't you say we're just friends?

458
00:31:36,029 --> 00:31:37,030
Well,

459
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,531
have your employees gone home?

460
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:40,433
Yes, they have.

461
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:50,877
What are you doing?

462
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,813
Changing the license plates.

463
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:57,784
I'm sorry for asking you
to return the car.

464
00:31:58,451 --> 00:32:00,253
A client will be here
for it tomorrow.

465
00:32:00,587 --> 00:32:02,622
But they'll return overseas
in a few days.

466
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:05,258
And you'll be able
to drive it long-term.

467
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,461
But feel free to tell me
if you're interested in another one.

468
00:32:10,263 --> 00:32:11,264
Thanks.

469
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,934
In any case, I'm not keen

470
00:32:15,402 --> 00:32:17,170
on you creating lies
to spread around.

471
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:20,273
You'll get caught eventually.

472
00:32:21,841 --> 00:32:22,842
Mayawee,

473
00:32:23,643 --> 00:32:25,145
if things keep going like this,

474
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,248
when will you get
to live your own life?

475
00:32:28,682 --> 00:32:29,683
Indy,

476
00:32:30,183 --> 00:32:31,951
I've discussed this with you
many times already.

477
00:32:32,218 --> 00:32:35,155
I'll keep saying it until you stop
doing what you're trying to do.

478
00:32:36,356 --> 00:32:37,557
Don't overthink it, Mayawee.

479
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:39,893
You're not struggling
like you used to anymore.

480
00:32:40,593 --> 00:32:42,062
Forget about the past. That's it.

481
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:44,698
Forget?

482
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:48,134
Do you think I can forget?

483
00:33:00,513 --> 00:33:01,514
Mayawee.

484
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:04,517
I asked you how you'd
expect me to forget.

485
00:33:05,552 --> 00:33:06,853
You were there with me that night.

486
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:10,790
You saw countless
of our relatives died.

487
00:33:11,491 --> 00:33:12,826
How many innocent people were there?

488
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:15,228
So how could you
expect me to forget?

489
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:17,797
But what else can we do?

490
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:21,301
It's in the past.
We can't turn back time.

491
00:33:23,403 --> 00:33:25,271
And our lives are better now.

492
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:27,874
I tried hard, and now I'm a
business owner.

493
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:30,910
I'm really worried about you,
Mayawee.

494
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:34,180
I want to see you live
a truly happy life.

495
00:33:37,751 --> 00:33:38,785
My life won't be happy

496
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:43,723
until I get to see all of them burn.

497
00:33:44,758 --> 00:33:45,759
It's me

498
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,094
who's going to cause pain

499
00:33:48,428 --> 00:33:50,797
and agony to everyone,
like how I used to feel.

500
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,967
All of them

501
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:55,535
are going to suffer a living hell.

502
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:04,310
Don't try to stop me again.

503
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:09,082
Mayawee.

504
00:34:14,654 --> 00:34:15,655
You jerk of a friend.

505
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:20,827
You recognized your name?

506
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,130
You've been following me?

507
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:27,300
The rich family you want to burn

508
00:34:28,168 --> 00:34:29,269
is It's family, isn't it?

509
00:34:31,871 --> 00:34:33,073
I heard everything.

510
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:37,010
Why did you use me?
What are you thinking of doing?

511
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:39,079
Since you know now,

512
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:41,047
you can cut ties with me
if you want.

513
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:42,615
Oh, I will.

514
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:45,852
And I'll tell them

515
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:47,821
everything you're thinking of.

516
00:34:48,054 --> 00:34:49,956
Then I'll tell them
about you and Kwan as well.

517
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,759
How come you're like this?

518
00:34:57,931 --> 00:34:58,932
Ow!

519
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:00,867
I won't let you

520
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:02,402
ruin my life!

521
00:35:08,508 --> 00:35:10,410
You're so keen on ruining my life,
aren't you?

522
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:13,279
Are you? Slap me then!

523
00:35:14,014 --> 00:35:16,016
If you think you're tough,
then slap me again!

524
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:18,618
There!

525
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,721
You're not me! You can't understand
what I've gone through!

526
00:35:22,022 --> 00:35:23,023
I never will!

527
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:26,326
I don't even understand
what you're doing!

528
00:35:27,127 --> 00:35:28,828
My life will be ruined,
and yours will be too!

529
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:30,830
What are you doing?
Use your head for once!

530
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:34,334
What did they do to you? Tell me!

531
00:35:37,003 --> 00:35:38,171
What's wrong with you?

532
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,175
Tell me! Why would you repress it?

533
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:44,944
Cat got your tongue?

534
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,417
When I was young,

535
00:35:53,053 --> 00:35:54,054
I lived

536
00:35:55,689 --> 00:35:57,490
a hopeless existence in the slums.

537
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,861
One night,

538
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:04,230
I had to wake up

539
00:36:05,131 --> 00:36:08,101
to something that turned my life
into a living hell.

540
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,003
What?

541
00:36:11,771 --> 00:36:12,772
Hey,

542
00:36:13,173 --> 00:36:14,174
what's that smoke?

543
00:36:14,474 --> 00:36:15,475
What?

544
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:16,910
Huh? What is that?

545
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,113
Dear, there's a fire!

546
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,648
People are running everywhere!

547
00:36:22,148 --> 00:36:24,351
Oh no! What are we going to do?

548
00:36:24,551 --> 00:36:25,919
Here. Come on.

549
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:27,554
Go ahead.

550
00:36:27,754 --> 00:36:29,222
- Mayawee, come here!
- Go.

551
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:30,457
Mayawee, run!

552
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,026
- Go on.
- No!

553
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:34,059
- Go!
- It's hot!

554
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,695
- Bring her out.
- Mayawee, go!

555
00:36:35,762 --> 00:36:36,963
- It's hot! No!
- Go!

556
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:38,832
- Go on!
- No, it's so hot!

557
00:36:38,998 --> 00:36:40,000
Go on!

558
00:36:40,066 --> 00:36:41,067
I can't breathe!

559
00:36:54,247 --> 00:36:55,782
- Dad!
- Help!

560
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:57,384
Anyone, help!

561
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,152
Dear!

562
00:36:59,285 --> 00:37:00,819
Get out of there!

563
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,820
Dad!

564
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:02,822
- Get out!
- Dear!

565
00:37:03,123 --> 00:37:04,457
- Help!
- Dad!

566
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:06,091
Help!

567
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,092
Mayawee!

568
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:08,294
Get out of there!

569
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:14,467
Dad!

570
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,239
Dad!

571
00:37:27,147 --> 00:37:28,948
You lived in the slums
that got burned down?

572
00:37:30,684 --> 00:37:32,686
The one that's now
It's shopping mall?

573
00:37:33,186 --> 00:37:34,954
The slums didn't just burn down.

574
00:37:37,323 --> 00:37:38,692
It was arson on someone's order.

575
00:37:41,561 --> 00:37:42,562
And do you know

576
00:37:43,863 --> 00:37:45,031
who gave the order?

577
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:49,436
- Wait. You little brat!
- Let go!

578
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:50,569
Come here!

579
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:52,038
- Let go of me!
- Come here!

580
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,641
You killed my dad!

581
00:37:55,008 --> 00:37:56,443
You scumbag! Jerk!

582
00:37:56,943 --> 00:37:57,944
A kid from the slums?

583
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,212
How did she get in?

584
00:37:59,245 --> 00:38:00,246
I'm sorry, sir.

585
00:38:00,513 --> 00:38:02,182
She came
with the protesters out front.

586
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:03,450
She got through the gate.

587
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:04,850
Take her out.

588
00:38:04,851 --> 00:38:06,219
- Come on.
- Why did you burn my house down?

589
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,787
My dad died because of you.

590
00:38:07,987 --> 00:38:09,255
You meanie! Jerk!

591
00:38:09,622 --> 00:38:11,191
I'm going to call the cops on you!

592
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:12,726
What's happening?

593
00:38:13,093 --> 00:38:14,260
A kid from the slums got in.

594
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:17,063
Filth. Don't mind her.

595
00:38:24,504 --> 00:38:25,505
Right.

596
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:27,540
So what if I did it?

597
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,576
What can you do to me?

598
00:38:30,477 --> 00:38:32,112
You lived in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

599
00:38:32,979 --> 00:38:34,280
You were lucky
not to die in the fire.

600
00:38:35,448 --> 00:38:36,449
Let go!

601
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:37,984
Even though he's been

602
00:38:38,518 --> 00:38:40,653
denying his involvement,

603
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:43,623
he admitted to my face

604
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:45,291
that he did it.

605
00:38:46,526 --> 00:38:48,028
Fifteen years later,

606
00:38:48,561 --> 00:38:51,897
he built a shopping mall on
the corpses of the people he killed,

607
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:53,299
including my dad's.

608
00:38:54,034 --> 00:38:56,236
And he's acting
as if he doesn't remember

609
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:57,604
or feel any remorse.

610
00:38:58,772 --> 00:39:00,440
Do you understand now

611
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,510
why I have to do what I'm doing?

612
00:39:05,712 --> 00:39:07,047
You understand, don't you?

613
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:13,987
I do.

614
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:17,857
And I'm sorry

615
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,229
I can't help you.

616
00:39:26,066 --> 00:39:27,067
I understand.

617
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:33,873
But I want you
to understand me as well.

618
00:39:35,108 --> 00:39:37,377
I've been doing everything
to have the life I live now

619
00:39:39,846 --> 00:39:42,215
because I don't want to go back
to being poor anymore.

620
00:39:53,393 --> 00:39:54,394
In the end,

621
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:57,397
money really is more important
than human lives.

622
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,801
All right.

623
00:40:02,502 --> 00:40:03,503
From now on,

624
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,839
do whatever you want.

625
00:40:06,673 --> 00:40:08,441
I won't tell anyone
about you and Kwan's past.

626
00:40:09,642 --> 00:40:11,044
If you want to live life

627
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,747
spending their dirty money,

628
00:40:14,047 --> 00:40:15,048
be my guest.

629
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:17,317
But let me tell you.

630
00:40:17,784 --> 00:40:19,252
Don't get in my way.

631
00:40:22,155 --> 00:40:24,491
But if you ruin my life

632
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:26,826
or cause me problems,

633
00:40:28,094 --> 00:40:29,262
I'll get in your way.

634
00:40:32,298 --> 00:40:33,366
Remember that too.

635
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:37,570
Maybe you and I

636
00:40:38,338 --> 00:40:40,140
shouldn't have been friends
in the first place.

637
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:42,509
Why were we even friends?

638
00:40:52,485 --> 00:40:54,354
You missed my birthday, Dad.

639
00:40:56,189 --> 00:40:58,925
I took the earliest flight
I could find.

640
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,528
I ordered a road closure

641
00:41:01,895 --> 00:41:03,163
and told my driver
to go as fast as he could.

642
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:04,998
I did everything,

643
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:07,000
but I still missed your birthday.

644
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:09,836
I'm sorry.

645
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:21,014
Happy birthday, darling.

646
00:41:22,982 --> 00:41:26,252
And how was the birthday party
Parnkeaw threw for you?

647
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:27,821
Was it fun?

648
00:41:29,723 --> 00:41:30,724
Yes, Dad.

649
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,494
Your birthday present is
in my suitcase.

650
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:36,563
You're going to like it.

651
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:40,700
I know

652
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:43,336
you understand me the most.

653
00:41:45,572 --> 00:41:46,573
But...

654
00:41:47,674 --> 00:41:49,876
can the present be
something else instead?

655
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:53,880
What do you want?

656
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:05,392
I guess you've seen the news

657
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:09,329
about Akin's family's shopping mall?

658
00:42:13,266 --> 00:42:14,267
His company's reputation

659
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:16,670
has suffered a lot of damage.

660
00:42:18,004 --> 00:42:19,639
I want you to help.

661
00:42:24,144 --> 00:42:25,145
Well,

662
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:26,913
you're engaged to Akin.

663
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:31,918
If I explicitly exercise my
authority at work to help,

664
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:34,020
people will be able to tell

665
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:35,288
it's personal.

666
00:42:35,622 --> 00:42:37,457
I'm not listening to your reason.

667
00:42:38,692 --> 00:42:41,761
You're the Minister
of Social Development.

668
00:42:42,462 --> 00:42:44,798
Your job involves people
in our society anyway.

669
00:42:45,465 --> 00:42:49,169
Just find something to help improve
the company's image.

670
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,780
Or do you want me to do
what I did again?

671
00:43:17,197 --> 00:43:19,132
Daughter of a renowned minister

672
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:21,434
takes a selfie
in the middle of the road

673
00:43:22,302 --> 00:43:23,503
in active traffic.

674
00:43:24,671 --> 00:43:27,807
"The cars will stop if I open
my heart and keep walking."

675
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:31,644
Do I have to do something on social
media to spite you so you'll help?

676
00:43:32,612 --> 00:43:33,780
Come on, Risa.

677
00:43:34,381 --> 00:43:35,515
Don't do that again.

678
00:43:35,815 --> 00:43:37,450
You're engaged to Akin now.

679
00:43:37,984 --> 00:43:39,953
I don't think he'll
like that very much.

680
00:43:40,487 --> 00:43:42,055
Then just wait and see

681
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:44,657
if I'll do it again

682
00:43:46,192 --> 00:43:47,627
if you don't help him.

683
00:43:51,531 --> 00:43:52,699
Stand next to her.

684
00:43:55,602 --> 00:43:57,269
It's my pleasure.

685
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:58,271
Thank you.

686
00:44:02,542 --> 00:44:04,077
Okay. This camera as well, please.

687
00:44:04,744 --> 00:44:05,912
Stand close to each other, please.

688
00:44:12,118 --> 00:44:14,521
I told my team to post it
on social media.

689
00:44:16,589 --> 00:44:17,891
The news of our company

690
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:21,860
making a donation to support the
development of slums

691
00:44:21,861 --> 00:44:23,763
organized by the Ministry
of Social Development.

692
00:44:24,931 --> 00:44:28,568
I believe things
are going to improve.

693
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,706
Thank you very much, Treetep.

694
00:44:33,673 --> 00:44:34,941
You're welcome, Parnkeaw.

695
00:44:35,775 --> 00:44:38,345
And thank you
for the financial support.

696
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:40,180
You're welcome.

697
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,816
It's almost time to wrap things up.

698
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:45,685
All right. If you wouldn't mind,

699
00:44:46,486 --> 00:44:49,823
I'd like to take Risa for a
girls-only activity.

700
00:44:50,557 --> 00:44:53,159
You don't have to go with them.
It's dusty and hot.

701
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:54,861
Okay.

702
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:56,963
Have fun, Dad.

703
00:44:58,365 --> 00:44:59,432
Bye, It.

704
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:01,701
- Let's go.
- Bye, Kin.

705
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,780
It's time, sir.

706
00:45:14,781 --> 00:45:15,782
Everything's ready?

707
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:17,884
- All right. Let's go.
- Okay.

708
00:45:23,757 --> 00:45:27,794
My daughter asked me to help you.

709
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:32,331
There should be a bit of a reward

710
00:45:32,332 --> 00:45:34,134
to thank her, It.

711
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:35,368
No problem.

712
00:45:39,506 --> 00:45:41,841
Spare some of the company's shares
for her, Akin.

713
00:45:56,756 --> 00:45:57,757
Where's Mom?

714
00:45:58,058 --> 00:45:59,059
In her room.

715
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,261
Come on in.

716
00:46:01,895 --> 00:46:03,063
Mom, someone's here to see you.

717
00:46:11,404 --> 00:46:13,440
It's my friend, Mayawee.

718
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:15,442
Mayawee?

719
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:18,111
It's been a few days.

720
00:46:20,046 --> 00:46:21,047
Let's eat.

721
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,416
I bought you lots
of your favorite foods.

722
00:46:27,987 --> 00:46:28,988
Can I get a hug?

723
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,209
Oh, hello.

724
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:50,976
Hey!

725
00:46:50,977 --> 00:46:52,144
They're here to hand out freebies!

726
00:46:52,145 --> 00:46:53,179
Come out now!

727
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:54,781
Let's do it outside.

728
00:46:54,981 --> 00:46:56,249
All right. Come and take your pick.

729
00:46:56,383 --> 00:46:57,916
Come on over. Line up.

730
00:46:57,917 --> 00:46:59,552
Hello.

731
00:46:59,786 --> 00:47:01,287
- The Minister is here.
- Over here, please.

732
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:03,323
Hello, everyone.

733
00:47:04,391 --> 00:47:05,592
I'm Treetep.

734
00:47:06,192 --> 00:47:08,795
As the Minister
of Social Development,

735
00:47:09,095 --> 00:47:11,598
I promise all of you

736
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:13,900
we will follow specific policies

737
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,103
to improve your quality of life.

738
00:47:18,838 --> 00:47:21,307
They're here to hand out
freebies in the slums.

739
00:47:22,108 --> 00:47:23,109
So fake.

740
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:24,944
Humans are weird.

741
00:47:25,412 --> 00:47:27,981
Handing out freebies and
being personable

742
00:47:28,481 --> 00:47:32,052
can convince people that capitalists
and politicians are good people.

743
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:33,553
I don't understand it at all.

744
00:47:37,557 --> 00:47:40,794
How long do we have to watch as they
prosper with blood on their hands?

745
00:47:41,194 --> 00:47:42,495
When will we ever be
able to get rid of them?

746
00:47:51,604 --> 00:47:53,640
He didn't say anything
when he promised to help.

747
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:56,443
And now he's asking us to give
his daughter shares in the company.

748
00:47:57,310 --> 00:47:58,311
He's crazy.

749
00:47:59,379 --> 00:48:00,380
He's swindling us.

750
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,750
Why didn't you turn him down
if you're not happy with it?

751
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,185
I couldn't.

752
00:48:06,052 --> 00:48:07,721
He's a minister.

753
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:08,922
How could I turn him down?

754
00:48:11,858 --> 00:48:12,859
It's your fault.

755
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:14,494
You're incompetent.

756
00:48:14,794 --> 00:48:16,229
That's why I needed his help.

757
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:18,164
I had to accept his help
because of you.

758
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:21,401
I told you to marry Risa

759
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:24,070
to increase profits,

760
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:25,905
not be at a disadvantage.

761
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:27,407
It,

762
00:48:30,443 --> 00:48:32,345
the photographers have sent
plenty of beautiful photos.

763
00:48:32,812 --> 00:48:35,048
You and Kin both look good
in all of them.

764
00:48:37,217 --> 00:48:38,351
What do you think?

765
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:40,353
Did I do a good job?

766
00:48:42,856 --> 00:48:44,590
Soon, people will find out that

767
00:48:44,591 --> 00:48:47,360
we support the minister's policy.

768
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:49,729
I don't think it can be compared
to a video clip

769
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:52,832
of a random music performance.

770
00:48:54,668 --> 00:48:56,102
Once the news gets out,

771
00:48:56,436 --> 00:48:58,838
I think it's going to help reduce
a lot of negativity on social media.

772
00:49:01,174 --> 00:49:02,709
Which ones should we
use for the news?

773
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:04,310
A lot of good ones here.

774
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:05,812
I thought you said
all of them are good.

775
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,881
Just use all of them.

776
00:49:17,023 --> 00:49:18,024
Kin,

777
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:21,493
I only hinted to Risa

778
00:49:21,494 --> 00:49:23,229
how she could help.

779
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,700
I didn't expect her to be able to
convince her dad to help this much.

780
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:31,071
See?

781
00:49:31,871 --> 00:49:32,872
Risa is

782
00:49:33,206 --> 00:49:35,175
the best woman for you.

783
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:40,080
Ask her out for dinner.

784
00:49:43,016 --> 00:49:44,017
Okay, Mom.

785
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,086
Mom?

786
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,454
We can't let her go out.

787
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,023
Mom!

788
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:24,624
Live happily.

789
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:26,960
All right. Let's help
each other, It.

790
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:28,227
Come on over.

791
00:50:28,228 --> 00:50:30,497
We won't abandon each other.

792
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:33,433
All right. Here you go.

793
00:50:33,767 --> 00:50:35,134
Go and get your family
and relatives.

794
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,237
There's still lots to go around.

795
00:50:38,838 --> 00:50:40,140
Mom!

796
00:50:40,206 --> 00:50:42,008
- Thanks to Itsara Group.
- Stop!

797
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:44,244
Let go of me!

798
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:45,812
Let go!

799
00:50:49,315 --> 00:50:50,517
Let go!

800
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:51,918
Mom, that's enough!

801
00:50:53,053 --> 00:50:54,054
Ow!

802
00:50:55,155 --> 00:50:56,690
- Why did you hold me back?
- Mom!

803
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:57,991
Why...

804
00:50:58,358 --> 00:50:59,392
Why would you hold me back?

805
00:50:59,492 --> 00:51:00,492
Why?

806
00:51:00,493 --> 00:51:02,294
- Mom!
- I'm going to kill him!

807
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:04,130
I'm going to kill him!

808
00:51:04,931 --> 00:51:06,132
Mom!

809
00:51:07,767 --> 00:51:09,234
Mom, please!

810
00:51:09,235 --> 00:51:10,236
Stop, please!

811
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:12,472
There, there.

812
00:51:15,575 --> 00:51:16,643
Mom!

813
00:51:16,876 --> 00:51:19,045
It's okay!

814
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:26,720
She took some medication
and fell asleep.

815
00:51:28,154 --> 00:51:29,456
She'll probably feel better
after she wakes up.

816
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:33,493
But if something triggers her again,

817
00:51:35,261 --> 00:51:36,329
she might have to

818
00:51:37,197 --> 00:51:38,365
go and stay at the hospital again.

819
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:43,103
They killed my dad

820
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:45,505
and made Mom like this.

821
00:51:47,007 --> 00:51:48,141
And you have to live alone now.

822
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:51,511
Do you see now

823
00:51:51,845 --> 00:51:54,080
why I can't give up?

824
00:51:54,881 --> 00:51:56,816
Why I have to deal with them?

825
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:02,088
I'm angry because of what
they did to us as well.

826
00:52:02,856 --> 00:52:04,290
And I want to do something

827
00:52:04,624 --> 00:52:05,759
so they have to pay for it.

828
00:52:07,694 --> 00:52:09,095
But what can we do?

829
00:52:14,601 --> 00:52:16,803
Don't you see? Look at your mom.

830
00:52:17,671 --> 00:52:19,139
She saw their faces,

831
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:20,940
heard you talking about them,

832
00:52:21,374 --> 00:52:22,876
and she lost it.

833
00:52:25,945 --> 00:52:27,480
And you're not happy either.

834
00:52:28,214 --> 00:52:30,183
That's why I want you
to get over it.

835
00:52:32,552 --> 00:52:34,888
And if you get close to them

836
00:52:35,422 --> 00:52:37,891
and they catch you,
what will they do to you?

837
00:52:39,225 --> 00:52:40,627
I'm very worried about you, Mayawee.

838
00:52:44,064 --> 00:52:45,065
Regardless,

839
00:52:46,132 --> 00:52:48,335
if I get to see them pay
for what they did,

840
00:52:49,669 --> 00:52:50,804
I'm willing to do it
even if it means I have to die.

841
00:52:58,078 --> 00:53:01,614
(Sofia)

842
00:53:03,316 --> 00:53:04,316
Hello?

843
00:53:04,317 --> 00:53:05,985
I've transferred
the money back to you.

844
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,389
We owe each other nothing now.

845
00:53:10,023 --> 00:53:12,258
And I already helped you

846
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:15,128
get to know It and Akin.

847
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:17,997
We go our separate ways now.

848
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:20,266
I don't care which way you go.

849
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,102
I won't tell anyone about you.

850
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:26,106
And you can't tell anyone
about me and Kwan either.

851
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:28,408
Listen to me, Mayawee.

852
00:53:29,175 --> 00:53:31,211
I won't help you
take revenge on anyone.

853
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:33,380
Sure, I understand.

854
00:53:34,781 --> 00:53:35,782
Good.

855
00:53:48,762 --> 00:53:50,030
Are you stupid?

856
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,800
Get out!

857
00:53:54,801 --> 00:53:55,835
I'm not going

858
00:53:56,936 --> 00:53:59,239
until you pay me 50 million!

859
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,341
Fifty million?

860
00:54:01,775 --> 00:54:04,110
I gave you lots. So why do I
have to give you more?

861
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:05,912
You crazy woman.

862
00:54:06,546 --> 00:54:07,547
All right.

863
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:10,216
I'll tell everyone

864
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:11,818
how sadistic

865
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:13,586
and sick in the head you are.

866
00:54:15,188 --> 00:54:17,223
I have video evidence.

867
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:20,493
I'm going to throw you
in jail for 20 years.

868
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,664
Fifty million

869
00:54:25,465 --> 00:54:26,533
in exchange for these video clips.

870
00:54:27,701 --> 00:54:28,702
Are you going to give it to me?

871
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,841
No?

872
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:36,810
Sure.

873
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:39,012
Then you can rot in jail.

874
00:54:41,648 --> 00:54:42,649
Wait.

875
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:13,380
Come to my house immediately.

876
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:14,914
Need some cleaning up.

877
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,644
Saksit killed his ex-wife
inside his house?

878
00:55:44,878 --> 00:55:45,912
I saw it with my own eyes.

879
00:55:46,346 --> 00:55:49,683
I asked Maya to host music therapy
sessions at our shopping mall.

880
00:55:51,251 --> 00:55:53,453
It's a pleasure to work together,
Parnkeaw.

881
00:55:53,653 --> 00:55:55,388
We'll probably see
each other more now.

882
00:55:55,855 --> 00:55:58,425
It's obvious that woman
wants to get close to you.

883
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,026
Don't trust her.

884
00:56:03,997 --> 00:56:04,998
These rich people live

885
00:56:05,298 --> 00:56:07,600
happily lives at the expense
of other people's suffering.

886
00:56:07,901 --> 00:56:10,870
I won't let them dance
on people's graves any longer.
