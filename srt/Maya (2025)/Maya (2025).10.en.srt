1
00:00:00,406 --> 00:00:01,406
Why did you ask to see me?

2
00:00:01,407 --> 00:00:03,475
I have to tie up the loose ends
between us.

3
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,110
Do you really remember it now?

4
00:00:05,244 --> 00:00:07,446
I already know the truth.

5
00:00:07,646 --> 00:00:10,883
There must be something.
What those scumbags did to Indy.

6
00:00:11,116 --> 00:00:12,518
There must be evidence.

7
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:15,287
Are you sure he did it?

8
00:00:16,088 --> 00:00:17,823
And what are you going to do
with the evidence?

9
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:19,525
I miss you.

10
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:20,993
I want to see you.

11
00:00:21,527 --> 00:00:24,930
Nothing will happen
if I take it to the police.

12
00:00:25,464 --> 00:00:26,765
Or maybe we tell the public

13
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:28,600
and let the public deal with him.

14
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:39,511
When it all started that night,

15
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:43,415
I used classical music
to bring myself to him,

16
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:45,351
to be in the same circle as him.

17
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:46,986
Classical music is falsely believed

18
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:49,722
as belonging to the rich.

19
00:00:50,155 --> 00:00:52,157
They're obsessed with using it
to enhance their taste

20
00:00:52,958 --> 00:00:56,028
and present themselves
as superior to others.

21
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:00,165
And this time,
I'm going to use classical music

22
00:01:00,432 --> 00:01:02,735
to bring myself to him
one last time.

23
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:06,138
Because I've now realized
there's no other way.

24
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,574
And this should be
the end to everything.

25
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:15,447
I'm the last-minute replacement for
the musician who called in sick.

26
00:01:16,649 --> 00:01:17,650
Can I see your credentials?

27
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:25,524
May I check your bag?

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,268
Are you the musician for tonight?

29
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:38,103
This way, please.
The event's about to start.

30
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,471
All done?

31
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,941
Risa will be unhappy if she's late.

32
00:01:43,242 --> 00:01:44,243
Please proceed.

33
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:08,520
Why the long face, It?

34
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:11,724
It's a night of merriment.

35
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:17,396
It's also a celebration of us
joining forces.

36
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:21,266
Just don't forget what you said.

37
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:24,370
I lost a fortune.

38
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:26,372
Of course, I won't forget.

39
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,641
You can rest assured.

40
00:04:29,642 --> 00:04:32,444
If someone digs up your past
and uses it against you,

41
00:04:33,245 --> 00:04:34,313
I'll help you sort it out.

42
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:40,085
I'm doing everything
for my daughter's sake.

43
00:04:40,586 --> 00:04:42,288
She's getting married after all.

44
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:43,989
So I want to be sure

45
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,326
I can guarantee her
stability and happiness.

46
00:04:49,328 --> 00:04:50,596
You're lucky to have a daughter.

47
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:53,899
Apparently, she can be used
as a guarantor

48
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:56,902
to demand an ample amount of money.

49
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:04,610
Oh, you.

50
00:05:06,145 --> 00:05:07,613
You're still yourself
after all this time.

51
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:12,017
Well then. I hope your luck is

52
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:14,219
as sharp as your tongue.

53
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:17,056
What are you doing here, Risa?

54
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,961
Oh, I'm about to head inside.

55
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,402
My daughter's very beautiful.

56
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:35,074
You've spoken to Treetep,
haven't you?

57
00:05:35,507 --> 00:05:38,477
The deal I have with him
is going smoothly, I hope?

58
00:05:39,411 --> 00:05:40,412
Of course I have.

59
00:05:41,747 --> 00:05:42,881
Let's wait until after tonight.

60
00:05:43,515 --> 00:05:44,883
It's not the time.

61
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:53,459
Oh?

62
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:57,830
Risa, you look
very beautiful tonight.

63
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:01,834
You're the bride of the year,
you'll be the talk of the town.

64
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,202
Thank you, Parnkeaw.

65
00:06:04,403 --> 00:06:05,938
This is such
an occasion to celebrate.

66
00:06:06,305 --> 00:06:09,642
It has brought
people of equal status

67
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,145
from our families together.

68
00:06:56,889 --> 00:06:58,557
Maya!

69
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:01,193
Keep it together.
People are watching.

70
00:07:04,797 --> 00:07:06,398
Escort this uninvited guest
out of here, please!

71
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:07,599
Don't worry.

72
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:09,168
I'll leave.

73
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,471
But I have to speak to It first.

74
00:07:16,775 --> 00:07:17,776
What's the matter?

75
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:19,678
You said you missed me.

76
00:07:20,646 --> 00:07:21,880
So I came to see you.

77
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,952
Let's wait until after the wedding.
I'll speak to you later.

78
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,888
Of course. I'll leave.

79
00:07:31,256 --> 00:07:32,524
But you have to tell me first.

80
00:07:36,195 --> 00:07:37,196
Why did you do this?

81
00:07:39,264 --> 00:07:41,700
I asked you who you're working for!

82
00:07:43,469 --> 00:07:46,171
If you don't talk,
you'll never talk again.

83
00:07:48,607 --> 00:07:49,642
Who do you work for?

84
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:51,877
How did you get your hands
on that clip?

85
00:07:52,278 --> 00:07:55,281
Tell me why you did it!

86
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,653
I don't think it's the time
to discuss it.

87
00:08:01,687 --> 00:08:02,955
And why would you be angry with me?

88
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:04,290
This man is a friend of mine.

89
00:08:05,557 --> 00:08:07,126
The person you tried to murder is

90
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,827
a friend of mine!

91
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:15,668
I didn't know he was your friend.

92
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:18,102
More importantly, I had to do that

93
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:20,104
because he did something to me
he shouldn't have done.

94
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:21,106
What was it then?

95
00:08:23,175 --> 00:08:25,411
Was it about you ordering the slums
to be burned down 15 years ago?

96
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:31,050
Burning down the slums?
I don't know anything about that.

97
00:08:33,585 --> 00:08:35,454
Maya, let's talk later, okay?

98
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:39,425
This is what I'm going to make you
admit to everyone tonight.

99
00:08:39,725 --> 00:08:40,793
You did it.

100
00:08:42,928 --> 00:08:44,263
I've been waiting for 15 years.

101
00:08:45,464 --> 00:08:46,498
I'm not going to wait any longer.

102
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:54,473
Don't go anywhere!

103
00:08:55,274 --> 00:08:56,308
Stay here and listen, all of you.

104
00:08:57,309 --> 00:08:58,377
Or I'm going to shoot him.

105
00:09:03,349 --> 00:09:04,817
- Maya?
- I knew it.

106
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:07,219
You wouldn't admit
anything that easily.

107
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:10,656
Spit it out.

108
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:15,160
Say you made the order
to burn the slums down.

109
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:23,202
Say it. The same thing
you said to me.

110
00:09:23,902 --> 00:09:26,205
Say that the lives
of the poor are worthless.

111
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:29,375
That we're just dirty rats.

112
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:33,679
Say it! Exactly like
when you said it to me.

113
00:09:35,814 --> 00:09:38,350
What's going to happen
once the slums have burned down?

114
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:41,954
Spit it out.

115
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:45,691
Just like you did
to that little girl.

116
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:48,894
You killed my dad, didn't you?

117
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,664
You good-for-nothing scumbag!

118
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,299
Why did you burn my house down?

119
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,933
My dad died because of you!

120
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,401
Let go of me!

121
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:57,503
So what if I did?

122
00:09:57,836 --> 00:09:58,904
What can you do to me?

123
00:09:59,505 --> 00:10:01,106
You don't deserve to be there.

124
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:03,242
You were lucky you didn't die.

125
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,511
Let me go!

126
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:11,717
You're...

127
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:15,888
that filthy little brat

128
00:10:17,456 --> 00:10:20,125
who came into my house?

129
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,968
It was you?

130
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:33,606
I can't believe it.

131
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:37,509
You came into my life

132
00:10:39,678 --> 00:10:41,747
and seduced me because of this?

133
00:10:53,325 --> 00:10:54,360
How pathetic.

134
00:10:56,128 --> 00:10:57,463
Because it's all in vain.

135
00:10:58,497 --> 00:11:00,265
I did nothing wrong.

136
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,838
Even if you kill me now,

137
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,040
it would be in vain.

138
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:11,443
People will come
to my funeral in droves

139
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,379
and praise me

140
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:16,515
for all of the wonderful things
I've done.

141
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,551
As for you,

142
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:21,487
you'll be in jail.

143
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:24,456
You're going to rot in jail.

144
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,727
And the past will
finally be forgotten

145
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,230
because it's only

146
00:11:32,264 --> 00:11:34,667
a pile of trash.

147
00:11:40,706 --> 00:11:41,707
Shoot me.

148
00:11:42,408 --> 00:11:44,276
- Do it!
- Do you think I won't?

149
00:11:44,543 --> 00:11:45,678
Shoot me if you dare!

150
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:47,613
- Maya, stop!
- Say it now!

151
00:11:47,846 --> 00:11:49,081
- Enough!
- Kin!

152
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:50,349
Kin, don't!

153
00:11:54,386 --> 00:11:55,387
Maya, enough.

154
00:11:56,822 --> 00:11:57,823
It's over now.

155
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:12,603
(A Few Hours Ago)

156
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:13,606
Did you get it?

157
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:14,807
Yes, sir.

158
00:12:15,474 --> 00:12:18,711
You fool. Your search for evidence
led you to your death.

159
00:12:19,044 --> 00:12:21,046
It will just be...

160
00:12:22,181 --> 00:12:23,182
a rumor now on.

161
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,334
Why are you here?

162
00:12:42,868 --> 00:12:45,137
You don't remember anything at all?

163
00:12:47,406 --> 00:12:48,407
No.

164
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:51,644
All this time, I've been
following your father's orders.

165
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:56,815
I always believed
I was serving a criminal.

166
00:13:01,987 --> 00:13:02,988
In here,

167
00:13:03,489 --> 00:13:05,624
there's important data
I was able to recover.

168
00:13:05,824 --> 00:13:06,892
I believe you might find it useful.

169
00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:21,774
I've transferred
all the data to this.

170
00:13:37,022 --> 00:13:38,023
It's over, Dad.

171
00:13:38,757 --> 00:13:39,758
What are you talking about?

172
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,961
Play the clip for me.

173
00:13:42,194 --> 00:13:43,195
What clip?

174
00:13:43,729 --> 00:13:44,730
What is it about?

175
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:46,699
No, what is this clip?

176
00:13:49,301 --> 00:13:50,769
Kin, what are you doing?

177
00:13:52,071 --> 00:13:53,272
Do you think I've forgotten?

178
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:59,011
In fact, I haven't.

179
00:14:00,379 --> 00:14:01,380
What do you mean by that?

180
00:14:02,181 --> 00:14:03,248
I told you

181
00:14:04,283 --> 00:14:05,684
I have to tell everyone.

182
00:14:06,719 --> 00:14:08,420
Akin, you...

183
00:14:09,088 --> 00:14:10,422
You... don't play it!

184
00:14:10,756 --> 00:14:13,125
- Don't do it!
- I saw you hurting them,

185
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:14,927
and my memory became even clearer.

186
00:14:15,961 --> 00:14:17,096
Because I used to be
on the receiving end as well!

187
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,935
I meant to wait
until after the wedding.

188
00:14:24,103 --> 00:14:25,337
But since it's come to this,

189
00:14:27,139 --> 00:14:28,140
I can't wait any longer.

190
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:30,242
Play the clip!

191
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:32,211
- No!
- Play it!

192
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:33,679
I said no!

193
00:14:44,356 --> 00:14:45,891
You can't burn down their houses!

194
00:14:46,058 --> 00:14:47,293
Come here, young master!

195
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:48,894
Come on!

196
00:14:49,028 --> 00:14:50,329
- No, you can't!
- I said let go!

197
00:14:50,996 --> 00:14:51,996
Don't!

198
00:14:51,997 --> 00:14:53,132
- I said let go!
- How did you find this?

199
00:14:53,432 --> 00:14:54,900
- No!
- Where did you get it?

200
00:14:55,768 --> 00:14:56,769
Please stop!

201
00:14:57,303 --> 00:14:58,304
Who took it?

202
00:14:58,637 --> 00:14:59,672
No, you can't do it.

203
00:14:59,738 --> 00:15:00,873
What are you doing here?

204
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:03,642
I've been looking everywhere
for you. What are you doing?

205
00:15:04,777 --> 00:15:05,778
What are you doing?

206
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,814
We have to go to the airport.

207
00:15:10,249 --> 00:15:11,684
You can't burn down
those people's houses.

208
00:15:12,017 --> 00:15:13,252
And how does it concern you?

209
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:15,888
Do you want to be a good person?

210
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:21,260
Remember.

211
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:23,963
There's no place for good people.

212
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:34,106
Are you sure

213
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,743
you want to reveal
the truth to everyone

214
00:15:38,477 --> 00:15:39,478
after this?

215
00:15:40,846 --> 00:15:42,348
If you're still going to be weak

216
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:45,284
and too much of a coward
to do anything,

217
00:15:45,951 --> 00:15:47,252
you'll never get anything from me.

218
00:15:47,987 --> 00:15:51,857
Because you'll ruin
everything I've built!

219
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:53,392
No!

220
00:15:53,559 --> 00:15:54,560
Kin!

221
00:15:56,295 --> 00:15:57,296
I don't want to!

222
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,834
If you don't burn it down,

223
00:16:03,102 --> 00:16:04,737
I'm going to kill them all.

224
00:16:05,971 --> 00:16:06,972
Burn it!

225
00:16:07,873 --> 00:16:08,874
No, Dad!

226
00:16:09,808 --> 00:16:10,843
Burn it.

227
00:16:12,311 --> 00:16:13,312
Burn it!

228
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,914
- I don't have that much time!
- I don't want to!

229
00:16:24,757 --> 00:16:25,758
No!

230
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,760
No!

231
00:16:29,128 --> 00:16:30,462
No!

232
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:33,599
Don't!

233
00:16:34,767 --> 00:16:35,868
No!

234
00:16:58,524 --> 00:16:59,525
I'm sorry.

235
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,339
- Hey!
- Dad!

236
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:15,574
- Calm down, Dad.
- Step back.

237
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:17,876
- Let her go.
- Step back!

238
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,411
- All of you, step back!
- Dad!

239
00:17:20,112 --> 00:17:21,113
Step back!

240
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:23,148
Step back, all of you.

241
00:17:23,415 --> 00:17:24,583
- Kin, don't!
- Dad!

242
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:26,719
- Let her go, please.
- Step back!

243
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,355
- Step back!
- You've done enough! Let her go!

244
00:17:29,688 --> 00:17:30,689
Risa!

245
00:17:31,824 --> 00:17:32,825
Don't go after them!

246
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,094
I forbid you to be involved with
these people ever again.

247
00:17:35,928 --> 00:17:37,329
Come on. Let's go home.

248
00:17:39,598 --> 00:17:40,599
We're done here.

249
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:44,103
Come on.

250
00:17:47,139 --> 00:17:49,808
Your husband's ruined everything.

251
00:17:56,749 --> 00:17:57,783
I didn't have any part in this.

252
00:17:59,251 --> 00:18:01,086
I... I didn't...

253
00:18:02,588 --> 00:18:04,523
I've never known
about anything It did.

254
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,429
Dad, wait! Dad!

255
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:27,479
Let me go!

256
00:19:39,752 --> 00:19:41,587
Oh? Ma?

257
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:44,356
What's wrong? Why are you crying?

258
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:47,660
What happened? Why are you crying?

259
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,028
Oh? Dear!

260
00:19:49,628 --> 00:19:50,863
She's bleeding!

261
00:19:51,563 --> 00:19:54,700
Oh dear! Look at her!
See what's wrong with her!

262
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:57,770
Huh? It's just a small cut.

263
00:19:58,537 --> 00:19:59,805
- Are you okay?
- You'll be fine.

264
00:20:00,439 --> 00:20:01,540
You're not going to die.

265
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:05,010
What? She's crying. She's hurt.

266
00:20:05,344 --> 00:20:09,315
Look at her. Is the cut deep?
Does she need stitches?

267
00:20:09,682 --> 00:20:12,318
What are you thinking, Bua?
We can't afford that.

268
00:20:16,755 --> 00:20:17,756
Let me see.

269
00:20:18,557 --> 00:20:20,025
I'll blow on it.

270
00:20:20,859 --> 00:20:23,696
Oh, it's okay.

271
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:28,667
I'm sorry for telling you off.

272
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:31,737
Okay? But you have to remember

273
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:33,439
to toughen up,

274
00:20:35,007 --> 00:20:36,442
or we won't survive.

275
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:40,379
We've still got
a tough life ahead.

276
00:20:43,749 --> 00:20:44,750
We're poor.

277
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:47,219
The poor will keep getting bullied.

278
00:20:48,687 --> 00:20:49,989
I want you to be strong

279
00:20:50,856 --> 00:20:52,324
so you'll be able
to keep fighting in life.

280
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:55,160
I love you, Ma.

281
00:21:00,899 --> 00:21:03,268
Ma?

282
00:21:04,436 --> 00:21:06,905
Ma?

283
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,212
- Mom?
- Ma.

284
00:21:16,115 --> 00:21:17,116
Dad?

285
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:21,253
Maya?

286
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:30,663
Maya?

287
00:21:31,497 --> 00:21:34,166
- Maya?
- Ma'am, are you okay?

288
00:21:45,177 --> 00:21:47,012
- All done.
- Thank you.

289
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,483
- Can you give us a moment?
- Of course.

290
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:57,189
Are you okay?

291
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:00,559
I'm all right.

292
00:22:06,131 --> 00:22:07,866
You said you were sorry.

293
00:22:10,102 --> 00:22:12,037
Please don't blame yourself.

294
00:22:13,138 --> 00:22:14,506
You didn't do anything wrong.

295
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:20,579
But at least, we've found out

296
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,949
what the wound in your heart is.

297
00:22:29,655 --> 00:22:30,723
Your method worked.

298
00:22:32,091 --> 00:22:33,359
It helped me remember everything.

299
00:22:35,594 --> 00:22:37,062
But it wasn't right.

300
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,534
It hurt you.

301
00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:45,037
It made you feel horrible.

302
00:22:46,472 --> 00:22:47,473
It's me

303
00:22:48,774 --> 00:22:49,908
who should be apologizing.

304
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:53,879
It's okay.

305
00:22:57,149 --> 00:22:58,984
I also remember you were that girl.

306
00:23:00,052 --> 00:23:02,821
You ran into my house to demand
justice for your family.

307
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,259
I understand

308
00:23:08,427 --> 00:23:10,362
why you did everything.

309
00:23:15,334 --> 00:23:16,335
That little girl...

310
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:20,606
was named Mayawee.

311
00:23:22,975 --> 00:23:24,410
She's also known as "Ma".

312
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:30,049
You met her
when you were younger

313
00:23:31,984 --> 00:23:33,686
before the terrible incident.

314
00:23:36,488 --> 00:23:37,990
You were very good at soccer.

315
00:23:43,896 --> 00:23:44,897
You're so good!

316
00:23:51,603 --> 00:23:52,604
That girl.

317
00:23:53,806 --> 00:23:55,007
Thank you so much

318
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:58,978
for helping a girl who had no hope

319
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:00,879
of finding happiness.

320
00:24:03,949 --> 00:24:05,818
You helped her feel
like she had a brother.

321
00:24:07,987 --> 00:24:09,555
And if that brother of hers would

322
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:13,225
keep her in his heart forever,

323
00:24:14,226 --> 00:24:15,995
she'd probably be very happy.

324
00:24:20,566 --> 00:24:21,567
I'm sorry

325
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:24,169
for coming into your life,

326
00:24:25,437 --> 00:24:26,572
lying to you,

327
00:24:29,275 --> 00:24:30,342
and hurting you.

328
00:24:33,345 --> 00:24:34,947
There's nothing truthful

329
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,449
about what's happened,

330
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:40,352
even our feelings.

331
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:47,559
I wish you a good life

332
00:24:51,096 --> 00:24:53,065
from now on.

333
00:25:01,941 --> 00:25:03,442
Let's get you to a hospital.

334
00:25:04,276 --> 00:25:05,911
Sure. But...

335
00:25:06,478 --> 00:25:08,447
can you drop me off
at a different one?

336
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:09,515
Of course.

337
00:25:12,551 --> 00:25:13,752
Akin.

338
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:18,457
You don't have
to come with me anymore.

339
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,761
And after this,

340
00:25:24,897 --> 00:25:27,933
please go and enjoy
your life without me.

341
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,257
All done. We're ready to go.

342
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:20,919
Ow. Ow!

343
00:26:22,588 --> 00:26:24,490
Ow!

344
00:26:25,591 --> 00:26:26,625
Let go of me!

345
00:26:27,459 --> 00:26:28,460
Let me go!

346
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:30,229
Argh!

347
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:31,930
Help!

348
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:33,365
Help!

349
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,368
Anyone, help me!

350
00:26:36,835 --> 00:26:38,337
Why would you tie me up?

351
00:26:39,104 --> 00:26:41,307
I'm in pain all over!

352
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:43,709
Anyone, please help me!

353
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,178
Where is everyone?

354
00:26:47,112 --> 00:26:48,180
Hey!

355
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:49,982
Hey!

356
00:26:57,189 --> 00:26:59,258
Anyone, help me!

357
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,494
Anyone, please!

358
00:27:04,296 --> 00:27:07,166
Please! I'm in agony!

359
00:27:09,468 --> 00:27:10,469
Dad?

360
00:27:12,104 --> 00:27:13,105
Dad.

361
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,441
Dad!

362
00:27:17,109 --> 00:27:18,110
Dad!

363
00:27:19,178 --> 00:27:20,579
Please, help me!

364
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:24,083
Help me!

365
00:27:26,485 --> 00:27:27,853
I want to die!

366
00:27:29,154 --> 00:27:30,255
I want to die!

367
00:27:30,923 --> 00:27:32,291
I want to die!

368
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:48,007
Mom, Dad, it's all over now.

369
00:27:49,308 --> 00:27:52,578
The person who did this to us
has faced the consequences.

370
00:27:53,545 --> 00:27:54,647
You don't have to worry anymore.

371
00:28:01,153 --> 00:28:03,789
I believe you're both
always with me.

372
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:09,328
And someday,
we'll see each other again.

373
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:25,778
I'm not running away from you.
I just moved, that's all.

374
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:30,282
Besides, I have to take care of Indy
and look for Kongkwan.

375
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:32,017
Ma,

376
00:28:32,952 --> 00:28:33,986
have you seen the news?

377
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,921
What news?

378
00:28:36,021 --> 00:28:39,525
Someone found a burned skeleton
in the forest.

379
00:28:40,592 --> 00:28:42,361
The police have
a lead on the culprit.

380
00:28:43,829 --> 00:28:45,698
There are comments on social media

381
00:28:46,999 --> 00:28:48,000
saying he works for Saksit.

382
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:51,837
Don't tell me it's Kwan.

383
00:28:52,738 --> 00:28:53,739
I don't know.

384
00:28:55,708 --> 00:28:58,477
I couldn't bear to keep watching
when the skeleton appeared.

385
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:00,846
I'm scared.

386
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,583
I'm scared I'll see something that
confirms it's Kwan.

387
00:29:06,218 --> 00:29:08,754
And have the police arrested Saksit?

388
00:29:09,722 --> 00:29:10,723
I have no idea.

389
00:29:11,957 --> 00:29:15,394
It's so obvious, but I don't know
if the cops can do anything to him.

390
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:18,263
Ma,

391
00:29:19,064 --> 00:29:22,134
we have to try and do something
before he gets away.

392
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,041
Saksit,

393
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,911
you didn't kill your ex-wife
like they're saying online, did you?

394
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,581
What are you doing?

395
00:29:36,482 --> 00:29:37,483
Are you running away?

396
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:42,788
Then you're admitting it.

397
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:48,127
You're leaving me with the backlash
that I'm a scumbag like you?

398
00:29:48,527 --> 00:29:49,995
Are you criticizing me right now?

399
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:51,697
As if you're a good person!

400
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,601
Saksit!

401
00:29:56,568 --> 00:29:59,038
It's always been the two of us
since we were young!

402
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:03,108
I'm on your side no matter what!

403
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:05,544
Please don't go!

404
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:10,648
I'll have no one else left
if you go!

405
00:30:10,649 --> 00:30:12,785
- Please!
- Hey!

406
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:15,754
Be with your husband!
Aren't you two very much in love?

407
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:18,891
He never loved me!
Let him die for all I care!

408
00:30:20,192 --> 00:30:21,193
Saksit!

409
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:24,897
Even if you're behind it,

410
00:30:25,631 --> 00:30:27,466
I'll still be on your side.

411
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:30,536
- Don't go! Let's start over!
- Ugh! Get off me!

412
00:30:30,903 --> 00:30:32,770
Like how we always do!

413
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:35,074
- Don't leave me!
- Let go!

414
00:30:35,841 --> 00:30:38,377
Are you going to be a burden
until the very last second?

415
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,412
Let me tell you!

416
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,449
You'd ruin it all again
if we started over!

417
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:44,950
You're a loser!

418
00:30:45,684 --> 00:30:48,487
I'd rather have a koala
for a sister!

419
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,423
From this moment on,

420
00:30:52,224 --> 00:30:54,593
we have no ties to each other!
We'll go our separate ways!

421
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:58,497
Saksit! Please don't go!

422
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:08,741
Saksit!

423
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,717
Please come with us
for questioning at the station.

424
00:31:19,385 --> 00:31:20,486
And why do I have to go?

425
00:31:21,086 --> 00:31:22,154
I didn't do anything wrong.

426
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:24,556
And even if I was in the wrong,

427
00:31:25,824 --> 00:31:27,226
you wouldn't be able
to lay a finger on me.

428
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:29,795
I'm close to the top brass.

429
00:31:30,396 --> 00:31:31,997
But I don't think
you'll get away this time.

430
00:31:32,364 --> 00:31:33,866
It's made national headlines.

431
00:31:34,199 --> 00:31:35,968
And the whole country is
keeping a close watch,

432
00:31:36,268 --> 00:31:37,269
Saksit.

433
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:39,672
And how is this
any of your business?

434
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:50,082
All right. Let's do it this way.
I'd like you all to leave my house.

435
00:31:50,516 --> 00:31:51,517
I'm afraid not.

436
00:31:52,051 --> 00:31:54,353
According to the forensic
examination of the burned skeleton,

437
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,657
the results show that the deceased
was an ex-wife of yours.

438
00:31:59,758 --> 00:32:03,228
We've also received a lead that
you might've murdered her here.

439
00:32:03,729 --> 00:32:07,499
And we were able to trace
her phone's signal to this place

440
00:32:07,666 --> 00:32:09,101
when her relative came
to file a report.

441
00:32:09,568 --> 00:32:11,971
Our speculation is that this is
the last place she visited.

442
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:13,739
Where's my friend?

443
00:32:17,443 --> 00:32:18,811
I asked you a question!

444
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:26,852
Officers, please hurry
and search the house.

445
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,821
I believe my friend is here.

446
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,625
We'll have to search the house.

447
00:32:33,325 --> 00:32:34,326
Here's the warrant.

448
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:38,864
This has nothing to do with me.
I'll see myself out.

449
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:41,734
Where do you think you're going,
you stuck-up snob?

450
00:32:43,335 --> 00:32:45,237
I believe you're
directly involved in it.

451
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:49,775
I hate her so much.

452
00:32:50,809 --> 00:32:53,178
I hate her, so, so much.

453
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:57,950
I really should've just killed her.

454
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:01,020
I should've just killed her!

455
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:04,556
I shouldn't have just asked you to
send someone over to beat her up!

456
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,761
Are you hard of hearing?

457
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:10,596
Try listening to it closely.

458
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:14,633
That's it! Now, are you going to
insist you're not involved?

459
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,602
You sent someone
to beat my friend up,

460
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,504
and you intended to kill her too!

461
00:33:18,637 --> 00:33:21,006
- You harlot!
- Is that so? Bring it on!

462
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:22,907
Come on!

463
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:24,176
Maya, you!

464
00:33:24,977 --> 00:33:25,978
You!

465
00:33:26,512 --> 00:33:28,314
You made me lose everything.

466
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:32,551
You made me lose everyone I love!

467
00:33:33,752 --> 00:33:35,853
You destroyed everything in my life!

468
00:33:35,854 --> 00:33:38,290
- Now I have nothing left!
- Calm down!

469
00:33:38,357 --> 00:33:39,391
You!

470
00:33:39,658 --> 00:33:42,161
- Let go of me!
- Get her out of here!

471
00:33:42,661 --> 00:33:44,330
- Let go of me! Maya!
- Get her out!

472
00:33:45,297 --> 00:33:47,433
- Maya!
- Come with us.

473
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,803
Go and be a snob in prison!

474
00:33:51,971 --> 00:33:52,972
Officers,

475
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:55,274
please search the house.
I'm very worried about my friend.

476
00:33:55,541 --> 00:33:56,542
- Let's go then.
- Okay.

477
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:59,478
And remember, both of you!

478
00:33:59,845 --> 00:34:02,781
If anything happened to my friend,
I will never let this go!

479
00:34:04,116 --> 00:34:05,117
Jerks!

480
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:10,889
- Kwan!
- Kwan!

481
00:34:13,325 --> 00:34:14,360
- Have you found her?
- No.

482
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,228
- Captain.
- Yes?

483
00:34:16,562 --> 00:34:17,863
We've located Saksit's wife.

484
00:34:19,198 --> 00:34:20,199
You've found my friend?

485
00:34:22,001 --> 00:34:24,503
Kwan? Kwan!

486
00:34:25,437 --> 00:34:26,572
- Kwan!
- Sofia!

487
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:27,940
Maya!

488
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:36,248
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry.

489
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:38,517
I'll get you out of here, okay?

490
00:34:38,717 --> 00:34:40,586
Don't leave me again, okay?

491
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,423
Don't leave me, please!

492
00:34:46,058 --> 00:34:47,159
Please!

493
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:50,296
Don't leave me!

494
00:34:51,096 --> 00:34:52,598
Don't go anywhere!

495
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:53,866
I promise!

496
00:35:06,745 --> 00:35:08,480
We've patted her down.
She's unarmed, sir.

497
00:35:10,883 --> 00:35:11,884
Have a seat.

498
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,391
After everything you've done,

499
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:22,094
you still asked
to meet me in private.

500
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:25,297
I really respect your tenacity.

501
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,970
I'm not surprised you were able
to put It in his place like that.

502
00:35:32,871 --> 00:35:35,541
All right. How can I help you today?

503
00:35:38,344 --> 00:35:40,646
(A List of Names of the Slum Victims
Affected by the Arson)

504
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,350
Here's a list of names
of all the people in the slums.

505
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,753
I asked you to help improve
the quality of their life

506
00:35:48,454 --> 00:35:50,222
according to the policy
you proposed.

507
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:54,393
But it seems that it never happened.

508
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:59,365
And do you really think that
one minister, like myself,

509
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:00,966
can make an order

510
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,669
and that society will
instantly improve?

511
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,804
You have to give it time.

512
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,806
But you can't wait
when it's people's lives.

513
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:12,378
I know we can't just rely
on those in power.

514
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:16,682
Anyway, while I wait
for you to do your part,

515
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:20,319
an individual like me will
do her best

516
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:23,989
to improve their lives as well.

517
00:36:26,292 --> 00:36:27,760
I want to give them hope

518
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:32,031
that their lives don't exist
just to help politicians win votes.

519
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:36,035
This has been an undeniable fact
for many years.

520
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,641
Okay. I'll receive your request.

521
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,178
And if there's nothing else,

522
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,081
please.

523
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:55,054
I'd like everyone's life to be
hopeful.

524
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:57,790
And I hope that someday,

525
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,292
you'll feel the same way I do now,

526
00:37:00,893 --> 00:37:01,894
Mr. Minister.

527
00:37:19,678 --> 00:37:20,679
Mom,

528
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:24,516
I'm afraid I'll have to break
the promise you asked me to keep

529
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,753
because I couldn't protect anything.

530
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:32,257
In fact, I had no right to do that

531
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:35,561
because we shouldn't have possessed
those things in the first place.

532
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:38,530
Both the land
and the mall were built

533
00:37:38,964 --> 00:37:40,699
at the cost of human lives.

534
00:37:42,067 --> 00:37:43,502
They shouldn't have been ours.

535
00:37:44,803 --> 00:37:45,938
I, Akin Itsarapat,

536
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:49,208
would like to resign
from all positions at Itsara Group.

537
00:37:50,175 --> 00:37:52,044
The resignation is
effective immediately.

538
00:37:52,278 --> 00:37:54,380
Why did you have to
since you're not in the wrong?

539
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:55,447
What happened?

540
00:37:55,748 --> 00:37:57,850
That's right. And who's going to
take over from you?

541
00:37:58,083 --> 00:37:59,417
That's right. Who?

542
00:37:59,418 --> 00:38:04,222
- Give us an answer, please.
- Akin?

543
00:38:04,223 --> 00:38:07,126
I believe you'll agree
with my decision

544
00:38:08,294 --> 00:38:10,095
because choosing to do what's right

545
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,631
is the type of courage

546
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:15,000
you wanted me to have.

547
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,705
I did it, Indy.

548
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:22,408
Right now,

549
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:24,610
those crooks have faced

550
00:38:25,778 --> 00:38:27,680
the consequences of their actions.

551
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:30,950
It is in agony,

552
00:38:31,884 --> 00:38:33,352
like he's in a living hell.

553
00:38:36,855 --> 00:38:37,890
I did it.

554
00:38:46,098 --> 00:38:47,099
Right now,

555
00:38:48,233 --> 00:38:50,269
it's almost a happy ending
for everything.

556
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,641
There's only you.

557
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,613
I want to talk to you,

558
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,982
like how you used to talk to me.

559
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,855
I want you to open your eyes

560
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:13,826
so you can keep living a happy life.

561
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:23,502
Wake up, Indy.

562
00:39:25,437 --> 00:39:26,639
Please!

563
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:44,089
Indy?

564
00:39:45,024 --> 00:39:47,159
Nurse!

565
00:39:49,662 --> 00:39:50,663
Indy!

566
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:04,410
I got lucky, thanks to my beauty.

567
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:07,446
That's why he kept me alive
and didn't kill me.

568
00:40:08,514 --> 00:40:10,649
That's true.
You're lucky you're pretty,

569
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,852
or you would've been
another dead body in his house.

570
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,287
Are you trying to jinx me?

571
00:40:16,689 --> 00:40:17,690
It sounds like it, doesn't it?

572
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:21,927
But I didn't expect him
to be such a scumbag.

573
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:25,130
There's probably a lot more
about him we still don't know.

574
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:29,268
But I'm curious as to
what's on his ex-wife's phone.

575
00:40:29,601 --> 00:40:32,204
She used it to blackmail him
for money but got killed instead.

576
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,810
There were photos and videos

577
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,312
when he slept with children.

578
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:44,216
They were still young.

579
00:40:45,684 --> 00:40:46,685
There were many too.

580
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:50,155
- He's evil beyond all reason.
- Oh gosh.

581
00:40:51,223 --> 00:40:52,558
What are you going to do now?

582
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:57,229
I don't know.
I'll think about it later.

583
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,232
I'm worried if I asked Sofia
to find me another rich man,

584
00:41:00,532 --> 00:41:02,868
she'll bring me
another psycho again.

585
00:41:03,302 --> 00:41:06,138
Okay. I guess the fault is all mine.

586
00:41:06,472 --> 00:41:08,173
- Indeed.
- I'm really sorry

587
00:41:08,574 --> 00:41:10,476
for finding you such a scumbag.

588
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,945
But when I let you try on your own,
you couldn't find anyone.

589
00:41:13,112 --> 00:41:14,113
Sofia.

590
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:15,681
That's the second time already.

591
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:18,951
Anyway, we still have a lot of time
to think about it.

592
00:41:19,318 --> 00:41:21,120
Judging from the kind of crimes
Saksit committed,

593
00:41:21,754 --> 00:41:23,722
he'll probably be
in prison for a while.

594
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:26,358
But I do know
where he hid his money.

595
00:41:27,293 --> 00:41:28,394
Once things quiet down,

596
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,929
I'll secretly spend his money.

597
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:32,631
Easy-peasy.

598
00:41:33,132 --> 00:41:35,034
You can call me Maharani.

599
00:41:35,434 --> 00:41:37,670
You almost got beaten to death,
yet you still...

600
00:41:38,637 --> 00:41:40,272
The worst person in this
is really you.

601
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,541
Just don't come to me
and beg for a new bag.

602
00:41:47,179 --> 00:41:50,015
Anyway, I'm happy you get to
turn over a new leaf.

603
00:41:52,017 --> 00:41:53,419
Thank you so much

604
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:55,054
for not abandoning me.

605
00:41:56,121 --> 00:41:59,358
And congratulations for your success
in dealing with It's family.

606
00:42:02,594 --> 00:42:03,629
I guess I didn't do anything.

607
00:42:03,963 --> 00:42:07,700
- Aw!
- I'm sorry.

608
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,169
I didn't expect

609
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:13,005
I'd land you in such a mess.

610
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:17,543
I love you.

611
00:42:20,779 --> 00:42:22,247
I've learned a lot from it.

612
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:27,219
Nothing can be gained
without giving something away.

613
00:42:28,253 --> 00:42:32,257
And I won't take the easy,
sneaky way to earn money again.

614
00:42:33,058 --> 00:42:37,463
Our lives are going to be full
of good things and happiness now!

615
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:40,399
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

616
00:42:41,533 --> 00:42:42,568
We're going to be rich!

617
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,447
Ma, thank you so much

618
00:42:56,081 --> 00:42:57,483
for everything you've done for me.

619
00:43:00,052 --> 00:43:02,388
And what are you going to do now?

620
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,724
You're not going
to leave me, are you?

621
00:43:07,059 --> 00:43:09,695
Gee, where would I go?

622
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,030
All I did was move.

623
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:17,169
I think I'll do things
I can handle from now on.

624
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:19,571
I want to help kids in need.

625
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:24,476
I might go and give
free music lessons in the slums.

626
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:28,914
At least it might provide them
with an opportunity.

627
00:43:29,348 --> 00:43:30,482
That's probably all I can do.

628
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:33,686
An opportunity can

629
00:43:34,353 --> 00:43:36,355
help change a lot of people's
lives for the better.

630
00:43:39,291 --> 00:43:40,292
As for me,

631
00:43:42,027 --> 00:43:43,329
I won't go anywhere either.

632
00:43:44,463 --> 00:43:46,265
I'll stay here and look after you
for the rest of our lives,

633
00:43:47,433 --> 00:43:49,101
no matter our relationship status.

634
00:43:49,635 --> 00:43:52,738
I promise I'll never leave you.

635
00:43:53,706 --> 00:43:54,707
Thanks so much.

636
00:43:57,209 --> 00:43:58,210
Oh, right.

637
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,346
This is for you.

638
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:03,582
- Thanks.
- Mm.

639
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:47,226
I think it's time
you moved on from him.

640
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:50,963
His family is
facing a lot of lawsuits.

641
00:44:52,131 --> 00:44:54,800
We shouldn't risk
our family's reputation.

642
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:57,269
It's good that things
turned out this way.

643
00:44:59,271 --> 00:45:01,340
I'm actually happier.

644
00:45:05,678 --> 00:45:08,547
I'm finally getting
to live the life I want.

645
00:45:10,950 --> 00:45:15,721
I hope you'll finally stop using me
as leverage in business dealings.

646
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:20,125
But I'm doing everything
for your sake.

647
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:26,065
If you really want
to do things for my sake,

648
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,802
then can I ask for one thing?

649
00:45:33,038 --> 00:45:34,807
Please give me freedom in life.

650
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:43,182
If you choose someone compatible
with me based on their wealth,

651
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:47,019
I might end up with someone
who doesn't love me again.

652
00:45:48,887 --> 00:45:49,888
I'm tired of it.

653
00:46:00,866 --> 00:46:01,867
I'm sorry.

654
00:46:04,203 --> 00:46:06,105
I... I thought

655
00:46:07,706 --> 00:46:09,341
you were happy.

656
00:46:13,779 --> 00:46:15,681
I was never truly happy.

657
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:21,887
Please let me have my freedom.

658
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:35,668
I love you.

659
00:46:44,643 --> 00:46:45,844
I love you very much.

660
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:32,591
Hello?

661
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:51,410
Why did you call me so many times?

662
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,881
Can you take me somewhere?

663
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:58,350
Where?

664
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,020
Anywhere you want to take me to.

665
00:48:04,790 --> 00:48:05,791
Risa?

666
00:48:08,227 --> 00:48:09,228
Where are you going?

667
00:48:10,195 --> 00:48:11,530
You promised

668
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:14,099
you'd let me live my life freely.

669
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,341
Let's go.

670
00:49:17,229 --> 00:49:20,332
(One Year Later)

671
00:49:20,399 --> 00:49:22,667
(Psychological Assessments)

672
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:24,036
- Akin.
- Yes?

673
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:28,907
Your condition has improved a lot.

674
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:32,011
And I believe it's going to
keep improving.

675
00:49:32,845 --> 00:49:33,846
Thank you.

676
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:35,681
I admire that you've

677
00:49:36,048 --> 00:49:38,017
started new things on your own.

678
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:42,454
As for the young patients
receiving psychiatric treatment

679
00:49:42,788 --> 00:49:45,057
as part of your project,

680
00:49:45,324 --> 00:49:47,726
their lives have
improved a lot as well.

681
00:49:49,161 --> 00:49:51,497
I think childhood is
the most important time

682
00:49:52,097 --> 00:49:53,465
because it's the starting point
of everything.

683
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,602
Right, I completely forgot.

684
00:49:57,069 --> 00:49:58,470
Do you mind if I have
a look at your hand?

685
00:49:59,405 --> 00:50:00,406
Oh, sure.

686
00:50:02,308 --> 00:50:04,543
That's great. There's no mark.

687
00:50:05,911 --> 00:50:08,013
- All right. I have to get back.
- Sure.

688
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:21,987
It was coincidental when we met
for the very first time as kids.

689
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,226
But the reunion was my intention.

690
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,530
But from now on,
I guess it's up to destiny.

691
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:34,300
I hope that
if we get to see each other again,

692
00:51:34,967 --> 00:51:39,471
it won't be to hurt each other
and leave our hearts wounded.
