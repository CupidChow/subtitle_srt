1
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:23,890
Maya!

2
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,113
Do it if you have the guts!

3
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,061
Help!

4
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,532
I've been waiting for 15 years
for this moment.

5
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,335
No, let me go!

6
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,036
I have to defeat my fear

7
00:01:10,136 --> 00:01:11,538
to confront my enemy.

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,377
And all of you will have to pay
for what you did to my family.

9
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,174
(Six Months Ago)

10
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,125
Who's your brother
marrying this time?

11
00:03:12,992 --> 00:03:14,027
I've never heard of her.

12
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:17,864
She's half his age.
What was she thinking?

13
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:22,202
But she's quite pretty.

14
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,603
So what?

15
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,739
Can she help with our business?

16
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:28,441
People are gossiping

17
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,477
that each girl your brother marries
is younger than the last.

18
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,379
Pervert.

19
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:36,149
We've merged into one family now.

20
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:38,952
Reputation is important.

21
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,920
Remind him.

22
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:45,225
He just wants to solve
his family issues.

23
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:50,230
He kept getting into fights
and was at odds with his ex-wife.

24
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,931
If things kept going like that

25
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:54,367
I think it would've done

26
00:03:54,668 --> 00:03:56,703
more harm than good
to our company's reputation.

27
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,271
And do you think this is better?

28
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,242
They're not even here yet.

29
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,114
- Hold on, Kin.
- Hm?

30
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,950
We're here at someone else's wedding
as an engaged couple.

31
00:04:11,618 --> 00:04:13,286
We have to have
matching engagement rings.

32
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,795
Let's go. My parents are waiting.

33
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:23,863
- Okay.
- Let's go.

34
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,538
Don't make that face.

35
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:33,406
What kind of face?

36
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:34,507
Like that.

37
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:40,280
People might start believing
the rumors that we're having issues.

38
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:42,082
And that's not the case at all.

39
00:04:46,052 --> 00:04:47,287
I understand you're a bit

40
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:51,725
upset about my brother
getting married again

41
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:54,828
because it's not a good look
for our company.

42
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,398
But soon,

43
00:04:58,698 --> 00:05:00,667
Kin and Risa
are going to get married.

44
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,670
Risa's the daughter of a minister.

45
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,439
It's our family's next wedding.

46
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,608
You should be happy about it.

47
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:11,678
We'll see when the time comes.

48
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,914
Oh.

49
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:16,249
Speak of the devil.

50
00:05:16,383 --> 00:05:18,284
- Hi.
- Risa!

51
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,919
I'm sorry we're late.

52
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,121
I took a long time
to pick out an outfit.

53
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:23,623
I wanted to dress appropriately
for the occasion.

54
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:25,759
It's not a problem at all.

55
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,496
You look beautiful tonight.

56
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:31,264
Thank you.

57
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:33,466
I'm dressed

58
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:35,135
according to Kin's preference.

59
00:05:37,203 --> 00:05:39,205
All right. Is everyone ready?

60
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:40,206
- Let's head inside.
- Sure.

61
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,341
Let's go.

62
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,381
Thank you.

63
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:52,485
So, is my bride beautiful?

64
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,754
- Yes, she is.
- Yes, she is.

65
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,222
Where did you two meet?

66
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:57,557
If you ask me where,

67
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,326
I have to say destiny
brought us together.

68
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,829
Aw.

69
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,200
Do you mind if I touch up
the bride's make-up?

70
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,571
Hey.

71
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,306
Smile a little.

72
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,709
This isn't your first wedding.

73
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,811
It's so uncomfortable.

74
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:20,246
Up your game
if you don't want to be poor.

75
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,984
- You're so beautiful!
- Thank you!

76
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:27,554
Bravo.

77
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:30,690
Congratulations, Saksit.

78
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:34,160
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

79
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:35,762
Let's take some photos.

80
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,134
Okay. Look here, please.

81
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,235
Smile.

82
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,904
Great. It looks good.

83
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,491
The bride and groom are over there.

84
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,561
But why are you so fascinated
by the music?

85
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,397
You know I'm fond of
classical music.

86
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,232
Hm?

87
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,539
Just like that.

88
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:28,575
As you've seen in the news.

89
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,343
That's right.

90
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:39,919
- Hey.
- Hm?

91
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,455
Wanchai wants to talk to you.

92
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,124
Oh, where is he?

93
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,725
Over there. Do you want to come?

94
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:59,339
You've been staring at my dad
for a while now.

95
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,708
Do you need something from him?

96
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,280
I don't think so.

97
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,416
Your father is very talented.

98
00:09:10,817 --> 00:09:12,652
I just want to get to know him.

99
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:15,989
I don't think it's a good time.

100
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,458
There are plenty
of important guests here.

101
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,527
My mom's over there as well.

102
00:09:22,095 --> 00:09:23,463
If you approach him,

103
00:09:24,831 --> 00:09:25,899
people might wonder

104
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,336
who you are, a complete stranger,

105
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,140
and whether you caused the rift
between my parents like the rumor.

106
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:36,276
I understand

107
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,244
everyone wants to approach

108
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,613
a rich entrepreneur like my dad.

109
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:43,516
But this isn't a good time.

110
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:46,720
Let's not make him look bad.

111
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:48,955
I understand your point.

112
00:09:50,223 --> 00:09:51,791
And I don't think

113
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:53,393
the rumor is true either.

114
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:55,528
Your parents seem to be

115
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,430
very much in love.

116
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:00,900
Besides,

117
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,470
I hope

118
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:05,472
that I won't be

119
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,775
a stranger to you not much longer.

120
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,711
So who are you?

121
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,752
Hi.

122
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:21,254
Are you a friend of Kin's?

123
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,189
Oh, no.

124
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,125
She was just asking about Dad.

125
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:26,693
Oh, I see.

126
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:28,495
Should we head inside?

127
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,363
The bride's about
to toss the bouquet.

128
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,632
If I manage to catch it,

129
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,467
the next wedding might be ours.

130
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:35,969
Shall we?

131
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,072
- Sure.
- I'm afraid we'll have to go now.

132
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:40,940
No problem.

133
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:52,485
All right. It's that time
the ladies have been waiting for.

134
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:54,988
Which single lady is
going to be the lucky one

135
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,691
to catch the bride's bouquet?

136
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,126
The next wedding

137
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:03,530
could be yours.

138
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:07,067
Well then. All the single ladies,

139
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,136
please approach the stage
and join in on the fun.

140
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:12,072
- Come on over.
- Kin, hold this.

141
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,040
- Sure.
- I'm going to catch it.

142
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,545
This isn't
an ordinary flower bouquet.

143
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,748
Our bride secretly told me

144
00:11:21,748 --> 00:11:25,285
there's a bit of cash in there

145
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:28,455
valued at 100,000 baht.

146
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:30,390
All right.

147
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:32,125
Is everyone ready?

148
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:33,293
Let me hear it loud and clear.

149
00:11:33,393 --> 00:11:34,861
- Okay!
- Okay!

150
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,429
Are you ready?

151
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:38,098
- Yes!
- Yes!

152
00:11:38,298 --> 00:11:41,434
Okay. Let's start the countdown.

153
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,571
All right. Who's going to get it?

154
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:47,640
Five, four, three,

155
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,376
two, one!

156
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,223
Ah!

157
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:07,093
It seems we've found our lucky lady.

158
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:09,029
Wait. Where are you going?

159
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,664
...cash valued at 100,000 baht.

160
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm not going to forget about
what happened.

161
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,637
Here, my dear friend. It's for you.

162
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,240
And it seems

163
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,678
that our lucky lady has given
the bouquet to a friend.

164
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:27,714
How lovely.

165
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:31,017
All right.
Let's invite our lucky lady

166
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:33,086
onto the stage.

167
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,771
I wasn't serious before.

168
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:53,273
Because you're going to

169
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,241
marry me anyway.

170
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:56,976
Am I right?

171
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,479
Should I buy you a bouquet?

172
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:00,880
Do you even have to ask?

173
00:13:05,385 --> 00:13:06,853
Congratulations.

174
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,527
- Thank you.
- Go ahead, please.

175
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,263
Do you know her?

176
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,934
You both look great tonight.

177
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:25,105
So lovely.

178
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:38,785
I knew you'd follow me here.

179
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:40,820
Sofia.

180
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:43,056
Actually, no.

181
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:44,791
Sophee.

182
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,059
What do you want?

183
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:47,827
Why did you come to the wedding?

184
00:13:49,696 --> 00:13:50,697
That's right.

185
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:52,665
I stole your money.

186
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:54,034
But it was necessary.

187
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,002
Didn't you steal my man too?

188
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:58,738
It's even now.
We're both scumbags.

189
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,140
I didn't steal your man.

190
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,641
He approached me first.

191
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,778
But I didn't know you were
seeing each other then.

192
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:05,879
Liar.

193
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:07,947
You wanted him because he's rich.

194
00:14:08,748 --> 00:14:10,950
But didn't we both miss out
on him in the end?

195
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,152
So?

196
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,154
What do you want then?

197
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,792
If it's money you want,

198
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:20,427
I'll transfer it back to you.

199
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,761
But if you're in a rush,

200
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,197
then you can just take this.

201
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:25,765
And can you just leave me alone?

202
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,435
I've already come this far.
I won't go back to being poor.

203
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:30,337
And when I was poor,

204
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:33,239
you probably know
what I had to go through.

205
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,410
So why did you dare to steal
my money and run away?

206
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:38,912
You scumbag of a friend?

207
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,581
That's right. I'm a scumbag.

208
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:44,417
But not tonight!

209
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:47,053
Don't you understand
how hard it's been for me

210
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,755
and what kind of life I long for?

211
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:51,725
Why do you have
to take revenge on me tonight?

212
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,427
I haven't been waiting for tonight

213
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:56,696
just to demand money back from you.

214
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,978
I know for a fact

215
00:15:12,545 --> 00:15:13,680
that Kongkwan

216
00:15:14,614 --> 00:15:17,050
or Kwan, your friend

217
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,052
used to be a prostitute as well.

218
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:24,257
So do you think

219
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,160
the wedding will be ruined

220
00:15:27,827 --> 00:15:29,095
if Saksit, her groom,

221
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:32,198
finds out about it?

222
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:35,568
You're such a pain.

223
00:15:42,976 --> 00:15:44,010
Tell me what you want!

224
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,212
Well, if you managed

225
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:49,616
to help Kwan get this far,

226
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,218
then I want you

227
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,554
to help me as well.

228
00:15:56,256 --> 00:15:57,657
But let me tell you something.

229
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,192
It's not going to be easy.

230
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,262
It costs a lot, and it's risky too.

231
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,664
Someone like you
won't be able to handle it.

232
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:07,067
How much do you want?
Name your price.

233
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,202
Otherwise,

234
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,271
all of the guests here

235
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:13,139
are going to find out

236
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,375
that Kongkwan

237
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:16,710
is just a prostitute.

238
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:20,580
Call me by my correct name.

239
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:21,915
It's Maya.

240
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,584
Maya.

241
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,521
You're aiming for It?

242
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:32,892
He's basically Satan.

243
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,695
He's harsh, ruthless,

244
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,731
and merciless.

245
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,267
His employees at his company
have been quitting in droves.

246
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:43,670
His ex-wife

247
00:16:44,204 --> 00:16:45,805
killed herself to get away from him.

248
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:47,607
Are you sure you can handle him?

249
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,342
Look over there.

250
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,512
His new wife is a former movie star.

251
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:53,780
What do you have
to compete with her?

252
00:16:55,081 --> 00:16:56,182
But if it's Akin,

253
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:57,851
then it might be easier.

254
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,719
Even though he has a fiancee,

255
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,187
he's still not married.

256
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:03,623
He's only engaged.
There's still a chance.

257
00:17:04,424 --> 00:17:05,558
That's his fiancee.

258
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:07,327
Little Miss Risa.

259
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,329
She's the daughter of a minister.

260
00:17:09,729 --> 00:17:11,297
Their families are business-focused.

261
00:17:11,765 --> 00:17:13,500
They won't let these two
break up that easily.

262
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,136
It's all about profit for them.

263
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:34,621
Happy birthday to you

264
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,258
Happy birthday to you

265
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,461
Happy birthday, happy birthday

266
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,096
It must be nice to be born rich.

267
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:45,265
They spend money as if
it's never going to run out.

268
00:17:45,765 --> 00:17:48,001
They're so happy, as if they've
never felt pain in this life.

269
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,437
They never think about how
other people survive.

270
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:53,973
Poor people's problems
aren't their problems anyway.

271
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:58,511
Do I have the right to spend my life
pretending not to notice

272
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:01,114
other people or what they've done?

273
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,049
I'm going to make a wish now.

274
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,956
Oh, that's right!

275
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,292
You're all happy and dandy,
aren't you?

276
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:15,495
I thought you said you wanted to
break up with me

277
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,163
because we didn't get along.

278
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,233
And since when did you start
getting along with this woman?

279
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:22,502
So?

280
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,137
Since when?

281
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:26,506
I guess you get along so well

282
00:18:27,007 --> 00:18:28,708
that you're marrying her

283
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,543
less than a month since
we got divorced.

284
00:18:31,311 --> 00:18:32,445
Oh, right.

285
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,847
So that's what it is?

286
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,248
You lied to me, didn't you?

287
00:18:35,682 --> 00:18:36,683
You scumbag!

288
00:18:44,691 --> 00:18:45,992
Calm down!

289
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,594
We've agreed

290
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,029
to part ways amicably.

291
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,163
Amicably?

292
00:18:51,531 --> 00:18:52,766
Should I tell everyone here

293
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,401
what you're really like?

294
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:56,036
Should I tell them

295
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,371
you're not as good as they think?

296
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,140
As for you,

297
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:02,042
watch your back.

298
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,710
He's going to find someone new,

299
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,913
and he's going to treat you
just like he treated me.

300
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:09,616
And you're going to end up

301
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,051
a toy

302
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:13,787
for the bedroom!

303
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:19,793
Excuse me.

304
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,929
I do understand
how insane you can get

305
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,231
after being dumped by a guy.

306
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,468
But would you mind your manners
at someone else's wedding?

307
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,970
Mind my manners?

308
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,840
Your friend stole my husband.

309
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:37,010
Do I have to mind my manners
with someone like her?

310
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,712
Stole?

311
00:19:39,112 --> 00:19:40,647
I don't know anything about this.

312
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,616
Liar! Don't pretend you didn't know!

313
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:47,220
Stop, you wench!

314
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:52,392
You're no better than I am.

315
00:19:53,059 --> 00:19:54,694
You'll end up like me one day.

316
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:59,165
He'll pretend to be nice,
take care of you,

317
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:00,667
and give you money.

318
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:03,203
Once he's fed up
with doing it with you,

319
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:04,938
then he'll dump you.

320
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,373
In the end,

321
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:07,974
you're just...

322
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,309
a prostitute.

323
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:11,077
A prostitute!

324
00:20:11,111 --> 00:20:12,112
You prostitute!

325
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,781
Get this insane woman out of here!

326
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:16,116
- Let go of me!
- Come now!

327
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:18,818
Let go!

328
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:20,220
Let me go!

329
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:21,488
- Hey!
- You!

330
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:23,523
It's your birthday?

331
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:25,258
You're a demon come to life!

332
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:03,630
Your brother's really done it.

333
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:05,665
Such humiliation.

334
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,501
Why?

335
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,104
Does he always have to pick
a lowlife as his wife?

336
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:13,606
Appearances, mannerisms.

337
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,975
And now they're having a catfight
at his wedding.

338
00:21:16,543 --> 00:21:17,544
Despicable.

339
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,113
I wonder what the press is
going to say tomorrow.

340
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,582
I don't even know how much damage
this will cause the company.

341
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:25,518
Just you wait.

342
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,954
The journalists are going to trace
your brother back to me.

343
00:21:28,788 --> 00:21:29,789
Good thing

344
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:32,992
I appointed Akin
as the CEO in my place,

345
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,794
not you.

346
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,163
Weren't you dying to be CEO?

347
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:38,998
Don't think I don't know you've been

348
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,935
telling the rest of the company
you want to be CEO.

349
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:45,205
I just want to help you out.

350
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:46,406
And here we are.

351
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:48,775
I appointed you as the head of PR.

352
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:50,443
Isn't that enough?

353
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:53,213
Of course,
for a relic of a movie star.

354
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:55,181
Don't you think that's too far?

355
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:59,285
Do you want to simply
keep me in the house?

356
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,287
And let other people
gossip that I'm...

357
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,758
good for nothing
except leeching off rich men?

358
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:06,526
Then there's Risa.

359
00:22:07,227 --> 00:22:09,029
I got her and Kin engaged.

360
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:12,065
This is for the good of our families
and the company.

361
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:35,055
I didn't expect something like that
to happen at the wedding.

362
00:22:35,755 --> 00:22:39,325
Good thing Saksit is rich
and could solve it with money.

363
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,528
He paid to silence journalists

364
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:43,229
and his ex-wife.

365
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,398
Money really can buy anything.

366
00:22:51,638 --> 00:22:54,207
Now that I've seen
such a beautiful wedding,

367
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,976
I'm starting to think about ours.

368
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,813
What kind of wedding

369
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,548
should we have for ourselves?

370
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,658
I'm only kidding.

371
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,862
I know we got engaged

372
00:23:16,963 --> 00:23:19,466
because of the elders
and for business reasons

373
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,135
like all the other rich kids.

374
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,808
I'm sorry

375
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,511
for making you feel uncomfortable.

376
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:33,013
It's okay.

377
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,115
I forgot

378
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:37,017
we're not in front of other people.

379
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:40,520
We don't have to show them
we're a couple.

380
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:42,889
It's not like that.

381
00:23:43,757 --> 00:23:45,759
I think it's for the future.

382
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,830
But I've talked to you about this,
haven't I?

383
00:23:52,165 --> 00:23:53,166
If you find

384
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,468
someone you truly like,

385
00:23:57,137 --> 00:23:58,138
then I won't mind.

386
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:00,640
I want you to be happy.

387
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:05,912
You'll probably be happier
to marry the right person.

388
00:24:10,016 --> 00:24:11,818
I want you to know

389
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,988
that it's just you right now.

390
00:24:15,755 --> 00:24:17,424
And I'm very happy.

391
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:21,261
Thank you for always
taking care of me.

392
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:51,691
Don't you even recognize
any of my achievements?

393
00:24:53,893 --> 00:24:54,894
Maybe everything I do

394
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:56,496
is wrong anyway.

395
00:24:57,664 --> 00:24:59,265
Because there's someone else
in your life.

396
00:25:00,033 --> 00:25:02,302
You know there's always been
someone else in my life.

397
00:25:03,236 --> 00:25:04,237
Why?

398
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,539
Because my wife is stupid.

399
00:25:08,675 --> 00:25:11,344
I've given you enough already.

400
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,848
Prove you're better than this
if you want more.

401
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:17,317
Do it.

402
00:25:19,252 --> 00:25:20,420
If you're unhappy,

403
00:25:21,321 --> 00:25:22,322
then feel free to leave.

404
00:25:32,499 --> 00:25:33,767
I'm sorry

405
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:35,902
for upsetting you.

406
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,207
Lately, you've been...

407
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,376
stressed.

408
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,046
I think

409
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:49,716
we should do something
other than work.

410
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:58,291
Enough.

411
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:00,593
If you have dignity left,

412
00:26:02,962 --> 00:26:04,264
don't do this.

413
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:08,268
You won't get me in the mood.

414
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:08,261
Why didn't you get straight As?

415
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:09,929
Why are you so stupid?

416
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:13,900
I sent you to the best
and the most expensive cram school.

417
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,368
And you're still incapable?

418
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:18,872
You're such a failure.

419
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:22,242
Why are you staring at me?

420
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,577
Huh?

421
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:27,881
You're still not remorseful?

422
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:30,183
No?

423
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,751
Stop! That's enough!

424
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,820
Enough? Look at his grades!

425
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:37,557
You keep siding with him.

426
00:27:37,757 --> 00:27:39,059
That's why he's such
a failure like you.

427
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,696
You've got entrance exams
in a few years.

428
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:45,665
And you have to run the company
after graduation.

429
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:48,868
If you can't be number one now,

430
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:50,370
what are you going
to do in the future?

431
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:53,039
Our company

432
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,275
is never second-best.

433
00:27:56,476 --> 00:27:57,477
Remember that.

434
00:27:58,445 --> 00:27:59,446
Understood?

435
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,116
Do you hear me? Do you?

436
00:28:03,316 --> 00:28:04,451
Enough!

437
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,420
Please! Just stop!

438
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,023
He understands now.

439
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:13,693
Tell him you understand, Akin.

440
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:18,164
I understand.

441
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:24,104
Then show me you can do it.

442
00:28:25,372 --> 00:28:26,473
Do better.

443
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:58,738
Kin,

444
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,208
I know you're sad

445
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,077
he punished you.

446
00:29:05,311 --> 00:29:06,980
But I want you to stay strong.

447
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:08,848
Get good grades

448
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:10,884
so he won't treat you
like that again.

449
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:12,619
Hm?

450
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,387
Once you've grown up,

451
00:29:14,954 --> 00:29:17,490
you'll be able to look after
yourself if you do well.

452
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,028
I won't be there
to look after you forever.

453
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:23,730
Do you understand?

454
00:29:26,266 --> 00:29:28,335
Why would you say that, Mom?

455
00:29:30,437 --> 00:29:32,138
It's because Dad's got
another woman, isn't it?

456
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,075
I heard your argument with him.

457
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,044
I won't let you go anywhere else.

458
00:29:40,347 --> 00:29:41,815
It's between me and him.

459
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:43,216
Pay no attention to it.

460
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:45,518
Mom?

461
00:29:47,887 --> 00:29:49,089
Listen to me carefully.

462
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,124
Once I'm gone,

463
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:54,828
you have to take good care
of what is yours.

464
00:29:56,629 --> 00:29:57,697
Do it for yourself.

465
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,400
Do it for me,
the person who loves you the most.

466
00:30:01,234 --> 00:30:02,235
Mom?

467
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:11,811
Mom!

468
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,451
Mom!

469
00:30:21,821 --> 00:30:23,556
Don't let anyone steal what's yours.

470
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,291
Help! Anyone?

471
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,559
Do you understand?

472
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:30,764
Remember my words.

473
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:33,967
I love you, Akin.

474
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:35,869
Help!

475
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,138
Please help my mom!

476
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,040
Help!

477
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:48,948
Mom!

478
00:30:50,884 --> 00:30:51,885
Help!

479
00:30:53,286 --> 00:30:54,688
Anyone? Please help my mom!

480
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,191
Why would you do this, Mom?

481
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:02,929
Are you still in shock?

482
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:09,869
I didn't expect her to come in
and cause a scene like that.

483
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,638
You must be startled.

484
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:17,677
I'm sorry I haven't been
taking good care of you.

485
00:31:19,412 --> 00:31:20,447
It's okay.

486
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:23,350
I'm just a bit confused

487
00:31:23,917 --> 00:31:26,019
as to why she had to
say that to you.

488
00:31:29,322 --> 00:31:30,323
Say what?

489
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:33,760
She accused you of being
a bad person.

490
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:37,864
But you're the best for me.

491
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:43,503
What about her threatening
to tell everyone something?

492
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:45,372
What was that about?

493
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,308
She's probably
just spewing nonsense.

494
00:31:48,875 --> 00:31:49,876
She must be angry

495
00:31:50,343 --> 00:31:53,813
I divorced her and married
a better woman.

496
00:31:56,049 --> 00:31:57,250
Don't pay her any attention.

497
00:31:58,051 --> 00:32:00,787
Pay attention
to our first night together.

498
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:05,058
But it's not our first night.

499
00:32:06,626 --> 00:32:10,263
But it's your first night
as my wife.

500
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,533
Your first night as my husband.

501
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:15,835
The first man for me.

502
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:20,407
And the only, forever.

503
00:32:31,885 --> 00:32:32,886
What is it?

504
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,123
I want to surprise you
for our first night.

505
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:41,528
Saksit.

506
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,301
Let's amp up the excitement

507
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:50,670
for a little bit, okay?

508
00:32:52,405 --> 00:32:53,406
Saksit...

509
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:54,574
Don't be afraid.

510
00:33:00,413 --> 00:33:01,481
Once you're used to it,

511
00:33:02,515 --> 00:33:03,950
you might end up liking it.

512
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:06,286
I don't think I'm going to like it.

513
00:33:06,286 --> 00:33:09,122
I guarantee you'll be excited.

514
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,993
Saksit.

515
00:33:14,661 --> 00:33:15,662
You're hurting me.

516
00:33:16,229 --> 00:33:17,630
All right. I'll be gentle.

517
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:19,399
Don't be afraid.

518
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:24,037
Are you ready?

519
00:33:24,771 --> 00:33:26,139
Can we not do this?

520
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:43,890
Are you ready?

521
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,097
Does it hurt?

522
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:53,266
It hurts!

523
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,467
Do you like it?

524
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:56,002
Say it.

525
00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:58,705
Hey!

526
00:33:58,905 --> 00:34:00,140
You're a naughty girl.

527
00:34:00,974 --> 00:34:02,075
You should be punished!

528
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:04,577
Let go of me!

529
00:34:09,115 --> 00:34:11,551
How dare you use that tone with me?

530
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:18,224
No, let me go!

531
00:34:39,312 --> 00:34:41,715
(Sofia)

532
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:47,821
Hello?

533
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:49,489
I saw you leaving the wedding.

534
00:34:49,756 --> 00:34:50,824
Are you okay?

535
00:34:52,058 --> 00:34:54,027
It was nothing.

536
00:34:54,728 --> 00:34:56,062
I was feeling a bit unwell.

537
00:34:56,796 --> 00:34:57,831
Hm.

538
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:02,235
It's nothing, really.
I'm just calling to tell you

539
00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:06,606
I know of a way to introduce you
to It and Akin.

540
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:09,342
The shopping mall's opening?

541
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:10,977
You knew?

542
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:13,680
You do know quite a lot.
I guess you don't need my help.

543
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:15,949
It's Kongkwan.

544
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:19,519
She wants to open a beauty clinic

545
00:35:19,753 --> 00:35:21,187
at It's shopping mall.

546
00:35:21,354 --> 00:35:23,790
So she pleaded with Saksit
to go to the opening

547
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,492
to help convince It.

548
00:35:26,026 --> 00:35:27,694
So, of course,
I have to accompany her.

549
00:35:28,661 --> 00:35:29,662
So what are you going to do?

550
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:34,034
I guarantee I can introduce you to
both It and Akin.

551
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:39,532
Now, it's time for us

552
00:36:39,532 --> 00:36:42,402
to officially open this
newly-established shopping mall.

553
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:45,305
Meet The Grand Itsara.

554
00:36:55,415 --> 00:36:57,217
(People Died for This Shopping Mall)

555
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,318
Murderers!

556
00:36:58,818 --> 00:36:59,886
Murderers!

557
00:37:00,286 --> 00:37:02,589
You murdered people and built
a shopping mall on their land.

558
00:37:02,922 --> 00:37:04,858
We remember! You murderers!

559
00:37:05,425 --> 00:37:06,426
Murderers!

560
00:37:06,526 --> 00:37:08,395
- Murderers!
- Stop!

561
00:37:08,628 --> 00:37:10,096
- Stop!
- Let go of me!

562
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:11,364
- I said stop!
- Murderers!

563
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:12,832
Excuse me, It.

564
00:37:13,033 --> 00:37:14,601
What's going on here?

565
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:16,202
He suffers from a mental illness.

566
00:37:16,202 --> 00:37:18,071
Is it true people died?

567
00:37:18,171 --> 00:37:19,706
No, how is that possible?

568
00:37:19,706 --> 00:37:22,275
Does it have something to do
with what happened 15 years ago?

569
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:23,710
That's such a long time ago.

570
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:27,013
He's not well.
Don't pay attention to him.

571
00:37:27,013 --> 00:37:29,049
We'll deal with him. I'm very sorry.

572
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:31,751
It's nothing. He's unwell.

573
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,555
We'll probably have
to take him to a hospital.

574
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:37,557
I just found out that apart from me,

575
00:37:37,557 --> 00:37:39,859
there's someone who hasn't forgotten
that 15 years ago,

576
00:37:40,393 --> 00:37:42,829
this place ended up
a graveyard for poor people.

577
00:37:43,563 --> 00:37:45,565
But all of you acted
as if nothing happened,

578
00:37:45,999 --> 00:37:47,500
and then you rubbed it in.

579
00:37:48,101 --> 00:37:50,503
You need to understand,
he has mental health issues.

580
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,305
You built a building
resembling a gravestone.

581
00:37:52,605 --> 00:37:54,207
Then you celebrate.

582
00:37:54,808 --> 00:37:55,809
Shameful.

583
00:37:55,809 --> 00:37:57,043
(Beware:
People Died for This Shopping Mall)

584
00:37:57,811 --> 00:37:58,812
Soon,

585
00:37:58,978 --> 00:38:02,148
you're going to regret hurting
a poor person like me.

586
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:03,616
(Beware:
People Died for This Shopping Mall)

587
00:38:06,252 --> 00:38:07,554
Kongkwan called. She told me

588
00:38:08,388 --> 00:38:09,756
she and Saksit have left.

589
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,292
Mr. It got upset

590
00:38:12,425 --> 00:38:13,693
after what happened at the opening.

591
00:38:14,594 --> 00:38:16,029
I don't think today's a good day

592
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,732
to introduce you to It and Akin.

593
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,002
Have you called the editor to say

594
00:38:22,002 --> 00:38:23,837
there's going to be another
press conference here?

595
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,339
I have. I was given the green light.

596
00:38:29,576 --> 00:38:31,444
So? What do you think?
Is it a good day or not?

597
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:34,914
It asked the journalists
to keep silent and leave.

598
00:38:34,914 --> 00:38:35,915
But they're still here.

599
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,388
And the rumor

600
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:44,591
about them burning down the slums,

601
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:46,359
is that true?

602
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:48,495
Shoot.

603
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:51,598
If it is true,
then people died here.

604
00:38:52,332 --> 00:38:53,333
I'm getting goosebumps.

605
00:38:57,103 --> 00:38:58,104
I think I have an idea.

606
00:38:59,005 --> 00:39:00,006
Can you help me?

607
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,445
Are you the organizer team?

608
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,814
I'm here to help with the problem

609
00:39:07,814 --> 00:39:09,482
so you won't get into more trouble.

610
00:39:09,482 --> 00:39:11,084
I know things are hectic right now.

611
00:40:00,467 --> 00:40:01,468
Akin.

612
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:03,870
She's a friend of mine.

613
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,338
She's a music therapist.

614
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,875
She's here to perform
to lighten the mood.

615
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:30,797
This is a music performance

616
00:40:31,664 --> 00:40:34,768
to pay tribute to the lives lost.

617
00:40:36,403 --> 00:40:37,771
Even though the shopping mall

618
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:41,007
had nothing to do with it,

619
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,943
I'd like everyone to be aware

620
00:40:45,078 --> 00:40:46,379
that all of us are sorry

621
00:40:47,514 --> 00:40:49,182
about what happened.

622
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,287
So I'd like everyone to stand up

623
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:57,223
to grieve

624
00:40:58,358 --> 00:41:01,795
and mourn for those who perished
in the fire that day.

625
00:41:34,961 --> 00:41:35,962
What you did just now

626
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:37,630
seemed like a good thing.

627
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,800
But you should've told me first.

628
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:43,837
Because I'm responsible
for this place.

629
00:41:44,637 --> 00:41:45,638
Okay.

630
00:41:45,872 --> 00:41:47,640
I'm sorry, Akin.

631
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:51,778
Sofia told me

632
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:53,913
you're a music therapist?

633
00:42:03,823 --> 00:42:04,824
That's right.

634
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:08,128
I used music to heal my own heart

635
00:42:08,561 --> 00:42:09,796
and other people's as well.

636
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,901
Maybe

637
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:16,536
someday

638
00:42:17,137 --> 00:42:19,205
you might need my music.

639
00:42:40,593 --> 00:42:41,594
Whether it's It

640
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:43,596
or Akin,

641
00:42:44,798 --> 00:42:45,799
I don't mind.

642
00:42:47,734 --> 00:42:49,636
Married? Engaged?

643
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,371
I don't mind either.

644
00:42:54,541 --> 00:42:57,544
So why try so hard
for a scholarship

645
00:42:58,111 --> 00:42:59,579
if your ultimate goal

646
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,415
is to tie down a rich guy
so he can take care of you?

647
00:43:13,727 --> 00:43:15,261
Are you admitting

648
00:43:16,029 --> 00:43:17,664
people want to be rich?

649
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:24,604
I look forward to the day

650
00:43:25,138 --> 00:43:26,639
you walk into my trap.

651
00:43:43,123 --> 00:43:45,125
- Darn it!
- Don't!

652
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,328
Don't think too much about it.

653
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:50,130
Just forget about the past.

654
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:51,831
Do you think I can just forget it?

655
00:43:52,332 --> 00:43:53,767
What do you really want from us?

656
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:56,069
I just want to find out,

657
00:43:56,269 --> 00:43:58,271
between you and your dad,

658
00:43:58,538 --> 00:43:59,939
who's going
to take better care of me?

659
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:03,309
Are you that bent
on ruining my life?

660
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:04,511
What's wrong with you?

661
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:06,179
You and I

662
00:44:06,312 --> 00:44:07,547
are from different classes.

663
00:44:08,348 --> 00:44:10,016
What you're trying to do

664
00:44:10,383 --> 00:44:11,418
isn't easy.
