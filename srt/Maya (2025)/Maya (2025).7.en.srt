1
00:00:00,033 --> 00:00:01,934
All of you seem to believe

2
00:00:01,935 --> 00:00:04,204
I'm capable of sorting out
these problems.

3
00:00:04,704 --> 00:00:07,107
I'm happy to accept
the position as chairperson.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,541
Everything that's been happening

5
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,243
isn't a coincidence.

6
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,277
- Treetep!
- What have you done?

7
00:00:12,278 --> 00:00:14,080
If you're going to
keep acting crazy,

8
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,316
then you won't even have

9
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,785
a stupid woman like me around.

10
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,454
- It?
- I've missed you.

11
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:24,858
I promise I'm going to take back
everything that's mine.

12
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:26,593
It!

13
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:27,761
Please be mine.

14
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:30,063
- Come on.
- Let go of me!

15
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:31,297
Let go, It!

16
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:33,365
It, stop! It!

17
00:00:33,366 --> 00:00:35,568
- Come on, Maya.
- No, It!

18
00:00:35,835 --> 00:00:36,902
I said let go!

19
00:00:36,903 --> 00:00:37,904
Be mine!

20
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:42,709
You're beautiful, Maya.

21
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:44,110
Maya.

22
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:48,515
Ma?

23
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:51,618
Don't pay any attention.

24
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:53,353
- It, don't!
- Ma?

25
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:54,888
- My friend's here! Let go!
- Are you home?

26
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,024
Ma, I have something urgent
to talk to you about!

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,600
Ma?

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,171
Oh.

29
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,373
Oh dear.

30
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:14,674
Hello, It.

31
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,877
I didn't know you were here.

32
00:01:19,612 --> 00:01:22,315
It had to talk to me about
something,

33
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:23,583
so he dropped by.

34
00:01:25,885 --> 00:01:26,886
But we're done now.

35
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:28,788
He's about to leave.

36
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:32,859
Should I drive you home?

37
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,761
No need.

38
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,598
I'll get going then.

39
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,268
Goodbye.

40
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,850
He wasn't here to talk, was he?

41
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,251
What did he do to you?

42
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,086
That scumbag tried to rape me.

43
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:01,488
What?

44
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,158
He tried to rape you?

45
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,660
I want to vomit just
thinking about it.

46
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,195
That disgusting old geezer!

47
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:12,032
Are you okay?

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,401
I'm fine.

49
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:16,202
Good thing you came just in time.

50
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,608
Ugh.

51
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:25,345
Why can't we get away
from these scumbags?

52
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,981
That horny pervert.

53
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,183
It'll be difficult.

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,318
We came into their lives
of our own accord.

55
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,824
By the way, why did you
come to see me?

56
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:42,529
Ma,

57
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,531
it's Kwan.

58
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:47,233
Why? What's the matter with her?

59
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,373
Hi!

60
00:04:33,506 --> 00:04:35,675
Where are you taking me
to spend money tonight?

61
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:37,510
Sofia.

62
00:04:38,745 --> 00:04:40,847
- Kwan?
- I can't take it anymore!

63
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:44,317
I really can't!

64
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,052
What happened?

65
00:04:46,886 --> 00:04:47,921
Was it Saksit?

66
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,457
Sofia.

67
00:05:01,101 --> 00:05:02,102
Yes, darling?

68
00:05:03,336 --> 00:05:04,504
Do you feel better now?

69
00:05:06,906 --> 00:05:07,907
Enough, please!

70
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:09,909
I can't take it anymore.

71
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:14,714
- Come here!
- Ah!

72
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:16,182
Kwan!

73
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,285
You dare to deny me?

74
00:05:21,021 --> 00:05:22,088
Remember.

75
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,524
I've given you everything.

76
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,126
I'm not sleeping with you for free.

77
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:29,129
So I have the right
to do anything to you!

78
00:05:32,365 --> 00:05:33,433
And do you really believe

79
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:36,469
I'm going to let you go
that easily?

80
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:38,538
No way.

81
00:05:41,274 --> 00:05:42,275
Kwan!

82
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,512
You dare to bite me?

83
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,016
What's wrong with you?
Are you trying to kill her?

84
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,519
- Saksit!
- You want to fight back?

85
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,421
Huh? What?

86
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,057
You're fighting back?

87
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:00,293
Kwan!

88
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,834
Kwan!

89
00:06:08,168 --> 00:06:09,436
Kwan, can you hear me?

90
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,237
Kwan!

91
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,873
What are you doing to my friend,
you scumbag?

92
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,744
(Sofia)

93
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,483
Kwan?

94
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,118
The phone was hung up.

95
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,520
And I haven't been able
to reach her since.

96
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,757
Ma,

97
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,759
I'm worried about her.

98
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,228
Is she going to die?

99
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,964
What if something happened to her?

100
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,201
It's my fault.

101
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,303
I sent her to him.

102
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,041
You're actually capable

103
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,343
of being a good person.

104
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,379
You're admitting your guilt.

105
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,415
But seriously,

106
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,952
I don't think
he'll dare to kill her.

107
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:05,291
But he killed his ex-wife
under his own roof.

108
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,496
So why wouldn't he

109
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,899
have the guts to kill Kwan?

110
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:21,374
I know I made a mistake. Can you
help me figure out what to do?

111
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:24,678
But if he

112
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,714
killed Kwan as well,

113
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,917
at least people might start
suspecting him.

114
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,020
Besides,

115
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:35,888
we don't know

116
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:38,925
how much Saksit knows about
us knowing his wrongdoings.

117
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,528
We don't know if he was
the one hanging up the phone.

118
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,765
The only way
to find out how Kwan's doing

119
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:48,134
is to see her with our own eyes.

120
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,738
But Saksit's very violent.

121
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,676
The three of us might die.

122
00:07:58,445 --> 00:07:59,446
So?

123
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,349
Are you going to let Kwan
handle him alone?

124
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:10,924
I sent her there.

125
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:13,593
I should be the one to help her.

126
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,530
Wait for me here.

127
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,468
In case both of us don't come back,

128
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,737
you can call the cops on our behalf.

129
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:26,039
Hey, no!

130
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,109
If you're going, I'm going too.

131
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,478
We're going to rescue Kwan together.

132
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:47,160
I have an appointment with Kongkwan.

133
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,161
Saksit's been informed.

134
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:50,897
He told us we could
come over whenever.

135
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,366
Can we come in?

136
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,803
Well then. Please have a seat.

137
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,997
Sofia, Maya.

138
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:33,273
Did you fall asleep and forget
about our plans?

139
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,377
I booked us a table at a place in
Banthadthong. Shall we go? Come on.

140
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,280
Kongkwan's not feeling well
right now.

141
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,882
It's already late as well.

142
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,251
We should let her rest.

143
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,288
If she wants something tasty,

144
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,256
I'll ask my subordinate
to go and buy it for her.

145
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:51,825
Saksit.

146
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:57,263
I know you're her friend
and worried about her.

147
00:09:57,864 --> 00:09:59,899
But I'm her husband.

148
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,003
I believe I can take better care
of her than both of you.

149
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,904
So you can

150
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:08,341
save us the hassle
and not worry so much.

151
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:15,215
We'll come and visit
our friend again.

152
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,551
Please take good care of her.

153
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,187
I hope she feels better soon.

154
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:23,790
Don't worry.

155
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,227
And I won't bother you
to come visit her too often.

156
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,661
We'll manage.

157
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,431
We're happy together.

158
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,066
Isn't that right?

159
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,168
Yes.

160
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:40,707
You should go.

161
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:54,287
We'll see you later.

162
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,659
Bye.

163
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,317
I probably can't stop you
from telling your friends about us.

164
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,853
But...

165
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:30,023
you probably don't want them
to get hurt like you, do you?

166
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:37,697
Think about it.

167
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,769
I can give you whatever you want

168
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:47,374
in exchange for a bit of pain
for the sake of my pleasure.

169
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,609
It's so worth it. Hm?

170
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:53,113
But you shouldn't beat me up.

171
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:54,748
You have no right.

172
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,654
You're being rude again.

173
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:05,959
Come on.

174
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,061
Why do you think I have no right?

175
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,198
I've paid a lot already.

176
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:16,169
I have the right to do anything.

177
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:21,207
I can do even more.

178
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,909
If Saksit realized we knew
what he's been doing to Kwan,

179
00:12:56,176 --> 00:12:57,844
is it going to treat her even worse?

180
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,080
He might kill us as well.

181
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,583
I don't think so. No matter how much
he can pay to silence the news,

182
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,253
people are going to catch on
if his wives keep dying.

183
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:09,522
And I think

184
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:11,291
he was only threatening us.

185
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,360
Kwan just has to do
as he says for now.

186
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:16,996
Only threatening?
He sounded serious.

187
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:20,734
And what are you going to do
about your problem?

188
00:13:21,568 --> 00:13:23,136
That pervy old geezer is

189
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,772
going to come back for you
if he wants you that much.

190
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:31,044
I might've been a little
too careless earlier.

191
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:35,515
I'm going to install CCTV cameras
around the house.

192
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,517
I'll ask Indy to come help.

193
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,320
Install CCTV cameras?

194
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,422
And? Are they going to
save you from him?

195
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,259
I'll play a game with him.

196
00:13:49,362 --> 00:13:51,798
I think I'll be able
to get away this time.

197
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,135
Just you wait.

198
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,382
Shut up! Quiet!

199
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,419
My boss sends his regards.

200
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,521
He asked that you keep
out of his business

201
00:14:15,121 --> 00:14:16,122
if you value your life.

202
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:39,979
I'm really sorry

203
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:42,549
about that night.

204
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,518
I must've had too much to drink.

205
00:14:47,687 --> 00:14:50,523
Things have been stressful lately.

206
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,793
And I might've

207
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,529
liked you too much. That's why...

208
00:14:57,797 --> 00:14:58,798
I couldn't help myself.

209
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,835
There's no rush.

210
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,471
I'm not running away from you.

211
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:08,608
I really like you, Maya.

212
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:13,780
I don't know. You make me feel
like I'm young again.

213
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,448
You get my heart going.

214
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,785
And I really don't have
anyone right now.

215
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,587
So I...

216
00:15:22,288 --> 00:15:23,490
I need you more.

217
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,865
I understand.

218
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,603
If I were to experience what you're
going through right now,

219
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:38,838
I would've felt

220
00:15:39,806 --> 00:15:41,074
the same way you do now.

221
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:44,611
Parnkeaw is your wife.

222
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,647
And Akin is your biological son.

223
00:15:48,882 --> 00:15:49,949
But it doesn't seem

224
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,752
like anyone's on your side.

225
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:56,356
It's okay.

226
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,859
I believe you'll
sort everything out

227
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,328
and return to
your normal self eventually.

228
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,499
I'm grateful there's someone
who understands me.

229
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,303
And I'm glad that someone is you.

230
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:12,839
Sitting right here with me.

231
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,681
And there's no need

232
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,450
to rush things between us.

233
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:27,620
Once you've sorted all
of your problems out,

234
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,724
then we can talk about us.

235
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,394
But I'd like you to know one thing.

236
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,198
I'm not hoping

237
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:41,468
to just be one of your women.

238
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,604
And I'd like you to know

239
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,842
you don't have to worry
about Parnkeaw.

240
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,978
I'll divorce her in any case.

241
00:16:53,913 --> 00:16:54,914
And when that day comes,

242
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:58,151
the day I have everything again...

243
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,757
you will be right there by my side.

244
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,661
I promise.

245
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:19,739
Please help him out.

246
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,808
I believe you can do it.

247
00:17:23,810 --> 00:17:27,414
Everyone knows
my processed food company

248
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:30,984
produces quality goods for domestic
and international markets.

249
00:17:32,018 --> 00:17:35,588
Help convince
all of the food outlets in the mall

250
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:38,091
to use products my company supplies.

251
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:41,227
It should be easy
and hassle-free for you.

252
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:45,265
Then you'll get a share
of the earnings too.

253
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:54,040
I recall Dad turning you down.

254
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,643
But you have the power
to make decisions now.

255
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:58,812
You're the chairperson.

256
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,047
You don't have to
listen to him anymore.

257
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:03,516
Trust me.
It's going to turn out well.

258
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,923
All right. I'll bring it up
in the meeting for a joint decision.

259
00:18:14,794 --> 00:18:18,131
So you're going to reconsider it.

260
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:20,066
Thanks for that.

261
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,136
We know each other well.

262
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,505
We're like family.

263
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:28,375
Everything I've done,

264
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:31,244
I've done for our benefit.

265
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,647
You're the chairperson now.

266
00:18:35,181 --> 00:18:37,017
I don't see the necessity

267
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:39,219
to follow certain procedures.

268
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,288
And don't forget

269
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:46,559
your family's business got this far

270
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,395
not because of honest means.

271
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,230
You're probably aware of that.

272
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,700
And another thing
I'd like you to know,

273
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:56,636
being too much of a good person

274
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,539
can't help a business prosper.

275
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:17,724
Why did you say that to Kin?

276
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:20,260
He's not a little kid anymore.

277
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,861
He's the chairperson.

278
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:23,630
If I wait for things
to happen like you do,

279
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,099
when will I get what I want?

280
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:30,470
That explains why you've never
received anything substantial

281
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,306
even though you've been
married to It for a while now.

282
00:19:34,507 --> 00:19:35,542
Let me tell you.

283
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:38,011
Akin isn't as tough as his dad.

284
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:40,613
You'll get something
if you keep pressuring him.

285
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,450
There's a rift going on
between the two as well.

286
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:45,418
He probably wants
to make some friends.

287
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:50,090
Isn't it better to have us
as his allies rather than no one?

288
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,263
Oh? It?

289
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,768
Gee, does the consultant have to
come in every single day?

290
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:05,238
I thought you'd like a break
after working for such a long time.

291
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:08,908
I just can't seem to catch a break.

292
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:13,013
It feels like vultures are circling,

293
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,549
waiting to swoop in.

294
00:20:17,283 --> 00:20:18,918
I have to keep reminding them

295
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,388
nothing can be gained easily.

296
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,524
Things can change.

297
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,196
Where were you that night?

298
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:34,934
Busybodies.

299
00:20:36,836 --> 00:20:37,837
Both of you.

300
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:44,444
Parnkeaw,

301
00:20:44,778 --> 00:20:46,546
which night is that night?
What happened?

302
00:20:47,881 --> 00:20:50,984
The night Treetep
threw a party for Kin.

303
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,154
I squeezed it out of the driver.

304
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,290
It went to see Maya.

305
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:02,328
Come on. You still
haven't dealt with her?

306
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,097
I don't see
how she can be dangerous.

307
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,600
She's just a simple, harmless woman.

308
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,469
And honestly,

309
00:21:09,969 --> 00:21:11,338
why do you pay attention
to her so much?

310
00:21:11,571 --> 00:21:14,874
You don't seem to care
about It's other women.

311
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:16,376
Hm?

312
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:22,148
I hate her so much.

313
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:27,320
See? You always let
your emotions lead the way.

314
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,423
That's why you never get
what you deserve.

315
00:21:30,757 --> 00:21:32,359
You always make mistakes.

316
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,993
You stupid sister.

317
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,785
Yes, Risa?

318
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,353
Akin,

319
00:22:01,254 --> 00:22:03,923
I'm wondering if you'd like to come
and see my wedding dress.

320
00:22:04,491 --> 00:22:07,460
I have an appointment with Pat.
She's the top designer.

321
00:22:07,727 --> 00:22:09,528
She's usually quite difficult
to make an appointment with.

322
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,931
But she's okay to have us
come in for a chat today.

323
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,100
I'm very busy right now.

324
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:15,902
Can it be some other day?

325
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,473
But Parnkeaw told me
you might be free

326
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:23,043
because there's no meeting
this afternoon.

327
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,911
Today's really not good for me.

328
00:22:25,045 --> 00:22:26,680
- But I...
- Let's talk later, okay?

329
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:28,415
I have to go now.

330
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:30,750
Kin.

331
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:44,764
Yes, Miss?

332
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:47,167
Can you follow up about my car?
And be quick.

333
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:54,074
What did Saksit
ask from you this time?

334
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:59,646
Don't tell me you agreed
to let him have it.

335
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,481
I'm not stupid, Dad.

336
00:23:02,816 --> 00:23:03,817
And I've turned him down.

337
00:23:04,818 --> 00:23:06,086
I didn't agree to anything.

338
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,156
Good. There's no way
you can outfox him.

339
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,260
Just you wait. Those two siblings
are going to bamboozle you one day.

340
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:17,330
Wasn't it you who got bamboozled?

341
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:20,400
What do you mean by that?

342
00:23:21,368 --> 00:23:23,703
You let that woman replace Mom.

343
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,007
And you allowed her brother
to come in and bother our family.

344
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,011
So wasn't it you who got bamboozled?

345
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:33,880
Kin, watch your mouth.

346
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,051
Was I wrong?

347
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:42,989
Even though you think I'm simple
and inexperienced,

348
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,959
I won't let anyone take advantage
of our company.

349
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:48,962
It's great

350
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:51,631
to hear that you take actions
keeping that in mind.

351
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:55,568
I have some errands to run today.

352
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,738
Do you want to come along?

353
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,044
You can go about your business.
I'm busy today.

354
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:06,980
Consult with me when there's
something important.

355
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,100
Can you order a bouquet for me?

356
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,878
I've been waiting for five minutes.

357
00:24:39,112 --> 00:24:40,113
Where's my car?

358
00:24:42,115 --> 00:24:44,317
Do you want me to call
a motorcycle taxi instead?

359
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,219
But if Dad sees,

360
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:48,722
you're going to get in trouble.

361
00:24:49,356 --> 00:24:51,324
Miss, the car is
still under repair.

362
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,260
What? Why is that?

363
00:24:55,362 --> 00:24:57,430
You're useless. Give me the number.
I'll call them myself.

364
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:07,240
(Minister's Daughter)

365
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,344
Hello?

366
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:13,046
Where's my car?

367
00:25:14,647 --> 00:25:15,648
Whose car...

368
00:25:16,616 --> 00:25:17,617
are we talking about again?

369
00:25:18,451 --> 00:25:19,652
I'm Risa.

370
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:21,087
Oh.

371
00:25:21,454 --> 00:25:22,756
You're the minister's daughter.

372
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:25,625
The repairs aren't done yet, Miss.

373
00:25:25,992 --> 00:25:28,294
What? Why is it taking so long?

374
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:30,997
Do you have another car
I can borrow for now?

375
00:25:32,632 --> 00:25:34,668
And which one would you like, Miss?

376
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,404
Just send over something.
I'm in a hurry.

377
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:38,738
Be quick about it.

378
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:42,375
Sure.

379
00:26:18,445 --> 00:26:19,446
You.

380
00:26:19,979 --> 00:26:22,015
You cut me off that night.

381
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,750
What are you doing here?

382
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,786
To bring you a vehicle.
We discussed it on the phone.

383
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,056
I didn't call you.

384
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:33,693
You definitely did.
I recognize your voice.

385
00:26:34,861 --> 00:26:35,962
Don't you recognize my voice?

386
00:26:37,731 --> 00:26:38,732
You're crazy.

387
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:42,369
Who'd recognize the voice
of a stranger you've just met?

388
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:46,339
Hang on.

389
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:49,075
My car's in your shop?

390
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:54,014
I told you it's my shop.

391
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,518
I sorted out the insurance
with your dad's subordinate.

392
00:26:59,019 --> 00:27:00,453
Even though I wasn't in the wrong,

393
00:27:00,787 --> 00:27:02,756
I'm happy to do the repairs for you.

394
00:27:04,591 --> 00:27:06,659
Hang in there. It'll be perfect.

395
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:10,230
And...

396
00:27:11,264 --> 00:27:13,466
which car are you
going to lend me for now?

397
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:17,237
Here. This is the only one I have.

398
00:27:18,872 --> 00:27:21,441
Are you crazy?
How come it's a motorbike?

399
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,076
I don't know how to ride one.

400
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,779
You told me you didn't mind
which one.

401
00:27:26,379 --> 00:27:28,648
Besides, I'm not saying
you have to ride it yourself.

402
00:27:29,249 --> 00:27:31,617
I wouldn't trust you
even if you knew how.

403
00:27:31,618 --> 00:27:33,620
It cost a pretty penny.

404
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,322
And judging by your
driving skills...

405
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,291
Ugh.

406
00:27:38,858 --> 00:27:39,859
You won't make it.

407
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:42,462
Aren't you in a hurry?

408
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:44,731
Hop on. This one's
the best for what you need.

409
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:48,702
You're telling me to ride on
the back with you?

410
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:52,272
Pass.

411
00:27:54,607 --> 00:27:55,608
I knew it.

412
00:27:56,776 --> 00:27:59,779
A posh girl like you wouldn't have
the guts for this kind of thing.

413
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:03,750
I just figured it was fast.
Everyone knows that.

414
00:28:04,551 --> 00:28:07,387
But if you think
it's beneath you,

415
00:28:08,488 --> 00:28:10,290
I'll call the shop
to bring something else.

416
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:11,658
But you'll have to wait.

417
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:13,059
It takes time.

418
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:16,563
No need.

419
00:28:18,665 --> 00:28:20,734
You're going to make me
waste even more time.

420
00:28:22,035 --> 00:28:25,038
I'm agreeing to ride with you
because I'm in a hurry.

421
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:28,141
And don't assume that I can't ride
on the back of a motorcycle.

422
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:30,777
Really, Miss?

423
00:28:31,177 --> 00:28:32,345
Then hop on.

424
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:34,014
Aren't you in a hurry, Miss?

425
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:36,116
Here.

426
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,351
Shut up.

427
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,797
I thought you said you can.

428
00:28:52,565 --> 00:28:53,566
Hold tight.

429
00:29:23,396 --> 00:29:24,397
I'm sorry.

430
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,661
Hello?

431
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:55,862
Where are you?

432
00:29:56,563 --> 00:29:57,697
I want to talk about us.

433
00:29:58,431 --> 00:29:59,432
Do you have a bit of time?

434
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,167
Today's not good for me.

435
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:02,869
But it's a good thing you called.

436
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,771
Are you free right now?

437
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,272
If you are,

438
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,241
can you come with me somewhere?

439
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,477
Where are we going to?

440
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,945
You're home, aren't you?

441
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:13,446
I'll come and pick you up.

442
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:29,596
Oh, hey.

443
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:35,969
Didn't your parents teach you to
say thank you when someone helps?

444
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:39,572
They only taught me to watch out
for people who want to exploit me.

445
00:30:40,974 --> 00:30:42,108
Me? Exploit you?

446
00:30:42,709 --> 00:30:44,310
What would I gain from you?

447
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,579
I drove all the way here
just for you.

448
00:30:47,914 --> 00:30:50,917
If it's such a bother, you don't
have to do it again. I'm going now.

449
00:31:08,401 --> 00:31:10,704
(Risa)

450
00:31:23,817 --> 00:31:25,417
Hey. Can you follow my fiancé's car?

451
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:27,754
I'm curious who he's bringing
the flowers to and where he's going.

452
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:29,956
No.

453
00:31:30,457 --> 00:31:32,191
What? Take me there.

454
00:31:32,192 --> 00:31:33,193
Thank me first.

455
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:34,728
Thank you!

456
00:31:36,162 --> 00:31:37,430
- Let's go.
- Here. Put the helmet on.

457
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,800
Hurry up, or we'll miss him.

458
00:32:14,768 --> 00:32:15,835
Where are you taking me?

459
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,071
Get in the car.

460
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:29,082
Why did you bring me here?

461
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:31,017
Kin's not around here.

462
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:33,520
I told you to follow
my fiancé's car.

463
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,321
Why didn't you do as I told you?

464
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,191
We've lost him.

465
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,461
There's no need.

466
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:45,031
Did I ask for your opinion?

467
00:32:48,201 --> 00:32:50,136
If he really cares about you,

468
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,239
you wouldn't have had
to follow him around.

469
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:57,210
It's always been
like that, hasn't it?

470
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:02,716
Shut your mouth
if you don't know anything.

471
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,751
It has nothing to do with you.

472
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:07,721
- Stay out of...
- Don't you dare.

473
00:33:08,655 --> 00:33:09,756
You're good-looking.

474
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,225
But why is your tongue so sharp?

475
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,061
I thought you were a posh girl.

476
00:33:17,697 --> 00:33:19,299
You're annoying!

477
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:20,867
Talking to you is pointless.

478
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:23,870
I'll call a cab
and go see Kin in his office.

479
00:33:31,578 --> 00:33:32,579
Ugh!

480
00:33:34,381 --> 00:33:35,515
Let's find shelter.

481
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,293
When is the rain going to stop?

482
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:53,133
There won't be any cabs
for you to call around here.

483
00:33:53,767 --> 00:33:55,101
It's going to take time
if you use the app.

484
00:33:56,136 --> 00:33:57,704
Let's wait until the rain stops,
then we can get going.

485
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:00,440
Otherwise, your pretty clothes
might get wet.

486
00:34:02,442 --> 00:34:04,444
It's your fault
for bringing me here.

487
00:34:07,347 --> 00:34:08,715
I'll call Kin.

488
00:34:09,783 --> 00:34:12,485
I'm his fiancée.
He'll answer my call.

489
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,355
Sure.

490
00:34:31,037 --> 00:34:34,240
The number you have called
is not available.

491
00:34:34,641 --> 00:34:37,744
Please leave a message

492
00:34:38,311 --> 00:34:40,613
after the beep.

493
00:34:57,964 --> 00:35:01,900
(Sasitorn Itsarapat)

494
00:35:01,901 --> 00:35:02,902
That's my mom.

495
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:07,207
Today's the anniversary
of her death.

496
00:35:09,509 --> 00:35:10,510
But it seems

497
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:13,279
I'm the only one who remembers.

498
00:35:18,351 --> 00:35:20,086
I briefly heard about your mother.

499
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,623
It must have been very sad

500
00:35:24,891 --> 00:35:27,360
to see the person you love
die right in front of you.

501
00:35:31,064 --> 00:35:32,732
I understand that feeling well.

502
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,241
The name "Sasitorn"...

503
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:44,110
means "the moon".

504
00:35:46,613 --> 00:35:47,947
The moon is calm and gentle.

505
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:51,818
But sometimes, being gentle...

506
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,854
can become a weakness.

507
00:35:58,625 --> 00:35:59,926
My mom didn't want me
to be like her.

508
00:36:00,727 --> 00:36:02,128
That's why she gave me
the name "Akin".

509
00:36:03,697 --> 00:36:04,698
It means "the sun".

510
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:09,502
It sounds fierce and strong.

511
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:14,307
So I'd be able to defend myself.

512
00:36:21,948 --> 00:36:25,051
I still remember
all of her stories and words.

513
00:36:28,054 --> 00:36:29,122
But I don't understand

514
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:34,527
why I can't remember that night.

515
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,498
The night the slums burned down.

516
00:36:42,402 --> 00:36:44,971
Maybe the fear you're trying
to help me uncover

517
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,441
has something to do with it.

518
00:36:58,585 --> 00:36:59,586
You know what?

519
00:37:00,353 --> 00:37:01,521
Sometimes I feel scared.

520
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:05,458
I'm scared the rumor
that my dad was behind the fire

521
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:07,727
might be true.

522
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:12,832
I don't know why,

523
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:15,802
but I feel guilty deep down

524
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,771
every single time

525
00:37:19,139 --> 00:37:20,440
I think about it.

526
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,643
It could just be in my head.

527
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,311
I might be worried

528
00:37:27,047 --> 00:37:28,114
about disappointing Mom

529
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:32,719
for not being as strong
as she'd hoped I would be.

530
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:37,424
I don't know if all of these
confused feelings

531
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:40,627
stem from the same thing.

532
00:37:51,137 --> 00:37:52,138
Hey.

533
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,745
Do you really love your fiancé,
or do you want to defeat him?

534
00:37:59,612 --> 00:38:01,648
You haven't given up
trying to call him.

535
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:06,820
You're getting a little too nosy.

536
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:09,489
We don't know each other that well.

537
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,827
You're just someone
who rides a lame motorbike.

538
00:38:14,461 --> 00:38:15,695
And I was unfortunate
to run into you.

539
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,002
You don't want to answer
my question

540
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:24,037
because it's personal?

541
00:38:24,704 --> 00:38:26,139
Or is it because...

542
00:38:27,173 --> 00:38:30,643
you're also not sure
if you love your fiancé?

543
00:38:36,683 --> 00:38:38,151
I often notice that

544
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:42,022
rich kids marry other rich kids

545
00:38:43,256 --> 00:38:44,824
for business reasons.

546
00:38:45,825 --> 00:38:46,860
Don't you think

547
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:50,163
your fiancé has to marry you
for those same reasons?

548
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:57,504
A simple and lame
motorbike rider like me

549
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,973
probably will never understand

550
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:02,409
how that kind of marriage can

551
00:39:02,976 --> 00:39:04,577
make people happy.

552
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:06,746
If it was me,

553
00:39:07,147 --> 00:39:08,982
I'd choose someone
who truly loves me

554
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,151
and not...

555
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:14,754
someone who makes
me feel unimportant.

556
00:39:24,297 --> 00:39:25,432
I don't think

557
00:39:26,399 --> 00:39:28,601
you have to be strong all the time.

558
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:31,671
Even the sun needs time to hide
behind the moon.

559
00:39:35,175 --> 00:39:36,910
I'd like to help you

560
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:39,112
uncover the truth.

561
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,781
In case someday

562
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:45,352
it will help heal the wound
in your heart.

563
00:39:58,264 --> 00:40:04,871
(Sasitorn Itsarapat)

564
00:40:07,874 --> 00:40:10,777
How many times have I had to put up
with you wasting my time?

565
00:40:11,511 --> 00:40:12,946
I hope there won't be a next time.

566
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:15,949
Oh, hey.

567
00:40:16,783 --> 00:40:17,784
Where are you going?

568
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,120
The rain's stopped.

569
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,956
I'm going. Leave me alone. Get lost.

570
00:40:23,857 --> 00:40:26,626
I told you it's deserted
around here. I'll give you a lift.

571
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,863
Don't take advantage of me. Let go.

572
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:32,265
I said it can be dangerous.
Let me give you a lift.

573
00:40:32,799 --> 00:40:36,536
Don't touch me without my consent.
Let go of me!

574
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,375
I... I'll give you a lift.

575
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:54,220
All right.

576
00:40:55,922 --> 00:40:57,524
I can't seem to call a cab either.

577
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,893
I told you were in
the middle of nowhere.

578
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:01,394
No one's going to drive past.

579
00:41:02,696 --> 00:41:04,230
Then why did you bring me here?

580
00:41:20,914 --> 00:41:23,650
Get home safe and take care.

581
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:29,189
I believe the wound in your heart
will be healed someday,

582
00:41:30,123 --> 00:41:31,825
even though it might leave a scar.

583
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,695
You just have to
find a way to live with it.

584
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:41,835
Ever since my mom died,

585
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:44,037
I have never been able
to trust anyone again.

586
00:41:49,609 --> 00:41:50,710
I can trust you, can't I?

587
00:42:22,342 --> 00:42:23,977
You never kissed me
like that before.

588
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:31,184
Thank you

589
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:34,187
for coming with me today.

590
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:45,732
I'm sorry.

591
00:43:13,259 --> 00:43:18,198
(Maya)

592
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:19,833
Hello, It.

593
00:43:20,834 --> 00:43:24,938
I've texted you the hotel location,
room number, and passcode.

594
00:43:25,939 --> 00:43:26,940
I'm on my way there.

595
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,209
See you soon.

596
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,384
(Message from Maya)

597
00:44:09,416 --> 00:44:10,417
Maya.

598
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:02,268
Maya!

599
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,137
- What's going on here?
- Who are you?

600
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:25,792
Is something the matter?

601
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:27,827
If you want my help,

602
00:45:28,862 --> 00:45:29,863
I know a way.

603
00:45:41,374 --> 00:45:43,109
You've murdered people with fire.

604
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:46,680
I'm going to use
the fire of your desire

605
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:49,115
to destroy you.

606
00:46:00,226 --> 00:46:01,828
Don't worry about the CCTV cameras.

607
00:46:02,729 --> 00:46:04,964
My friend owns this hotel.
I'll handle it.

608
00:46:10,837 --> 00:46:11,838
Let's go.

609
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:32,826
Where were you?

610
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,162
Why would you ask?

611
00:46:37,564 --> 00:46:38,998
You know I won't answer,
so why bother asking?

612
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:41,668
Maya told you to meet at a hotel,
didn't she?

613
00:46:44,704 --> 00:46:47,173
So what if I went to see her?

614
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,909
It's between me and her.
It has nothing to do with you.

615
00:46:52,212 --> 00:46:53,313
You should know this.

616
00:46:55,181 --> 00:46:56,349
It's a lot more fascinating.

617
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:05,892
Maya!

618
00:47:06,459 --> 00:47:07,460
What's going on here?

619
00:47:10,864 --> 00:47:12,899
I'm on my way there. See you soon.

620
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,438
Maya!

621
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:20,407
- What's going on here?
- Who are you?

622
00:47:26,146 --> 00:47:27,147
Did you...

623
00:47:28,782 --> 00:47:30,350
Did both of you trick me?

624
00:47:33,219 --> 00:47:34,320
Why would you do that?

625
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,289
What do you want?

626
00:47:37,123 --> 00:47:38,124
Divorce me.

627
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,361
Or I'm going to share this clip.

628
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:43,997
I don't know

629
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:46,199
what's going to happen afterward.

630
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:51,037
I'm going to tell everyone you
worked together to trick me.

631
00:47:53,273 --> 00:47:57,043
Who's going to care?
It's obvious in the clip

632
00:47:57,811 --> 00:47:59,079
the former lead actress

633
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:01,514
stormed into every room
like a mad woman.

634
00:48:02,682 --> 00:48:04,751
I wonder how viral it will be

635
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:06,853
if it gets uploaded to social media.

636
00:48:07,854 --> 00:48:08,855
And then

637
00:48:09,723 --> 00:48:10,724
for me,

638
00:48:11,424 --> 00:48:14,227
as your husband,

639
00:48:15,729 --> 00:48:17,063
how humiliating is it going to be?

640
00:48:19,632 --> 00:48:21,434
Isn't it enough of a reason

641
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:23,536
for me to file for divorce?

642
00:48:25,638 --> 00:48:27,974
Why did you have to go this far?

643
00:48:28,041 --> 00:48:29,442
And what about what you did to me?

644
00:48:30,343 --> 00:48:32,846
You worked with Treetep
to kick me out of my position.

645
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:34,313
I didn't do it!

646
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:35,315
I don't believe you!

647
00:48:37,384 --> 00:48:38,385
You can decide

648
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:41,454
whether to divorce me willingly

649
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:45,992
or lose everything you have
in exchange.

650
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:48,461
Because if I file for a divorce,

651
00:48:49,195 --> 00:48:50,497
you'll have nothing
left to your name.

652
00:48:55,402 --> 00:48:56,403
So?

653
00:48:57,771 --> 00:49:00,140
The man you thought was a loser.

654
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:05,278
Do you think he's still a loser now?

655
00:49:38,712 --> 00:49:42,115
(Maya)

656
00:49:45,885 --> 00:49:48,822
Ever since my mom died, I was never
able to trust anyone again.

657
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:50,757
I can trust you, can't I?

658
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:05,405
It and Maya are dangerous.

659
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:07,340
We can't underestimate them.

660
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:10,276
Do you see it now?

661
00:50:11,144 --> 00:50:13,246
You said she was a simple woman.

662
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:15,181
And look how she turned out.

663
00:50:18,284 --> 00:50:19,719
It went that far

664
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,921
because he's fed up with you.

665
00:50:24,824 --> 00:50:27,494
And you were stupid enough
to fall into his trap.

666
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:29,829
How can I not call you stupid?

667
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:32,132
Stupid, stupid, stupid!

668
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:35,435
Why do you have to rub it in?

669
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,938
If I have to lose everything,

670
00:50:40,106 --> 00:50:41,841
then you'll be left
with nothing either.

671
00:50:45,512 --> 00:50:46,746
That Maya.

672
00:50:49,382 --> 00:50:52,752
I really hate her guts.

673
00:50:54,854 --> 00:50:57,290
I should've just killed her.

674
00:51:02,629 --> 00:51:05,632
I hate her so much!

675
00:51:06,066 --> 00:51:08,735
I hate her! Do you understand?

676
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,338
- Enough!
- I really hate her!

677
00:51:12,772 --> 00:51:14,407
It's because you've lost your mind!

678
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,309
That's why you keep making mistakes!

679
00:51:21,514 --> 00:51:22,649
Let's put our heads together.

680
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:25,652
Use that feeble mind of yours

681
00:51:26,052 --> 00:51:28,855
and help me figure out a solution.

682
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,800
In any case, you still have
Risa and Treetep.

683
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:45,805
I think you're going to have to
lose something this time.

684
00:51:47,273 --> 00:51:48,608
Then you can take it back later.

685
00:51:52,812 --> 00:51:54,247
Are you telling me to divorce It?

686
00:51:57,317 --> 00:51:58,318
I won't do it.

687
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:02,956
You don't have to.

688
00:52:03,723 --> 00:52:05,191
I know a better way.

689
00:52:35,555 --> 00:52:37,991
I've decided to resign
from Itsara Group.

690
00:52:38,558 --> 00:52:41,461
What have you cooked up with her
this time?

691
00:52:42,729 --> 00:52:44,364
I'll never divorce you.

692
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:45,832
I believe

693
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,469
Risa's family is our only hope
for things to get better.

694
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:51,705
Do you enjoy manipulating men?

695
00:52:51,938 --> 00:52:54,741
Can you tell me the truth...

696
00:52:55,408 --> 00:52:57,010
- Ma!
- About what happened?

697
00:52:57,177 --> 00:52:59,979
It's time for us to take action.

698
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:03,817
What? You have video evidence
of the fire?
