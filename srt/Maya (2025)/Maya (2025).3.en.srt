1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,569
You're aware you have no right to
demand anything from me, aren't you?

2
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:04,971
And I hope my dad will
stay away from you too,

3
00:00:05,105 --> 00:00:06,473
once he finds out
you've slept with me.

4
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:09,609
Risa, do you mind if my friends join
your birthday party?

5
00:00:09,909 --> 00:00:11,177
Hi, Risa.

6
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,479
Happy birthday.

7
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:14,447
I saw what you did to Kin.

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,216
But I felt nothing.

9
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:17,484
Do you know why?

10
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:18,785
We're from different classes.

11
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:22,088
Ma, when will you get
to live your own life?

12
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,323
My life

13
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,427
won't be happy until I get to see
all of them burn.

14
00:00:30,997 --> 00:00:32,032
You're not joking, are you?

15
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:35,335
Did Saksit really kill his ex-wife
inside his house?

16
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:38,238
What kind of twisted person
is capable of murder?

17
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,844
Are you for real, Kwan?

18
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:46,279
Sounds like a TV drama to me.

19
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:47,547
Hey.

20
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:48,982
I saw it with my own eyes.

21
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,725
It was terrifying.

22
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:03,496
All right, take a deep breath.

23
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:06,399
Are you sure

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,035
no one saw you leaving the house?

25
00:01:12,272 --> 00:01:13,306
No one was there.

26
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,843
Darn it. What do I do now?

27
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:18,478
I can't go back there.

28
00:01:19,012 --> 00:01:20,914
If I do, he'll kill me.

29
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,649
If he realizes I saw him...

30
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:24,884
Oh no.

31
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:26,986
- Calm down.
- He'll kill me.

32
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,260
Hey.

33
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,229
He must have sent someone to get me.

34
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,931
- He knows I...
- Shh.

35
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,303
Calm down.

36
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,023
I was startled.

37
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,059
Why are you here, Ma?

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,761
I want to talk about us.

39
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:09,095
Now's not a good time.

40
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,665
Kwan.

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,068
Such a busybody.

42
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:18,204
What's wrong?
Did Saksit do something to you?

43
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:21,273
I saw Saksit killing...

44
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:22,275
Kwan!

45
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,480
Why?

46
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,315
Why can't we tell her?

47
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,117
We're all friends.

48
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:36,756
It's your call.

49
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:38,792
If you want to tell her, go ahead.

50
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:40,827
But don't be a fool

51
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,629
and go around telling people
what you saw.

52
00:02:42,862 --> 00:02:43,863
Otherwise, we'll all be dead.

53
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:47,133
What's going on, Kwan?

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,735
Who did Saksit kill?

55
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:28,168
I never thought
he would be this cruel.

56
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,072
But if you don't have any proof,

57
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,107
you must go back to him.

58
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,677
No, I can't go back.

59
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:41,147
If I do, he'll kill me.

60
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:44,718
Kwan.

61
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:46,786
I know you're shocked and scared.

62
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,788
But you need to use your head.

63
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:51,191
How will you support yourself
if you run away?

64
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,126
If you decide to run,

65
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,195
do you think
you can keep doing that forever?

66
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,896
And if you run,

67
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:58,698
Saksit will know that you know.

68
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,232
Right.

69
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,901
He will find you

70
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,403
and kill you.

71
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,172
He might also come after Ma and I

72
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,907
and kill us all to keep us quiet.

73
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,512
It's not that easy to walk away
from someone like Saksit.

74
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,914
Should I go to the police?

75
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,121
You're such an idiot, Kwan.

76
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:24,724
I understand how upset you are.

77
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:27,360
Do you think someone capable of that

78
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:29,662
is scared of the police?

79
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:33,199
I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

80
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,769
If I go back, he'll kill me.

81
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,938
What am I supposed to do?
I just want his money.

82
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,844
I don't think

83
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,180
Saksit realizes you know.

84
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:49,649
Otherwise, he would've sent someone
for you already.

85
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,918
You're right.

86
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:55,388
He hasn’t called you, has he?

87
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:00,026
I guess

88
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:02,829
we should take some time
to figure out our next move.

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,364
We?

90
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:07,767
How do Kwan and I know

91
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,004
you won’t just fend for yourself

92
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,573
and betray me again?

93
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:19,946
Are you two fighting?

94
00:06:21,247 --> 00:06:22,515
If you want us all in,

95
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,818
tell her your story.

96
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,687
True friends don’t keep secrets.

97
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,402
I'm home.

98
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,605
I’m going to take a shower.

99
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,044
Where were you? You're home late.

100
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:03,790
I thought you had run away from me.

101
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,362
Why would you say that?

102
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:11,431
Where would I possibly run to?

103
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,772
Had fun, didn’t you?

104
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,240
You were gone all day.

105
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:23,743
Yes.

106
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:27,714
I waited all day for you.
I missed you so much.

107
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:42,162
That's right.

108
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:43,896
- Parnkeaw.
- Hello.

109
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:46,633
- Congratulations.
- Thank you so much.

110
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:48,468
Parnkeaw is truly a wicked hag.

111
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,136
She worked her way in
to become a shareholder.

112
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,039
- Come on.
- How can she be so wicked?

113
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:54,674
Feel free to look at the courses.

114
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,209
- Okay.
- All right.

115
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:00,146
So many people are here.

116
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,148
What could I have done?

117
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,818
She said
she had everything prepared.

118
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,219
After hearing
that Saksit discussed with It

119
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,755
about finding a place
for the clinic,

120
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,458
she dragged me and Saksit
into becoming shareholders.

121
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:14,227
Those siblings are ruthless.

122
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,330
They won’t let anyone else benefit.

123
00:08:18,098 --> 00:08:19,499
No one's talking about that day.

124
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,737
The mall is open as usual,

125
00:08:25,138 --> 00:08:26,639
even though someone died.

126
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
Wait, no.

127
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,377
Many people died.

128
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,314
Maya.

129
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:37,183
I'm sorry for your loss.

130
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,222
These rich people

131
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,125
find happiness,
no matter who they hurt.

132
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:49,162
I won’t let them be happy
at the cost of so many lives.

133
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:56,002
But before that day comes,

134
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,673
all we have to do
is grab as much as we can.

135
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:01,908
If they think they're wicked,

136
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:03,710
my friend is way worse.

137
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,547
To all my wicked friends.

138
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,149
I’m well-trained.

139
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:15,321
He’s looking this way.
Give him a smile.

140
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,502
Classy, looking people
up and down like that.

141
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,707
Now's not a good time.
I have more interviews later.

142
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,509
Go ahead and eat, Risa.
I'm not sure when I'll be done.

143
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:38,345
I'll call you later.

144
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,249
Where are you going?

145
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:48,388
I came to congratulate a friend
who opened a clinic in your mall.

146
00:09:49,489 --> 00:09:51,825
Parnkeaw is a shareholder.

147
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:53,693
Aren’t you coming to the event?

148
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,528
I'm busy.

149
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,130
My question earlier.

150
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:58,732
What I meant was

151
00:09:59,366 --> 00:10:00,367
what are you doing here?

152
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,102
Where are you going?

153
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,337
This is a company office.

154
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:07,040
Not somewhere
outsiders can just wander into.

155
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,509
Actually,

156
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,379
I have an appointment with your dad.

157
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,614
We have things to discuss.

158
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,449
About what?

159
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:19,819
You’re still messing
with my dad, huh?

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,888
I said we have things to discuss.

161
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,757
If you doubt it,

162
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,458
you’re welcome to join.

163
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:30,530
I'm on my way.

164
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,199
But you seem busy.

165
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:35,802
I'll excuse myself then.

166
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:38,705
I don’t know

167
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:40,607
how you were raised.

168
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:42,809
You slept with me,

169
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:45,311
and now you’re chasing after my dad
like it’s nothing.

170
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,148
I'm warning you.

171
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,684
Stay away from my family.

172
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:53,920
If my dad finds out about us,

173
00:10:55,555 --> 00:10:57,157
he won't want to mess
with a woman like you.

174
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,262
I also don't know

175
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,831
how you were raised.

176
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,702
You slept with me
just to block your own dad.

177
00:11:12,939 --> 00:11:13,940
Please excuse me.

178
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,042
I don’t want
to keep your dad waiting.

179
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,289
This is this month's PR plan.

180
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,528
Usually, it’s just Kin
who joins the meetings.

181
00:11:36,162 --> 00:11:38,964
I really appreciate
that you, as the company president,

182
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,201
recognize the value of our PR work.

183
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:46,172
I just want to know if it’s possible
to add a special PR event here.

184
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,108
What event?

185
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,451
Hello, It.

186
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,854
Hello, Parnkeaw.

187
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:06,760
I'd like Maya to handle music
therapy activities at our mall,

188
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,729
so that our customers feel
more relaxed.

189
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,064
Most importantly, it could encourage

190
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,400
generous customers to donate
to those in need.

191
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,702
It’s a worthy cause.

192
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:18,738
Could you and your team
handle the PR for her?

193
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:31,551
I'm pleased to be working
with you, Parnkeaw.

194
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:33,953
We'll be seeing each other
more often.

195
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:36,690
Yes.

196
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:02,482
Parnkeaw.

197
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:15,995
Risa.

198
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,831
When did you get here?

199
00:13:18,865 --> 00:13:20,300
I’ve been here for a while.

200
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,436
Akin’s busy,
so I was waiting for you.

201
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,211
What did that woman do to you?

202
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,082
No one did anything to me.

203
00:13:37,684 --> 00:13:38,685
I'm just upset.

204
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:43,757
I don't believe you.

205
00:13:46,526 --> 00:13:48,228
Because I hate her too.

206
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,773
She had the nerve to do that to Kin
at your birthday party?

207
00:14:00,807 --> 00:14:01,808
Yes, Parnkeaw.

208
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:05,779
She wasn't drunk or confused.

209
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:07,414
I think she did it on purpose.

210
00:14:12,018 --> 00:14:14,220
That woman can never compare to you.

211
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,857
Kin will never be interested in her.

212
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,365
Don't worry.

213
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,501
We must hurry

214
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,737
and arrange your and Kin's wedding.

215
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,275
Thank you.

216
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:47,120
All of this marks the next step
in Thailand’s retail industry,

217
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:49,222
as outlined by Itsara Group.

218
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,224
All right, Akin.

219
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:55,929
Moving on to your personal life.

220
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,131
Before becoming the CEO
you are today,

221
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,734
what was your childhood like?

222
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:04,404
Why are you so stupid?

223
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,105
You're still not remorseful? No?

224
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,107
Mom.

225
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:15,615
Are you uncomfortable with
the question?

226
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,716
This is based on the script

227
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:20,220
that was sent to you earlier.

228
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,223
But if you're uncomfortable,
we can cut this part out.

229
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:24,891
It's fine.
Feel free to ask your questions.

230
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:28,094
Okay, please tell us
about your childhood.

231
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:29,429
Sure.

232
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,439
My childhood

233
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,107
was just like any other kid’s.

234
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:43,542
But I was very serious

235
00:15:43,543 --> 00:15:45,945
and wanted to do everything
to the best of my ability.

236
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,269
The psychiatrist said

237
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:12,806
you don’t remember anything at all.

238
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,290
Where are you going?

239
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:06,893
We're taking these
to Maya's office.

240
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,467
What's going on?

241
00:17:47,967 --> 00:17:50,270
Your dad set up
an office for me here.

242
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,345
Hey. You’re doing that again.

243
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:00,914
You’ve been doing it

244
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,982
since you were a kid, haven’t you?

245
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:05,985
It's none of your business.

246
00:18:11,825 --> 00:18:12,826
You know,

247
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,694
wounds from childhood

248
00:18:15,695 --> 00:18:17,197
can affect us well into adulthood.

249
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,501
Right now,

250
00:18:22,202 --> 00:18:23,570
you’re all grown up.

251
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,905
You have responsibilities.

252
00:18:27,073 --> 00:18:29,409
So you decide to forget
your childhood wounds.

253
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,078
But sometimes,

254
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:33,913
the more you try to forget

255
00:18:34,547 --> 00:18:36,116
or ignore them,

256
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,119
it’s like

257
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,021
sweeping them under the rug.

258
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,223
If one day

259
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,025
you can’t hide them anymore,

260
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:47,560
this is what happens.

261
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:49,729
If you don’t get help,

262
00:18:51,064 --> 00:18:52,298
your wounds

263
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,035
will never heal.

264
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,439
Don’t you want to find out

265
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:02,876
about the trauma

266
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,011
that’s keeping you stuck?

267
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:08,782
I can help you.

268
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,339
At the very least,

269
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:35,475
music therapy

270
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,610
might help.

271
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,513
It can reduce your stress.

272
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,283
Do you want to give it a try?

273
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:56,690
All right.

274
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,092
Now that you're feeling
a bit more relaxed,

275
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,996
I want you to picture yourself
in the past.

276
00:21:05,632 --> 00:21:07,300
Picture that little boy.

277
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,570
Imagine yourself

278
00:21:11,538 --> 00:21:13,106
as a friend of his.

279
00:21:14,341 --> 00:21:16,109
You’re there with him
through everything.

280
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,211
The good moments

281
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:20,480
and the bad ones.

282
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,918
While you're with him,

283
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,721
ask him

284
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,423
if he's seen

285
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:34,060
or heard his father do something.

286
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:37,197
Did he see

287
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:40,000
your father do something that day?

288
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:42,535
The day

289
00:21:43,737 --> 00:21:45,271
of the fire in the slums.

290
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,274
Do you remember?

291
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,651
What did you do to me?

292
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:00,653
Did you hypnotize me?

293
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:02,822
No, I didn't.

294
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:05,525
I just used
some psychology I studied,

295
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:07,293
combined with music therapy,

296
00:22:08,028 --> 00:22:10,797
to help uncover
and heal your internal wounds.

297
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,671
So,

298
00:22:18,805 --> 00:22:19,806
did you see anything just now?

299
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,643
No, I didn't.

300
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:27,213
I don't remember anything.

301
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,450
That's fine.

302
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,819
We can try again.

303
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:35,822
Akin.

304
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,893
I'll help you heal your wounds.

305
00:22:52,339 --> 00:22:53,406
Don't worry.

306
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,643
I'm here with you.

307
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:36,082
It’s probably a battery issue.

308
00:23:36,349 --> 00:23:37,784
I’ll send someone to handle it.

309
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:39,853
Okay, thank you.

310
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,287
Just a moment.

311
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,227
Nice car.

312
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:49,729
Is there an issue?

313
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:53,867
Yes, but a mechanic's on the way.

314
00:23:54,034 --> 00:23:55,035
I see.

315
00:23:56,736 --> 00:24:00,707
I haven't had the chance
to thank you for my office.

316
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:03,309
Don't worry. It’s no big deal.

317
00:24:03,743 --> 00:24:05,879
Let me know if anything’s missing.
My team will take care of it.

318
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:07,480
Thank you.

319
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,449
So, what now?

320
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,052
It’s dinner time.

321
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:14,087
Haven’t eaten yet, have you?

322
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,925
Let’s grab something good.

323
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:20,093
I'm starving.

324
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:22,062
I’ll take you home afterward.

325
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:25,498
Sure.

326
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,270
Thank you so much

327
00:24:30,804 --> 00:24:33,006
for always supporting me.

328
00:24:35,275 --> 00:24:36,276
You're welcome.

329
00:24:38,411 --> 00:24:39,546
But I think

330
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,048
I want to do more than
just play music

331
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,418
and collect donations at the mall.

332
00:24:49,689 --> 00:24:51,224
I want to

333
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:54,027
host a charity concert.

334
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,130
It’d be great for your company

335
00:24:57,530 --> 00:25:00,300
if we could channel
all the donations

336
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:04,237
to the slum development project
you’ve been supporting.

337
00:25:04,871 --> 00:25:05,872
What do you think?

338
00:25:07,841 --> 00:25:08,842
It's interesting.

339
00:25:11,311 --> 00:25:13,380
We can also promote

340
00:25:14,247 --> 00:25:16,149
the concert as a memorial event,

341
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:19,753
so the community knows

342
00:25:20,353 --> 00:25:21,621
your company

343
00:25:22,155 --> 00:25:23,990
is expressing its condolences
about the incident.

344
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:28,628
From what I found out

345
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:31,031
about the fire that day,

346
00:25:32,132 --> 00:25:33,867
many people lost their lives.

347
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:39,305
Shall I serve the food now, sir?

348
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,241
Sure.

349
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:42,542
Please wait a moment.

350
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,178
Let's eat something first.

351
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:46,846
We can

352
00:25:48,048 --> 00:25:49,049
discuss work later.

353
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:50,850
Come on.

354
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:02,829
Anyway, thank you again

355
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:04,898
for always supporting me.

356
00:26:11,104 --> 00:26:12,105
You're welcome.

357
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:13,506
By the way,

358
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,376
do you know about the fire that day?

359
00:26:18,378 --> 00:26:19,479
Your house

360
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,549
isn’t far from where it happened.

361
00:26:28,488 --> 00:26:30,290
I remember

362
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,259
my family and I

363
00:26:33,993 --> 00:26:37,197
were abroad at that time,
not in Thailand.

364
00:26:38,898 --> 00:26:41,034
So I don't know what happened.

365
00:27:22,409 --> 00:27:24,477
Thank you for dinner

366
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:26,846
and for taking me home.

367
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,449
You’re really kind.

368
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,219
You're welcome.

369
00:27:34,888 --> 00:27:35,889
Good night.

370
00:27:37,691 --> 00:27:38,692
Good night.

371
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:01,815
Hey, how did you get in?

372
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,249
You’re not listening
to my warning, are you?

373
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:07,354
Did you follow me?

374
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:10,890
Don’t tell me

375
00:28:11,624 --> 00:28:12,759
you care about me too.

376
00:28:12,926 --> 00:28:14,260
You’re messing with my family.

377
00:28:15,095 --> 00:28:16,096
I have to protect them.

378
00:28:22,535 --> 00:28:23,536
Who do you live with?

379
00:28:24,804 --> 00:28:25,805
I live alone.

380
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:27,607
I have no brothers or sisters.

381
00:28:28,508 --> 00:28:29,709
My parents are dead.

382
00:28:42,422 --> 00:28:43,857
If you want to know something
about me,

383
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:45,792
just ask.

384
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:06,079
Don’t tell me

385
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,082
you followed me into my house

386
00:29:09,616 --> 00:29:10,617
and aren't going to do anything.

387
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:14,187
Why?

388
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:16,256
Are you afraid
your dad will scold you?

389
00:30:14,214 --> 00:30:17,250
I hope after you finish
playing music at the mall,

390
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,119
we won’t see each other again.

391
00:31:19,646 --> 00:31:20,647
Indy.

392
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,551
Hey, what are you doing?

393
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:27,921
He could do it but I can't?

394
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,759
It’s just part of the plan.

395
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,761
What stupid plan?

396
00:31:35,562 --> 00:31:37,030
Why would you sacrifice yourself
like that?

397
00:31:38,331 --> 00:31:39,332
Do you like him?

398
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:45,638
I will never have feelings
for a scumbag like him.

399
00:31:47,807 --> 00:31:49,776
And I will never have feelings
for anyone.

400
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:54,014
From now on,

401
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:56,649
my life is all about revenge.

402
00:31:59,886 --> 00:32:00,887
When this finally ends,

403
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:03,089
will you stop messing with him?

404
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,092
Fine.

405
00:32:06,893 --> 00:32:07,894
I will help you.

406
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:11,398
How can you possibly help me?

407
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,575
Wait, Indy.

408
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,030
Sir.

409
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:45,632
This is probably Maya's.

410
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:47,334
I found it in the car.

411
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:52,972
Okay.

412
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:56,609
Leave.

413
00:33:07,687 --> 00:33:08,688
Where have you been?

414
00:33:10,323 --> 00:33:11,324
Dad.

415
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:12,926
Kin.

416
00:33:13,493 --> 00:33:14,661
You're home.

417
00:33:15,362 --> 00:33:17,063
Your dad and I want to talk
to you about something.

418
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:22,235
What is it?

419
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:26,339
We must hurry
and arrange your wedding with Risa.

420
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,575
The most auspicious date

421
00:33:28,708 --> 00:33:30,810
is three months from now.

422
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:37,417
Why?

423
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:39,853
Is there a problem?

424
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:43,923
Don’t make me
break my promise to Treetep.

425
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,761
Yes, Dad.

426
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:05,211
Since you’ve found the best
and most suitable woman for you,

427
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,549
there’s no reason to waste time.

428
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:44,951
Come in.

429
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:52,225
You sent someone to get me.
Is there something you need?

430
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:03,703
You dropped this in my car.

431
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,941
Thank you.

432
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,609
I was looking for it.

433
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:12,012
I’ll put it on for you.

434
00:35:48,682 --> 00:35:49,683
Akin.

435
00:35:57,590 --> 00:36:01,161
Maya and I are expanding
our CSR program.

436
00:36:02,629 --> 00:36:05,231
Could you and Akin help
coordinate this, please?

437
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:07,434
What now?

438
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,736
A charity concert

439
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:12,238
by Maya.

440
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:20,714
Thank you.

441
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:23,016
I thought you had forgotten.

442
00:36:30,156 --> 00:36:31,157
That's all.

443
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:43,870
From now on,

444
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:45,939
I’ll handle

445
00:36:46,906 --> 00:36:48,041
all your troublesome activities,

446
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,344
so you can stop bothering my dad.

447
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:54,848
Thank you

448
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,183
for paying attention to me.

449
00:36:58,251 --> 00:36:59,252
I hope

450
00:37:00,687 --> 00:37:02,489
this will be the last event.

451
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:06,159
You can just take the money.

452
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,561
Tell me how much you want.

453
00:37:09,829 --> 00:37:11,698
Maybe then you’ll finally
leave my family alone.

454
00:37:14,334 --> 00:37:15,468
Do you think

455
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:18,338
I’m doing all this

456
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:20,440
for money?

457
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:23,410
Then what do you want?

458
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:28,748
Be patient, Akin.

459
00:37:29,582 --> 00:37:31,151
One day, you’ll find out

460
00:37:31,951 --> 00:37:33,920
whether what I want from you guys

461
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,389
is what you thought I wanted.

462
00:37:40,927 --> 00:37:41,961
Don’t stress yourself out.

463
00:37:42,529 --> 00:37:45,699
I just want to do something good

464
00:37:46,166 --> 00:37:47,734
to help those in need.

465
00:37:49,135 --> 00:37:50,270
Like the concert,

466
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:52,105
it’s for charity.

467
00:37:53,073 --> 00:37:54,607
I’m not looking to gain anything
from anyone.

468
00:37:59,779 --> 00:38:00,980
I understand

469
00:38:01,748 --> 00:38:03,416
that maybe

470
00:38:04,651 --> 00:38:06,386
your stress

471
00:38:07,687 --> 00:38:08,922
comes from your past.

472
00:38:11,691 --> 00:38:13,460
I genuinely want to help you.

473
00:38:17,664 --> 00:38:18,732
I'm glad

474
00:38:20,166 --> 00:38:22,068
to be working here.

475
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:30,110
I want to

476
00:38:30,543 --> 00:38:32,445
help you heal from your trauma.

477
00:38:42,956 --> 00:38:43,957
What are you two doing?

478
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:57,337
What therapy?

479
00:38:57,904 --> 00:38:58,905
Why did you ask...

480
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:04,944
Why did you ask her
to do it privately?

481
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:08,381
If someone saw that,
it could be misunderstood.

482
00:39:09,449 --> 00:39:10,650
It’s nothing, Risa.

483
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,086
Are you sick?

484
00:39:13,953 --> 00:39:14,954
What’s wrong?

485
00:39:15,689 --> 00:39:17,123
If you need to see a psychiatrist,

486
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,158
I can ask my dad
to talk to the doctors

487
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:21,061
and recommend
a good one for you.

488
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,430
It's fine.

489
00:39:23,763 --> 00:39:24,898
I'm not that sick.

490
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:28,668
You’re right.

491
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:32,539
It's obvious that
she just wants to get close to you.

492
00:39:34,541 --> 00:39:35,909
Do you still believe her?

493
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:38,611
We don't even know who she is.

494
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,614
Do not trust her.

495
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,951
I’m not saying I trust her.

496
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,158
But what I saw
tells a different story.

497
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,931
All right then,

498
00:39:58,932 --> 00:40:00,900
let’s talk about our wedding.

499
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:03,203
So you can prove

500
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:05,271
you’re not interested
in anyone else but me.

501
00:40:22,222 --> 00:40:23,223
Indy.

502
00:40:23,656 --> 00:40:24,657
What are you doing here?

503
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,761
There?

504
00:40:28,862 --> 00:40:30,163
Is that where the guy jumped?

505
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:35,035
I’d probably seem
like a selfish person

506
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,971
if I didn’t help you do something
for those who passed away.

507
00:40:38,238 --> 00:40:39,639
Why bring this up here?

508
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:42,275
Are you trying to stop me again?

509
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:48,281
I fixed your car,
so I brought it here.

510
00:40:51,217 --> 00:40:52,218
Thank you.

511
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,287
But other than that,

512
00:40:54,754 --> 00:40:55,789
you don’t need to help me.

513
00:40:56,156 --> 00:40:57,157
I’m helping you.

514
00:40:58,024 --> 00:41:00,126
Because I want you to finish
what you’re doing quickly.

515
00:41:00,827 --> 00:41:02,395
So you can start living your life.

516
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:11,938
Hello?

517
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,710
Huh? What did you say?

518
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:20,213
Okay.

519
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,581
What’s going on?

520
00:41:21,748 --> 00:41:22,749
Mom is gone.

521
00:41:23,016 --> 00:41:24,117
- What?
- Let's go.

522
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:35,161
Mom.

523
00:41:39,866 --> 00:41:42,002
Have you found her?
How did my mother go missing?

524
00:41:42,302 --> 00:41:43,837
She was asleep,

525
00:41:43,903 --> 00:41:44,903
so I took out the trash.

526
00:41:44,904 --> 00:41:46,106
It was only a moment.

527
00:41:46,406 --> 00:41:48,441
When I came back, she was gone.

528
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,411
I searched everywhere,
but couldn’t find her.

529
00:41:51,878 --> 00:41:53,680
Everyone’s been looking for her.

530
00:41:56,816 --> 00:41:57,951
Can you move your car?

531
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:00,220
Doctor.

532
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,421
Come on.

533
00:42:01,788 --> 00:42:02,789
There.

534
00:42:02,922 --> 00:42:04,391
- Over here.
- I remember her.

535
00:42:04,524 --> 00:42:06,860
She was wandering around.
She’s mentally ill.

536
00:42:07,527 --> 00:42:08,828
Poor her.

537
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:12,098
What’s that noise?

538
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:14,701
What’s happening?

539
00:42:25,945 --> 00:42:29,581
That crazy woman was hit by a car.
The driver fled.

540
00:42:29,582 --> 00:42:30,583
You can’t enter.

541
00:42:31,785 --> 00:42:32,786
Mom!

542
00:42:33,753 --> 00:42:35,155
Mom.

543
00:42:36,189 --> 00:42:37,190
- No.
- Wait, miss.

544
00:42:38,258 --> 00:42:40,493
- Mom, wake up!
- Please move away.

545
00:42:40,794 --> 00:42:42,828
- Wake up, Mom!
- Let us do our job.

546
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:44,297
Please let the officers
do their work.

547
00:42:45,365 --> 00:42:46,765
- Mom, wake up!
- Miss.

548
00:42:46,766 --> 00:42:48,368
Don't die.

549
00:42:50,136 --> 00:42:52,539
Mom! Don't die.

550
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:57,544
Mom.

551
00:42:58,278 --> 00:42:59,611
Wake up, Mom.

552
00:42:59,612 --> 00:43:00,714
- Mom.
- Move away.

553
00:43:02,115 --> 00:43:03,450
It's me, Mom.

554
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:08,754
What should we do?

555
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:10,757
Mom.

556
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:13,960
Mom.

557
00:43:14,961 --> 00:43:16,596
Wake up, Mom.

558
00:43:16,963 --> 00:43:18,864
Wake up.

559
00:43:18,865 --> 00:43:20,300
- Mom.
- Please let us do our job.

560
00:43:23,403 --> 00:43:24,404
Please.

561
00:43:28,575 --> 00:43:31,077
Come back to me.

562
00:43:32,012 --> 00:43:33,013
Mom.

563
00:43:33,747 --> 00:43:35,382
Wake up, Mom.

564
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:49,462
Stop lying to me.

565
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:50,997
I know she's your mother.

566
00:43:52,165 --> 00:43:53,600
What did you do to Risa

567
00:43:53,767 --> 00:43:55,168
that caused Treetep to be unhappy

568
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,469
and say that to me?

569
00:43:56,636 --> 00:43:57,904
What did you do

570
00:43:58,438 --> 00:43:59,539
to give him the upper hand
to blackmail us?

571
00:43:59,673 --> 00:44:00,674
Darn it.

572
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:03,877
You enjoy music.
Would you like to give it a try?

573
00:44:06,579 --> 00:44:08,381
I know what you’re thinking.

574
00:44:08,982 --> 00:44:11,384
You're nothing
compared to me, lowlife!

575
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:13,386
I have to stay alive

576
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:16,156
to see those who did evil

577
00:44:16,322 --> 00:44:18,024
face the full consequences
of their actions.
