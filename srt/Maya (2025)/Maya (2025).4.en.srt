1
00:00:00,266 --> 00:00:03,570
I'd like Maya to handle music
therapy activities at our mall.

2
00:00:04,437 --> 00:00:05,438
What did you do to me?

3
00:00:05,638 --> 00:00:06,639
Did you hypnotize me?

4
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:08,274
Do you still believe her?

5
00:00:08,641 --> 00:00:10,310
We don't even know who she is.

6
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:12,212
Do not trust her.

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,180
He could do it but I can't?

8
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,849
Do you like him?

9
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:18,118
I will never have feelings
for a scumbag like him.

10
00:00:18,418 --> 00:00:20,487
And I will never have feelings
for anyone.

11
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:21,955
Mom is gone.

12
00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:23,523
Mom!

13
00:00:27,394 --> 00:00:29,896
Mom, wake up!

14
00:00:42,742 --> 00:00:43,743
Are you a relative of Bua's?

15
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:45,311
That's right.

16
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,180
How is she doing?

17
00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:49,582
She fractured her skull,

18
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,118
and her brain's swollen.
She's still unconscious.

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,355
She has to remain in the ICU.

20
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:57,357
She needs close observation.

21
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:04,998
When is she going to wake up?

22
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:06,666
As for that...

23
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:08,768
we still don't know the answer.

24
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:10,937
We will have to assess
her condition daily.

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,441
Thank you, Doctor.

26
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,909
Excuse me.

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,304
No matter how poor we are,

28
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:51,244
doesn't Mom have the right to live
a happy and worthy life?

29
00:01:58,151 --> 00:01:59,586
Mom's in this state

30
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,287
because of them.

31
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,457
If something happens to her someday,

32
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,227
do you think

33
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,462
I'll be able to stay put?

34
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,580
Ma.

35
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:33,553
You need to relax.

36
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:35,855
Your mom is with the doctors now.

37
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,591
They'll do their best to help her.

38
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,100
She's going to be okay, isn't she?

39
00:02:58,645 --> 00:02:59,846
She's going to.

40
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:01,815
We have to keep
reminding ourselves that.

41
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,998
It's okay.

42
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:20,854
Who do you live with?

43
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,256
Mom, wake up!

44
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:24,557
I live alone.

45
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,459
I have no brothers or sisters.

46
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,495
My parents are dead.

47
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,198
Do you think I’m doing all this

48
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:33,600
for money?

49
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,268
Then what do you want?

50
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,337
One day, you’ll find out

51
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,973
whether what I want from you guys

52
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,475
is what you thought I wanted.

53
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,287
I want you to picture yourself
in the past.

54
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,091
Picture that little boy.

55
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:01,461
Imagine yourself

56
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,697
as a friend of his.

57
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:06,800
Picture that little boy.

58
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,302
Ask him

59
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,705
if he's seen

60
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,741
or heard his father do something.

61
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,644
The psychiatrist said
you don’t remember anything at all.

62
00:06:17,911 --> 00:06:18,978
You're still not remorseful?

63
00:06:19,346 --> 00:06:20,347
No?

64
00:06:20,447 --> 00:06:21,748
Did he see

65
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,384
your father do something that day?

66
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,819
No! Enough!

67
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,354
- Mom!
- Stop!

68
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:30,123
The day of the fire in the slums.

69
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:31,358
Do you remember?

70
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,592
Darn it!

71
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,237
The people in the slums
are protesting?

72
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:53,346
Are they crazy?

73
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,548
Do they think that land
belongs to them?

74
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:00,587
Deal with them tonight

75
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,157
before things escalate.

76
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,860
Burn it all down.

77
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,628
I don't care if anyone dies.

78
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,693
(Fire in the Slums 15 Years Ago)

79
00:07:46,533 --> 00:07:47,634
Murderer!

80
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:49,202
Murderer!

81
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:51,938
You killed people and built a
shopping mall on their land!

82
00:07:52,238 --> 00:07:54,140
We still remember, you murderer!

83
00:07:54,774 --> 00:07:55,775
Murderer!

84
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,032
No information at all?

85
00:08:20,567 --> 00:08:23,503
What about the day our company
hosted the funeral?

86
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,339
No one came or presented themselves
as relatives?

87
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,810
I've been wondering
that if I want to ask

88
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,947
about the fire in
the slums 15 years ago,

89
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:35,682
who should I be asking?

90
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,720
Oh, it's all right.

91
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,058
Well then. Have you sent over
the video clip I asked for?

92
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,328
Oh, you have. Thank you.

93
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,110
This is...

94
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:42,682
Thank you so much

95
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,585
for joining our music therapy
session today.

96
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,788
You can donate to support

97
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,092
the slums development project.

98
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,426
Do you know

99
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,428
why I'm fond of butterflies?

100
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,465
It's because they don't

101
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,035
have any recollection
of when they were young.

102
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:38,938
When they are only pupas,

103
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,708
they'll destroy all of their limbs

104
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,910
to transform into butterflies.

105
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,312
It's been tested.

106
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:48,148
It turns out
that the brain of a butterfly

107
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:52,018
has no recollection
of when it was a pupa.

108
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:56,022
If people could forget
their childhood memories,

109
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,991
it would be good, wouldn't it?

110
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,230
Did something happen to you
when you were a kid?

111
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:07,634
Is that why you want
to forget so much?

112
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,739
My past isn't important.

113
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,408
Let's talk about you.

114
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,312
If you can remember your childhood,

115
00:11:20,146 --> 00:11:21,948
your life will probably
be much easier.

116
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,851
Do you really want to help me?

117
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:28,388
Or do you actually want something?

118
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:30,557
You've asked me many times already

119
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:31,925
what I want.

120
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:46,639
Why would you do that?

121
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:49,909
What did I do?

122
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:53,079
Carrying flowers that resemble
funeral flowers

123
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,715
at the opening
of my shopping mall.

124
00:11:58,251 --> 00:11:59,252
Why did you do it?

125
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:02,922
I brought them to say
congratulations.

126
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,591
But then that thing happened.

127
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,459
But you seemed very satisfied

128
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,661
that someone caused a scene there.

129
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:11,431
I think you're misunderstanding
my intentions.

130
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,034
Are you lying right now?

131
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,173
Why would I lie to you?

132
00:12:20,407 --> 00:12:21,708
And what else did you lie about?

133
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,343
Tell me.

134
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,550
Come with me.

135
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,552
Where are we going?

136
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,020
Akin!

137
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,764
Where are you taking me?

138
00:12:53,573 --> 00:12:54,774
What's up with you?

139
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,210
Let go of me!

140
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,185
What's your relation
with the patient in this room?

141
00:13:08,855 --> 00:13:09,989
Stop lying to me.

142
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:11,958
I know she's your mother.

143
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,895
I've seen everything
since she was hit by a car.

144
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,498
I thought you said
your parents were dead.

145
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,401
Tell me.

146
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,602
Why did you lie to me?

147
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:26,873
And what else did you
lie to me about?

148
00:13:27,741 --> 00:13:28,908
What do you actually want from me?

149
00:13:29,909 --> 00:13:30,909
Tell me!

150
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,910
Hey!

151
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,580
- You!
- Hey! Don't!

152
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:35,815
Stop, both of you!

153
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,487
The woman in this room

154
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:43,390
is his mother.

155
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:47,093
If you don't believe me,

156
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,863
then feel free to check
her last name.

157
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,166
Hers and mine are different.

158
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:58,805
And this guy...

159
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:01,908
is my boyfriend.

160
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:13,586
Does your boyfriend know about us?

161
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:16,756
He knows everything.

162
00:14:17,824 --> 00:14:18,825
And he doesn't care.

163
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,928
I guess that means

164
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,130
he's working with you.

165
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:26,733
Working with me?

166
00:14:27,834 --> 00:14:28,835
What are you talking about?

167
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:31,805
To seduce rich men, of course.

168
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:36,509
If that's the case,

169
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,778
then you understand everything.

170
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,748
There's nothing I'm hiding
from you anymore.

171
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,718
How much do you want?

172
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:47,754
Take your service fee.

173
00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:51,091
And stay away from me.

174
00:14:51,424 --> 00:14:52,425
Akin,

175
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:54,227
keep in mind

176
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:57,630
that you're not my target.

177
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:00,200
Don't flatter yourself.

178
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,435
The person I want

179
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:04,537
is your dad.

180
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,474
Your dad is

181
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:09,609
the chairperson of the company.

182
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,378
It's a high-ranking position.

183
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,480
You're nothing compared to him.

184
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,449
Another thing,

185
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,918
if you're thinking of
exposing me to It,

186
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,254
then be my guest.

187
00:15:22,856 --> 00:15:23,990
Because now,

188
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,426
your relationship with him

189
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:27,961
isn't great either.

190
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:31,498
All I have to do is tell him

191
00:15:32,198 --> 00:15:33,600
that you're jealous of me.

192
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:34,934
My dad will probably

193
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,604
use your service
for only a few times.

194
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:39,039
Then he'll get fed up

195
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,640
and dump you.

196
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:44,210
Then let's wait
until he's fed up with me.

197
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,448
But if he becomes so attached to me
that he's unable to dump me,

198
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:50,717
then it's your problem.

199
00:16:04,597 --> 00:16:05,799
Have I ruined your plan?

200
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:08,501
No.

201
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:10,070
This is good.

202
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:13,306
So he'll stop wondering
about you and my mom.

203
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,308
What are you going to do now?

204
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:18,978
You should spend your time
taking care of her.

205
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,914
It's better
than doing something else.

206
00:16:21,381 --> 00:16:22,382
Indy,

207
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,517
I'm not going to talk to you
about this anymore.

208
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,287
And quit trying to get me to stop.

209
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:29,989
I'm about to find out the truth.

210
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,157
I won't stop now.

211
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,494
I'm going to see Mom.

212
00:16:47,207 --> 00:16:48,208
Akin.

213
00:16:52,979 --> 00:16:54,047
I'm sorry

214
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,549
my boyfriend did that to you
yesterday.

215
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,187
Well,

216
00:17:01,888 --> 00:17:04,057
we're going through a rough patch.

217
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,494
I'm about to break up with him.

218
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:10,196
But,

219
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:12,332
I had to do it

220
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,568
because he's refusing to break up.

221
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:18,872
Why are you telling me this?

222
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,474
I...

223
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,278
want to heal the wound
in your heart.

224
00:17:26,746 --> 00:17:28,048
And that's my intention.

225
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:31,618
I must've opened up
old wounds for you.

226
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:35,021
I want to heal them.

227
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,891
I believe I can do it

228
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,859
if you open up your heart
and let me try.

229
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:42,896
I have a degree in this field.

230
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,414
You called. What's the matter, Dad?

231
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:05,352
Ah, you're here now.

232
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:09,756
Hello, Treetep.

233
00:18:11,725 --> 00:18:13,426
You must've been busy lately.

234
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,564
Risa said you haven't
had much time for her.

235
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:22,235
Oh.

236
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,472
There's been a lot of work
to deal with lately.

237
00:18:27,107 --> 00:18:28,108
I guess so.

238
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,744
There's probably plenty
on your hands,

239
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:32,379
so you're stressed.

240
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:37,650
That's why you needed to use
music therapy service.

241
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:49,929
It's nothing, really.

242
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:53,900
I'm just here to chat with your dad.

243
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,071
We were also discussing the wedding.

244
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,408
I hope you have some time
to prioritize it

245
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,610
and do your best
to organize the wedding.

246
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,479
So that my daughter's happy with it.

247
00:19:08,548 --> 00:19:09,549
Of course.

248
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,692
Right, It.

249
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:22,562
Have a look. Do any of these
land plots catch your eye?

250
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,965
My friends proposed them to me
so you can develop them.

251
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,399
I see.

252
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,637
But a lot of them are
adjacent to slums.

253
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:34,507
Bangkok has a lot of slums,
unfortunately.

254
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,278
But I don't think it's going to be
a problem for you.

255
00:19:39,546 --> 00:19:41,648
Because you seem to have
your own solution.

256
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:48,621
It's good our families are
about to merge.

257
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,660
Otherwise, what if the evidence

258
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:56,463
of what you did
in the past resurfaces?

259
00:19:58,198 --> 00:19:59,265
Who's going to be able to help you

260
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,101
apart from me?

261
00:20:11,845 --> 00:20:13,680
Don't disappoint Risa, Akin.

262
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:16,816
I won't.

263
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:21,821
Treetep, things are
ready downstairs.

264
00:20:22,322 --> 00:20:23,322
Thank you.

265
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:24,324
This way, please.

266
00:20:48,815 --> 00:20:50,383
What did you do to Risa

267
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:52,952
that caused Treetep to be unhappy

268
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,487
and say that to me?

269
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:58,758
What did you do

270
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:00,760
to give him the upper hand
to blackmail us?

271
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:02,595
What did I do?

272
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,764
What did I do?

273
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,901
It might only be an empty threat.

274
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:09,436
He might not have evidence.

275
00:21:12,038 --> 00:21:13,039
Are you sure

276
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:15,842
his treat isn't

277
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,579
about the fire in the slums
that we built the mall on top of?

278
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,882
Are you sure

279
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:25,085
you didn't do anything wrong?

280
00:21:35,662 --> 00:21:36,663
You don't want to know

281
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,433
what happened that day.

282
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:44,170
It's time.

283
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,740
Treetep's downstairs waiting.

284
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,276
Aren't you going to come down?

285
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,812
Can't you see I'm about to?

286
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,720
These two girls were
born in the slums.

287
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,289
Many of you might think

288
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:11,224
that classical music is
only for the wealthy.

289
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:12,759
But in fact,

290
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:16,830
everyone has the right
to classical music.

291
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:20,066
Anyway, thank you very much

292
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,268
for donating to our project.

293
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,838
And these two girls will

294
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:27,340
have the chance
to hone their skills

295
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,642
and improve their lives.

296
00:23:49,496 --> 00:23:51,430
(The Grand Itsara
Donates 100,000 baht...)

297
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,599
(to the Slums Development Project)

298
00:23:54,567 --> 00:23:55,568
Thank you.

299
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:58,805
You're beautiful, talented,

300
00:23:59,472 --> 00:24:00,674
and very charitable.

301
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:05,545
I'd like to support your work
with my own money.

302
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:10,784
Parnkeaw, would you mind
heavily advertising this?

303
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:13,687
Attract people's attention
so they donate.

304
00:24:14,387 --> 00:24:15,622
I'm happy to help.

305
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,123
Thank you again.

306
00:24:17,657 --> 00:24:19,125
You're also very charitable
yourself.

307
00:24:31,838 --> 00:24:33,173
Let me measure
the light level real quick.

308
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:36,743
Okay. Ready?

309
00:24:38,378 --> 00:24:39,379
That's good.

310
00:24:40,547 --> 00:24:41,648
Change your pose, please.

311
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:44,017
Great. That's beautiful.

312
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:47,654
Okay. Great.

313
00:24:49,022 --> 00:24:50,023
Another one, please.

314
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,658
Wow, that one hits hard.

315
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,162
Whoa, nice. Try changing
to another pose.

316
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:57,897
Okay. Another one.

317
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,800
Okay. Stare into the camera. Good.

318
00:25:01,701 --> 00:25:02,702
Hold on.

319
00:25:27,927 --> 00:25:28,928
Thank you

320
00:25:29,529 --> 00:25:32,265
for coming to take care
of me personally today.

321
00:25:33,433 --> 00:25:34,901
Don't misunderstand me.

322
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,505
I just want things
to turn out nicely.

323
00:25:40,306 --> 00:25:41,307
Because this is

324
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:44,144
a reflection upon my work.

325
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:46,846
As for your work,

326
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:49,716
it's only temporary.

327
00:25:59,259 --> 00:26:00,860
No one's going to keep you
around for long.

328
00:26:15,575 --> 00:26:16,576
Oh?

329
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,311
What's happened?

330
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,146
I didn't do anything.

331
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,218
Let's give Maya some time
to rest for a bit.

332
00:26:25,452 --> 00:26:26,452
Feel free to take a break.

333
00:26:26,453 --> 00:26:27,454
Sure.

334
00:26:27,587 --> 00:26:30,223
She did it to herself.
I didn't do anything.

335
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:33,026
Are you okay?

336
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,661
Does your wrist hurt?

337
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:36,062
I'm okay.

338
00:26:36,396 --> 00:26:39,032
I'm probably a little tired today.

339
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,134
I'll just go and get some rest.

340
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:44,070
All right. Can you help her over?

341
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:46,806
Take it slow.

342
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,141
Okay.

343
00:27:04,724 --> 00:27:06,426
Don't look at me like that.

344
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:12,932
I swear I didn't do it!
Do you understand?

345
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,168
I don't understand

346
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,970
why you're so interested
in this stupid music business

347
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:19,872
when there are other major...

348
00:27:19,873 --> 00:27:21,341
I know you well enough.

349
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:25,979
Maya's helping us out.

350
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,781
If she hurt her wrist

351
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,549
and can't perform,
what are we going to do?

352
00:27:36,823 --> 00:27:38,425
I know you well enough as well.

353
00:27:41,594 --> 00:27:43,129
I know what you're thinking.

354
00:27:44,931 --> 00:27:46,833
I've been with you
for so many years.

355
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,369
I can tell it just
from looking into your eyes.

356
00:27:53,206 --> 00:27:54,274
Do you think

357
00:27:55,408 --> 00:27:59,512
you're going to sleep with
everyone that walks into your life?

358
00:27:59,779 --> 00:28:00,780
Huh?

359
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:02,282
Huh?

360
00:28:02,482 --> 00:28:03,483
Stop this insanity.

361
00:28:06,219 --> 00:28:07,787
It's because I have a wife
who's insane.

362
00:28:09,022 --> 00:28:10,023
Remember.

363
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:13,293
I'm going to sleep with every
woman in the world except you.

364
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:15,628
You're crazy!

365
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,355
What are you looking at?

366
00:29:17,657 --> 00:29:19,859
There's no one here
and no camera either.

367
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,663
I know what you're thinking.

368
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:26,266
You're nothing
compared to me, wench!

369
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,867
You're a lowlife!

370
00:29:29,602 --> 00:29:30,770
Do you think I can't fight back?

371
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,173
Huh? Do you really think so?

372
00:29:33,306 --> 00:29:34,941
Who do you think you are?

373
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,043
You think you're so high and mighty?

374
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:39,679
What?

375
00:29:42,482 --> 00:29:43,483
Do it!

376
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:44,851
Go on!

377
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:46,553
Do you have the guts?

378
00:29:48,088 --> 00:29:49,789
Do you think I don't?

379
00:29:50,256 --> 00:29:51,257
Huh?

380
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:52,726
This is nothing.

381
00:29:53,426 --> 00:29:54,594
I've done a lot worse.

382
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:56,629
Therefore,

383
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,631
a lowlife like me

384
00:29:59,532 --> 00:30:01,768
is going to bring you down
from your tower.

385
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:08,441
Let me finish my work.

386
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,044
Then I'll leave on my own accord.

387
00:30:13,513 --> 00:30:14,714
You're all old and wrinkly.

388
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:17,417
I can just take you down
with a single slap.

389
00:31:22,115 --> 00:31:23,116
Hey.

390
00:31:24,084 --> 00:31:25,185
It's these two, mom and daughter.

391
00:31:25,652 --> 00:31:27,087
They're living with Indy.

392
00:31:27,821 --> 00:31:28,888
I feel sorry for the girl.

393
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,658
Her dad died,
and her mom lost her mind.

394
00:31:34,761 --> 00:31:36,363
Mom, do you like this kind of music?

395
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:49,109
(Free Classical Music Lessons
For Children in the Slums)

396
00:31:54,414 --> 00:31:55,749
Fire!

397
00:31:56,149 --> 00:31:57,350
- Fire!
- Mom?

398
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,550
Help!

399
00:31:58,551 --> 00:31:59,685
- Help!
- It's okay!

400
00:31:59,686 --> 00:32:01,754
I'm scared! It's so hot!

401
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:04,023
- Calm down!
- Let me go!

402
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:05,024
Calm down.

403
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:06,393
Mom, take it easy.

404
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,040
Calm down.

405
00:32:58,011 --> 00:32:59,079
She'll wake up soon.

406
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,920
Mm.

407
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,755
She probably will.

408
00:33:38,651 --> 00:33:40,053
What? Let go of me!

409
00:33:46,626 --> 00:33:47,627
Come here!

410
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:49,029
Let go!

411
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:15,055
Get out.

412
00:34:16,489 --> 00:34:17,490
I said get out!

413
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,461
Or I'll shoot you.

414
00:34:28,702 --> 00:34:29,703
Get out!

415
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:01,668
What's the matter, Indy?

416
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,211
Ma'am?

417
00:35:11,845 --> 00:35:14,547
What happened to you?
We'll take you to the ER.

418
00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:16,082
Can you get her a wheelchair?

419
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,584
Ma'am?

420
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,031
Ma?

421
00:35:31,865 --> 00:35:32,866
Who did this to you?

422
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:34,367
What happened to you?

423
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:37,404
It's not true, is it?

424
00:35:38,104 --> 00:35:39,606
She is still alive, right?

425
00:35:41,007 --> 00:35:42,509
Tell me she still is.

426
00:35:45,845 --> 00:35:46,846
Ma.

427
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:52,519
She's not with us anymore.

428
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,921
She's gone.

429
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,226
Ma.

430
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:03,930
Ma!

431
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:14,908
Ma.

432
00:36:16,943 --> 00:36:17,944
How are you feeling?

433
00:36:21,314 --> 00:36:23,683
Tell me what happened to you.

434
00:36:25,151 --> 00:36:27,454
The doctor said if it was
any worse than this,

435
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:30,090
you might not be able to use
your hand to play anymore.

436
00:36:35,595 --> 00:36:36,596
It's okay.

437
00:36:37,464 --> 00:36:39,499
You saved me
with that gun you gave me.

438
00:36:49,209 --> 00:36:50,210
What about Mom?

439
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,956
She's not with us anymore.

440
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,127
She's not in pain anymore.

441
00:37:12,432 --> 00:37:13,433
It's over.

442
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:19,239
From now on,

443
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:21,441
you should enjoy
the rest of your life

444
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,044
and live for yourself.

445
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,989
Food's ready. Are you hungry, Ma?

446
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:45,158
Here.

447
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:47,259
Is this pretty?

448
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,260
Let me see.

449
00:38:48,261 --> 00:38:50,296
Wow, look at that.

450
00:38:50,764 --> 00:38:53,499
Wow, that's so beautiful.

451
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,668
Let me have a closer look.

452
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:57,103
Is that me?

453
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,738
- Yes.
- Really?

454
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,807
You've given me very small eyes,

455
00:39:01,808 --> 00:39:03,042
but I'm so beautiful.

456
00:39:03,043 --> 00:39:04,176
You're our darling girl.

457
00:39:04,177 --> 00:39:06,479
- Well done, baby.
- Right?

458
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:36,109
Mom, Dad, if I follow you,

459
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:40,080
will we meet again?

460
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,991
(Sofia: I know who had you
beaten up.)

461
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:04,037
I know who had you beaten up.

462
00:40:10,944 --> 00:40:13,880
Kongkwan said she overheard
Saksit on the phone.

463
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,249
The person who broke into your place

464
00:40:16,783 --> 00:40:17,784
works for him.

465
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:19,452
And Parnkeaw

466
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,421
hired him.

467
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,092
She hoped to hurt you
so you can't play anymore.

468
00:40:27,694 --> 00:40:28,862
Why are you making that face?

469
00:40:29,796 --> 00:40:30,997
Did you think I was dead?

470
00:40:32,899 --> 00:40:35,301
You dropped off the radar,
and no one could reach you.

471
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:38,505
So I thought we might've
to cancel the concert.

472
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,375
I can't die yet.

473
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,412
I have to stay alive...

474
00:40:50,383 --> 00:40:53,019
to see those who did evil

475
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,588
face the full consequences
of their actions.

476
00:41:38,231 --> 00:41:40,533
I heard music,
so I came in to check it out.

477
00:41:41,968 --> 00:41:43,069
Where have you been
in the past few days?

478
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:47,340
Something came up.

479
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:53,046
It's very late.

480
00:41:54,647 --> 00:41:56,016
But you're still practicing.

481
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:00,186
I'm sorry.

482
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:04,958
Was it... too loud?

483
00:42:06,026 --> 00:42:07,127
Did I disturb you?

484
00:42:11,131 --> 00:42:12,132
You know

485
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:14,300
I enjoy it.

486
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,271
The thing is

487
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:21,007
I just bought a new cello.

488
00:42:22,142 --> 00:42:24,978
So I want to get used to it
before the performance.

489
00:42:27,747 --> 00:42:28,748
Thank you

490
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:32,652
for prioritizing our event.

491
00:42:40,694 --> 00:42:41,695
You enjoy music.

492
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:44,397
Would you like to give it a try?

493
00:42:47,867 --> 00:42:48,868
Me?

494
00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:50,704
Playing music?

495
00:42:58,244 --> 00:42:59,512
And why not?

496
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:03,416
Anyone can do it if they try.

497
00:43:05,819 --> 00:43:06,820
I'll teach you.

498
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:12,325
Take a seat.

499
00:43:27,273 --> 00:43:28,675
- Like this?
- Mm-hm.

500
00:43:32,912 --> 00:43:34,481
But you have to relax.

501
00:43:36,182 --> 00:43:37,183
Okay.

502
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:39,753
Now what?

503
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,101
Close your eyes.

504
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:10,116
You have to relax more.

505
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:13,920
Okay.

506
00:44:33,606 --> 00:44:35,742
I'm sorry. Did I...

507
00:44:36,943 --> 00:44:38,144
startle you?

508
00:44:40,146 --> 00:44:42,615
I'm not that easy to startle.

509
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:46,886
But if you're ready
to keep teaching me,

510
00:44:49,322 --> 00:44:50,323
I'm okay with that.

511
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,093
Come on.

512
00:44:55,795 --> 00:44:56,796
The thing is

513
00:44:57,564 --> 00:45:00,700
I want to concentrate
on our concert.

514
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,104
I want to...

515
00:45:05,238 --> 00:45:06,706
do my best.

516
00:45:08,742 --> 00:45:10,010
Therefore,

517
00:45:10,643 --> 00:45:11,644
let's talk about us

518
00:45:13,346 --> 00:45:14,848
afterward.

519
00:45:19,486 --> 00:45:20,487
All right.

520
00:45:23,256 --> 00:45:24,257
I'll wait.

521
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:36,236
Are you sure you're going
to do it this way?

522
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,461
I'd like to thank everyone for
coming on behalf of the company.

523
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:36,563
As for all of the money we raised,

524
00:46:36,863 --> 00:46:38,665
The Grand Itsara will

525
00:46:38,832 --> 00:46:40,967
donate it to aid
the development of slums

526
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:44,104
and improve the well-being of
everyone, especially children.

527
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,080
It's true that children can't
choose where they are born.

528
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,950
But they can choose
to have a better life.

529
00:46:57,217 --> 00:46:59,452
With everyone's donation,

530
00:46:59,786 --> 00:47:03,289
a better life and future await them.

531
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:04,791
Thank you again, everyone.

532
00:47:10,263 --> 00:47:11,297
And now,

533
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:14,601
we're going to show you a VTR
from the children.

534
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:35,955
(Giving Chances Is Giving Life)

535
00:47:44,297 --> 00:47:48,301
(Thank You for Your Generosity,
To Give Is to Provide Opportunity)

536
00:47:50,804 --> 00:47:52,172
What is this?

537
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:54,740
That's It.

538
00:47:54,741 --> 00:47:56,042
That's him.

539
00:47:56,576 --> 00:47:58,178
- What is it?
- Huh?

540
00:47:58,311 --> 00:47:59,312
What are they doing?

541
00:47:59,879 --> 00:48:01,114
That's It and Maya.

542
00:48:01,915 --> 00:48:03,750
- Huh?
- Aren't they too close?

543
00:48:03,783 --> 00:48:05,617
- Oh dear.
- Look at that.

544
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:06,853
- Why are they doing that?
- Tell me about it.

545
00:48:09,155 --> 00:48:10,523
What about his wife?

546
00:48:11,558 --> 00:48:12,559
Whoa!

547
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,561
What?

548
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:18,331
How could it be?

549
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,787
I hope you leave my family alone
after you're done with your job.

550
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:43,690
But I'm not sure if your dad will

551
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,792
want to leave me alone or not.

552
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:49,162
The major shareholders want to
reconsider the chairperson position?

553
00:48:49,796 --> 00:48:50,930
I'm going to show her

554
00:48:51,564 --> 00:48:53,633
she's wrong for thinking

555
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,168
she can do anything to us.

556
00:48:55,635 --> 00:48:56,803
You asked to see me tonight.

557
00:48:57,303 --> 00:48:58,637
Did you do as I told you?

558
00:48:58,638 --> 00:49:00,740
You want me

559
00:49:01,107 --> 00:49:02,108
Ma,

560
00:49:02,175 --> 00:49:05,278

to cause them trouble.

561
00:49:05,845 --> 00:49:06,846
What did you say?
