1
00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,267
Stop lying to me.

2
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:02,769
I know she's your mother.

3
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:05,438
She's not with us anymore.

4
00:00:05,739 --> 00:00:07,140
She's not in pain anymore.

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,776
I know what you're thinking.

6
00:00:10,076 --> 00:00:12,779
You're nothing
compared to me, wench!

7
00:00:13,213 --> 00:00:14,414
Parnkeaw hired the intruder

8
00:00:14,681 --> 00:00:16,716
that broke into your place.

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,984
You enjoy music.

10
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,352
Would you like to give it a try?

11
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:35,235
That's It!

12
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,675
It and Maya.

13
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,510
Huh?

14
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:47,714
He's the chairperson.
What is he doing?

15
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,284
No regard for his wife.

16
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:53,053
Oh dear!

17
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:54,988
What are they doing?

18
00:00:57,857 --> 00:00:58,858
Why is this happening?

19
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:33,987
So? What happened?

20
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:36,856
I didn't have time
to check the video.

21
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,993
I received it only
a few minutes before the event.

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,361
And why is that?

23
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,296
Uh, well...

24
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:45,298
It was a new one.

25
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,833
A new one?

26
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:48,635
What do you mean?

27
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:51,438
Why is it new?

28
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,139
Answer me.

29
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:55,008
You're going to get in trouble
if you can't answer.

30
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:57,677
What do you mean by "new"?
Who gave it to you?

31
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:00,847
A staff member swapped it

32
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:01,981
and told me...

33
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,952
it was Parnkeaw's order.

34
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,357
Well, she's overseeing the event.

35
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,858
So I thought...

36
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,297
I knew it. I knew it was you!

37
00:03:18,231 --> 00:03:19,232
Are you crazy?

38
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:21,001
Why would I do that?

39
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,069
To frame Maya, of course.

40
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:24,671
No!

41
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,239
I didn't do it!

42
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:28,541
You didn't? So who did?

43
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,777
Who'd do such a stupid thing
unless it was you?

44
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,612
Listen to me for once!

45
00:03:33,246 --> 00:03:35,782
I swear I didn't do it!

46
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,421
It was her.

47
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,359
Maya did it.

48
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:49,029
Why would she?
Her reputation's at stake here.

49
00:03:50,163 --> 00:03:51,164
What?

50
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:53,433
Her reputation's at stake?

51
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,570
What about me?

52
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,507
What about my reputation?

53
00:04:01,341 --> 00:04:04,511
Look. What will
the guests think of me?

54
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,415
How do you think I feel?
This is humiliating!

55
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:13,253
I should be the one to ask you

56
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,856
how you could do that with her.

57
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:18,058
What?

58
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,060
What did I do?

59
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,829
Could you tell from the video
what we were actually doing?

60
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,831
We did nothing!

61
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,703
You hid a camera in Maya's room

62
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:31,705
to spy on me.

63
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:33,840
I didn't do it!

64
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:36,109
Stop pretending already!

65
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,477
Everybody sees through you.

66
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:41,114
If you're so bent
on ruining my reputation,

67
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:42,515
then we should just get a divorce.

68
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,018
Let's just get it over with.

69
00:04:54,227 --> 00:04:55,228
Get out.

70
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,531
Get out! All of you!

71
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:10,410
All done, Indy.

72
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:11,778
I'm walking over now.

73
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,350
This is the only thing
that will ruin their lives.

74
00:05:18,084 --> 00:05:19,319
Can you do something

75
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,488
to mislead the event organizers

76
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:24,758
into thinking
that Parnkeaw's responsible?

77
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:32,198
This is the only thing
that will ruin their lives

78
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,368
the way they ruined mine

79
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:37,504
and my family's.

80
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,415
- Hello?
- Don't speak. Don't turn back.

81
00:05:48,948 --> 00:05:50,383
Akin's following you.

82
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,019
He probably suspects you.

83
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,954
Let's talk when we're both home.

84
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,589
I should go.

85
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,907
Why are you following me?
Is something the matter?

86
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,680
Parnkeaw's a former movie star
who cares about her image.

87
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,450
Why do you think she'd
leak that video clip?

88
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,419
Jealousy is capable

89
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,123
of making people act impulsively.

90
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:34,060
Like right now, you're tailing me.

91
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,862
Right here, right now,

92
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:37,864
and also at the hospital

93
00:06:38,665 --> 00:06:40,300
despite having
plenty of things on your hands.

94
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,372
Maybe that video

95
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,574
upset you?

96
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,978
I can say it now

97
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,314
you're probably jealous
over me as well.

98
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,017
Don't change the subject.

99
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,754
You're behind that clip, aren't you?

100
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:02,956
Tell me

101
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,026
before I find out for myself
and sue you

102
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,328
for defamation.

103
00:07:09,796 --> 00:07:11,598
But if you don't have evidence,

104
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:15,035
then that's an accusation.

105
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:17,737
I'm at a disadvantage here.

106
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:26,646
Once your music gig is over,

107
00:07:28,715 --> 00:07:30,650
I hope you'll leave my family alone.

108
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,654
If that's what you want.

109
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,557
But I'm not so sure

110
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,292
if your dad will want to

111
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,428
leave me alone or not.

112
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,199
The same goes for you too.

113
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,871
Anyway, I'll see you later

114
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,773
if you still want
to be involved with me.

115
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:12,692
Avenge me.

116
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:14,627
Avenge us.

117
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,131
You promised

118
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,200
you're going to help me
any way you can.

119
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,006
You're the only person
I trust, Indy.

120
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,279
How did it go? Is it done?

121
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,522
Thank you for all the help.

122
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,937
There might be problems
going forward

123
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:00,240
because there are people
who suspect you.

124
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,779
But since I've agreed to help you
with your plans...

125
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,900
No matter what happens,

126
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:29,135
I'm going to help you.

127
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:34,341
I'll do whatever I can so that
your mission ends quickly.

128
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,212
Don't forget life is short, Ma.

129
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,549
I want you to be happy
as soon as possible.

130
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,851
For the rest of your life from now.

131
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:55,695
Thanks.

132
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:58,465
You're the best friend
I've ever had.

133
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,938
Well then. I should go.

134
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:26,493
How dare you insult me
in front of her!

135
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:30,363
Are you blinded by infatuation?

136
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:33,133
She's just some lowly woman!

137
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:36,703
She spread her legs for men
under the guise of classical music!

138
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,072
If you divorce me now,

139
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:41,975
then you're admitting to the public

140
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,411
that you took a woman like her
as your mistress!

141
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,689
Have you even thought about that?

142
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:08,902
And do you think

143
00:11:09,636 --> 00:11:10,637
you're so clever?

144
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,406
Huh?

145
00:11:14,307 --> 00:11:15,942
- I just...
- Are you that clever?

146
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,844
I just wanted to
bring you back to reality.

147
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:19,179
Do you think you're so clever?

148
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,448
Do you really think so?

149
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:24,117
I just wanted to...

150
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,119
If you're so clever,

151
00:11:27,587 --> 00:11:28,588
then keep your mouth shut.

152
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,459
Don't you dare order me around.

153
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,227
Don't make me angry again.

154
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,563
Understand?

155
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,531
Understand?

156
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,300
Dad.

157
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:47,307
What?

158
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:50,210
You haven't looked at your phone,
have you?

159
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:53,279
The news of the event

160
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,382
has reached our major shareholders.

161
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:59,319
The board wants to call for
a meeting with you right away.

162
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:10,330
What?

163
00:12:12,365 --> 00:12:13,400
The major shareholders want to

164
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,169
reconsider my position
as chairperson?

165
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,438
What does that mean?

166
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,540
Who do they want then?

167
00:12:21,274 --> 00:12:22,275
Who?

168
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,711
Is there anyone who will put in
as much for the company as I do?

169
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:28,381
Who else can be the financial
backbone and brains apart from me?

170
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:31,851
You're right, It.

171
00:12:33,119 --> 00:12:35,055
But it is the duty of
the board members

172
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,190
to be morally conscious.

173
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:39,492
Lately,

174
00:12:40,293 --> 00:12:42,462
your actions have been lacking
moral judgment.

175
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,199
We don't want to interfere
into your private matters either.

176
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:47,934
But this affects

177
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:50,737
the company's image.

178
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:53,406
So you'd like to replace me.

179
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:55,508
And?

180
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,677
If you're dying to do so,

181
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,780
then who?
You won't seem to answer me.

182
00:13:02,215 --> 00:13:04,617
As for last night, I asked my people

183
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,986
to check everyone's cell phones

184
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,789
before they were allowed to leave.

185
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:12,625
The clip's now been deleted.
It no longer exists.

186
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:14,527
There's nothing on
social media either.

187
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:16,763
So why?

188
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,966
Why are you making this such
a big deal?

189
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:21,568
If it wasn't a problem,

190
00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:24,771
we wouldn't be wasting our time
with this meeting right now.

191
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,676
Don't forget. You might be the chair
but you don't hold the most shares.

192
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,479
You don't hold absolute authority.

193
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
A meeting between shareholders

194
00:13:35,348 --> 00:13:36,983
is going to happen soon as well.

195
00:13:38,385 --> 00:13:39,786
I'd like to remind you

196
00:13:40,086 --> 00:13:41,755
to not do anything
inappropriate again.

197
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,457
By that point,

198
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:47,861
the shareholders will
probably want a chairperson

199
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:49,396
with a good reputation

200
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:52,999
and not someone who believes he's
the best in the company like you.

201
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,216
(Maya)

202
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,155
The number you have called...

203
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,100
Good thing you decided
to visit today.

204
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,970
I'm rearranging the place
for music therapy sessions.

205
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,171
Okay.

206
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,579
You could've just called me over.
I'm not that far away.

207
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,551
Actually,

208
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:53,687
there's nothing else to do now.

209
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:56,790
You can go back to your shop
if you want.

210
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:01,027
Ma,

211
00:16:02,062 --> 00:16:03,096
can you tell me something?

212
00:16:03,897 --> 00:16:05,432
You don't feel the same way

213
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:07,834
that I feel for you, do you?

214
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,972
I've been trying to improve
the quality of my life.

215
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:15,375
Find a job and earn money.

216
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,410
Do you know for who?

217
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,548
There's only you in my life.

218
00:16:22,415 --> 00:16:23,516
Everything I'm doing

219
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,218
is for you.

220
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,756
And I want to see you smile

221
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,791
and laugh like you did just now.

222
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,694
I want to see you happy every day.

223
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,567
Can you give me a chance

224
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,503
to make you happy from now on?

225
00:16:56,816 --> 00:16:57,817
Indy,

226
00:16:59,452 --> 00:17:00,453
I've lost enough

227
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,623
people I love in my life.

228
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,062
Don't let me lose you too.

229
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:21,474
It's okay.

230
00:17:22,976 --> 00:17:23,977
I understand.

231
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:27,380
You might not be ready to think
about anything

232
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,215
that could distract you
from your goal.

233
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:32,318
But I promise

234
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,822
I'll never abandon you.

235
00:17:39,492 --> 00:17:40,660
I just dropped by to see

236
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,729
how you're doing

237
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,597
after last night.

238
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,301
I should go.

239
00:17:48,935 --> 00:17:51,438
Call me anytime if there's anything.

240
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:53,773
Bye.

241
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:15,195
Is it severe enough that he'd
lose his position as chairperson?

242
00:18:16,296 --> 00:18:17,597
I'm surprised as well.

243
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:21,368
The PR team and I have been
doing everything we can.

244
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,571
We silenced the press and
created scandals to cover it up.

245
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:30,877
And if...

246
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:34,014
if that's really the case,
what's going to happen then?

247
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:39,518
Is Kin going to lose his job?

248
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,653
And what about my job?

249
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:43,088
If Treetep thinks we're useless,

250
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:45,392
is he going to call off
Risa's engagement?

251
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,529
Saksit,

252
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:52,966
I'm scared.

253
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,770
I'm so scared!

254
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,341
I'll have nothing left if that's
what happens.

255
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:03,810
Come on. Calm down.

256
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,079
Don't assume the worst just yet.

257
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:10,717
The board members just
gave It a warning.

258
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,851
He hasn't been removed or anything.

259
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,421
But seriously,

260
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:16,890
you weren't behind

261
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,591
that video clip, were you?

262
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,660
Of course not.

263
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,730
Why would I do
something that stupid?

264
00:19:24,831 --> 00:19:26,766
Why doesn't anyone believe me?

265
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,070
Because It truly believes

266
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,440
you're just a stupid bimbo.

267
00:19:34,374 --> 00:19:36,609
That's why he's so sure
that something this stupid

268
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,911
would come from you.

269
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:42,682
Maya.

270
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:47,020
I'm sure it was her.

271
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,224
I hate her so much, Saksit.

272
00:19:52,459 --> 00:19:54,828
I should've just killed her.

273
00:19:57,864 --> 00:20:00,300
I should've just killed her, Saksit!

274
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,269
I shouldn't have just had someone
beat her up.

275
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,539
Don't you start bringing me trouble.

276
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,808
Think before you speak.

277
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:10,977
We might get ourselves into trouble.

278
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,516
Seriously,

279
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,551
she's just a simple woman.

280
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,787
Don't you know
how to handle her at all?

281
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,690
Don't I know how?

282
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,191
And what about you?

283
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,027
What can you handle?

284
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:30,430
Your ex-wife caused a scene
at your wedding.

285
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,198
Were you able to handle her?

286
00:20:33,433 --> 00:20:36,102
She'll come back and cause us
trouble again. Trust me.

287
00:20:37,537 --> 00:20:38,905
There's no way she'll come back.

288
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,743
How can you be so sure?

289
00:20:57,323 --> 00:20:58,324
Huh?

290
00:20:58,892 --> 00:21:00,326
I thought you said

291
00:21:01,161 --> 00:21:02,796
your wife went to bed.

292
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,834
(Sofia)

293
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,241
It's probably nothing.

294
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:16,810
She must've left her phone behind.

295
00:21:18,044 --> 00:21:19,879
Anyway, you should go home.

296
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,282
Take good care of It.

297
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,085
He probably doesn't have the guts
to divorce you right now.

298
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:28,188
Otherwise, he'll be at risk
of getting attacked.

299
00:21:29,389 --> 00:21:30,890
If he's clever enough,

300
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,460
he'll pretend he loves you very much

301
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:35,528
and create a good image
to cover up the news.

302
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,031
And don't forget

303
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,800
to suck up to Risa.

304
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:44,838
If you can make allies
out of Treetep and her,

305
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,107
It is nothing.

306
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,576
He won't be able to hurt you.

307
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:36,790
You left your phone downstairs

308
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,858
I brought it up for you.

309
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,361
Thank you.

310
00:23:15,362 --> 00:23:18,064
The audio recording I took

311
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:21,701
can be used as evidence against
Parnkaew for having you beaten up.

312
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:27,507
There's a chance for them to lose
their positions at the company.

313
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,042
And from now on,

314
00:23:29,342 --> 00:23:31,578
you'll be able to go after them
for burning down your house.

315
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:35,181
But I don't think
it's going to be that simple.

316
00:23:36,249 --> 00:23:37,550
These people are rich.

317
00:23:38,118 --> 00:23:39,619
Rich people have power

318
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:41,821
and can silence anyone.

319
00:23:42,689 --> 00:23:44,491
And if we publish this recording,

320
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,627
Saksit will realize Kwan took it.

321
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:49,562
And he'll take it out on her.

322
00:23:49,863 --> 00:23:51,431
And she'll be in danger.

323
00:23:52,632 --> 00:23:53,633
No more of that.

324
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,002
What a shame.

325
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,973
We nearly got evidence of Saksit
admitting to his wife's murder.

326
00:24:00,974 --> 00:24:03,309
Would he be able to walk away
if that was the case?

327
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:07,013
The brother's a murderer

328
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,516
and the sister hired a hitman
to assault someone.

329
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,885
Rich people are

330
00:24:12,986 --> 00:24:13,987
such scumbags.

331
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,726
Not all rich people are like that.

332
00:24:20,694 --> 00:24:22,095
It's just these scumbags

333
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,897
who are still rich.

334
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:30,937
Anyway, we now know their positions
at the company are unstable.

335
00:24:31,438 --> 00:24:33,506
And they're starting
to get restless.

336
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:37,911
Your plan is awesome, Kwan.

337
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:39,879
One single recording

338
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,915
and down goes the whole family.

339
00:24:42,449 --> 00:24:44,551
The entire company is shaking.
How will they survive?

340
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:48,655
But Kwan,

341
00:24:48,888 --> 00:24:51,157
you have to be careful
with whatever you do from now on.

342
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:54,227
Thanks.

343
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:57,297
I just want to finally be able
to escape from Saksit.

344
00:24:58,398 --> 00:24:59,399
Honestly,

345
00:24:59,899 --> 00:25:01,301
I'm scared

346
00:25:02,268 --> 00:25:03,737
and disgusted by him nowadays.

347
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,239
Then why would you look at him?

348
00:25:07,574 --> 00:25:08,808
Look at his credit cards instead.

349
00:25:09,542 --> 00:25:10,543
You're stressed, aren't you?

350
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,179
Come on. Let's go shopping
with his credit card.

351
00:25:14,047 --> 00:25:15,348
- Let's go.
- Okay then.

352
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:19,853
You're acting as if you don't
enjoy spending money.

353
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,590
All done. Thank you.

354
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,025
Thank you.

355
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:33,299
So? What do you think of the bridal
treatment? Do you like it?

356
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,270
Tell me if you want
to do anything else.

357
00:25:37,470 --> 00:25:39,873
It's our business after all.
Everything's free.

358
00:25:41,508 --> 00:25:42,509
I will.

359
00:25:43,076 --> 00:25:46,479
I've been thinking I should take
care of myself before the wedding.

360
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,415
I might have to come here every day.

361
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:52,652
No need to be so considerate.

362
00:25:53,753 --> 00:25:55,555
We're about to become family.

363
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:02,128
You heard about that night,
haven't you?

364
00:26:03,263 --> 00:26:06,433
There was a bit of a hiccup
at our company afterward.

365
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,504
I'm not sure if your dad finds it
upsetting or not.

366
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:15,275
Have you spoken to him at all?

367
00:26:18,044 --> 00:26:19,579
He hasn't mentioned it.

368
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:26,219
That's great.
I've been worried about him.

369
00:26:26,953 --> 00:26:27,954
I see.

370
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:31,958
I heard about the clip from people
who attended the event that night.

371
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,994
But I think there's
a silver lining to this.

372
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:39,099
At least Kin's going to realize
what her intentions are.

373
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:42,302
And I don't think
he's going to let it slide.

374
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,938
As for It,

375
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:46,673
just forget about it, Parnkeaw.

376
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,808
He'll lose interest eventually.

377
00:26:50,143 --> 00:26:51,144
In the end,

378
00:26:51,644 --> 00:26:53,513
how can a lowlife like her

379
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,649
have an impact on our lives?

380
00:26:58,985 --> 00:27:01,254
You're right. I think so too.

381
00:27:02,322 --> 00:27:03,356
Where should we go now?

382
00:27:04,424 --> 00:27:05,425
A manicure, perhaps?

383
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,028
That's good. My nails
are starting to get too long.

384
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,262
The gel's coming off too.

385
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:15,935
Should we get botox after shopping?

386
00:27:16,236 --> 00:27:18,705
We'll be well-dressed and look good.

387
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,975
All right. Get on the chopping
block. Should I get some too today?

388
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,308
Hm. Again?

389
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,878
And then maybe...

390
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:26,379
- Good, isn't it?
- Yes.

391
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,280
My nails are very thin.

392
00:27:28,281 --> 00:27:29,516
They did a good job with the gel.

393
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,424
You stirred up trouble but still
have the gall to show your face?

394
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,460
And why can't I be here?

395
00:27:41,161 --> 00:27:42,696
I didn't do anything wrong.

396
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:47,400
Can you give me
any good recommendations?

397
00:27:48,301 --> 00:27:49,302
Because I'll be coming here

398
00:27:50,036 --> 00:27:51,104
every day from now on.

399
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:53,106
You...

400
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,377
Let's not waste time.

401
00:28:00,113 --> 00:28:01,214
Let the dog bark.

402
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,552
But you're also barking back at me.

403
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:08,488
Woof-woof.

404
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,293
No matter what It says
about that night,

405
00:28:14,294 --> 00:28:16,796
you'll never get what you want.

406
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,634
Do you think I don't know?

407
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:24,971
You three are prostitutes.

408
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,641
You're so bent on catching rich men.

409
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:30,210
Parnkeaw,

410
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,747
my friends have nothing to do
with what's going on between us.

411
00:28:35,148 --> 00:28:37,617
Huh? Maybe you could tell

412
00:28:38,118 --> 00:28:39,686
because you used to be one as well?

413
00:28:40,086 --> 00:28:41,721
- Ooh!
- Ooh!

414
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:43,857
What?

415
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:47,394
Are you mad I spoke the truth?

416
00:28:49,329 --> 00:28:51,231
My family's already rich.

417
00:28:53,333 --> 00:28:56,836
I know you're behind
what happened that night.

418
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:00,740
Once I find evidence,

419
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,410
you're done.

420
00:29:05,245 --> 00:29:06,780
Good luck then.

421
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,826
Can't we do anything to her?

422
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,028
Can we put up some signs
and ban her from this place?

423
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:24,864
I'd do that

424
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,101
if I could.

425
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:31,271
Her being disrespectful
to you just now was

426
00:29:32,405 --> 00:29:34,941
enough to show her true colors.

427
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,410
I’m usually right about people.

428
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,747
I've hated her since the first time
I laid eyes on her.

429
00:29:41,681 --> 00:29:43,416
And I'm sure

430
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,087
she was behind that night.

431
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:50,957
I'm going to show her

432
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:54,961
she's wrong to believe that

433
00:29:56,029 --> 00:29:57,030
she can do anything to us.

434
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:10,477
Hello?

435
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,680
Geez, we just saw each other.

436
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:18,518
Maybe you secretly
enjoy talking to me.

437
00:30:19,219 --> 00:30:22,222
You still haven't deleted my number
even though the event's over.

438
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:24,891
Do you want to meet?

439
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,329
Unless you're too scared to do so.

440
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,877
Thank you very much
for your generous sponsorships

441
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:46,012
and for supporting our concert

442
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:48,648
and attending
our thank-you party tonight.

443
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,751
Hello, Indy.

444
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,187
I've arrived at the place
Parnkeaw asked me to come.

445
00:30:55,221 --> 00:30:56,222
Cheers.

446
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:57,390
Thank you very much.

447
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:02,128
Don't worry.
There are quite a few people around.

448
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:04,330
I'll call you right away
if there's anything.

449
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:13,073
Oh? Maya? You've arrived.

450
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:16,543
Come on in.

451
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:30,423
What are you playing at?

452
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:35,128
I'm being a good wife to you.

453
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:44,537
As we all know,
there was an incident that night.

454
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:48,708
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
and thank you, everyone,

455
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:51,811
for cooperating and letting us
check your phones before leaving.

456
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:56,149
At first, Maya refused
to come tonight

457
00:31:56,549 --> 00:31:57,951
because she was worried
there might be a problem.

458
00:32:00,987 --> 00:32:03,423
But this is a good opportunity

459
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,759
for us to provide you
with an explanation.

460
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:10,163
There was nothing to that clip.

461
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,365
It was just a music rehearsal.

462
00:32:12,632 --> 00:32:14,534
And It was supervising closely.

463
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:18,471
He worked really hard on the event.

464
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,341
Maya is close

465
00:32:21,875 --> 00:32:24,310
to both me

466
00:32:25,178 --> 00:32:26,179
and also

467
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,781
to It.

468
00:32:29,449 --> 00:32:30,517
She's close to both of us.

469
00:32:30,917 --> 00:32:32,418
If the camera had zoomed out,

470
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,554
you'd see me standing there as well

471
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:35,789
with staff members.

472
00:32:38,191 --> 00:32:40,493
Everything happened so quickly

473
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,662
that we didn't get
the chance to explain.

474
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,264
In any case, I'd like to apologize

475
00:32:45,265 --> 00:32:47,500
and thank you for your
understanding.

476
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,270
All right.

477
00:32:51,237 --> 00:32:52,405
Let's toast to Maya.

478
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,311
Cheers.

479
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:21,968
I'd like to use this opportunity
to invite Risa,

480
00:33:22,402 --> 00:33:23,536
Akin's fiancée,

481
00:33:24,037 --> 00:33:27,741
on behalf of Minister Treetep
who couldn't make it tonight,

482
00:33:28,274 --> 00:33:30,010
to present a flower bouquet to Maya.

483
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:32,045
We still haven't

484
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:35,181
gotten to congratulate her.

485
00:33:36,182 --> 00:33:37,183
Please, Maya.

486
00:33:43,056 --> 00:33:44,724
It, Kin, come on.

487
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:49,896
Stand closer together, please.

488
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,931
Look at the camera.

489
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:54,267
That's great.

490
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:00,306
Over here, please.

491
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:03,476
Right here, please.

492
00:34:08,581 --> 00:34:10,617
You've seen the clip
of my loving family, haven't you?

493
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:15,789
I guess you've realized

494
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:18,591
who It will choose when
in front of other people.

495
00:34:21,094 --> 00:34:22,462
The clip you showed everyone

496
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:24,330
couldn't do anything to me at all.

497
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:27,600
Do you realize

498
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:30,203
every time you speak

499
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:32,405
or try to do something,

500
00:34:33,973 --> 00:34:35,942
you look... tacky?

501
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:37,877
You seem agitated

502
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:40,213
and scared.

503
00:34:43,883 --> 00:34:45,051
Don't be so arrogant.

504
00:34:45,885 --> 00:34:48,388
I know you just want to get rich

505
00:34:49,222 --> 00:34:51,925
by leeching off men without caring
if they're married or not.

506
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:58,031
You're just like
those lowlives in the slums.

507
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:03,470
Those kids from the slums you
brought over to perform.

508
00:35:04,404 --> 00:35:05,971
You had to go there to teach them,
didn't you?

509
00:35:05,972 --> 00:35:07,574
Is that why they've
rubbed off on you?

510
00:35:15,915 --> 00:35:20,153
Do you want to know what
It calls those people?

511
00:35:24,324 --> 00:35:25,892
He calls them "dirty rats."

512
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:31,931
Maya,

513
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:35,769
he doesn't care
about your stupid music at all.

514
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,039
He just wants to build
a good image of himself.

515
00:35:39,939 --> 00:35:42,075
You're just his means to an end.

516
00:35:45,712 --> 00:35:46,946
I'm not afraid of you.

517
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:52,285
But I'm disgusted.

518
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:58,858
You're just one of those dirty rats
from the slums.

519
00:36:00,927 --> 00:36:02,629
You're not only worthless,

520
00:36:03,563 --> 00:36:04,998
but you're also pathetic.

521
00:36:09,169 --> 00:36:10,370
Even if all of you died,

522
00:36:12,138 --> 00:36:14,140
it wouldn't have any effect
on this world.

523
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,678
Do you want to know what
It calls those people?

524
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:54,047
He calls them "dirty rats."

525
00:36:55,148 --> 00:36:56,950
You're not only worthless,

526
00:36:57,817 --> 00:36:59,219
but you're also pathetic.

527
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,955
Even if all of you died,

528
00:37:03,523 --> 00:37:05,525
it wouldn't have any effect
on this world.

529
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:19,272
(It)

530
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,640
You wouldn't answer any of my calls.

531
00:37:55,041 --> 00:37:57,977
I'm just... a bit confused.

532
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:00,914
I don't know what you think
about what happened.

533
00:38:06,219 --> 00:38:08,221
I'm not recording anything.

534
00:38:16,096 --> 00:38:17,097
I trust you.

535
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,735
I don't care about

536
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:24,104
the terrible stuff that
happened that night.

537
00:38:25,872 --> 00:38:27,107
I called you

538
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:29,609
because I was worried
about your well-being.

539
00:38:33,513 --> 00:38:34,681
You're worried about me?

540
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:38,952
Of course.

541
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,021
I'm worried.

542
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:43,189
You asked to see me tonight

543
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:45,959
because of our agreement, right?

544
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,029
That after the concert, we'll...

545
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,967
You want me to keep
giving you music lessons?

546
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,204
I don't want music lessons.

547
00:38:59,906 --> 00:39:00,907
You know that.

548
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:42,816
Oh?

549
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:45,485
What?

550
00:39:46,419 --> 00:39:47,420
I'm sorry.

551
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,292
Is something wrong?

552
00:39:54,294 --> 00:39:55,295
You're shaking.

553
00:39:56,129 --> 00:39:57,130
Are you nervous?

554
00:39:57,697 --> 00:39:58,698
It's okay.

555
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,934
I'm fine. I...

556
00:40:01,868 --> 00:40:02,869
I'm just

557
00:40:03,536 --> 00:40:04,571
not sure

558
00:40:05,271 --> 00:40:06,706
if this is the right time.

559
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:12,278
How come?

560
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,249
If you're talking about the fact
that I still have a family,

561
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:18,718
then don't worry.

562
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,820
Parnkeaw and I are about to
get a divorce.

563
00:40:21,521 --> 00:40:23,656
You heard me telling her today
I wanted a divorce.

564
00:40:25,525 --> 00:40:27,827
She and I can't keep going anymore.

565
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:29,863
We have to split up.

566
00:40:31,364 --> 00:40:32,499
There's no need to feel guilty.

567
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,601
As for you,

568
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:36,569
I can give you anything.

569
00:40:39,506 --> 00:40:40,507
Whether it's money,

570
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:44,210
shares in the company,

571
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,081
or Parnkeaw's current position.

572
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:50,050
It won't be a problem

573
00:40:51,584 --> 00:40:52,585
if you want those things.

574
00:40:54,821 --> 00:40:56,289
I really can give you anything.

575
00:40:57,991 --> 00:41:00,026
Thank you. But...

576
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,429
please give me
some more time to think.

577
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,731
Oh?

578
00:41:06,199 --> 00:41:07,634
So why did you ask

579
00:41:09,636 --> 00:41:10,637
to see me tonight?

580
00:41:11,671 --> 00:41:12,672
I just...

581
00:41:13,907 --> 00:41:15,442
wanted to find out

582
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:17,344
what you really think of me.

583
00:41:18,712 --> 00:41:20,547
So I'd know how to behave
moving forward.

584
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,919
Oh, my dear girl.

585
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:30,557
Okay. I understand.

586
00:41:33,626 --> 00:41:34,627
I'll wait for you.

587
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:32,018
Go to bed if you're drunk.

588
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:40,093
What's gotten into you now?

589
00:42:40,627 --> 00:42:42,696
You went to see her, didn't you?

590
00:42:44,631 --> 00:42:45,632
What's wrong with you now?

591
00:42:48,802 --> 00:42:50,970
You went to see her!

592
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:52,872
Why did you?

593
00:42:56,776 --> 00:42:57,777
Have you come to your senses now?

594
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:03,683
I will not...

595
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,488
divorce you no matter what!

596
00:43:12,392 --> 00:43:13,393
Remember.

597
00:43:14,994 --> 00:43:16,329
I'm going to divorce you
no matter what.

598
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:19,199
Name your price!

599
00:43:20,967 --> 00:43:21,968
All right!

600
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:23,503
Try me!

601
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:26,239
If you divorce me,

602
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:30,176
I'm going to tell everyone

603
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:33,880
you pressured your ex-wife
into hanging herself right here!

604
00:43:41,121 --> 00:43:43,456
You were the reason
behind her death.

605
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:44,758
Don't think I didn't know.

606
00:43:51,998 --> 00:43:52,999
It was you.

607
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,368
It was your nastiness

608
00:43:56,469 --> 00:43:58,638
that drove her to kill herself.

609
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,108
Let me tell you.

610
00:44:03,243 --> 00:44:05,311
You can't divorce me

611
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:10,350
because I know your true colors.

612
00:44:13,153 --> 00:44:14,821
Have you not realized

613
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,792
that hussy, Maya,

614
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:21,061
just wants to leech off you?

615
00:44:23,596 --> 00:44:24,698
And how is that
any different from you?

616
00:44:25,265 --> 00:44:26,933
You're leeching off me as well!

617
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:28,068
I'm useful!

618
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,169
In what way?

619
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:34,741
A former movie star like me is
uplifting to your company's image!

620
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:37,644
I'm an improvement
to the company's image!

621
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:44,384
Maya and I

622
00:44:45,251 --> 00:44:46,653
are incomparable.

623
00:44:49,422 --> 00:44:51,291
If she's going to keep
leeching off you,

624
00:44:52,759 --> 00:44:55,462
then tell her to stay in her lane.

625
00:44:57,430 --> 00:45:00,266
Otherwise, you can't call me cruel.
Understood?

626
00:45:02,502 --> 00:45:04,104
It's you who should
stay in your lane.

627
00:45:05,638 --> 00:45:07,907
If you harass her again,

628
00:45:08,274 --> 00:45:09,709
I'm not going to let you live.

629
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:11,411
You're just a washed-up movie star.

630
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:27,961
Why would you come to see me again?

631
00:45:29,095 --> 00:45:30,130
You know

632
00:45:31,197 --> 00:45:33,400
your dad will never let go of me.

633
00:45:34,534 --> 00:45:35,535
But you know

634
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,071
you're not his only woman.

635
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:40,874
And soon, he's going to

636
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:43,843
get fed up with you and leave you

637
00:45:44,711 --> 00:45:45,879
like all the others.

638
00:45:47,747 --> 00:45:49,516
And you have to go up
against Parnkeaw.

639
00:45:50,283 --> 00:45:52,619
She's capable of doing anything
to get what she wants.

640
00:45:54,254 --> 00:45:55,255
Aren't you afraid?

641
00:45:57,023 --> 00:45:58,425
It sounds as if...

642
00:45:59,392 --> 00:46:00,960
you're worried about me.

643
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:04,064
I'm starting to feel unsure

644
00:46:05,098 --> 00:46:08,368
if this is a warning or a threat.

645
00:46:09,536 --> 00:46:10,937
But it looks like

646
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,240
you won't let go of me either.

647
00:46:16,409 --> 00:46:17,410
I came

648
00:46:18,578 --> 00:46:19,779
to make a proposal.

649
00:46:22,382 --> 00:46:23,383
I'll give you anything,

650
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:25,819
whether it's money

651
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:27,620
or anything you want,

652
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:31,691
as long as you agree
to meet me in secret

653
00:46:32,859 --> 00:46:34,027
and leave my dad alone.

654
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:37,230
What?

655
00:46:38,365 --> 00:46:40,533
Isn't this what you want?

656
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:42,702
You might not believe it.

657
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:45,238
But I can give you
as much as my dad.

658
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:49,876
I'm also younger

659
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:51,778
and stronger.

660
00:46:52,545 --> 00:46:55,415
I can satisfy your needs better
than he can.

661
00:46:58,018 --> 00:46:59,019
Take my money.

662
00:46:59,919 --> 00:47:00,920
And I order you

663
00:47:01,488 --> 00:47:03,623
to not sleep with anyone else
apart from me.

664
00:47:10,397 --> 00:47:12,298
Hey, Akin! Let go of me!

665
00:47:12,732 --> 00:47:14,734
You're no different
from your dad if you do this!

666
00:47:15,802 --> 00:47:16,803
Let go of me!

667
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:18,705
You were much kinder and nicer

668
00:47:18,938 --> 00:47:20,807
when you were a kid!

669
00:47:21,741 --> 00:47:22,742
How do you know?

670
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:24,444
You're just saying things.

671
00:47:25,345 --> 00:47:28,448
You're acting as if you understand
me and are being sincere.

672
00:47:29,683 --> 00:47:30,684
Stop talking already.

673
00:47:32,552 --> 00:47:35,021
This is just part of your charm
to lure men to you.

674
00:47:35,989 --> 00:47:37,590
Just accept my proposal.

675
00:47:40,093 --> 00:47:41,594
Akin, you're hurting me!

676
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:43,096
You're hurting me!

677
00:48:55,535 --> 00:48:57,804
I've rearranged the space
for music therapy sessions.

678
00:48:59,773 --> 00:49:00,774
Can I ask you something?

679
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:03,710
What did I help you remember?

680
00:49:04,577 --> 00:49:05,845
Why were you so shocked?

681
00:49:14,854 --> 00:49:16,022
You must've lived through

682
00:49:16,956 --> 00:49:18,591
a lot of horrible things.

683
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:23,596
It must've caused you to
present yourself

684
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:26,566
as someone who's cold
and indifferent.

685
00:49:28,601 --> 00:49:30,370
Stop talking as if you know me.

686
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:35,308
So can you help me
get to know you better?

687
00:49:37,944 --> 00:49:39,279
I want to know more about you.

688
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:42,349
I want to know what's
hurting you inside.

689
00:49:44,718 --> 00:49:45,785
I really want to help you.

690
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,153
Here.

691
00:49:48,054 --> 00:49:49,055
This is your payment

692
00:49:49,689 --> 00:49:50,790
as per my proposal.

693
00:49:56,129 --> 00:49:57,130
Take it.

694
00:49:57,297 --> 00:49:58,298
What proposal?

695
00:49:59,733 --> 00:50:01,134
I haven't agreed to anything.

696
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:03,003
What you did just now

697
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:05,305
felt like an agreement.

698
00:50:08,508 --> 00:50:10,343
At least use it to help
your boyfriend's mother.

699
00:50:12,545 --> 00:50:13,546
But I don't know

700
00:50:14,147 --> 00:50:15,582
that once she wakes up

701
00:50:16,216 --> 00:50:17,350
and finds out how you got the money,

702
00:50:19,252 --> 00:50:20,387
whether she'll feel good about it

703
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:22,689
or would rather die.

704
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,291
She's dead!

705
00:50:25,525 --> 00:50:26,526
Happy?

706
00:50:29,963 --> 00:50:31,398
Keep your dirty money!

707
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,701
Get out now!

708
00:50:35,869 --> 00:50:36,870
Get out!

709
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:39,873
Think about it.

710
00:51:01,861 --> 00:51:03,730
- What's up, Indy?
- Ma,

711
00:51:04,397 --> 00:51:07,500
I came up with another way
to mess with them again.

712
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:10,170
What did you say?

713
00:51:27,821 --> 00:51:28,822
See?

714
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:33,126
My solution has put
a beautiful end to everything.

715
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:38,298
I believe today's meeting
with the shareholders

716
00:51:38,765 --> 00:51:40,200
is going to go well.

717
00:51:48,508 --> 00:51:49,843
Force yourself a little.

718
00:51:51,244 --> 00:51:53,780
Show other people
we're still in love.

719
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:58,618
It's necessary for your position
as chairperson.

720
00:52:01,221 --> 00:52:02,222
I don't see any problem.

721
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:04,157
Come on.

722
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:10,063
What interview is this?

723
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:14,901
It, are you worried about today's
meeting with the shareholders?

724
00:52:15,902 --> 00:52:17,203
There's nothing to worry about.

725
00:52:17,637 --> 00:52:21,541
We have to call for a special
meeting with them today

726
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:23,476
because just as you're
seeing right now,

727
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,813
we're working hard to have all
the shops open at the same time.

728
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:28,181
And that includes all the services.

729
00:52:28,248 --> 00:52:32,185
We have to cover all of our bases.

730
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:36,556
So we want the shareholders to feel
confident we're on the right track.

731
00:52:37,857 --> 00:52:40,627
There's a rumor going around that
your position is being reconsidered.

732
00:52:40,727 --> 00:52:42,429
Is there anything
you'd like to say about that?

733
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,297
A rumor is just a rumor.

734
00:52:44,531 --> 00:52:46,566
Rest assured. I'll continue
as chairperson.

735
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,203
All right?
I oversee all of the policies.

736
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:53,373
And Akin, who's the CEO
enforces them.

737
00:52:53,707 --> 00:52:56,508
As for Parnkeaw,
she supports the PR department

738
00:52:56,509 --> 00:52:58,878
and keeps everyone updated
on where we stand.

739
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:00,714
Uh, excuse me?

740
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:02,682
Is something the matter?

741
00:53:02,882 --> 00:53:05,719
There are protesters from the slums
outside of the mall.

742
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,854
We'll have to go there now.

743
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:10,690
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

744
00:53:12,058 --> 00:53:13,059
Find out what's going on.

745
00:53:17,263 --> 00:53:18,331
What on earth are they doing here?

746
00:53:19,265 --> 00:53:20,433
Scumbags, get out!

747
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:21,835
Scumbags, get out!

748
00:53:22,102 --> 00:53:23,203
Scumbags, get out!

749
00:53:23,636 --> 00:53:24,637
Get out!

750
00:53:25,005 --> 00:53:27,073
Scumbags, get out!

751
00:53:27,474 --> 00:53:28,475
Get out!

752
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:30,310
- Get out!
- You can't do this here!

753
00:53:30,443 --> 00:53:31,444
And why not?

754
00:53:31,644 --> 00:53:33,213
We're here to drive
the scumbags away!

755
00:53:33,646 --> 00:53:36,316
Get out!

756
00:53:36,449 --> 00:53:37,784
- Get out!
- Excuse me?

757
00:53:37,984 --> 00:53:39,786
What's the protest about?

758
00:53:39,986 --> 00:53:41,254
We're driving the scumbags away.

759
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:43,490
Just like how they burned our houses
down to drive us away!

760
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:45,658
They said they'd find us
a new place to live.

761
00:53:45,959 --> 00:53:48,895
But it's been 15 years
and they've done nothing!

762
00:53:49,029 --> 00:53:50,630
They just kept throwing
money our way!

763
00:53:50,830 --> 00:53:52,732
Get out!

764
00:53:53,133 --> 00:53:56,369
Get out!

765
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,772
Get out!

766
00:53:58,938 --> 00:54:00,106
Calm down!

767
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:01,408
Calm down!

768
00:54:01,474 --> 00:54:03,476
Get out!

769
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:05,745
Get out!

770
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,181
Get out!

771
00:54:08,915 --> 00:54:10,050
Are you saying

772
00:54:10,517 --> 00:54:13,019
you'll gather people from the slums
for a protest?

773
00:54:13,820 --> 00:54:14,821
That's right.

774
00:54:15,422 --> 00:54:16,756
They're our family.

775
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:20,560
And they can help us kick those
people out of their company.

776
00:54:21,661 --> 00:54:23,496
I'm sure they'll end up
with nothing.

777
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,866
Their lives are going to be ruined
just like you want.

778
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:31,571
Don't worry, Ma.

779
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:34,708
They don't know your story.

780
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:37,944
If anything happens, I'll handle it.

781
00:54:42,382 --> 00:54:44,283
Get out!

782
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,720
Get out!

783
00:54:47,087 --> 00:54:49,022
Get out!

784
00:54:56,496 --> 00:54:59,099
Get out!

785
00:54:59,265 --> 00:55:03,103
Get out!

786
00:55:03,203 --> 00:55:04,971
Get out!

787
00:55:07,607 --> 00:55:08,608
Dad!

788
00:55:09,743 --> 00:55:10,744
Ma?

789
00:55:11,077 --> 00:55:12,078
Are you okay?

790
00:55:25,558 --> 00:55:26,559
Get out!

791
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,195
He's afraid of fire too?

792
00:55:35,168 --> 00:55:36,169
You can't burn that here!

793
00:55:36,336 --> 00:55:37,337
What do you see?

794
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:44,611
Get out!

795
00:56:05,965 --> 00:56:10,236
If all of you believe
I can help the company,

796
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:12,972
then I'm happy to accept
the position of chairperson.

797
00:56:14,074 --> 00:56:17,110
It's so strange
that Akin feels the same as me.

798
00:56:17,711 --> 00:56:20,380
It's as if he was
also there that night.

799
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:22,582
If you can't get a hold of yourself,

800
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:24,784
then you won't even have

801
00:56:24,984 --> 00:56:26,353
a woman like me by your side.

802
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:28,421
He's probably starting
to realize it.

803
00:56:29,122 --> 00:56:30,890
He'll probably try to find an answer

804
00:56:31,491 --> 00:56:32,492
as to why.
