1
00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:02,889
It's time for us to take action.

2
00:00:03,716 --> 00:00:04,850
I sympathize with you.

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:07,887
You've got your hands
full with problems.

4
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:12,525
I know of a way to bring back
everything you used to have.

5
00:00:12,925 --> 00:00:15,394
Treetep must be behind all of this.

6
00:00:15,995 --> 00:00:17,363
Find evidence

7
00:00:17,897 --> 00:00:19,432
of the crimes he's committed.

8
00:00:19,765 --> 00:00:22,601
What? You have video evidence
of the fire?

9
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:25,237
Ma, if anything happens to me,

10
00:00:25,504 --> 00:00:27,073
I want you to know
the person who did it is...

11
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,742
Indy?

12
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:31,911
Who do you work for?

13
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:54,400
You're not going to talk?

14
00:00:57,336 --> 00:00:58,337
One...

15
00:01:00,673 --> 00:01:01,807
Now, are you going to talk?

16
00:01:02,742 --> 00:01:04,043
Who sent you?

17
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:05,845
Two...

18
00:01:12,551 --> 00:01:14,553
Sir, someone's coming!
We need to go!

19
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:16,322
Sir!

20
00:01:18,858 --> 00:01:19,859
Sir, he's not breathing.

21
00:01:22,228 --> 00:01:23,229
Clean up the mess.

22
00:01:23,996 --> 00:01:24,997
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

23
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:42,782
Hello? Mister?

24
00:01:43,683 --> 00:01:45,484
Mister?

25
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:47,453
Mister, are you okay?

26
00:01:48,354 --> 00:01:49,355
Mister?

27
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,725
Mister?

28
00:01:56,262 --> 00:01:57,730
(Incoming call:
Ma)

29
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:02,134
Excuse me? Were you the one
who found my friend?

30
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:03,602
That's right.

31
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:09,108
Doctor,

32
00:02:09,675 --> 00:02:10,743
how's my friend doing?

33
00:02:11,377 --> 00:02:12,912
It's a miracle.

34
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:16,282
He actually stopped breathing.

35
00:02:16,782 --> 00:02:20,286
But the EMT team performed CPR
on him on the way to the hospital.

36
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:22,955
Does that mean he...

37
00:02:23,756 --> 00:02:24,757
Exactly.

38
00:02:25,424 --> 00:02:26,626
But he's still in serious condition.

39
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:30,796
He sustained injuries
from being hit by a car.

40
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:33,032
There were also signs
of a violent assault.

41
00:02:33,933 --> 00:02:35,935
He must remain under
a close observation

42
00:02:36,602 --> 00:02:37,803
until he regains consciousness.

43
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:42,174
Thank you very much for your help.

44
00:02:42,675 --> 00:02:43,676
You're welcome.

45
00:02:47,213 --> 00:02:48,781
Your friend's very lucky.

46
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:51,517
He must have bad blood
with someone.

47
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,119
You should file a police report.

48
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:54,920
Would you like me to be the witness?

49
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,924
Before I came,

50
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:02,662
did anyone come by to ask
about his condition?

51
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,365
I don't think so.
I didn't see anyone.

52
00:03:08,868 --> 00:03:10,403
If anyone asks you after this,

53
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,405
tell them you don't know

54
00:03:13,005 --> 00:03:14,640
or that he's died.

55
00:03:17,843 --> 00:03:18,844
Sure.

56
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,085
We've cleaned up the scene.

57
00:03:26,986 --> 00:03:28,154
And don't worry about
the CCTV cameras.

58
00:03:28,754 --> 00:03:29,989
There aren't any in that area.

59
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:31,891
Would you like me
to follow up on this?

60
00:03:33,526 --> 00:03:34,527
No need.

61
00:03:35,761 --> 00:03:37,196
Dead men tell no tales.

62
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:41,233
But are you sure
you didn't leave a trace?

63
00:03:42,201 --> 00:03:43,202
Yes, sir.

64
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,272
The person who sent him must be

65
00:03:47,006 --> 00:03:50,009
frantically trying to find out
who took him out.

66
00:03:52,478 --> 00:03:53,879
Let's wait for their movement.

67
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:07,693
Stupid moron.

68
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:11,364
The evidence led to your own death.

69
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:17,903
Who did this to you?

70
00:04:18,704 --> 00:04:20,206
If anything happens to you,

71
00:04:21,674 --> 00:04:22,675
I promise

72
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:25,711
that those people are going

73
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:27,880
to pay with their lives.

74
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:32,885
It's going to be
a mere rumor from now on.

75
00:04:35,454 --> 00:04:36,455
Until the end of time.

76
00:06:13,853 --> 00:06:14,854
Ma,

77
00:06:16,455 --> 00:06:17,790
what are you going to do now?

78
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,761
I don't know.

79
00:06:22,395 --> 00:06:25,231
But I had to move
Indy here for safety.

80
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:29,602
And if someone's looking for him,

81
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,804
then we'll know who's behind it.

82
00:06:34,273 --> 00:06:36,375
You say that as if you have
a suspect in mind.

83
00:06:37,109 --> 00:06:38,110
Who do you think it was?

84
00:06:39,145 --> 00:06:40,246
I'm not sure either.

85
00:06:41,514 --> 00:06:44,550
Indy was asking everyone
for evidence of the fire.

86
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:47,153
He recently went to Treetep's house.

87
00:06:49,088 --> 00:06:50,823
Huh? Maybe...

88
00:06:51,924 --> 00:06:55,394
He overheard Treetep's
conversation with Saksit.

89
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,931
Are you saying Saksit might've
beaten Indy up?

90
00:07:03,669 --> 00:07:05,104
I can't be sure
of anything right now.

91
00:07:07,573 --> 00:07:09,742
And if Saksit really was behind it,

92
00:07:10,576 --> 00:07:12,078
then Kongkwan's in danger.

93
00:07:14,313 --> 00:07:15,414
But if that's really the case,

94
00:07:17,116 --> 00:07:18,884
then they planned all of this.

95
00:07:22,054 --> 00:07:23,456
I think I should pay Kwan a visit.

96
00:07:24,557 --> 00:07:25,558
Perhaps

97
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,997
she might've heard
about what Saksit did to Indy.

98
00:07:31,797 --> 00:07:32,798
Are you going alone?

99
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:35,368
Yes.

100
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:39,905
If I don't find out about Indy,

101
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:42,375
at least I'll know how Kwan's doing.

102
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:43,909
I'm worried about her.

103
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:46,646
But you have to be careful.

104
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,382
I don't want anything
to happen to you too.

105
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:51,584
You should stay with Indy.

106
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:53,753
I'll go see Kwan.

107
00:08:17,743 --> 00:08:18,778
Saksit.

108
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,949
I'm sorry. I didn't mean for this.

109
00:08:23,816 --> 00:08:25,751
I just took it out to clean it.

110
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:28,754
In case I need to use it.

111
00:08:30,256 --> 00:08:32,825
So, what brought you
all the way here?

112
00:08:36,762 --> 00:08:37,763
Uh...

113
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:39,865
I just came to visit Kongkwan.

114
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,236
I've never known her to stay home
so much, so I came to check on her.

115
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:49,108
Don't worry.
I take good care of her.

116
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:53,479
Too good sometimes.
And now she doesn't want to go out.

117
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,416
That's true. I think so too.

118
00:08:58,551 --> 00:09:02,288
All right. Do you mind if I
talk to her for a bit?

119
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,092
Not at all. Have a seat.

120
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:14,600
Would you be okay
if we talk outside?

121
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:16,535
It's a girl thing.

122
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:22,807
Of course.
There are plenty of rooms here.

123
00:09:22,808 --> 00:09:26,245
Feel free to choose
whichever room you want.

124
00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:27,780
Hm.

125
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:33,486
I've known you for a while,
but I haven't gotten a tour yet.

126
00:09:33,953 --> 00:09:38,090
It's big. There must be
a lot of rooms around.

127
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,861
There are probably
mysteries to discover.

128
00:09:42,361 --> 00:09:44,230
I'll visit often.

129
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,701
Saksit.

130
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,340
Sure.

131
00:09:54,807 --> 00:09:57,076
I'm happy to welcome you
into my home.

132
00:09:58,144 --> 00:09:59,145
Feel free to come by whenever.

133
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,181
Here. Put this away for me.

134
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,750
Be careful. It's loaded.

135
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:08,354
It might go off
if there's a fuss.

136
00:10:09,221 --> 00:10:10,222
Yes, sir.

137
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:14,827
Okay. Go ahead.

138
00:10:28,674 --> 00:10:31,143
Did Saksit really try
to silence Maya's friend?

139
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:34,313
Have you heard him
say anything about it?

140
00:10:36,582 --> 00:10:37,583
No, never.

141
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:40,052
But there's no proof.

142
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,421
It's just speculation.

143
00:10:44,557 --> 00:10:47,193
Kwan, you have to
be careful as well.

144
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:49,428
Mm.

145
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:54,734
Is he really going to kill everyone
who gets in his way?

146
00:10:55,868 --> 00:10:58,037
He kills people so easily
like they're animals.

147
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:01,440
He'll probably come
after me one day too.

148
00:11:02,274 --> 00:11:03,275
Kwan,

149
00:11:03,609 --> 00:11:05,044
I'll visit you often.

150
00:11:05,478 --> 00:11:07,246
So he'll realize you're not alone.

151
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:10,149
No, don't come.

152
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:12,485
You saw it. He threatened you.

153
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,154
I'll find a way to escape this
hellhole myself.

154
00:11:16,355 --> 00:11:17,356
What's on your mind?

155
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:23,062
You know the risk. You could die.

156
00:11:25,731 --> 00:11:27,833
It's like waiting for my turn
if I stay anyway.

157
00:11:29,035 --> 00:11:31,103
Let me be. I'll be fine.

158
00:11:32,238 --> 00:11:33,572
Even if he killed me,

159
00:11:35,474 --> 00:11:37,043
it's still better
than living in this hell.

160
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:54,560
Listen to me.

161
00:11:55,594 --> 00:11:56,729
I won't let you die.

162
00:11:59,398 --> 00:12:00,399
Hang in there.

163
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,203
I never thought

164
00:12:05,805 --> 00:12:06,806
that the hope

165
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,875
for a comfortable life,

166
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,812
not having to try to find a job,

167
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,581
living a good life

168
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:18,584
in a beautiful house,

169
00:12:20,286 --> 00:12:21,687
eating three square meals a day,

170
00:12:22,922 --> 00:12:24,223
wearing pretty clothes

171
00:12:26,659 --> 00:12:28,527
could bring me so much suffering.

172
00:12:31,097 --> 00:12:33,032
I haven't found the happiness
I hoped for.

173
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:37,937
Kwan,

174
00:12:38,838 --> 00:12:39,839
you're exhausted, aren't you?

175
00:12:42,942 --> 00:12:43,943
Hang in there.

176
00:12:45,711 --> 00:12:46,912
It's not always the case.

177
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,516
It's just that the things
you have right now aren't yours.

178
00:12:52,218 --> 00:12:53,219
But someday it will be.

179
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,789
And I'll help you escape this place.

180
00:12:58,891 --> 00:12:59,892
Stay with me.

181
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:13,105
Has your friend left?

182
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,243
Come on. Let's eat.

183
00:13:17,743 --> 00:13:20,813
I've ordered
all of your favorite dishes.

184
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,160
Saksit,

185
00:13:35,027 --> 00:13:37,697
I'd like to go and check out
the clinic sometime.

186
00:13:38,464 --> 00:13:39,799
I haven't been there in a while.

187
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,337
You're so lovely.

188
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,708
I want you to live comfortably here,
yet you still insist on working.

189
00:13:50,376 --> 00:13:51,377
Don't worry.

190
00:13:51,844 --> 00:13:53,946
Parnkeaw's taking
good care of the clinic.

191
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:58,084
But...

192
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:00,252
Let's eat.
The food will get cold.

193
00:14:03,389 --> 00:14:05,424
You go ahead. I'm not that hungry.

194
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:07,293
Hey!

195
00:14:10,997 --> 00:14:12,198
What's gotten into you now?

196
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:13,833
Huh?

197
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,502
Don't you like staying home
and living comfortably?

198
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:18,704
- Huh?
- That's not it.

199
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:23,409
So what's wrong with you?

200
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,444
- Huh?
- You're hurting me.

201
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,179
You want to get out all of a sudden.

202
00:14:28,014 --> 00:14:29,515
Do you want to go out
and find a new husband?

203
00:14:31,517 --> 00:14:32,785
I told you to eat.

204
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:34,720
So eat!

205
00:14:35,054 --> 00:14:36,589
Eat! Open up!

206
00:14:37,189 --> 00:14:38,190
Eat!

207
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:40,693
Eat!

208
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:42,328
Chew!

209
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,768
If you behave,

210
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:53,172
then I will make other women
jealous of you.

211
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:54,807
But if not,

212
00:14:55,941 --> 00:14:57,643
you probably know
what's going to happen, don't you?

213
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:00,546
And your friend too.

214
00:15:01,213 --> 00:15:03,716
Don't let her come here
and defy me like that again.

215
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,919
Or I will let her have it.

216
00:15:08,387 --> 00:15:09,388
Do you understand?

217
00:15:13,726 --> 00:15:16,162
Tomorrow's appointment
is confirmed, sir.

218
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:19,231
Just have the car ready.
I'll drive there myself.

219
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:21,801
And while I'm away,

220
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,071
don't let anyone enter
or leave this place.

221
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:27,473
Do you understand?

222
00:15:27,807 --> 00:15:30,009
Yes, sir. Leave it to me.

223
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:45,818
Where's Saksit?

224
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,087
He's been out since morning.

225
00:16:49,355 --> 00:16:50,890
Did he say when he was coming back?

226
00:16:51,524 --> 00:16:53,426
No, but he'll probably be out
for the whole day.

227
00:16:55,027 --> 00:16:57,830
But he ordered us to look after you.

228
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,667
It's okay.

229
00:17:02,134 --> 00:17:03,135
I'll let you know
if there's anything.

230
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:04,603
Okay.

231
00:17:35,434 --> 00:17:37,003
I have evidence!

232
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,106
You're going to be
in jail for 20 years!

233
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:42,642
Fifty million

234
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:44,543
in exchange for these videos.

235
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:46,946
Are you going to cough it up?

236
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,039
Please! Don't hurt me anymore!

237
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,674
How dare you!

238
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:23,776
You asked for it!

239
00:19:25,411 --> 00:19:26,712
You're only 14?

240
00:19:28,114 --> 00:19:29,148
Do you have a boyfriend?

241
00:19:29,915 --> 00:19:31,350
No, I don't.

242
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,186
That's great.

243
00:19:34,553 --> 00:19:35,554
Don't be afraid.

244
00:19:35,788 --> 00:19:37,323
I'll pay you double.

245
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:42,295
Can you send over the documents
as discussed?

246
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:46,599
Sure. I'll contact you.

247
00:19:50,503 --> 00:19:51,504
Sir.

248
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:59,845
- What's the matter?
- A woman came to see your ex-wife.

249
00:20:00,346 --> 00:20:01,347
She claims to be a relative.

250
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:17,663
She didn't come here.

251
00:20:18,164 --> 00:20:19,765
We haven't seen each other
in a while now.

252
00:20:22,034 --> 00:20:23,169
I'm afraid I can't help you.

253
00:20:23,736 --> 00:20:25,104
It's been over between us
for a long time.

254
00:20:25,838 --> 00:20:27,373
Then I'll have to go to the police.

255
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,343
I'm sorry for the bother.

256
00:20:43,055 --> 00:20:44,924
Have you dealt with her body?

257
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,826
Yes, sir.
No one will be able to find it.

258
00:20:48,594 --> 00:20:49,595
Hey!

259
00:20:50,262 --> 00:20:51,263
Hey!

260
00:20:52,732 --> 00:20:54,166
Ow! Let go of me!

261
00:20:54,634 --> 00:20:55,635
Let me go!

262
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,040
You heard everything, didn't you?

263
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:07,880
Really. You shouldn't have
come snooping around.

264
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,126
Let go of me!

265
00:21:20,526 --> 00:21:21,527
Let go!

266
00:21:24,497 --> 00:21:26,632
You shouldn't have
looked at this phone.

267
00:21:27,466 --> 00:21:30,002
I just wanted to keep it
as a souvenir.

268
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:34,006
What a waste.

269
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:37,777
Truly.

270
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:39,845
Let me go!

271
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:41,614
Ow!

272
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:43,683
Let go!

273
00:21:50,957 --> 00:21:51,958
Kwan.

274
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:05,204
Hello?

275
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:09,375
Kwan's not home.
I sent her on a holiday overseas.

276
00:22:10,276 --> 00:22:11,811
And don't call again.

277
00:22:11,877 --> 00:22:13,546
I'm too busy to answer calls
on her behalf.

278
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,451
Oh. And did she say
when she was coming back?

279
00:22:20,686 --> 00:22:21,687
It's probably going to be a while.

280
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,060
Well, is it okay if I come over
and pick up her phone?

281
00:22:28,594 --> 00:22:30,896
There are some photos I need.

282
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:34,734
I'm afraid not. It's my wife's
personal item, after all.

283
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,236
I'm afraid you can't have it.
I hope you'll understand.

284
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,538
Oh. One more thing.

285
00:22:40,206 --> 00:22:41,307
I want you to know

286
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:43,709
that even though
Kongkwan's a friend of yours,

287
00:22:44,377 --> 00:22:46,012
she's my wife now.

288
00:22:46,946 --> 00:22:50,182
You have no business
getting involved with my family.

289
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:52,752
And if you're still curious,

290
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:56,656
I can send someone over
to set the record straight.

291
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,626
So you won't be able to open your
mouth to question anything again.

292
00:23:01,994 --> 00:23:02,995
You get it, don't you?

293
00:23:04,764 --> 00:23:07,733
And don't think of stirring the pot.

294
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,269
You know who I am.

295
00:23:11,037 --> 00:23:12,705
No one wants to mess with me.

296
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,041
That's it.

297
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:49,241
He said he sent her
on a holiday overseas.

298
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:52,078
Does he think I'm stupid?

299
00:23:53,045 --> 00:23:54,880
What kind of person travels overseas
without telling their friends?

300
00:23:57,083 --> 00:24:00,686
Does he think she'll leave without
telling me or bringing her phone?

301
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:03,823
He's a scumbag and a liar.

302
00:24:08,194 --> 00:24:09,195
Ma,

303
00:24:10,997 --> 00:24:12,465
do you think Kwan's still alive?

304
00:24:18,804 --> 00:24:19,939
I have to tell the police.

305
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,308
Have you forgotten
about his threats?

306
00:24:22,942 --> 00:24:24,043
What are the police going to do?

307
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:25,978
Does it even matter?

308
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:29,348
Are you scared? Then stay out of it.

309
00:24:30,683 --> 00:24:32,084
I'm not saying I won't help.

310
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:34,553
But you have to
get a hold of yourself.

311
00:24:35,521 --> 00:24:37,056
Think before you do anything.

312
00:24:37,757 --> 00:24:39,392
I don't want anything
to happen to you too.

313
00:24:41,627 --> 00:24:42,995
What if Kwan's dead?

314
00:24:45,931 --> 00:24:48,434
Do you realize I sent her
to that scumbag?

315
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,271
If she's dead,

316
00:24:53,806 --> 00:24:56,042
then it's my fault. You know, right?

317
00:25:01,614 --> 00:25:02,615
Can't the poor

318
00:25:03,749 --> 00:25:05,685
defeat the rich for once?

319
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:09,655
Do I have to cower
under their feet forever?

320
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:12,224
I'll never defeat them, will I?

321
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:19,298
No.

322
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,268
I believe we'll be able
to deal with them.

323
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,571
But right now, we have to believe

324
00:25:26,339 --> 00:25:28,274
Kwan's okay.

325
00:25:32,912 --> 00:25:34,046
You have to believe

326
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,182
our friend's safe.

327
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:53,799
Indy.

328
00:25:55,434 --> 00:25:57,203
If I was the one lying here,

329
00:25:57,937 --> 00:25:59,005
what would you do next?

330
00:26:00,406 --> 00:26:01,407
Maybe...

331
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:05,244
it was my fault?

332
00:26:08,748 --> 00:26:10,916
Is that why everyone
around me is in this state?

333
00:26:16,656 --> 00:26:18,824
But I can't let them get away

334
00:26:20,459 --> 00:26:21,761
with what they've done to us.

335
00:26:24,163 --> 00:26:26,899
You'd do the same, wouldn't you?

336
00:26:55,661 --> 00:26:56,662
Why did you ask to see me?

337
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,767
You said you don't trust me.
Yet you came.

338
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:03,736
Thank you.

339
00:27:05,905 --> 00:27:06,906
What do you actually want?

340
00:27:07,974 --> 00:27:10,109
I have to tie up the loose ends
between us.

341
00:27:12,712 --> 00:27:13,713
What do you mean by that?

342
00:27:19,952 --> 00:27:20,953
What are you doing?

343
00:27:38,671 --> 00:27:39,705
Stop! Don't go!

344
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,841
Look at the flames!

345
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,644
So you can find out
what you actually fear!

346
00:27:47,113 --> 00:27:49,282
I told you to look
at the flames, Akin!

347
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:55,253
No!

348
00:27:55,254 --> 00:27:56,255
One.

349
00:27:56,422 --> 00:27:57,423
What do you see?

350
00:27:58,624 --> 00:28:00,092
No, enough!

351
00:28:00,926 --> 00:28:01,926
Two.

352
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:02,962
What do you see, Akin?

353
00:28:03,996 --> 00:28:04,997
Three!

354
00:28:05,164 --> 00:28:06,299
- Throw!
- No!

355
00:28:12,605 --> 00:28:13,606
It's not true!

356
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:15,574
No, Dad!

357
00:28:22,782 --> 00:28:24,917
It's not true! Fire!

358
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:26,652
Fire! Help!

359
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,721
Put the fire out!

360
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:31,057
- Put it out!
- What do you see?

361
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,491
Say it.

362
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:33,993
So you can find out

363
00:28:34,493 --> 00:28:37,730
if you're afraid of fire
or the truth.

364
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:41,634
Face it!

365
00:28:48,708 --> 00:28:49,709
Tell me!

366
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:52,211
What do you see? Tell me!

367
00:28:52,645 --> 00:28:53,713
Why would you want to know?

368
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:56,048
What do you want?

369
00:28:58,684 --> 00:28:59,986
You don't care about me!

370
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:01,587
I'm stupid for trusting you!

371
00:29:02,355 --> 00:29:03,622
What do you see? Say it!

372
00:29:03,623 --> 00:29:04,624
Stay away from me!

373
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:51,837
I need to talk to you.

374
00:29:53,673 --> 00:29:55,074
Same here.

375
00:29:56,976 --> 00:29:58,077
My men told me

376
00:29:58,644 --> 00:30:00,546
you were looking for
information on the company.

377
00:30:01,747 --> 00:30:05,818
About the employees and caretakers
of this house from 15 years ago.

378
00:30:08,321 --> 00:30:09,322
What do you want?

379
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:11,757
Was it you?

380
00:30:12,358 --> 00:30:13,793
Did you try to pry
into my business?

381
00:30:17,797 --> 00:30:18,798
And what are you afraid of?

382
00:30:21,834 --> 00:30:22,835
Are you scared I'd find

383
00:30:23,703 --> 00:30:24,704
the truth?

384
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,276
You don't want to know

385
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:33,079
what the truth is.

386
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:39,819
I already know.

387
00:30:43,089 --> 00:30:44,090
I understand now

388
00:30:44,757 --> 00:30:45,758
what's the cause

389
00:30:47,627 --> 00:30:48,894
of the guilt

390
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:50,930
and pain in my heart.

391
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,234
You forced me

392
00:30:57,269 --> 00:30:58,270
to kill innocent people

393
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:01,140
for your own gain.

394
00:31:03,876 --> 00:31:05,011
How could you do that?

395
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,815
Do you really remember it now?

396
00:31:13,386 --> 00:31:14,387
You have to own up

397
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:16,355
to what you did.

398
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,824
Own up to what?

399
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,894
Those dirty slum rats had no right

400
00:31:22,161 --> 00:31:25,131
to build houses on that land
in the first place!

401
00:31:26,832 --> 00:31:27,833
You're admitting it now, aren't you?

402
00:31:30,536 --> 00:31:31,537
That's right.

403
00:31:32,972 --> 00:31:33,973
So what?

404
00:31:37,543 --> 00:31:39,845
But if you remember everything now,

405
00:31:40,179 --> 00:31:41,180
you should realize

406
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:44,450
you're the one at fault, not me.

407
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:47,853
Even though I wanted to do it,

408
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:49,855
you were the one who did it!

409
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:51,157
Don't you say that!

410
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:52,925
You forced my hand!

411
00:31:58,798 --> 00:31:59,865
If I didn't do it,

412
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,234
someone else would've.

413
00:32:03,102 --> 00:32:06,172
That land's worth a fortune.
Everyone wants a piece of it.

414
00:32:07,506 --> 00:32:10,009
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
standing here

415
00:32:10,142 --> 00:32:12,311
as the company's chairperson
and defying me as we speak!

416
00:32:12,445 --> 00:32:13,479
But I never wanted it

417
00:32:14,146 --> 00:32:15,615
if lives were going to be at stake!

418
00:32:17,283 --> 00:32:19,485
I'm going to do everything
to make things right.

419
00:32:21,754 --> 00:32:23,122
Don't you dare.

420
00:32:24,223 --> 00:32:25,391
Don't you dare

421
00:32:25,591 --> 00:32:26,926
because you'll have nothing left.

422
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,528
And you'll bring your family down
with you too!

423
00:32:29,562 --> 00:32:31,731
I don't care!
I just want to get out of this!

424
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:34,800
At last,

425
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,536
you've chosen to be stupid

426
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,573
and weak, just like your mother.

427
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:45,411
Standing up for what's right

428
00:32:47,013 --> 00:32:49,081
isn't stupidity or weakness.

429
00:32:50,683 --> 00:32:52,585
Mom was a good person.

430
00:32:53,552 --> 00:32:55,621
As for you, you're a crook!

431
00:32:58,424 --> 00:33:00,192
This is my final warning

432
00:33:00,826 --> 00:33:02,762
before I do even worse.

433
00:33:06,098 --> 00:33:07,466
I'm going to tell
everyone about this.

434
00:33:11,737 --> 00:33:13,172
Kin, stop right there!

435
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:14,607
Hey, stop!

436
00:33:17,043 --> 00:33:18,044
You've gone too far!

437
00:33:22,214 --> 00:33:23,215
Kin!

438
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:32,558
Kin?

439
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,541
What have you done?

440
00:33:49,575 --> 00:33:50,843
He's your own son.

441
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:53,546
Have you forgotten

442
00:33:54,146 --> 00:33:56,983
he'll be the one to bring back
our company to its former glory?

443
00:33:58,117 --> 00:33:59,118
He'll be the one

444
00:34:00,453 --> 00:34:01,821
to ruin us all.

445
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:03,656
What's gotten into you?

446
00:34:05,091 --> 00:34:06,092
Get out of my sight.

447
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:08,661
This is between a father and son.
You're an outsider.

448
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,201
Kin?

449
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:17,169
Kin?

450
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,211
Why am I here?

451
00:34:27,113 --> 00:34:28,114
What happened?

452
00:34:29,315 --> 00:34:30,316
Ugh.

453
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:41,093
He sustained only minor injuries.

454
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:44,397
And not being able
to remember the events prior

455
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:48,768
is probably
a pre-existing condition.

456
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:50,970
It resurfaced

457
00:34:51,404 --> 00:34:52,538
from the impact.

458
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:57,476
I suggest you take him
to a hospital just to be sure.

459
00:34:59,178 --> 00:35:00,913
He's been working hard lately

460
00:35:01,614 --> 00:35:05,017
and hasn't gotten enough rest.
He fainted and fell down the stairs.

461
00:35:06,018 --> 00:35:07,019
Don't worry, Doctor.

462
00:35:07,954 --> 00:35:09,789
I'll take him to a hospital.

463
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,358
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

464
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:19,432
Kin,

465
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:21,500
you should rest.

466
00:35:22,635 --> 00:35:23,636
Okay.

467
00:35:27,406 --> 00:35:28,908
Are you sure you don't
remember anything?

468
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,645
The psychiatrist said

469
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,047
you don't remember anything?

470
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,091
Ouch.

471
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:49,695
Let him rest.

472
00:35:55,201 --> 00:35:56,202
Get some rest, okay?

473
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:12,718
Ever since he was a kid, trauma
has caused him memory problems.

474
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:16,522
I thought he already
recovered from that.

475
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:20,493
But that's good.

476
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:23,763
Otherwise, you'd be in trouble.

477
00:36:30,536 --> 00:36:33,806
An assault, especially when
it's because your own son

478
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,808
took your position in the company,

479
00:36:36,309 --> 00:36:38,044
is a big deal.

480
00:36:38,644 --> 00:36:39,979
You took this clip?

481
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:42,682
Scumbag.

482
00:36:43,015 --> 00:36:44,550
So I can watch it for fun later.

483
00:36:45,051 --> 00:36:47,286
And I saved the file.

484
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:57,063
You have no right
to boss me around anymore.

485
00:37:04,804 --> 00:37:06,005
This is nice.

486
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:12,812
We'll be presenting ourselves as
loving spouses to the public again

487
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:15,615
at Kin and Risa's wedding.

488
00:37:18,517 --> 00:37:20,920
People are going to be very envious
of our family.

489
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:27,126
You're a clever man.

490
00:37:28,661 --> 00:37:29,962
I guess you've probably realized

491
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:35,868
that you should treat
a stupid person like me nicely.

492
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:05,097
Treetep.

493
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,101
I've made my decision.

494
00:38:11,871 --> 00:38:15,775
I'll transfer half
of my shares to you.

495
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,345
I hope it's enough

496
00:38:21,047 --> 00:38:23,716
to guarantee my safety.

497
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:24,176
(Maya)

498
00:40:05,084 --> 00:40:06,085
Yes, Risa?

499
00:40:13,459 --> 00:40:16,228
I'm glad you like
the wedding invitation.

500
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:19,465
I'll have them printed right away.

501
00:40:20,633 --> 00:40:21,634
Okay.

502
00:40:23,269 --> 00:40:24,370
Talk to you later.

503
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,294
I think you understand
the meaning of freedom.

504
00:40:49,328 --> 00:40:51,931
But I'm not sure
you'll have the chance

505
00:40:52,398 --> 00:40:54,433
to experience it in this life.

506
00:40:58,704 --> 00:41:00,506
If there's something that makes you
feel uncomfortable,

507
00:41:01,941 --> 00:41:04,844
you should have the choice
to free yourself from it.

508
00:41:21,027 --> 00:41:23,729
The number you have called is not
available at this time.

509
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:33,172
The number you have called is not
available at this time.

510
00:41:33,606 --> 00:41:36,309
Please leave a message after the...

511
00:42:03,803 --> 00:42:05,271
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

512
00:42:07,506 --> 00:42:09,976
- How can I help you?
- Uh, is Indy here?

513
00:42:10,209 --> 00:42:13,011
Oh, I haven't been able
to reach him for days now.

514
00:42:13,012 --> 00:42:14,547
I'm not sure if he's out of town
or not.

515
00:42:14,947 --> 00:42:18,317
He goes out of town
to rest quite often.

516
00:42:19,852 --> 00:42:21,387
By the way, is there anything
I can help you with?

517
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:24,089
It's okay.

518
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:27,526
Do you mind asking him to call me
the next time you talk to him?

519
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:29,328
He knows who I am.

520
00:42:29,428 --> 00:42:30,429
Oh, sure.

521
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:33,099
- Thank you.
- No problem.

522
00:42:49,482 --> 00:42:50,483
Indy!

523
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,119
Hey! Indy! Indy, wake up!

524
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:54,553
Indy!

525
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:56,856
Nurse! Can you come here, please?

526
00:42:57,456 --> 00:42:59,959
Indy! Wake up, Indy!

527
00:43:00,192 --> 00:43:01,593
Indy, come on!

528
00:43:01,594 --> 00:43:03,129
- What happened?
- Please help!

529
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,331
Indy!

530
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:08,167
Indy!

531
00:43:17,043 --> 00:43:18,044
Ma.

532
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:23,916
How's Indy?

533
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:31,357
He's going to be fine, okay?

534
00:43:34,593 --> 00:43:35,661
There must be something.

535
00:43:36,996 --> 00:43:38,998
What those scumbags did to him.

536
00:43:39,765 --> 00:43:41,100
There must be evidence.

537
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:46,038
Where are you going?

538
00:43:47,073 --> 00:43:48,074
What are you thinking of doing?

539
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:51,811
I won't let him get hurt
for nothing.

540
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:54,680
Look after him for me.

541
00:44:02,355 --> 00:44:03,923
Can you be scared
of something for once?

542
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:17,069
You say that as if you have
a suspect in mind.

543
00:44:17,303 --> 00:44:20,106
Indy was asking everyone
for evidence of the fire.

544
00:44:20,506 --> 00:44:22,308
He recently went to Treetep's house.

545
00:44:26,646 --> 00:44:27,647
Hello?

546
00:44:28,147 --> 00:44:30,616
Hello? Do you know where
the owner of the phone is?

547
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:33,085
And who are you? Why are you
answering his phone?

548
00:44:33,452 --> 00:44:35,521
Do you mean the guy
who rides a motorbike?

549
00:44:36,188 --> 00:44:38,057
That's him. What happened?

550
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:41,494
I'm not sure either.
He's probably been hit by a car.

551
00:44:43,262 --> 00:44:44,263
Who do you think it was?

552
00:44:44,563 --> 00:44:46,666
Ma, if anything happens to me,

553
00:44:46,866 --> 00:44:48,501
I want you to know
the person who did it is...

554
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,872
Indy? What's going on?

555
00:45:04,884 --> 00:45:05,952
There must be something.

556
00:45:06,686 --> 00:45:07,887
There must be evidence.

557
00:45:49,161 --> 00:45:50,162
Who do you work for?

558
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:08,547
No matter what happens,

559
00:46:09,482 --> 00:46:10,883
I'm going to help you, Ma.

560
00:46:11,917 --> 00:46:13,152
I will do everything I can

561
00:46:13,486 --> 00:46:15,988
so that what you're trying to do
is over as soon as possible.

562
00:46:18,124 --> 00:46:19,258
Our lives are short.

563
00:46:20,493 --> 00:46:22,628
I want you to be happy
as soon as possible.

564
00:46:23,529 --> 00:46:24,897
For the rest of your life.

565
00:46:26,499 --> 00:46:27,867
I'm really worried about you, Ma.

566
00:46:31,237 --> 00:46:32,338
I don't want you to forget

567
00:46:33,806 --> 00:46:34,907
that you still have me

568
00:46:36,976 --> 00:46:38,010
no matter what.

569
00:46:59,365 --> 00:47:05,604
(It)

570
00:47:11,077 --> 00:47:12,078
Hello?

571
00:47:12,945 --> 00:47:13,946
I miss you.

572
00:47:17,049 --> 00:47:19,352
I miss us listening
to music together

573
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:21,887
and our conversations.

574
00:47:23,089 --> 00:47:24,423
It made me very happy.

575
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:28,794
I want to see you.

576
00:47:31,364 --> 00:47:32,598
I miss you too.

577
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,301
Very much so.

578
00:47:37,637 --> 00:47:38,638
Don't worry.

579
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:41,240
It won't be long

580
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:43,976
until we see each other.

581
00:47:45,478 --> 00:47:46,479
I'll be waiting.

582
00:48:02,228 --> 00:48:04,597
Are you sure he did it?

583
00:48:05,765 --> 00:48:07,500
That scumbag It.

584
00:48:09,735 --> 00:48:11,504
And what are you going to do
with the evidence you found?

585
00:48:14,473 --> 00:48:17,943
Nothing will happen
if I take it to the police.

586
00:48:18,678 --> 00:48:20,046
He's got the money and the power.

587
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,417
Or maybe we tell the public

588
00:48:24,784 --> 00:48:26,218
and let the public deal with him.

589
00:48:37,029 --> 00:48:39,398
Thank you for always
being there for me.

590
00:48:42,902 --> 00:48:46,038
Right now, I want you to wake up

591
00:48:47,606 --> 00:48:50,042
so you can watch them
pay for what they did to you.

592
00:48:55,114 --> 00:48:56,115
What are you going to do?

593
00:49:51,637 --> 00:49:53,239
You said you missed me.

594
00:49:56,108 --> 00:49:57,343
So I came to see you.

595
00:49:57,710 --> 00:49:58,711
Maya!

596
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:00,947
Have you seen the news?

597
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:03,015
Don't tell me it's Kwan.

598
00:50:04,884 --> 00:50:06,018
Fortunately, you have a daughter.

599
00:50:07,286 --> 00:50:08,487
She makes a good hostage.

600
00:50:09,121 --> 00:50:11,023
Enough, Maya. It's over now.

601
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,326
I've been waiting for 15 years.

602
00:50:17,296 --> 00:50:18,297
I'm not going to wait any longer.
