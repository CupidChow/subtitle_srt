1
00:00:00,125 --> 00:00:01,825
Dad, the news of the event

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,758
has reached our major shareholders.

3
00:00:04,158 --> 00:00:06,425
Thank you for all the help.

4
00:00:07,058 --> 00:00:08,258
You asked to see me tonight

5
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:09,958
because of our agreement, right?

6
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:11,191
I can

7
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:12,425
give you anything.

8
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:15,458
Remember,
I'm going to divorce you

9
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,625
no matter what.

10
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:19,158
I came to make a proposal.

11
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:21,958
Be with me
and leave my dad alone.

12
00:00:22,358 --> 00:00:25,391
I came up with another way
to mess with them again.

13
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,558
He's afraid of fire too?

14
00:00:33,891 --> 00:00:38,291
Get out!

15
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:43,225
Get out, scumbags!

16
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:48,491
How are you going to explain
today's protest, It?

17
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:50,825
Nothing. Just as you've all seen.

18
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:55,191
These people are always publicly
harassing and pressuring us

19
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,225
so they can demand compensation

20
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,425
for the fire that happened
years ago.

21
00:00:59,691 --> 00:01:02,391
We weren't even involved.

22
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,425
I don't think we should
pay them any attention.

23
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:08,391
Are you really treating it
as something insignificant?

24
00:01:08,891 --> 00:01:10,325
All of these disruptions are

25
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:13,358
negatively impacting
our company's reputation.

26
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:15,625
How do you plan to fix this?

27
00:01:16,058 --> 00:01:20,791
In any case, I'll try my best to
prevent this from happening again.

28
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:23,891
I'm not sure it can
be fixed that easily.

29
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:27,291
Especially if there aren't
any changes made.

30
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:31,791
What do you mean by that?

31
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,358
The protesters were

32
00:01:33,858 --> 00:01:36,258
directly targeting you, It.

33
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:40,025
Should we be reconsidering
your position as chairperson?

34
00:01:41,925 --> 00:01:43,525
I don't think
we have to go that far.

35
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:46,991
We all know I'm the only person here

36
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:49,358
who brings both experience and
company knowledge to the table.

37
00:01:50,158 --> 00:01:51,691
But reputation is

38
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:53,658
also important to the company.

39
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:55,991
And how have I tarnished
our reputation?

40
00:01:56,525 --> 00:01:59,624
You know this protest has
obviously been orchestrated.

41
00:01:59,625 --> 00:02:00,625
I didn't do anything bad.

42
00:02:01,725 --> 00:02:03,625
Oh dear. It.

43
00:02:04,258 --> 00:02:07,158
There's a video clip of you
and that musician on social media.

44
00:02:09,225 --> 00:02:10,225
Oh.

45
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:15,058
It's come this far. Do you honestly
believe it's still not a problem?

46
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:17,125
It hasn't been problematic.

47
00:02:17,358 --> 00:02:20,858
I think we should make a decision
aimed to limit backlash.

48
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:26,791
We should finally elect
a new chairperson.

49
00:02:31,958 --> 00:02:34,525
I don't think
it's the right time yet.

50
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:37,925
There's no one who can
replace me now either.

51
00:02:39,725 --> 00:02:42,625
You can still lend your skills
as a consultant.

52
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,325
I would like to suggest a new
chairperson for you to consider.

53
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:51,691
And that is Akin Itsarapat.

54
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,058
I don't think he's going to...

55
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,425
accept the position.

56
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:09,391
Because he's fully aware that

57
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,558
he's not experienced enough.

58
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,825
Listen to me carefully.

59
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,225
When I'm gone,

60
00:03:23,158 --> 00:03:25,858
you have to protect everything
that belongs to you.

61
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:31,925
Don't let anyone take away
what's yours.

62
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:44,858
All of you seem to believe

63
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:48,158
I'm capable of sorting out
these problems.

64
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,091
I'm happy

65
00:03:56,991 --> 00:03:58,225
to accept the position
as chairperson.

66
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:05,225
Well then. Who else agrees
to appoint Akin

67
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:08,058
as chairperson of Itsara Group?

68
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:03,258
Akin's here.

69
00:06:04,225 --> 00:06:06,325
- Akin, can I get a quick interview?
- Yes?

70
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:07,658
Of course.

71
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,658
How do you feel about being
appointed as the new chairperson?

72
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:16,191
I'd have to thank all of
the shareholders and board members

73
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:17,425
for putting their trust in me.

74
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:20,625
I will do my best in the role
I have been assigned.

75
00:06:21,625 --> 00:06:22,625
Kin.

76
00:06:24,358 --> 00:06:25,358
Congratulations.

77
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,025
Thank you.

78
00:06:28,091 --> 00:06:29,858
The news seems
to have traveled fast.

79
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:32,857
Thank you to both of you

80
00:06:32,858 --> 00:06:35,425
for coming here to congratulate him.

81
00:06:37,025 --> 00:06:41,391
Of course. I pay extra attention to
companies with family ties.

82
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:47,525
That incident shouldn't have
happened, It.

83
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:55,158
But I'm very glad
on your behalf, Akin.

84
00:06:56,058 --> 00:06:57,058
Thank you.

85
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:59,991
It, how are you feeling?

86
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:02,158
How am I feeling?

87
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,125
I feel good, of course.

88
00:07:07,025 --> 00:07:08,025
Good.

89
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,825
You all know Akin is my son.

90
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,791
I should be supportive of him,
shouldn't I?

91
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:17,691
Of course. Thank you.

92
00:07:17,891 --> 00:07:20,058
- Can we take a group photo, please?
- Sure.

93
00:07:20,925 --> 00:07:21,925
- Please stand right over there.
- Sure.

94
00:07:25,691 --> 00:07:27,325
- Thank you.
- Stand close together, please.

95
00:07:28,691 --> 00:07:29,791
This camera too, please.

96
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:31,358
That's right.

97
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:32,725
That's beautiful.

98
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:38,091
- This way too, please.
- Over here. Thank you.

99
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,825
Look here as well, please.

100
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,391
What's gotten into you?

101
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,291
Huh?

102
00:07:51,025 --> 00:07:52,291
Why aren't you staying
with the guests?

103
00:07:52,658 --> 00:07:54,858
You're hiding from everyone.
Isn't it a tad uncivilized?

104
00:07:55,191 --> 00:07:56,191
Who's uncivilized?

105
00:07:56,691 --> 00:07:57,691
Who?

106
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:59,791
Don't you think what Treetep did
was uncivilized too?

107
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:01,125
What?

108
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,758
What did he do?

109
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,558
Have you not realized?

110
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:08,825
He orchestrated all of this

111
00:08:09,058 --> 00:08:11,091
so Akin could become chairperson!

112
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:16,258
How could he have arrived
right after the meeting was over?

113
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:26,125
Or did you know
and not tell me about it?

114
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:30,958
Oh, that's right.

115
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,891
If Akin becomes chairperson
and marries Risa,

116
00:08:35,425 --> 00:08:37,458
it's a win-win for you and them.

117
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:46,591
You leaked that video clip,
didn't you?

118
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,625
You did it, didn't you?

119
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,625
Why?

120
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:54,925
What did Treetep give you
that you thought it was worth it?

121
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,958
- You stupid woman!
- That's right!

122
00:08:58,258 --> 00:09:00,191
I'm the stupid one!

123
00:09:01,391 --> 00:09:04,291
I wouldn't be with you if I wasn't!

124
00:09:05,825 --> 00:09:07,625
And you can't blame me
for everything.

125
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:09,525
I'm not a piece of trash!

126
00:09:09,725 --> 00:09:11,458
You can't toss me around
like I'm nothing!

127
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:13,625
- You're trash!
- I'm not!

128
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:17,025
And I didn't leak that video clip!

129
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:18,658
I gain nothing from it.

130
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,724
Everyone's cursing and mocking me.
So why would I do it?

131
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:25,525
Because you're stupid,
but you think you're so clever!

132
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:26,925
You're a fool!

133
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:29,325
You're stupid in every way!

134
00:09:30,025 --> 00:09:31,025
Did you think

135
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,825
you'd get something from Treetep
by serving under him

136
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,358
if he took over the company?

137
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:41,591
As soon as he takes over,
he'll just fill his pockets.

138
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:43,425
And he'll end up brushing you off.

139
00:09:43,725 --> 00:09:45,958
You won't get anything,
and we'll be ruined!

140
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:47,625
That's what you call stupid!

141
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:51,725
Yes, I'm stupid.

142
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,391
And you?

143
00:09:55,891 --> 00:09:59,425
If you think Treetep is
that powerful,

144
00:09:59,825 --> 00:10:01,525
then why don't you go
and put on a performance

145
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,824
that you're okay
about what happened today?

146
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:05,225
Because I'm not!

147
00:10:08,591 --> 00:10:09,591
Let me tell you something.

148
00:10:10,225 --> 00:10:15,324
Treetep was kind enough
to keep you on as the consultant.

149
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:16,358
Consultant?

150
00:10:16,758 --> 00:10:18,758
I don't want to be a consultant,
you fool!

151
00:10:19,258 --> 00:10:21,691
I'm the owner of the company.
I built it with my own hands!

152
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:25,025
Go away. Get lost.

153
00:10:25,391 --> 00:10:26,391
Sure!

154
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:27,925
I'm going now!

155
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:31,025
Treetep and Risa are

156
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,758
congratulating Akin right now.

157
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:38,258
No one cares about
an elderly consultant

158
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:40,825
who thinks he's the cleverest person
in the world.

159
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,758
I'm so happy for you.

160
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,558
You're talented.

161
00:10:50,958 --> 00:10:53,725
You're the most deserving
to take over from It.

162
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,625
Thank you.

163
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,158
I'm the luckiest woman
in the world, Dad.

164
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:04,458
Don't disappoint her, Akin.

165
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:07,058
I won't.

166
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:10,124
He's also the luckiest man
in the world

167
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,091
to have her as his bride-to-be.

168
00:11:13,325 --> 00:11:14,991
Don't worry, Treetep.

169
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:17,958
He'll never disappoint her.

170
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:22,858
This is nice.
Today's full of positivity.

171
00:11:23,591 --> 00:11:27,625
Let's have dinner and throw
a party for Akin later.

172
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:32,291
You're always looking for an excuse
to throw a party.

173
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:37,191
Right. Do you mind
if I chat with Kin for a bit?

174
00:11:38,425 --> 00:11:39,425
- Sure.
- Well then.

175
00:11:39,558 --> 00:11:41,791
Should we go shopping while we wait?

176
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:45,125
Maybe you'll want to buy
a new outfit for the party.

177
00:11:46,191 --> 00:11:48,724
I'll get the personal shopper
to put together outfits

178
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:51,025
from every brand's new collection

179
00:11:51,525 --> 00:11:55,325
so you can try them on
in the VIP Lounge, okay?

180
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,025
Okay.

181
00:11:58,925 --> 00:12:00,125
See you at home, Dad.

182
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,958
- Bye, Kin.
- Bye.

183
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:12,458
Risa's very happy
you're chairperson.

184
00:12:13,758 --> 00:12:15,458
I'm very happy for you as well.

185
00:12:17,091 --> 00:12:18,091
Thank you.

186
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,525
Now that you're chairperson,

187
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:23,458
our conversations are probably going
to be easier from now on.

188
00:12:25,591 --> 00:12:27,825
And if you want to stay
in the position long term,

189
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:29,825
then I think

190
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,125
we should be having
conversations often.

191
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:45,658
Do you think everything that's
happened was purely coincidental?

192
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:58,091
You've obtained the most important
position in the company.

193
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:00,258
Since you're my future son-in-law,

194
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:04,325
I'll provide you with extra support
in every way.

195
00:13:07,191 --> 00:13:09,691
Let's discuss the business agreement
when we both have time.

196
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:13,658
I have plenty
of great propositions for you.

197
00:13:17,558 --> 00:13:18,558
Of course.

198
00:13:33,658 --> 00:13:35,625
Do you think you've
got an easy job,

199
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:38,358
Mr. Chairperson?

200
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:50,725
You're just a puppet

201
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,825
for those hoping
for personal gains.

202
00:13:54,225 --> 00:13:55,225
Once you're no longer of use,

203
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:57,625
you won't be able
to keep your position

204
00:13:58,058 --> 00:13:59,525
or my company.

205
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,491
Let's not jump to conclusions.

206
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:04,358
We should wait and see for a bit.

207
00:14:05,591 --> 00:14:08,391
I might end up being
a better chairperson than you.

208
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:09,858
Akin!

209
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:12,891
Why do you think
you're better than me?

210
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:16,791
You can't even hold
onto your position.

211
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:18,825
Akin!

212
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,091
You’ve got some nerve
talking to me like that now.

213
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:25,891
Has this been part
of your plan the whole time?

214
00:14:31,925 --> 00:14:32,925
It's a shame

215
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:34,991
it wasn't.

216
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:37,891
But if it was me,

217
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:41,425
didn't you teach me

218
00:14:42,991 --> 00:14:45,691
there's no place for decency?

219
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:48,391
That if I want to win,

220
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,291
I should do everything in my power

221
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:52,925
whether it's good or bad?

222
00:14:54,325 --> 00:14:55,325
That's right.

223
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:57,258
I taught you those things.

224
00:14:58,058 --> 00:15:00,825
But I'm your father!
You can't do this to me!

225
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,358
Ingrate.

226
00:15:08,391 --> 00:15:11,125
Aren't you misunderstanding
something?

227
00:15:12,558 --> 00:15:14,125
I'm being a grateful son.

228
00:15:16,025 --> 00:15:17,891
I'm going to be
the freaking best chairperson.

229
00:15:20,425 --> 00:15:21,725
I won't disappoint Mom.

230
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:24,691
I'm going to do it for her.

231
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,625
I will demand back her rights

232
00:15:28,025 --> 00:15:29,858
and protect everything
that should be mine.

233
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,358
Those were her last words
before she died.

234
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:37,391
Before you made her die.

235
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,025
Kin.

236
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,358
Kin!

237
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:45,725
Kin!

238
00:15:47,225 --> 00:15:48,225
Dear, dear.

239
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,125
Is that how he thinks of you?

240
00:16:00,891 --> 00:16:01,925
It's okay.

241
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:06,558
Things are going to get better
once he marries Risa.

242
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,625
The money's going to stay
where it should be.

243
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,725
It's none of your business.

244
00:16:19,158 --> 00:16:20,158
Greedy.

245
00:16:20,525 --> 00:16:22,258
It's all about money with you!

246
00:16:22,391 --> 00:16:24,058
So do you think money
isn't important?

247
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:27,791
Haven't you been doing things
for money this whole time?

248
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:36,291
This day has finally arrived.

249
00:16:37,891 --> 00:16:40,525
The day the father loses to his son.

250
00:16:44,925 --> 00:16:45,925
And why are you happy?

251
00:16:47,225 --> 00:16:48,291
Kin isn't your son.

252
00:16:49,491 --> 00:16:52,458
If this is how he treats his father,
what do you think he'll do to you?

253
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:55,025
I don't think he's going to do
anything to me.

254
00:16:56,425 --> 00:16:57,691
Kin is a good person.

255
00:16:58,658 --> 00:16:59,658
Unlike you.

256
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:04,125
Don't you dare.

257
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:08,725
If you really think Treetep was
behind you losing your position,

258
00:17:10,491 --> 00:17:12,525
you should start treating me better.

259
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:19,225
Because no one can
help you except me.

260
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:22,125
Get out.

261
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:03,625
I didn't leak the clip.

262
00:18:04,591 --> 00:18:05,591
What?

263
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,491
Don't you believe me?

264
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:09,391
No.

265
00:18:11,325 --> 00:18:12,725
I don't think you did it.

266
00:18:16,391 --> 00:18:18,625
I hope you didn't come
all the way here

267
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,925
just to ask me about it.

268
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,891
You should be happy

269
00:18:25,925 --> 00:18:27,758
to have gotten your dad's position.

270
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,125
But why does your expression

271
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,058
seem sad?

272
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:38,658
You're a therapist who can read
people's feelings well.

273
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:41,358
You probably know

274
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:43,558
how I'm feeling.

275
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:46,025
Tell me.

276
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:47,725
What's on my mind right now?

277
00:18:48,058 --> 00:18:49,725
Why wouldn't I know

278
00:18:50,691 --> 00:18:51,758
how you're feeling?

279
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,258
If you want me to speak
from the standpoint of a therapist,

280
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:58,258
I'll need a bit more time

281
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,825
to study my patient.

282
00:19:02,591 --> 00:19:06,058
But if you want me to speak
as someone who's acquainted

283
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:08,391
and close to you,

284
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,325
I can say

285
00:19:12,325 --> 00:19:13,325
that right now,

286
00:19:14,091 --> 00:19:15,691
you're feeling confused

287
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:17,725
and distrustful of everyone else,

288
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,458
even your own family.

289
00:19:21,325 --> 00:19:23,891
But you still chose
to come here to see me.

290
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:31,358
I might've come to see you

291
00:19:32,891 --> 00:19:34,791
so that we could let
some steam off together.

292
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:36,925
If that's the case,

293
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,058
what would you like to do

294
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:44,025
to let off some steam then?

295
00:20:19,458 --> 00:20:22,825
I know you're trying to act strong

296
00:20:23,158 --> 00:20:24,525
and capable of handling problems.

297
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:28,058
But it doesn't mean you're weak

298
00:20:28,858 --> 00:20:30,058
if you can't handle everything.

299
00:20:31,658 --> 00:20:32,658
Regardless,

300
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:35,425
you struggle with
your mental health.

301
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:38,658
Without proper treatment,

302
00:20:39,358 --> 00:20:42,325
I'm worried the wound in your heart
might get bigger

303
00:20:43,058 --> 00:20:44,991
and eventually cause everything
to fall apart.

304
00:20:47,325 --> 00:20:49,225
I want to help you find it

305
00:20:49,725 --> 00:20:50,891
so that you can recover.

306
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:55,125
I'll let you know once I'm ready.

307
00:21:10,325 --> 00:21:13,725
I knew they wouldn't dare to press
charges against the protesters.

308
00:21:14,491 --> 00:21:17,791
They probably don't want
to get criticized on social media.

309
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:22,025
Besides, they also
promised the protesters

310
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,891
to look after them
and provide support.

311
00:21:25,025 --> 00:21:27,925
Even though they'll never
keep the promise.

312
00:21:28,525 --> 00:21:31,225
But at least I know now

313
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,291
I'm not fighting them alone.

314
00:21:34,425 --> 00:21:35,590
There are still lots of people

315
00:21:35,591 --> 00:21:36,891
who haven't forgotten
about that incident.

316
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:43,125
Anyway, thanks so much
for always helping me.

317
00:21:45,258 --> 00:21:48,991
I said I'd do whatever it takes
to end this as soon as possible.

318
00:21:51,058 --> 00:21:52,625
It lost his position

319
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:55,158
because that clip was
the final straw.

320
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:57,525
If you weren't the one
who leaked it,

321
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,358
who did?

322
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:03,325
It doesn't matter.

323
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,858
We got something
out of it after all.

324
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:09,225
But there's something else
more interesting.

325
00:22:10,158 --> 00:22:12,491
Did you see Akin's reaction
when he saw the fire?

326
00:22:12,891 --> 00:22:16,891
Get out!

327
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:19,858
What do you think it means?

328
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:22,791
Why is he afraid of fire like you?

329
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,891
Have we dealt with the protesters?

330
00:22:26,858 --> 00:22:28,025
Okay. Thank you.

331
00:22:33,425 --> 00:22:36,191
I have a feeling
that Akin's condition

332
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:39,191
is the result of that night,
same as mine.

333
00:22:44,758 --> 00:22:45,758
Strange.

334
00:22:46,325 --> 00:22:48,458
Why does he feel the same?

335
00:22:51,925 --> 00:22:52,925
It's as if...

336
00:22:54,258 --> 00:22:55,858
he was there that day.

337
00:23:05,191 --> 00:23:07,391
But he's probably
starting to realize it now.

338
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:13,891
And he's probably
trying to find an answer as to why.

339
00:23:14,491 --> 00:23:16,725
Can you get me the addresses
of the protesters?

340
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:19,558
Maybe someone
who looks like the leader.

341
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:22,058
Thank you.

342
00:23:32,525 --> 00:23:33,525
Hi.

343
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:36,125
Do you remember me?

344
00:23:37,925 --> 00:23:38,925
What?

345
00:23:39,791 --> 00:23:41,358
I thought you said you weren't going
to press charges against us.

346
00:23:41,825 --> 00:23:42,825
Did you change your mind?

347
00:23:42,826 --> 00:23:44,225
Oh, I didn't.

348
00:23:44,691 --> 00:23:47,925
I'm just here to ask you to tell me
the truth about that night.

349
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:50,025
You're the son of the family
who lives in that big house.

350
00:23:50,258 --> 00:23:51,291
Don't you know anything at all?

351
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:55,125
I don't remember
what happened at all.

352
00:23:57,191 --> 00:23:58,691
And how come you're so sure

353
00:23:59,225 --> 00:24:01,625
my dad was behind the arson?

354
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:03,391
Oh?

355
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,925
Someone saw him there, of course.

356
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:07,425
Really?

357
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:10,825
Was there anyone else there?

358
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:14,758
Why are you asking
all of these questions?

359
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:17,025
- Are you trying to frame someone?
- No!

360
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:20,425
Rich people like you don't care
about anybody.

361
00:24:21,025 --> 00:24:22,025
Let's go.

362
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:23,891
He's just a rich scumbag.

363
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,658
Hey, where have you been?

364
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:49,391
I went in there
to talk to some people.

365
00:24:53,425 --> 00:24:54,458
You look rich enough.

366
00:24:57,158 --> 00:24:58,158
Spare me some change?

367
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:00,358
Maybe?

368
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:02,891
Come on.

369
00:25:03,858 --> 00:25:05,858
Are you going to cough it up,
or do you want to die?

370
00:25:12,225 --> 00:25:13,225
Come on.

371
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:21,358
Easy enough.

372
00:25:27,825 --> 00:25:28,825
Stop.

373
00:25:29,891 --> 00:25:30,891
Or I'll shoot you.

374
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:32,725
Leave!

375
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,425
Why are you here?

376
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:42,358
You have a gun?

377
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,191
Huh? You're bleeding.

378
00:25:48,391 --> 00:25:49,391
Does it hurt a lot?

379
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:01,791
All done.

380
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:05,325
Thank you.

381
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:09,425
You still haven't told me

382
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,558
why you were there.

383
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:15,791
Have you forgotten I work to support
people in the slums?

384
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:19,291
I go there regularly.

385
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:24,158
But I admit I was eavesdropping.

386
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,791
I was listening to you talking
to those people

387
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:30,225
because I was curious if you were
going to do anything to them.

388
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,558
And how come you have a gun?

389
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,191
My ex gave it to me
for self-defense.

390
00:26:43,991 --> 00:26:45,491
And it did save my life before.

391
00:26:47,325 --> 00:26:48,325
Your ex.

392
00:26:49,591 --> 00:26:50,625
The one you said
you've broken up with?

393
00:26:52,725 --> 00:26:53,891
He's still taking care of you?

394
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:56,825
He seems worried about you.

395
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:05,425
It's my fault.

396
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,225
He's a decent guy who loves me,
but I didn't reciprocate.

397
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,591
I fell for someone
I shouldn't have instead.

398
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:15,125
Who are you referring to?

399
00:27:19,858 --> 00:27:21,425
If you're going there again,

400
00:27:22,325 --> 00:27:23,791
you have to watch your back.

401
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:28,258
That kind of place can be
dangerous sometimes.

402
00:27:29,291 --> 00:27:30,725
That's why I have to
bring a gun with me.

403
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:40,258
I overheard you talking
to those people about the past.

404
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:45,325
Do you really not remember
the fire that night?

405
00:27:49,825 --> 00:27:50,825
No.

406
00:27:53,025 --> 00:27:54,025
That's why I want to find out.

407
00:27:55,825 --> 00:27:56,825
Strange.

408
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:00,791
You've chosen to forget
certain things from the past.

409
00:28:02,525 --> 00:28:03,558
Then I guess

410
00:28:04,358 --> 00:28:06,325
it means a lot to you deep down.

411
00:28:08,991 --> 00:28:10,325
That's why you've chosen
to forget about it.

412
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:26,325
What are you doing?

413
00:28:28,091 --> 00:28:29,191
Trust me.

414
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:48,525
Keep your eyes on the flame.

415
00:29:06,225 --> 00:29:07,225
Akin,

416
00:29:10,525 --> 00:29:12,291
try remembering the scene
from that night.

417
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:14,958
The night when the fire broke out.

418
00:29:17,958 --> 00:29:18,958
What did you see?

419
00:29:21,125 --> 00:29:22,191
Say it out loud.

420
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,125
Do you see this fire?

421
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:40,958
It's hot.

422
00:29:42,958 --> 00:29:43,958
Try touching it.

423
00:30:05,091 --> 00:30:06,091
I'm sorry.

424
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:09,325
It's not going to work.

425
00:30:10,625 --> 00:30:11,858
I won't remember
no matter how many times you try.

426
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:13,325
It's okay.

427
00:30:17,425 --> 00:30:19,958
What did you see just now?

428
00:30:21,058 --> 00:30:22,058
Tell me.

429
00:30:24,291 --> 00:30:25,291
I saw nothing.

430
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:30,425
Let's stop.

431
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:41,858
That night at the wedding

432
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:44,558
between your friend and Saksit,

433
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:46,825
you also reacted

434
00:30:48,325 --> 00:30:49,525
when the fire happened, didn't you?

435
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:54,625
Are you afraid of fire as well?

436
00:30:56,525 --> 00:30:57,525
It had nothing to do with the fire.

437
00:30:58,725 --> 00:31:00,891
I was feeling
a bit unwell that night.

438
00:31:03,425 --> 00:31:05,425
Then that happened,

439
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:07,925
so I felt short of breath
and got a bit startled.

440
00:31:19,925 --> 00:31:20,925
Akin.

441
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:25,191
I'm sorry

442
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:29,025
that my methods might've
made you feel uncomfortable.

443
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:34,358
But in any case,
if you remember something,

444
00:31:34,991 --> 00:31:36,491
feel free to call me anytime.

445
00:31:37,225 --> 00:31:38,625
I still want to give it a try.

446
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:44,425
You don't really smile much at all.

447
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:46,291
You always look so stressed.

448
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:49,958
I don't feel like smiling.

449
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,858
Even though you're unhappy
and don't feel like smiling,

450
00:31:53,558 --> 00:31:55,258
if you try to smile,

451
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:57,391
your body will feel it.

452
00:31:58,325 --> 00:31:59,825
If you make it a habit,

453
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:02,058
your body will get used to it.

454
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:04,891
And you'll feel better.

455
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,191
I read a study on it.

456
00:32:09,758 --> 00:32:13,058
Because I often use the same
method myself.

457
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:19,425
You say that
as if you're not happy either.

458
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:23,125
Don't pay attention to me.

459
00:32:25,158 --> 00:32:28,458
Anyway, I believe you're like this

460
00:32:29,925 --> 00:32:32,025
because you grew up
with a father like that.

461
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:34,525
Or maybe

462
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:36,558
when you were younger,

463
00:32:37,725 --> 00:32:40,025
you might've had to go through
something very traumatic.

464
00:32:44,325 --> 00:32:45,325
Can I ask you something?

465
00:32:46,925 --> 00:32:47,925
When you were young,

466
00:32:48,991 --> 00:32:50,825
did you ever have a best friend?

467
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:53,925
Someone to make you smile,

468
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:56,058
laugh,

469
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,791
and to share happiness with.

470
00:33:22,925 --> 00:33:23,925
Someone like me

471
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:26,025
doesn't have friends.

472
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:30,758
I should go.

473
00:34:13,891 --> 00:34:14,958
What are you doing here?

474
00:34:16,025 --> 00:34:17,425
I'm just playing soccer.

475
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:21,591
You don't allow me to go outside,
so I have to play alone.

476
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:23,358
Why aren't you studying?

477
00:34:25,091 --> 00:34:27,058
If your grades are bad again,

478
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,091
I'm not going to let it slide.

479
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:33,325
Remember. You have to be number one.

480
00:34:33,758 --> 00:34:35,958
Don't expect to go out anywhere
if you can't be number one.

481
00:34:36,725 --> 00:34:40,058
Your good friends
from decent and rich families

482
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:41,991
are all studious.

483
00:34:43,191 --> 00:34:45,225
Only stupid and poor
kids from the slums

484
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:46,891
would run around playing all day.

485
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:48,591
Do you want to be like them?

486
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,125
Why are you staring at me?

487
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:54,891
Dear.

488
00:34:56,725 --> 00:34:58,091
I'm done getting dressed.

489
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:00,725
Shall we go?

490
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:03,791
Go study.

491
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:46,991
You're so good.

492
00:36:26,791 --> 00:36:28,790
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

493
00:36:28,791 --> 00:36:29,791
Okay.

494
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:09,358
Do you like it?

495
00:37:10,925 --> 00:37:11,925
It's yours. You can have it.

496
00:37:12,158 --> 00:37:13,158
Thank you.

497
00:37:15,458 --> 00:37:16,458
Smile.

498
00:37:17,691 --> 00:37:19,825
One, two, three.

499
00:37:24,658 --> 00:37:25,658
Here.

500
00:38:02,358 --> 00:38:04,025
(Ma)

501
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:18,925
- What's the matter, Indy?
- Ma,

502
00:38:19,591 --> 00:38:21,858
did you hear about Akin having
a chat with people in the slums?

503
00:38:22,658 --> 00:38:24,791
I think he's investigating
something.

504
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:28,325
Really?

505
00:38:28,858 --> 00:38:30,025
I didn't hear a thing.

506
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:36,025
Anyway, can you ask those people

507
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:38,691
not to say anything just yet

508
00:38:39,825 --> 00:38:41,225
until we find out the whole truth?

509
00:38:42,725 --> 00:38:43,725
Probably soon.

510
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:46,191
That's right. Soon.

511
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,325
I hope so too.

512
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:52,658
Thanks so much

513
00:38:53,858 --> 00:38:55,125
for always helping me.

514
00:38:58,125 --> 00:38:59,358
I have to go now.

515
00:39:09,558 --> 00:39:11,658
What did he talk to you about, Chai?

516
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:12,958
Did you tell him anything?

517
00:39:13,391 --> 00:39:14,925
He asked about 15 years ago.

518
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:16,991
But I didn't tell him anything.

519
00:39:21,558 --> 00:39:22,558
You're bleeding.

520
00:39:59,158 --> 00:40:00,458
Were you driving with
your eyes closed?

521
00:40:01,225 --> 00:40:02,591
You scratched my car.

522
00:40:03,258 --> 00:40:06,291
I should be asking you that.
What's the hurry?

523
00:40:06,491 --> 00:40:08,525
If you're in such a hurry,
why didn't you leave yesterday?

524
00:40:09,058 --> 00:40:10,091
Did you actually take
the driving test?

525
00:40:10,358 --> 00:40:11,358
Or did you hire someone
to sit for you?

526
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:14,491
Do you know you're supposed to leave
space in front when you drive?

527
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,658
You dare to use that tone with me?

528
00:40:19,658 --> 00:40:20,925
Do you know who my father is?

529
00:40:22,125 --> 00:40:23,125
He's a minister.

530
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:25,791
I'm calling him right now.

531
00:40:26,691 --> 00:40:28,758
You're calling your daddy? Why?

532
00:40:29,491 --> 00:40:31,891
It's a car crash.
Call the insurance company.

533
00:40:32,258 --> 00:40:33,791
And now you're ordering me around?

534
00:40:36,525 --> 00:40:37,525
Here.

535
00:40:41,158 --> 00:40:42,158
What are you doing?

536
00:40:47,391 --> 00:40:49,158
Here's my number.

537
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,425
If you don't want to wait
for the insurance company,

538
00:40:51,925 --> 00:40:53,458
then we'll sort this out later.

539
00:40:53,991 --> 00:40:57,125
And if you still want to call
your daddy, be my guest.

540
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,625
But look at this.

541
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,458
My car has a dash cam.

542
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:06,291
Go on.

543
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:11,125
I'll post it online so people can
learn about the minister's daughter.

544
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:15,491
In this day and age,
no matter how influential you are,

545
00:41:15,858 --> 00:41:17,558
you're still at the mercy
of social media.

546
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:22,858
Besides, your family's
probably rich.

547
00:41:23,291 --> 00:41:24,891
Should we bring on the drama?

548
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:26,458
Should we give it a try?

549
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,258
You're going to get buried.

550
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:36,891
I can recommend you a good shop.

551
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:39,925
Minor scratches like that
are a piece of cake.

552
00:41:41,025 --> 00:41:42,025
Call me if you're interested.

553
00:41:43,191 --> 00:41:44,191
Stay out of it.

554
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:49,058
All right.
Then call the insurance company.

555
00:41:49,391 --> 00:41:51,790
I'm on my way to a party to
celebrate my fiancé's new position

556
00:41:51,791 --> 00:41:52,791
as chairperson.

557
00:41:53,291 --> 00:41:55,658
You probably don't understand
how important it is.

558
00:41:56,925 --> 00:41:58,425
I'll ask my dad's people
to handle this.

559
00:41:58,725 --> 00:41:59,725
Don't go anywhere.

560
00:42:00,691 --> 00:42:01,958
Go on. Feel free.

561
00:42:05,325 --> 00:42:07,525
Hello? I had a car accident.

562
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,358
Come over and sort out
the insurance for me.

563
00:42:09,891 --> 00:42:11,791
Send over a car
to pick me up right away.

564
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,525
Right now. At this moment.

565
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:14,991
I'll send the location.

566
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:18,991
Don't let me find out
you did a runner.

567
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:20,558
I've got nowhere to be.

568
00:42:23,925 --> 00:42:25,525
Did he cut you off?

569
00:42:26,025 --> 00:42:27,225
That's right.

570
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,225
I lost a lot of time
because of it.

571
00:42:31,391 --> 00:42:33,624
But I don't think
I'll press charges.

572
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:35,391
It's not worth it.

573
00:42:37,025 --> 00:42:39,925
Everyone knows I'm Akin's fiancé.

574
00:42:40,625 --> 00:42:42,991
He's got an important position
at the company now.

575
00:42:43,558 --> 00:42:45,325
I don't want to cause him
any trouble.

576
00:42:48,391 --> 00:42:50,058
You must've been in shock.

577
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:53,358
Yet you were still
thinking of him.

578
00:42:54,325 --> 00:42:55,325
Of course.

579
00:42:56,591 --> 00:42:59,225
And I've decided that
after we get married,

580
00:42:59,625 --> 00:43:01,325
I'm going to help with the company.

581
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,991
So I have to be extra careful not to

582
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:07,891
cause problems that can affect
the company or Akin's reputation.

583
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:10,625
Oh, my dear daughter.

584
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:14,425
I thought you'd only be interested
in partying and shopping.

585
00:43:14,825 --> 00:43:16,325
You're a good worker as well?

586
00:43:17,758 --> 00:43:20,091
Dad, I'm not a little kid anymore.

587
00:43:20,791 --> 00:43:24,758
Which position should we
appoint her, Mr. Chairperson?

588
00:43:26,291 --> 00:43:29,758
Oh, for someone like her...

589
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:31,391
- Hm.
- Maybe...

590
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:33,291
I think

591
00:43:34,025 --> 00:43:35,758
for a girl as pretty as her,

592
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:38,925
she should be in the public eye.

593
00:43:39,791 --> 00:43:44,025
Are you interested
in my PR position?

594
00:43:45,758 --> 00:43:49,925
I'll let you take over
as head of the department.

595
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:51,591
What do you think?

596
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,391
Isn't it a little too high-ranking?

597
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:57,491
Then what about you?

598
00:43:58,058 --> 00:44:03,025
I think Kin's been working
very hard recently.

599
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:04,758
He's straddling two positions.

600
00:44:05,325 --> 00:44:07,858
He's both the chairperson and CEO.

601
00:44:09,058 --> 00:44:10,825
So I think I can

602
00:44:11,191 --> 00:44:12,925
lighten his load

603
00:44:13,625 --> 00:44:14,825
by becoming the CEO myself.

604
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:21,458
Is that a good idea, Kin?

605
00:44:25,125 --> 00:44:27,325
What do you think, Treetep?

606
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:39,958
Should we discuss it
with the company's consultant first?

607
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:46,325
Discuss it with me?

608
00:44:47,925 --> 00:44:48,991
I don't see why you should.

609
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:51,425
You're having fun assigning
each other roles.

610
00:44:52,558 --> 00:44:53,558
That's it.

611
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:56,225
I'll follow along
with whatever you see fit.

612
00:45:00,091 --> 00:45:01,991
I'm glad you agree, It.

613
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:06,491
I do have many great projects
to propose to Akin.

614
00:45:07,558 --> 00:45:11,091
But first of all, let's make a toast
to Akin's new position

615
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:14,591
and the imminent success
of our company.

616
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:15,925
Here.

617
00:45:16,925 --> 00:45:18,725
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

618
00:45:18,891 --> 00:45:20,025
Cheers.

619
00:45:23,825 --> 00:45:24,825
Excuse me.

620
00:45:25,258 --> 00:45:26,258
I have to take a call.

621
00:45:28,758 --> 00:45:29,758
Hello?

622
00:45:33,991 --> 00:45:36,425
He's busy now, but it's okay.

623
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:38,025
Let's drink to it.

624
00:45:38,825 --> 00:45:40,358
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

625
00:45:40,658 --> 00:45:41,891
Cheers.

626
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:43,725
Congratulations, Akin.

627
00:45:43,925 --> 00:45:44,925
Thank you.

628
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:48,558
How is Risa's car?

629
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:51,958
Mm. Sort it out.

630
00:45:59,825 --> 00:46:00,891
You're not enjoying the party, It?

631
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:03,358
Or is it the food?

632
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:06,558
I chose Risa's
favorite restaurant for tonight.

633
00:46:07,558 --> 00:46:11,358
She was the one
who wanted to congratulate Akin.

634
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:17,525
Maybe you're not that happy
about your son's achievement?

635
00:46:21,725 --> 00:46:24,491
Akin as chairperson is
good for the company's image.

636
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:28,425
What are you getting at?

637
00:46:30,091 --> 00:46:31,091
Why would you say that?

638
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:35,191
Hold on. You're probably
misunderstanding me.

639
00:46:36,058 --> 00:46:38,858
I'm trying to say Akin's
from a younger generation.

640
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:41,791
It's probably good
for our company's image.

641
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,925
It shows our demographic
isn't just the older crowds.

642
00:46:45,391 --> 00:46:47,725
We plan to target

643
00:46:48,458 --> 00:46:51,225
the younger generation
who can afford it too.

644
00:46:53,425 --> 00:46:56,991
You seem to understand
our family's business quite well,

645
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:58,691
Mr. Minister.

646
00:47:01,225 --> 00:47:03,691
Why do you say that
as if I'm an outsider?

647
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,125
We're all good friends here.

648
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:08,658
Come on, It.

649
00:47:09,225 --> 00:47:11,091
I know you're confused

650
00:47:11,691 --> 00:47:13,925
with all the rapid changes.

651
00:47:14,358 --> 00:47:15,358
I know

652
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,791
everything that's been happening

653
00:47:19,558 --> 00:47:20,858
isn't a coincidence.

654
00:47:22,058 --> 00:47:23,058
Calm down.

655
00:47:23,858 --> 00:47:25,025
You don't have to be so upset.

656
00:47:26,558 --> 00:47:27,758
You must've had too much to drink.

657
00:47:30,158 --> 00:47:31,725
You shouldn't act impulsively.

658
00:47:32,925 --> 00:47:35,291
People might misunderstand
if they see you.

659
00:47:35,825 --> 00:47:38,125
They might think you're in conflict
with a minister.

660
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:41,525
People nowadays like to take videos
and post them online as well.

661
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,525
Any more leaked clips of yourself

662
00:47:46,191 --> 00:47:47,191
wouldn't be a good look.

663
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,825
If things escalate to that level,

664
00:47:50,826 --> 00:47:54,291
even your powerless
consultant position

665
00:47:54,525 --> 00:47:55,525
would slip through your fingers.

666
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:57,325
And then you'll have nothing

667
00:47:58,091 --> 00:47:59,790
despite having built everything...

668
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:00,791
Treetep!

669
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:02,291
It!

670
00:48:02,825 --> 00:48:03,825
It!

671
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:07,691
I'm so sorry, Treetep.

672
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:10,658
He probably had too much to drink.

673
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:12,158
He's been stressed lately.

674
00:48:13,325 --> 00:48:15,525
It's okay. I don't mind.

675
00:48:17,458 --> 00:48:20,158
It, you should go home.

676
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:22,325
Excuse me.

677
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,658
What on earth did you do?

678
00:49:01,325 --> 00:49:02,425
What have you done?

679
00:49:04,791 --> 00:49:07,891
Have you lost your mind
along with your position?

680
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:13,091
You're siding with him.

681
00:49:14,825 --> 00:49:15,891
Flattering each other.

682
00:49:18,991 --> 00:49:20,691
What's your next step?

683
00:49:23,025 --> 00:49:24,658
Do you want to be his wife?

684
00:49:28,025 --> 00:49:29,025
Of course.

685
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:33,091
That's all a woman like you
is capable of.

686
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:39,758
You dressed up to go out
for dinner with him.

687
00:49:40,991 --> 00:49:41,991
If you're going
to dress so revealing,

688
00:49:42,925 --> 00:49:44,225
then why not go there naked?

689
00:49:46,158 --> 00:49:47,225
You dare to slap me?

690
00:49:47,525 --> 00:49:49,291
- You dare to slap me?
- Yes, I do!

691
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:51,225
That's right!

692
00:49:51,625 --> 00:49:53,591
I might want to be
his wife after all!

693
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:55,625
At least

694
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:59,191
he doesn't look down
on me like you do.

695
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:03,358
If you're going to
keep acting crazy,

696
00:50:04,191 --> 00:50:06,225
then you won't even have

697
00:50:07,091 --> 00:50:08,658
a stupid woman like me around.

698
00:50:09,025 --> 00:50:10,425
Don't act like you care.

699
00:50:11,058 --> 00:50:14,325
I know you're dying
to sleep with him.

700
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:16,391
Go on! Get laid!

701
00:50:16,791 --> 00:50:17,825
If he wants you, that is!

702
00:50:18,191 --> 00:50:19,191
Go!

703
00:50:20,025 --> 00:50:21,025
Wait.

704
00:50:23,558 --> 00:50:25,258
I won't let you go that easily.

705
00:50:25,758 --> 00:50:29,625
He's going to get my leftovers.

706
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,025
What?

707
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:48,958
Do you understand now

708
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:52,558
how it feels

709
00:50:53,991 --> 00:50:55,091
to be denied?

710
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,458
If you're so thirsty,

711
00:51:03,925 --> 00:51:05,291
then go and sleep
with those prostitutes!

712
00:51:07,891 --> 00:51:08,891
Oh.

713
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:11,958
Ever since you lost
your position,

714
00:51:12,158 --> 00:51:16,225
those prostitutes have left you
for men who are better!

715
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,125
Parnkeaw!

716
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:39,125
It?

717
00:51:41,991 --> 00:51:42,991
I've missed you.

718
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,725
Have you been drinking?

719
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:53,625
Are you going to stay with me

720
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:58,991
if I don't have anything left
at that company?

721
00:52:00,791 --> 00:52:01,825
But I promise

722
00:52:02,891 --> 00:52:05,091
I'm going to take back everything
that's mine.

723
00:52:06,058 --> 00:52:07,058
Trust me.

724
00:52:09,391 --> 00:52:10,658
- Please be mine.
- It!

725
00:52:10,925 --> 00:52:13,191
Please don't!

726
00:52:14,891 --> 00:52:17,691
It, no!

727
00:52:19,125 --> 00:52:20,725
- It, no!
- Please be mine.

728
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:23,191
- Please.
- Let go of me!

729
00:52:23,325 --> 00:52:24,325
I've missed you.

730
00:52:24,491 --> 00:52:26,358
Let go! Let me go now!

731
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:31,291
It, stop right now!

732
00:52:32,325 --> 00:52:33,325
It, let go of me!

733
00:52:33,391 --> 00:52:35,858
- I said let go!
- Come on. Let me have you.

734
00:52:48,391 --> 00:52:49,958
I'm worried about Kwan.

735
00:52:50,691 --> 00:52:51,825
I haven't been able
to get in touch with her.

736
00:52:52,725 --> 00:52:54,791
The only way to find out
how Kwan's doing

737
00:52:55,991 --> 00:52:57,391
is to see her with our own eyes.

738
00:52:59,125 --> 00:53:00,325
Keep your mouth shut

739
00:53:00,958 --> 00:53:01,958
if you don't want to die.

740
00:53:02,525 --> 00:53:04,158
If you've killed someone with fire,

741
00:53:04,591 --> 00:53:06,825
I'm going to use
the fire of your desire

742
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:09,258
to destroy you.

743
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:12,558
Hello, It. I sent you
the location of the hotel.

744
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:13,791
See you soon.
