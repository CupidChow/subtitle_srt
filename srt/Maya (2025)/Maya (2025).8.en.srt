1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:01,167
Ever since my mom died,

2
00:00:01,368 --> 00:00:02,903
I've never been able
to trust anyone.

3
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,005
I can trust you, can't I?

4
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:07,607
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:11,444
Hello, It. I've shared
the hotel's location with you.

6
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:12,811
See you later.

7
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:13,947
Maya!

8
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:15,048
What's going on here?

9
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:16,983
If you want me to help,

10
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:18,518
then I know a way.

11
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:19,953
Why would you do this?

12
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,521
What do you want?

13
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:22,656
Divorce me.

14
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:23,790
This time,

15
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:25,325
I think you have to lose something.

16
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:26,927
Are you telling me to divorce It?

17
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:28,662
I know of a better way.

18
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,532
Based on past incidents,

19
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:37,137
there have been suspicions
around our relationship.

20
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,340
I still insist

21
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,509
they were only rumors.

22
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:44,644
We're still in love.

23
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,084
However, to prevent my private life

24
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,988
from affecting It
and the company's image,

25
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,425
I still haven't told
anyone about this.

26
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:05,365
I've decided to resign
from Itsara Group.

27
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:11,972
You're telling me to resign?

28
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:14,040
Oh.

29
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,477
Do you know what I had to do

30
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:20,247
to get this far?

31
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:26,686
No, I won't do it.
I'm not resigning.

32
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:29,356
And you're still going to be
protective over your position.

33
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,058
Are you that stupid to the point
that you can't see

34
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:35,128
It's pressuring you
to divorce him?

35
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,297
And he'll publish the video clip.

36
00:01:38,164 --> 00:01:41,067
You'll get fired
and be left with nothing.

37
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,637
And you want me
to hold a press conference?

38
00:01:44,537 --> 00:01:46,439
The journalists aren't stupid.

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,675
Yes, they're not.

40
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:50,043
But you are.

41
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,347
Hire the ones you're familiar with.
Let them come up with questions.

42
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:57,350
Then act like you're reluctant
to answer or speak.

43
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,954
Now people are going to want to
write or talk about you.

44
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,427
And what if I resign?

45
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,664
What will I get in return?

46
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:14,768
You can trust me on this.

47
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,605
I'm going to help you earn
more than you've ever had.

48
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:31,718
Actually,

49
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,789
I didn't want to say much publicly

50
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,225
because I didn't want it
to make headlines.

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,361
If you didn't ask,

52
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:44,798
I'd step back quietly.

53
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:47,634
Right now,

54
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:52,872
I'm going to do my best
in the only role I have left.

55
00:02:53,974 --> 00:02:57,210
And that is to be a good wife

56
00:02:57,777 --> 00:03:00,714
and stay by It's side
during his time

57
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,184
of crisis.

58
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:10,490
The love I have for him is so great.

59
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:12,892
It's even greater

60
00:03:13,927 --> 00:03:16,830
than profits or business.

61
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,439
Excuse me, Parnkeaw.

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,076
Then who's going to take
over the position from you?

63
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,679
That's all I'd like to say.

64
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,414
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:35,448 --> 00:03:36,950
Thank you so much, everyone.

66
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,451
No problem.

67
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:40,387
Do you mind if I take some photos?

68
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:26,960
Well done.

69
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,664
I have to give you credit
for this one.

70
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,534
You're a former
movie star after all.

71
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,536
An old one.

72
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,376
I don't think I was that good.

73
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,679
Even you could tell.

74
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:50,517
Who'd know you as well as I do?

75
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,420
You hired the journalists as well.

76
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,489
I did.

77
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,362
My resignation isn't
actually big news.

78
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,066
But since I acted
like I didn't want to say much,

79
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,437
other outlets are going to come up
with their own interpretations.

80
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,909
In any case, some people will
probably feel sympathetic.

81
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,378
Actually, there might be a lot too.

82
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,619
Now, if you still insist on playing
the cruel husband

83
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,489
and decide to publish the clip
to hurt his poor, poor wife,

84
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:31,358
be my guest.

85
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:39,499
Your dear brother is

86
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,369
the director behind this, isn't he?

87
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:44,804
Because you'd never be

88
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,274
capable of going this far.

89
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:50,911
That's right.

90
00:06:51,678 --> 00:06:52,879
I'm not the sharpest.

91
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:56,283
But if you still want to do
what you want to do,

92
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,485
then you're more stupid than I am.

93
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:01,288
So?

94
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,392
How much did your obsession
with that woman cost you?

95
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,061
Do you still think
you're in the right?

96
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:12,465
It,

97
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,201
let go of your ego.

98
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:18,772
Why would you behave
so high and mighty?

99
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:21,775
At least I'm higher than you.

100
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,109
Remember this.

101
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,950
Don't work with her
to do anything to me again.

102
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,852
I'll never divorce you.

103
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,323
And tell her

104
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,259
you two will never

105
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:42,195
get what you want.

106
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,564
Because I won't let you.

107
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,701
I won't let you either.

108
00:08:07,754 --> 00:08:10,190
I've decided to resign
from Itsara Group.

109
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:15,894
Actually, I didn't want
to say much publicly,

110
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:19,466
because I didn't want it
to make headlines.

111
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,768
If you didn't ask,

112
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,372
I'd step back quietly.

113
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,443
I had to resign

114
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:32,279
because of that woman.

115
00:08:37,584 --> 00:08:39,519
So if she even does
something to me again,

116
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:42,522
it won't affect our company.

117
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,931
I made this sacrifice
for the company.

118
00:08:56,069 --> 00:08:58,138
You should stay away
from her as well.

119
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:07,514
You don't want her to ruin
everything your mom built, do you?

120
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,219
No.

121
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,966
Risa's heartbroken.

122
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:30,170
She's sad you haven't
visited her at all.

123
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:33,440
She called me today

124
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:35,308
and asked if you were free.

125
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,280
She loves you very much.

126
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:45,719
Kin.

127
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:50,056
Visit her sometimes.

128
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,629
No matter what you feel,

129
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,931
I believe

130
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,603
her family is the only way
to make things better.

131
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:09,776
At least they'll help our company
stay afloat.

132
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:16,917
Don't forget to call her, okay?

133
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:20,220
Okay.

134
00:10:57,557 --> 00:10:58,992
What do you think of this, Kin?

135
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,329
It's beautiful.

136
00:11:03,363 --> 00:11:05,699
It's going to take a while.
I have to try on different ones.

137
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:09,169
So I can pick the one I like
the most and Pat can redesign it.

138
00:11:11,471 --> 00:11:15,074
Anyway, do you mind zipping me up?

139
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,177
I can't reach.

140
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:27,887
You've probably got
a lot on your hands lately.

141
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:32,759
You've been so busy
you never answer my calls.

142
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,141
I understand.

143
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,911
Parnkeaw just resigned as well.

144
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,513
There's probably a lot to handle.

145
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:55,949
Should we do it this way?

146
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,153
I'll help you organize our wedding.

147
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,957
We already have people
helping with preparations.

148
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,925
It won't be tiring.

149
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:08,161
It's only decision-making.
We have people to do everything.

150
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,132
And are you okay with me

151
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:13,900
letting you handle it alone?

152
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,736
Of course.
It's not a problem at all.

153
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,439
You should wrap things up
at the company

154
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,475
so you won't have anything to worry
about during our wedding.

155
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,012
In any case,

156
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:29,883
we'll have a lot of time to spend
together, won't we?

157
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,327
Risa,

158
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:43,964
are you really going to be happy?

159
00:12:48,668 --> 00:12:49,669
Yes?

160
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,441
We're here

161
00:12:56,309 --> 00:12:57,677
because of what our families want.

162
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:01,815
So I want to make sure

163
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:07,187
you're really going to be happy
with our marriage.

164
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,131
No matter the reasons,

165
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,835
I'm always happy every time
I get to spend time with you.

166
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,473
And I believe

167
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:29,609
you'll be able to make me
happy forever.

168
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:34,948
Thank you for always worrying
about my feelings.

169
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:43,723
Risa,

170
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,861
I'm worried about you.

171
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,032
I want you to be happy.

172
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,935
That's why I'm always telling you

173
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,070
if you feel unsure

174
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:58,672
about us,

175
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,610
then I want you
to reconsider it carefully.

176
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,822
There's nothing else
for me to reconsider.

177
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,495
I trust in everyone's decision.

178
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,572
All right.

179
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,308
I'll do my best on my part.

180
00:14:38,144 --> 00:14:41,314
Feel free to pick
any wedding dress you want.

181
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,950
Actually, you can have several
made for yourself.

182
00:14:44,451 --> 00:14:46,786
I notice brides changing
into different ones.

183
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,724
Thank you, Kin.

184
00:14:51,324 --> 00:14:52,758
I'll get back to trying
the dresses on.

185
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:53,760
Okay.

186
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:33,833
Hello?

187
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,036
You still haven't saved my number?

188
00:15:37,571 --> 00:15:39,639
Oh, it's you. What's the matter?

189
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:41,708
Nothing.

190
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:44,711
I'm just calling to tell you
your car's ready.

191
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,279
You can send someone over for it.

192
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:48,448
Can you send the car over
to my house instead?

193
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,184
Come on. I've done
the repairs for free,

194
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:53,820
even though I wasn't in the wrong.

195
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,222
So why do I have
to deliver the car to you too?

196
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,525
Send one of your dad's
subordinates over.

197
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:00,527
It's inconvenient for me.

198
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:04,631
I'll be able to check everything
with you there just in case.

199
00:16:06,866 --> 00:16:08,435
Ugh, okay. Sure.

200
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,143
Is something the matter?

201
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,249
Nothing. The car's ready and is
getting delivered to my house.

202
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,084
Can you drop me off there?

203
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:25,819
Sure.

204
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:35,662
This way, please.

205
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,435
This way.

206
00:16:44,271 --> 00:16:45,972
- Feel free to have a seat.
- Thank you.

207
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,778
It's so luxurious. To be expected
of the minister's daughter's house.

208
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,748
She doesn't usually allow anyone
to come in and wait.

209
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,585
- She'll be back in no time.
- Thank you.

210
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,219
Would you like coffee or water?

211
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,955
I'm sorry for the bother.

212
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,891
I have something
to discuss with you.

213
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:06,559
What is it about?

214
00:17:06,793 --> 00:17:08,695
Well, it's about It.

215
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,068
- Who's that?
- A guest for Miss Risa.

216
00:17:17,571 --> 00:17:18,805
Well then. This way, please.

217
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:30,482
My sister's resigned
from the company

218
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,987
because she wanted to step back
from handling their problems.

219
00:17:35,188 --> 00:17:37,791
But as a matter of fact, I think

220
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,860
It is the problem.

221
00:17:41,628 --> 00:17:44,030
He said he's the consultant now,

222
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:46,199
but I don't think that's the case.

223
00:17:46,933 --> 00:17:48,001
So I think it's time

224
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:51,338
for us to do something about it.

225
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:54,574
How?

226
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:59,613
Well, if someone
facing a scandal like him were to

227
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,315
be completely removed
from the company,

228
00:18:02,716 --> 00:18:05,418
the company's image
is going to improve.

229
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:09,422
And it's also good for all of us.

230
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:14,060
You say this as if It's
going to agree to it.

231
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,596
He still has plenty of shares
in the company.

232
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,832
He's not going to give up easily.

233
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:22,903
And that's why I'm here
to talk to you.

234
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,305
I know you know a way.

235
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:29,843
And for someone
with a suspicious past like It,

236
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,178
it shouldn't be difficult to find
his weakness, should it?

237
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,249
There's also the case of him
having the slums burned down.

238
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:42,689
What do you want?

239
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:44,858
And why should I help you?

240
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,528
Because of our shared profits.

241
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:51,998
If It were to be removed
from the company,

242
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:56,536
Akin would be able to step in
to run the place and do more.

243
00:18:57,437 --> 00:19:00,974
And you and Risa would be happy

244
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:02,976
to get whatever you want.

245
00:19:03,843 --> 00:19:04,945
As for me,

246
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,047
I want to help my sister

247
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:10,150
get what she wants.

248
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:14,120
You're such a good brother.

249
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,825
By the way, doesn't your sister know

250
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:21,895
whether the case is true or not?

251
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,363
I don't think so.

252
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,298
But in my opinion,

253
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:28,468
those rumors about It being
behind it are probably true.

254
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,306
Hm.

255
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,744
I don't know if it's going to be
worth it for me or not

256
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,480
if I get myself involved.

257
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,417
We can talk about it.

258
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,554
I'm going to do everything

259
00:19:48,622 --> 00:19:50,757
so you can feel that it's worth

260
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,892
the risk you're taking.

261
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,405
Here's the key.

262
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,907
Can you give it to her?
I'm in a hurry.

263
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:11,044
Oh? There she is.

264
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,225
- Hello, Akin.
- Hi.

265
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:34,166
- Thanks, Kin.
- My pleasure.

266
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:35,769
Your father's inside, Miss.

267
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,671
He's having a conversation
with Saksit.

268
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,174
I should go.

269
00:20:41,775 --> 00:20:42,776
Oh?

270
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:47,614
You're not coming inside
to say hi to Dad?

271
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:50,717
Saksit's here as well.

272
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,521
It might be an important
conversation.

273
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:56,089
I don't want to bother them.

274
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,760
Okay.

275
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:04,097
Thank you for taking me to try out
the dresses earlier.

276
00:21:04,998 --> 00:21:06,633
No problem. Bye.

277
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:34,060
Oh? It's you.

278
00:21:35,729 --> 00:21:37,264
Got abandoned at home again?

279
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:41,301
Did your boyfriend refuse
to say hi to your dad?

280
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:48,375
Here. Your car key.

281
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:51,344
Give it a spin.
Call me if there are any issues.

282
00:21:54,948 --> 00:21:55,949
Wait.

283
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,187
Are you free today?

284
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,994
I want to go for a drive

285
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,663
in case there are any issues.

286
00:22:11,798 --> 00:22:13,533
Can you come with?

287
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,137
Mm.

288
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:54,541
I've adjusted
the brakes for you too.

289
00:22:55,175 --> 00:22:56,910
It'll probably feel softer.

290
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,619
Had a fight with your fiancé?

291
00:23:07,254 --> 00:23:08,255
I didn't.

292
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:11,157
I'm going to marry him next month.

293
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,628
If you're happy,

294
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:17,430
then congratulations.

295
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:20,667
What about you?

296
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:22,903
Aren't you seeing anyone?

297
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:27,507
No.

298
00:23:29,309 --> 00:23:30,310
I have to go.

299
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,144
Take the car for a spin.

300
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:34,481
Call me if there's a problem.

301
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,217
My name's Indy

302
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,786
in case you want to finally
save my number.

303
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:44,391
Indy?

304
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:47,193
That's a strange name.

305
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,097
Mm.

306
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:52,632
Indy.

307
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:55,068
It comes from "independence".

308
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,273
I think you understand what
independence means.

309
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:03,743
But I'm not sure if you'll ever get

310
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,246
to experience it in this life.

311
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:10,250
Whatever you're doing
that makes you uncomfortable,

312
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:14,921
you should be able to get
yourself out and be independent.

313
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,661
Bye.

314
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:23,830
Thanks...

315
00:24:30,103 --> 00:24:31,304
for fixing my car.

316
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:36,076
Mm. No worries.

317
00:24:36,876 --> 00:24:40,013
But I won't do it
for free next time.

318
00:24:40,347 --> 00:24:42,616
And don't let your mind drift
and rear-end someone again.

319
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,618
If you crash your car again,

320
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:47,854
I'm going to charge you extra.

321
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:51,057
Toodles.

322
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,681
You've sent me everything that was
managed by Parnkeaw?

323
00:25:16,149 --> 00:25:17,150
Thank you.

324
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:42,809
Ever since my mom died,

325
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:44,778
I've never been able
to trust anyone.

326
00:25:47,147 --> 00:25:48,214
I can trust you, can't I?

327
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,738
Saksit asked Treetep

328
00:26:11,972 --> 00:26:13,974
to spread rumors about It
burning down the slums?

329
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,042
Yes.

330
00:26:16,343 --> 00:26:19,246
It turns out everyone's
going after him right now.

331
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:22,749
We might not even have to do
anything. Just wait and see.

332
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:27,821
And I might know of a way to track
Treetep's movements.

333
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:30,423
Mm.

334
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,360
But in any case,

335
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,195
you have to be careful.

336
00:26:36,529 --> 00:26:38,732
Not all of It's enemies will

337
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:40,400
consider you as their ally.

338
00:26:41,735 --> 00:26:43,970
So don't risk yourself, okay?

339
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:47,440
How many times have I told you?

340
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,410
I won't let you take risks alone.

341
00:26:52,012 --> 00:26:55,248
And why did you ask me to install
CCTV cameras around the house?

342
00:26:59,753 --> 00:27:00,754
What happened?

343
00:27:01,988 --> 00:27:03,456
Did Parnkeaw send someone over
to hurt you again?

344
00:27:04,491 --> 00:27:06,259
Was it Akin? Maybe It?

345
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,261
It was nothing.

346
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:09,930
Don't worry.

347
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:11,965
Honestly,

348
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:15,235
I'm still not sure if we'll be able
to do anything to them.

349
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,338
Indy, don't you understand?

350
00:27:19,606 --> 00:27:22,442
It'll only take
a single piece of evidence.

351
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:26,313
I'm sure I'll be able to convince It

352
00:27:27,514 --> 00:27:29,950
to reveal the crimes he committed.

353
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,055
We're here now.

354
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:37,023
We've already come so far.

355
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:40,860
Just a little more

356
00:27:41,461 --> 00:27:43,029
and everyone's going
to find out the truth.

357
00:27:44,598 --> 00:27:46,099
I believe we can do it.

358
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,446
But CCTV cameras alone might not

359
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,214
be that helpful.

360
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:03,783
You have to promise me.

361
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:07,287
No matter what happens,
you have to tell me.

362
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:09,356
And I'll come running.

363
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:23,003
I'm really worried about you, Ma.

364
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:26,506
I don't want you to forget

365
00:28:27,941 --> 00:28:29,009
that you still have me

366
00:28:29,943 --> 00:28:30,977
no matter what.

367
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,584
Let me know if there's anything.

368
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:39,419
Don't carry the burden alone.

369
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:44,090
You still have me in any case.

370
00:28:45,425 --> 00:28:46,426
Do you understand?

371
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:10,984
I have to go.

372
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:27,200
Huh?

373
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:29,636
Akin?

374
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:32,572
What is this? Hey! Let go!

375
00:29:34,774 --> 00:29:36,810
Do you enjoy manipulating men?

376
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:41,147
My dad, your ex, and me.

377
00:29:42,616 --> 00:29:43,617
Seriously,

378
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,120
how many men does it take
to satisfy your desire?

379
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:49,956
Oh.

380
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:52,158
Maybe you're broke?

381
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,829
Is that why you spread your legs
to anything that moves?

382
00:29:57,063 --> 00:29:58,064
And seriously,

383
00:29:58,698 --> 00:29:59,699
that guy,

384
00:30:00,967 --> 00:30:01,968
is he really an ex?

385
00:30:04,537 --> 00:30:05,538
Or is he a regular client?

386
00:30:09,342 --> 00:30:10,343
How much did he pay you?

387
00:30:11,211 --> 00:30:12,579
I can top it.

388
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:15,081
And don't say you're not
in it for the money.

389
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:18,351
I know you gave it to me for free

390
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,121
to lure me into falling for you.
Isn't that right?

391
00:30:24,057 --> 00:30:25,125
Now I'm convinced

392
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:28,628
you're that kind of guy.

393
00:30:29,863 --> 00:30:30,931
You're only good at running
your mouth.

394
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:34,100
You keep insulting others
and think you can buy anyone.

395
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:36,469
Don't act like you know me.

396
00:30:37,604 --> 00:30:40,206
It's only right that I bought
a woman like you.

397
00:30:41,741 --> 00:30:43,910
How much is it? Name the price.
I'm buying you exclusively.

398
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,781
And I'll be your only client
from now on! Do you understand?

399
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:50,584
Let go of me!

400
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,118
Get off me!

401
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:54,387
Let go!

402
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,594
You're a lost cause.

403
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:02,963
Or maybe

404
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,864
you're not unwell.

405
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:07,000
But this is actually who you are.

406
00:31:08,635 --> 00:31:09,903
Huh? Or maybe

407
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:12,672
you already know everything.

408
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,041
You remember everything, don't you?

409
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:17,177
What are you talking about?

410
00:31:18,578 --> 00:31:19,779
The fire in the slums.

411
00:31:20,513 --> 00:31:22,349
You know what happened, don't you?

412
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:25,619
Or maybe

413
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:28,255
you know what your dad's done

414
00:31:29,589 --> 00:31:32,659
but choose to turn a blind eye
and ignore it.

415
00:31:33,927 --> 00:31:35,729
Because if that's really the case,

416
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:36,997
you're the cause of the fire

417
00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:39,599
that burned down the slums

418
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:41,801
and destroyed everything,

419
00:31:42,602 --> 00:31:44,170
just like what you did to me today.

420
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:50,010
You'll eventually turn
into your dad someday.

421
00:31:50,143 --> 00:31:52,178
I'll never be like him! I'm not him!

422
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,381
And let me tell you.

423
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:57,284
If the rumors
about the fire are true,

424
00:31:57,851 --> 00:31:59,586
I'll take full responsibility
in his place!

425
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,888
And don't change the topic.

426
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:04,858
Ask yourself if you
possess a single shred of sincerity.

427
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:06,593
Can you be trusted?

428
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:09,195
The answer is no
from what I've seen!

429
00:32:11,464 --> 00:32:12,766
Aren't you misunderstanding
something?

430
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:16,736
The people you shouldn't trust

431
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,705
are the ones around you,

432
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:20,707
not an outsider like me!

433
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,311
So?

434
00:32:25,111 --> 00:32:26,780
I'm not trustworthy anyway.

435
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,281
Get out then.

436
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:31,051
Get out!

437
00:32:58,979 --> 00:33:00,413
How could I forget

438
00:33:01,715 --> 00:33:02,849
that apart from me,

439
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,152
you might've also changed with time?

440
00:33:36,816 --> 00:33:38,018
The fire in the slums.

441
00:33:38,818 --> 00:33:40,553
You know what happened, don't you?

442
00:33:41,421 --> 00:33:43,290
You know what your dad's done

443
00:33:44,591 --> 00:33:47,627
but choose to turn a blind eye
and ignore it.

444
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,098
The people in the slums
are going to protest?

445
00:33:53,266 --> 00:33:56,369
Are they insane? Do they think
the land belongs to them?

446
00:33:59,339 --> 00:34:01,007
Deal with them by tonight

447
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,511
before things get out of hand.

448
00:34:06,846 --> 00:34:07,847
Burn them all down.

449
00:34:08,615 --> 00:34:09,849
I don't care if anyone dies.

450
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:24,197
I don't think he'll
keep anything here.

451
00:34:25,765 --> 00:34:27,667
Why are you asking me to do
such a risky thing?

452
00:34:28,134 --> 00:34:30,804
Try and find something, okay?

453
00:34:31,204 --> 00:34:33,673
I might have something to use
as leverage with Treetep.

454
00:34:34,341 --> 00:34:36,943
That jerk only takes.
He refuses to lose anything.

455
00:34:37,277 --> 00:34:39,312
And how should I know what to
look for?

456
00:34:39,846 --> 00:34:43,817
Property deeds, government papers,
money transfer receipts.

457
00:34:43,950 --> 00:34:47,621
He might've hidden his crimes
in an unexpected place.

458
00:34:48,388 --> 00:34:50,357
You're so good
at this kind of thing.

459
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,260
Is it really the time
to criticize me right now?

460
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,129
Hurry up and find something
before It comes home.

461
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,031
All right.

462
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,084
Aren't you misunderstanding
something?

463
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:20,687
The people you shouldn't trust

464
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:22,622
are the ones around you.

465
00:35:23,356 --> 00:35:24,524
There's nothing.

466
00:35:24,791 --> 00:35:26,693
I don't think
he'd keep anything here.

467
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:30,730
It's been a decade or so. He won't
keep evidence of the arson here.

468
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,636
I should go. I'll call you
when I think of something.

469
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:51,251
Is there something important?

470
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:53,787
Why did you ask
to meet at a safe house?

471
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:57,691
Have a seat.

472
00:36:11,071 --> 00:36:12,205
I feel sorry for you.

473
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:15,141
Your hands are full of trouble.

474
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:19,346
It's probably quite tough on you.

475
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:22,649
But I think

476
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,051
I might be able to help you.

477
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,095
If you mean the company,

478
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,932
shouldn't you talk to the
chairperson about what you want?

479
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:42,202
You know I no longer have
the authority.

480
00:36:44,938 --> 00:36:46,573
That's why I asked you to meet.

481
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:49,476
Because I believe

482
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:54,481
I know a way to help you take back
everything you used to have.

483
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:58,852
No use.

484
00:36:59,552 --> 00:37:00,820
If we're going to talk about this,

485
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,157
then excuse me.

486
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,396
I refuse to accept your help.

487
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,731
Come on, It.

488
00:37:12,732 --> 00:37:15,535
We can come to an agreement
with whatever's bothering you.

489
00:37:22,709 --> 00:37:25,145
Have a drink and calm down.

490
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,181
Excuse me.

491
00:37:41,494 --> 00:37:43,430
You've caused me to lose everything.

492
00:37:44,197 --> 00:37:45,198
Isn't that satisfying enough?

493
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:47,834
What else do you want from me?

494
00:37:49,903 --> 00:37:52,272
You can't make empty
accusations against me.

495
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:55,242
But it's okay.

496
00:37:56,276 --> 00:37:58,211
Let's wait until you've calmed down.

497
00:37:58,845 --> 00:38:00,213
And we can discuss this later.

498
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:04,284
Right now, I just want you to know

499
00:38:05,218 --> 00:38:07,220
that some people are
coming after you.

500
00:38:08,655 --> 00:38:10,257
And I hold enough power

501
00:38:10,824 --> 00:38:12,792
to help clean up your past

502
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:15,795
including silencing anyone

503
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:18,431
and preventing them from speaking.

504
00:38:23,103 --> 00:38:24,638
As long as we work together.

505
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,642
You probably don't want me to join
forces with anyone else, right?

506
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,978
Unless...

507
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:37,651
your past is completely clean.

508
00:38:39,953 --> 00:38:41,588
Then there's nothing to fear.

509
00:38:58,905 --> 00:38:59,906
Treetep.

510
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:03,777
That jerk's probably
behind everything.

511
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:05,946
He's also a scumbag.

512
00:39:07,113 --> 00:39:08,315
Everyone knows that.

513
00:39:08,815 --> 00:39:10,250
But there's no evidence of it yet.

514
00:39:11,751 --> 00:39:13,086
Find something.

515
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,622
Any crimes he's committed.

516
00:39:17,557 --> 00:39:18,558
I'm curious to find out

517
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:22,295
if he'll act like he has
the upper hand again.

518
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:04,638
Hello? Maya?

519
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,140
How are you doing?

520
00:40:10,543 --> 00:40:11,811
You've probably seen the news.

521
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,217
It didn't go as we expected
with Parnkeaw.

522
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:23,089
But your voice is quite strained.

523
00:40:25,558 --> 00:40:26,626
Would you like to meet?

524
00:40:28,028 --> 00:40:30,397
I might be able to ease the pain.

525
00:40:46,913 --> 00:40:48,114
This piece is my favorite.

526
00:40:50,717 --> 00:40:53,353
I still haven't asked you
why you like classical.

527
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,891
Should there be a reason

528
00:40:58,992 --> 00:41:00,160
why someone likes something?

529
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:04,664
That's true.

530
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:06,800
There's no need for a reason.

531
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,071
Similar to how I like you.

532
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:38,932
Ma!

533
00:41:44,137 --> 00:41:45,438
I'm so happy for you.

534
00:41:45,805 --> 00:41:47,807
You've got the scholarship
to go and study overseas.

535
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:53,780
Who would've thought wanting to use
music to calm your mom down

536
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,016
would get you that far?

537
00:42:01,554 --> 00:42:02,555
Are you okay?

538
00:42:04,257 --> 00:42:05,625
Do you realize
the scholarship I won is

539
00:42:06,493 --> 00:42:07,827
his dirty money?

540
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:10,497
That scumbag?

541
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:14,768
He claims to like classical music

542
00:42:15,435 --> 00:42:16,970
because he wants
to help kids from the slums.

543
00:42:18,338 --> 00:42:19,338
(Itsara Group Awards Scholarships
to Outstanding Students)

544
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:20,840
He just wants to put up a front

545
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:23,276
so people forget his crimes.

546
00:42:25,545 --> 00:42:27,514
I meant to apply for the scholarship

547
00:42:28,014 --> 00:42:29,149
so I could take his money.

548
00:42:33,486 --> 00:42:34,988
And I'm going to use this

549
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,624
to destroy his life.

550
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:44,364
Right.

551
00:42:45,799 --> 00:42:46,800
Watch where you're walking.

552
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:13,960
Your muscles are quite tense.

553
00:43:15,128 --> 00:43:17,097
They say that if you're stressed,

554
00:43:18,198 --> 00:43:19,799
it'll manifest itself physically.

555
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:23,503
You might be right.

556
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:26,306
I'm stressed.

557
00:43:29,342 --> 00:43:30,343
Maybe...

558
00:43:31,077 --> 00:43:34,180
society's misunderstanding
of you from a decade or so ago

559
00:43:35,015 --> 00:43:38,118
has got you constantly thinking

560
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:40,520
and causes you to feel stressed?

561
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:44,324
If you want someone
to let off steam with,

562
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:47,961
I can help you.

563
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:53,033
And remember.

564
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:56,036
No matter what the truth is,

565
00:43:57,337 --> 00:43:58,972
I'll always stay by your side.

566
00:44:13,553 --> 00:44:14,955
Can you tell me?

567
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:16,890
Hm?

568
00:44:17,357 --> 00:44:18,959
What's the truth?

569
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:20,961
What actually happened?

570
00:44:23,463 --> 00:44:24,564
What do you want to know about?

571
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,201
Well...

572
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:32,272
About society's misunderstanding...

573
00:44:35,008 --> 00:44:36,309
from a decade ago.

574
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,382
You can trust me.

575
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:48,755
Well, I...

576
00:44:59,466 --> 00:45:00,467
I'd rather not.

577
00:45:01,735 --> 00:45:02,769
It's nonsensical.

578
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:05,639
Let's not ruin the good atmosphere.

579
00:45:16,516 --> 00:45:17,517
Nonsensical?

580
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:19,486
Ma!

581
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:22,422
The death of my parents is
nonsensical?

582
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:55,789
Excuse me.

583
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:02,862
- What?
- The people accepted the money.

584
00:46:03,396 --> 00:46:04,965
And they agreed to say

585
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:07,567
who hired them to join the protest
during the shareholders' meeting.

586
00:46:08,368 --> 00:46:10,203
Oh? I see.

587
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:12,572
Deal with it now.

588
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,441
I'll be there soon.

589
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:15,942
Yes, sir.

590
00:46:17,677 --> 00:46:18,678
Thank you very much.

591
00:46:19,479 --> 00:46:20,847
You've made me very happy tonight.

592
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,252
But I have something
to attend to now.

593
00:46:29,623 --> 00:46:30,624
I'll be back.

594
00:47:14,801 --> 00:47:16,603
(Unknown)

595
00:47:18,538 --> 00:47:19,539
Hello?

596
00:47:20,206 --> 00:47:23,243
What? You have
a video clip of the fire?

597
00:47:24,945 --> 00:47:27,581
Where are you now?
I'll be there right away.

598
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:31,251
Okay.

599
00:47:44,431 --> 00:47:45,532
Are you Indy?

600
00:47:47,767 --> 00:47:48,768
Yes.

601
00:47:49,236 --> 00:47:50,937
It's me. I asked to meet you.

602
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:56,109
I know you're looking for evidence
of the fire in the slums.

603
00:47:57,510 --> 00:48:00,280
You said you have something.

604
00:48:00,614 --> 00:48:01,781
Where did you find it?

605
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:06,319
I used to work for It.

606
00:48:07,787 --> 00:48:09,022
And I was there that night.

607
00:48:11,057 --> 00:48:13,560
I can't bear the guilt anymore.

608
00:48:15,262 --> 00:48:18,231
I had friends
who died in the fire too.

609
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:23,236
I never spoke out previously

610
00:48:23,536 --> 00:48:25,005
because I was still accepting
money from It.

611
00:48:26,506 --> 00:48:27,607
I was selfish.

612
00:48:29,342 --> 00:48:31,378
But I've finally realized

613
00:48:32,212 --> 00:48:34,481
it's time to do what's right.

614
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:41,855
This clip was taken
with a phone 15 years ago.

615
00:48:43,423 --> 00:48:44,457
It might be a little blurry.

616
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:49,129
But it's enough to show
what happened and who did it.

617
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:53,700
Hand it over!

618
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:55,602
Hey!

619
00:48:57,404 --> 00:48:58,905
Hurry up and run!
Don't worry about me!

620
00:49:32,305 --> 00:49:33,306
Yes, Indy?

621
00:49:37,777 --> 00:49:40,080
Ma, if something happens to me,

622
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:41,948
I want you to know
the person who did it is...

623
00:49:44,217 --> 00:49:45,218
Indy?

624
00:49:50,957 --> 00:49:52,759
Indy? What's going on?

625
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:17,851
You nearly failed.

626
00:50:22,122 --> 00:50:23,423
What about the double-crosser?

627
00:50:24,591 --> 00:50:25,759
He's been dealt with, sir.

628
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,671
Who do you work for?

629
00:50:40,073 --> 00:50:41,074
It's Treetep, isn't it?

630
00:50:49,749 --> 00:50:50,951
Who do you work for?

631
00:50:51,785 --> 00:50:53,219
Treetep, is it?

632
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:57,023
You're not going to answer?

633
00:50:58,258 --> 00:50:59,593
- Search him.
- Yes, sir.

634
00:51:06,232 --> 00:51:07,234
Found it.

635
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:14,074
So, can you tell me now...

636
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:18,178
who you work for?

637
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,081
Huh?

638
00:51:35,562 --> 00:51:36,563
Are you ready to talk?

639
00:51:38,231 --> 00:51:40,100
If not, you'll never talk again!

640
00:51:41,301 --> 00:51:42,602
Who do you work for?

641
00:51:44,404 --> 00:51:45,472
Who?

642
00:51:51,811 --> 00:51:53,446
- Beat him up.
- Yes, sir.

643
00:52:02,789 --> 00:52:03,857
Who do you work for?

644
00:52:35,922 --> 00:52:37,324
Who did this to you?

645
00:52:38,224 --> 00:52:39,593
If something happens to you,

646
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:40,994
I promise

647
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:42,762
those people are going to

648
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:44,998
pay with their lives.

649
00:52:45,665 --> 00:52:46,665
Why did you ask to see me?

650
00:52:46,666 --> 00:52:48,768
I want to tie up our loose ends.

651
00:52:48,935 --> 00:52:51,704
The person who sent him is
probably frantically trying

652
00:52:51,705 --> 00:52:53,173
to find out who did it.

653
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:56,176
Can't the poor
defeat the rich for once?

654
00:52:56,643 --> 00:52:58,545
Do I have to cower
under their feet forever?

655
00:52:59,012 --> 00:53:00,580
I'll never defeat them, will I?

656
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,149
Don't you want
to find out the truth?

657
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,218
The truth?
I'm going to tell everyone.

658
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:06,286
You!
