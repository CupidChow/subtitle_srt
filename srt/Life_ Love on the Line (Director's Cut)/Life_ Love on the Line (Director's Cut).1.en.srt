00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,770
If you go that direction, we can't meet!

177
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,420
I'm sorry.

178
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,110
I'm ashamed to look you in the face.

179
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,730
Don't screw around!

180
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:54,320
You! The other day, you...

181
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,190
He truly is mad after all.

182
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:03,280
But I'm happy just to see his face. I'm a horrible person!

183
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,130
The other day, you fell from the line. Right!?

184
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,520
That's what he's mad about!?

185
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:20,300
You definitely died right there! You were definitely skewered by those pointy ice things!

186
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,360
And you left me behind...

187
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:27,640
Don't stray from the line so selfishly!

188
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:32,150
Hey, you...

189
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,710
You don't understand the problem at all.

190
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,390
What's the problem?

191
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:41,220
I... um....

192
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,430
I look at you with a strange gaze.

193
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,600
And if I'm with you again, I might put you through another unpleasant memory.

194
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,660
That's not a problem at all!

195
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,420
The problem is... whether you want to meet me or not!

196
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,310
I want to meet you!

197
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,270
How about you?

198
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,830
- Huh? 
 - How about you!?

199
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,060
Me, too.

200
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,230
I want to meet you.

201
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:27,610
Then there's no problem.

202
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,380
There's no problem.

203
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,950
Right?

204
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,240
- But... 
 - But?

205
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:55,890
If possible, I want to walk at your side from here on out.

206
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,000
Then...

207
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,930
We need to think of a new setting.

208
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,820
Right!

209
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,210
The same setting for both of us.

210
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,130
What would be good? A desert or something?

211
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,830
A desert? When it comes to deserts, what comes to mind?

212
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:24,330
- Camels. 
 - That's good!

213
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:28,540
The two of us are riding camels. And... we fight monsters.

Sorry for the wait!

221
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:39,130
I'm sure it's the same as that feeling...

223
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,190
Sorry, really!

224
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:49,050
I waited so long that I'm starving!

225
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:52,180
- Do you want to go eat something? 
 - I was just thinking the same thing!

226
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,030
I was thinking of catching a really fat salmon in the Alaskan outdoors!

227
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:01,610
We would grill it on an open fire. And if we ate it while watching the aurora, it would be so delicious!

228
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:06,380
- Let's go together someday! 
 - I want to eat you.

229
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,260
For now, let's go to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant.

230
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,630
Salmon!

231
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,410
- Salmon! 
 - Salmon!

232
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,200
We both passed our entrance exams and are now university students.

233
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,080
- I'm going to repel you with a salmon roe battleship roll! 
 - Eat this, salmon roe cannon!

234
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,940
All right! Lucky!

235
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,410
University students have a lot of free time, so we contact and meet each other at any time.

236
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,090
- What period do you start tomorrow? 
 - I have first period.

237
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,160
- That's so tiring. 
 - What is it?

238
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,900
See you later.

239
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,120
Oh.

240
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:48,950
I'll see you.

241
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,830
The train is now departing. Please keep your distance.

242
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:02,800
The more we meet,

243
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,150

Sister! Long time no see!

246
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,220
Akira, I'm going to be going abroad for a while!

247
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,890
What!?

248
00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:30,560
Hitomi!

249
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,280
- That girl is always so selfish! 
 - Come on now!

250
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,910
I can't believe she would graduate from her university and not look for a job!

251
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,300
If she let's this opportunity as a new graduate pass by, it will be rough on her later!

252
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,740
- Akira, what about you? 
 - I'm going to look for a job and work normally, so don't worry.

253
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:51,300
- Would you like some dinner? 
 - Yeah.

254
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:14,080
When we kiss, he always has this troubled look on his face.

255
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,170
But it's not like he's rejecting me.

256
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,200
And I want to touch Nishi more.

257
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:30,300
I want to see all of his expressions that I've never seen before.

258
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,320
And his voices yet unheard.

259
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,330
What are you doing?

260
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,240
Hey!

261
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:58,200
Come on now! What are you going to do about job hunting?

262
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,590
I'm thinking of getting something nearby.

263
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,600
Are you just being considerate of our parents?

264
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,740
Huh? What do you mean?

265
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:10,560
I mean, are you living life honestly with yourself?

266
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,290
You've always been afraid of failure. Sometimes you act too cautiously!

267
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,480
But simulations are important, right?

268
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,850
Sometimes it's important to just dash forward! You're still young after all!

269
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:33,550
I'm someone with more imagination than most.

270
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:39,230
However, when I imagine things I always come to my senses and give up.

271
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:46,990
In order not to fail... It's too late if it comes to a point where you can't undo things.

272
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,930
- Nishi-kun, don't you often walk along lines? 
 - Yeah.

273
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:59,190
If I arrive there going like this, I have a feeling I can reach an incredible place.

274
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,780
You don't get it?

275
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:06,560
In any case, this white line will take me to a wonderful place!

276
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,940
- Nishi-kun, you're a little weird you know? 
 - I guess that's true!

277
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,890
Well then, I'll see you tomorrow.

278
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:18,150
- Sorry for the wait! 
 - It's okay.

279
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:20,180
Are you friends with that girl just now?

280
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,570
She's in the same lecture class as me.

281
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,380
I see. Shall we go?

282
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,980
Yeah.

283
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:40,220
I can't take this anymore! I'm tired of this report.

284
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,090
You have no concentration at all!

285
00:27:43,090 --> 00:27:44,830
Let's take a break!

286
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,760
- Hey! 
 - This feels so good!

287
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,920
You haven't even really progressed at all either!

288
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,900
What are you writing about anyway?

289
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,560
You have a lot of strange things written.

290
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:40,390
Hey! Stop, Itou! Hey!

291
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,990
Hey, stop it!

292
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:58,380
You can't cross this line! If you cross it, you will be electrocuted by one million volts of electricity!

293
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,420
Stuff like that is troubling for me!

294
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,390
Can't you see that I'm troubled by this?

295
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:10,800
So he really didn't like it after all.

296
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,180
You're always too selfish!

297
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,660
The other day, you came to me outside so suddenly...

298
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,670
I need to be mentally prepared for these things!

299
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:27,240
What?

300
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,520
Um... So it's not that you don't like it?

301
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,680
I don't like this sudden feeling at all!

302
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,710
I didn't mean that.

303
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,170
So basically,

304
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,500
you're fine with kissing?

305
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,580
Nishi...

306
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,800
Stay there! One million volts!

307
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,120
I always worried that you might come to hate me.

308
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,410
But when I see your face,

309
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,960
I can't hold myself back.

310
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:50,950
I want to move forward.

311
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,520
I want to go as far as possible as I can.

312
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,570
With you, Y-Yuki.

313
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,990
- If you're going to stutter, then stop. 
 - Huh?

314
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:10,600
Calling me by my first name.

315
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:14,420
Oh... sorry.

316
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:16,250
It's fine.

317
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,440
I told you, it's fine!

318
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,380
But...

319
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,770
if I cross this line,

320
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,930
I'll be electrocuted to death.

321
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,050
If you're not the one to come here and kiss me...

322
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:09,220
Don't move.

323
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,270
Don't look at me!

325
00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:51,540
Say it again.

327
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,700
I love you.

328
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,230
- You don't really have to send me off. 
 - Well...

329
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,960
I wanted to send you off!

330
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,220
Is your health all right?

331
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,550
Yeah.

332
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,380
Here is fine.

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,140

00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,160
Huh?

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,660
Yeah, it was.

- You're still saying that? 
 - Well, that's because...

00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:40,630
I'm going to visit some fellow alumni next week.

365
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:45,290
I don't know where I should start from, on these decisions.

Also, if your profession has any connections to them or not.

369

Why don't you think about it like that?

00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:00,760
That's a wake-up call...

Huh, why?

The things you say sound like an old man.

I can't take this anymore!

Oh!

All these formal suits are all the same, aren't they?

383
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,700
Just try it on!

384
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,990
It's important to get the right size!

- Right? 
 - That's correct!

- That's what's important? 
 - Yeah.

Is this fine?

388
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,500
That suits you quite well.

- What? 
 - Myself, as a working adult.

399
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,750
I have nothing I'm good at and nothing I want to do.

400
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,580
Everyone else has a goal they're running towards.

401
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,450
I'm the only one who's unsure.

402
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:10,810
I end up just following everyone else.

403
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,720
And if I just end up going somewhere because of that...

404
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,920
Would that be okay?

405
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:23,070
I really badly want to become a working adult.

406
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,580
I guess that...

00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,160
your sense is just worlds apart from mine.

408
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:32,420
If we become working adults, we can live together, can't we?

409
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,370
Then we can be together every day.

410

That's my goal.

411

 - No, I do.

 - Shut up!

We are just like those stars, every one of us.

I think we're just little dots that were forced into this world.

 - Yeah.

- I wonder if I dropped it somewhere while we were playing. 
 - Shall we search for it?

528
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,430
No, it will be hard to find in the sandy plains.

At that time, more so than when we first met, that mature smile

However, in the next moment...

559
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:56,910
I imagined a world without Yuki.

560

Didn't we want to go to a place like this long ago?

696
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:15,490
I know we're busy right now and really shouldn't be thinking about a trip, but...

It is said that it could take several days before you can see the aurora, after all.

Don't you think we'd still be pretty energetic when we're sixty years old?

702

We could cover the expenses by saving up little by little.

703

Why?

710
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,960
Do the two of us have a future?

711
01:09:27,110 --> 01:09:30,580
We're no longer of an age where youthful enthusiasm can accomplish anything.

712
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:38,290
You and I weren't necessarily into other guys in the first place, right?

713
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:45,320
When you think about your future, you would also like to normally get married and have a family, right?

714
01:09:48,170 --> 01:09:53,530
If we continue on with this fruitless relationship,

715
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,750
we'll surely regret it once we're forty or fifty years old.

716
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,930
To be attached to this relationship...

717

01:28:12,660 --> 01:28:18,050
You should learn from Akira! He went to a local university,

872
01:28:18,050 --> 01:28:22,180
got a job, and had a normal marriage. Right?

873

879
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:55,160
I've been frantically trying to live normally. I read people's faces in order to not stray from the norm.

880
01:28:55,160 --> 01:28:57,810

01:48:20,150 --> 01:48:27,100
♫ People lie  and people try to steal each others seat ♫

1051
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:30,940
♫ Sometimes while breathing ♫

1052
01:48:30,940 --> 01:48:34,970
♫ Sometimes we’re dreaming ♫

1053
01:48:34,970 --> 01:48:38,980
♫ Because we are creatures ♫

1054
01:48:38,980 --> 01:48:44,300
♫ Foolish believers ♫

1055
01:48:45,690 --> 01:48:53,120
♫ And I... And I... ♫

1056
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:57,640
♫ Will be the No. 1 ♫

1057
01:48:57,640 --> 01:49:01,690
♫ No. 1 tonight ♫

1058
01:49:01,690 --> 01:49:09,030
♫ Tonight... Tonight... ♫

1059
01:49:09,030 --> 01:49:13,480
♫ Will be the No. 1 ♫

1060
01:49:13,480 --> 01:49:17,450
♫ The No. 1 tonight ♫

1061
01:49:17,450 --> 01:49:24,940
♫ And I... And I... ♫

1062
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:29,370
♫ Will be the No. 1 ♫

1063
01:49:29,370 --> 01:49:34,650
♫ The No. 1 tonight ♫

[Life~Love on the Line (Director's Cut)]

1066
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:23,710
♫ Clouds of fog wander ♫

1067
01:50:23,710 --> 01:50:27,290
♫ Under the crescent moon ♫

1068
01:50:27,290 --> 01:50:33,330
♫ In the silence, the light gradually dawns ♫

1069
01:50:33,330 --> 01:50:37,630
♫ Upon the labyrinth of the only night ♫

1070
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:42,450
♫ The memory of the scene which a commotion 
started to break the silence ♫

1071
01:50:42,450 --> 01:50:46,510
♫ Is projected onto my eyes ♫

1072
01:50:46,510 --> 01:50:52,440
♫ Just eager to understand the meaning ♫

1073
01:50:52,440 --> 01:50:58,120
♫ Of that breath ♫

1074
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:01,770
♫ Only to helplessly process every day ♫

1075
01:51:01,770 --> 01:51:07,270
♫ That had passed in vain ♫

1076
01:51:07,270 --> 01:51:09,310
♫ Countless thoughts of wanting to escape from this cross my mind ♫

1077
01:51:09,310 --> 01:51:18,070
♫ As I self-loathe the chaos in my head that had been pried open ♫

1078
01:51:18,070 --> 01:51:24,440
♫ The sky is soaring high and solitary, 
the serene blue had inadvertently take my breath away ♫

1079
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:28,760
♫ With nowhere to go but to pursue the star trails ♫

1080
01:51:28,760 --> 01:51:33,460
♫ If a place with a downpour is where I return ♫

1081
01:51:33,460 --> 01:51:37,870
♫ Then nothing has changed at all since the past ♫

1082
01:51:37,870 --> 01:51:43,730
♫ It's too difficult to keep things as they were, 
and we always fear for those that are unbeknown to us ♫

1083
01:51:43,730 --> 01:51:52,940
♫ As if the moon is swaying, the flowing time that has passed, those drifting years that we spent ♫

1084
01:51:53,030 --> 01:51:57,870
♫ The fleeting reverberation somehow becomes lasting ♫

1085
01:51:57,870 --> 01:52:05,520
♫ There, this so-called reality is my imagination ♫
