1
00:00:47,237 --> 00:00:50,167
(The Auditors)

2
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:59,703
Why aren't you
coming to me to report?

3
00:01:02,173 --> 00:01:04,242
Haven't you heard
from the President?

4
00:01:04,243 --> 00:01:06,372
- She embezzled the business expenses...
- Never mind.

5
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:08,061
Listen to my decision.

6
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:10,852
Director Yoo will be transferred to
the branch in Florida as scheduled.

7
00:01:10,853 --> 00:01:13,822
Period.

8
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:17,092
Turning a blind eye to an embezzling
employee is the wrong decision.

9
00:01:17,093 --> 00:01:18,992
- Please reconsider it.
- No.

10
00:01:18,993 --> 00:01:22,663
I entered the company because the
full authority to audit is guaranteed.

11
00:01:23,663 --> 00:01:27,193
Please take my
opinion into account.

12
00:01:28,163 --> 00:01:31,102
It's annoying, right?
But you have no choice.

13
00:01:31,103 --> 00:01:36,703
The authority to audit you've
been relying on is now on me.

14
00:01:40,883 --> 00:01:42,642
- Mr. Han Soo.
- Yes.

15
00:01:42,643 --> 00:01:48,852
No matter what it takes, prevent
the director from going to the airport.

16
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:50,723
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:56,863
Shin Cha Il, you're fired.

18
00:02:19,053 --> 00:02:21,552
Hey. Get out of the way.

19
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:23,353
Get out of the way.

20
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,223
What is he doing?

21
00:02:28,763 --> 00:02:30,632
They're all crazy.

22
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:33,232
What are you doing?
Get out of the way.

23
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:38,433
You can't take the director to the
airport. The audit hasn't ended yet.

24
00:02:49,643 --> 00:02:55,182
(The Auditors)

25
00:02:55,183 --> 00:02:57,053
(Episode 4)

26
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:08,303
How did it go?

27
00:03:08,304 --> 00:03:13,902
Director Yoo voluntarily went to a
police station by getting in Shin's car.

28
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:18,943
She told me to report it to you
because you would know what's going on.

29
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:38,064
I fired Shin Cha Il.

30
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:40,832
He ignored the order from
his immediate superior.

31
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:46,202
Write a pink slip. I'll
throw that to his face.

32
00:03:46,203 --> 00:03:50,773
I just gave you the authority to
audit. I didn't tell you to fire him.

33
00:03:51,473 --> 00:03:53,742
Are you kidding me?

34
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,962
I warned you that the
construction could be stopped.

35
00:03:56,963 --> 00:03:58,482
It can lead you to be
kicked out of your place.

36
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:01,452
I know you won't let the
construction be stopped.

37
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:03,276
It's a contract you won
after making a huge effort.

38
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,622
Will you just stand by and
watch as it gets stopped?

39
00:04:05,623 --> 00:04:08,123
You don't do anything that
might hurt your reputation.

40
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:12,271
You still have the authority to
audit the Director Yoo. Good luck.

41
00:04:12,272 --> 00:04:16,702
With the disobeying team
leader I won't get anything.

42
00:04:16,703 --> 00:04:18,933
What are you up to?

43
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:31,313
I'm sorry, but I
have other plans.

44
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:58,076
How did it go?

45
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,012
Mr. Shin took the
director to a police station.

46
00:05:01,013 --> 00:05:02,612
I heard the Vice President
tell him to leave her alone.

47
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:04,233
How could he let her go free?

48
00:05:04,234 --> 00:05:05,452
We should arrest her because
she embezzled the money.

49
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:08,955
No matter what she did, an office
worker should do what they are told.

50
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:11,122
Mr. Shin caused the trouble.

51
00:05:11,123 --> 00:05:13,822
It's not a problem. If we
can find the money, it's okay.

52
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:17,462
She will be sentenced to 4 years at maximum
considering the amount of 3.4 billion.

53
00:05:17,463 --> 00:05:19,886
She won't be bothered to stay in prison
because she can earn one billion a year.

54
00:05:19,887 --> 00:05:21,232
I bet she won't return
the embezzled money.

55
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:23,232
He'll find the money.

56
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,071
He'll definitely find the money.

57
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:29,428
You go out and help
him find the money.

58
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,543
You're talking nonsense.

59
00:05:32,073 --> 00:05:33,773
You worked hard.

60
00:05:37,613 --> 00:05:40,922
How was your new team
leader? Isn't he bothering you?

61
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,952
The president hired him to
kick me out of the company.

62
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:48,762
There was no
one I could rely on.

63
00:05:48,763 --> 00:05:50,843
I feel safe when you
are at the same company.

64
00:05:50,844 --> 00:05:52,892
That money is the insurance I received
from the car accident Min Seok's dad had.

65
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:56,433
How can my grandchildren
survive if I die?

66
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:11,113
I'm going to the police office
and won't confront you anymore.

67
00:06:11,883 --> 00:06:13,683
I can board a flight tomorrow.

68
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:19,222
The investigation will be resumed
based on the union president's statement.

69
00:06:19,223 --> 00:06:22,192
You'll be banned from
leaving the country.

70
00:06:22,193 --> 00:06:26,132
The company will be on
my side. And you'll be fired.

71
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,932
I don't care.

72
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:29,802
Why on earth are
you doing this to me?

73
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,303
Because you embezzled.

74
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:35,802
I guess Kang Myeong Cheol plans to
go to America when things settle down.

75
00:06:35,803 --> 00:06:38,412
In the meantime, he would
do his best to hide the money.

76
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:41,512
What kind of life did you
dream of with 3.4 billion won?

77
00:06:41,513 --> 00:06:45,444
You might've dreamed of a luxury house
with a pool raising a dog in a garden,

78
00:06:45,445 --> 00:06:48,282
designer clothes,
and fancy food.

79
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:51,122
But you'll be confined in
a bar watched by a dog

80
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:54,662
and receive food while
wearing a prison uniform.

81
00:06:54,663 --> 00:07:00,963
I'll definitely punish you.

82
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,412
Office workers shouldn't skip a
meal. I guess Mr. Shin would be late.

83
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:52,052
We should eat
to rack our brains.

84
00:07:52,053 --> 00:07:53,882
Let's have lunch.

85
00:07:53,883 --> 00:07:57,323
- Let's eat lunch to get energized.
- Today's lunch menu is Hot Pot Bulgogi.

86
00:07:58,093 --> 00:08:01,893
The meat isn't from domestic
farmers. But it's super expensive.

87
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,402
Why aren't you eating lunch?

88
00:08:09,403 --> 00:08:10,703
I don't feel like having lunch.

89
00:08:15,573 --> 00:08:19,043
I think we can find the money
through cross-examination.

90
00:08:20,683 --> 00:08:22,413
I just have no appetite.

91
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:40,163
We just warned to audit.
It gets my appetite back.

92
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:43,732
The team leader
must be fired this time.

93
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:47,902
I've never seen a person who survived
after disobeying the Vice President.

94
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,642
Do you hate him that much?

95
00:08:49,643 --> 00:08:52,342
Of course. He's screwing the
Audit Team at his own authority.

96
00:08:52,343 --> 00:08:56,442
How can I like him?

97
00:08:56,443 --> 00:08:59,058
Look around.

98
00:08:59,059 --> 00:09:01,952
They don't even eat near us.

99
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:03,482
It's hard to find a
department I didn't audit.

100
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:06,222
I have no place to go because
I have too many enemies.

101
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:09,323
Auditing is to correct wrong things. I
don't understand why it makes an enemy.

102
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:11,789
You're so frustrating.

103
00:09:12,763 --> 00:09:15,928
That's why we call a
worker like you a rookie.

104
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,632
You really don't know anything.

105
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:24,512
I think seeing an auditor
as their enemy is wrong.

106
00:09:24,513 --> 00:09:27,172
I'm finished. Enjoy your meal.

107
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:30,329
You're my enemy. It's you.

108
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:32,782
He learned how to talk back.

109
00:09:32,783 --> 00:09:34,607
Even he…

110
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:37,352
You put down your hair.

111
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:39,622
It suits you well. I'm jealous
because I have little hair.

112
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:43,723
The hierarchy at the
company is a mess.

113
00:09:45,033 --> 00:09:47,732
It's chaotic.

114
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:51,202
How dare a low-level
employee block me?

115
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:54,242
And the leader of the Audit Team
is trying to throw me out the window.

116
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:56,703
- He shoots a laser from his eyes...
- Shut up.

117
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:05,953
It's me, Lawyer.

118
00:10:12,523 --> 00:10:16,622
The union president stated
that he committed it alone.

119
00:10:16,623 --> 00:10:19,732
What a shame I won't
get punished by you.

120
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:22,502
I have no business
with you anymore.

121
00:10:22,503 --> 00:10:26,873
You're idealistic like
you were in the past.

122
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,292
This is Shin Cha Il.

123
00:10:51,293 --> 00:10:53,692
Why are you hustling
around? I said you're fired.

124
00:10:53,693 --> 00:10:56,163
You should follow a dismissal
procedure in written form.

125
00:10:57,703 --> 00:10:58,932
What are you going to do now?

126
00:10:58,933 --> 00:11:02,261
You made the employee's embezzlement
a lone crime by the union president.

127
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:04,112
You're the target of auditing.

128
00:11:04,113 --> 00:11:05,212
Did I?

129
00:11:05,213 --> 00:11:07,293
You sent the lawyer to the union
president to make a secret deal.

130
00:11:07,294 --> 00:11:08,912
A reduced punishment
and good money.

131
00:11:08,913 --> 00:11:10,542
You have a sixth sense.

132
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,653
I'm sad you're not on my side.

133
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:16,962
Please cancel the order
to transfer the Director Yoo.

134
00:11:16,963 --> 00:11:19,652
And tell the union president
to make a correct statement.

135
00:11:19,653 --> 00:11:22,792
Then, you can undo your
mistake and won't get audited.

136
00:11:22,793 --> 00:11:24,392
It's a ridiculous threat.

137
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:26,862
The company must carry the
can for what employees did.

138
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:30,209
It's easy to say that
because it's not your money.

139
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:33,072
I do nothing to lose my money.

140
00:11:33,073 --> 00:11:35,317
You can benefit a lot
from retrieving the money

141
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:37,242
and returning it to
the union members.

142
00:11:37,243 --> 00:11:40,242
You can have a good brand image and
employee's improved loyalty to the company.

143
00:11:40,243 --> 00:11:43,513
What if you don't retrieve the
money? Will you take the fall for it?

144
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:58,363
I will. I'm going to
submit my resignation.

145
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:02,903
Is your resignation
worth 3.4 billion?

146
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:09,702
You should suggest
a trade that fits the bill.

147
00:12:09,703 --> 00:12:13,612
Submit your resignation and
stand surety for the money.

148
00:12:13,613 --> 00:12:16,843
You should pay back the
money. What do you think?

149
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:19,313
I see.

150
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:22,782
I am canceling the order
to transfer the director now.

151
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,122
You make the union
president state again.

152
00:12:25,123 --> 00:12:26,592
You only have three days.

153
00:12:26,593 --> 00:12:28,562
If you don't find the money,

154
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:34,063
the director will fly to the US and
you should pay back 3.4 billion.

155
00:12:54,223 --> 00:12:56,222
This is Goo Han Soo.

156
00:12:56,223 --> 00:13:00,452
The union president stated
that he committed it alone.

157
00:13:00,453 --> 00:13:03,214
The Director Yoo won't
take any action for three days.

158
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,812
I'll figure out what Kang
Myeong Cheol is planning on.

159
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:08,901
You explain how it's going
on to the team members.

160
00:13:08,902 --> 00:13:10,989
Yes, sir.

161
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:29,422
You should recover strength.

162
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:32,303
The union president stated
that he committed it alone.

163
00:13:32,304 --> 00:13:35,792
We have no choice but to
find the money ourselves.

164
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:39,362
Did the Vice President make him…

165
00:13:39,363 --> 00:13:40,993
Yes.

166
00:13:42,563 --> 00:13:44,263
Please enjoy it.

167
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:02,883
Audit exists for
ethical management.

168
00:14:03,953 --> 00:14:05,520
Ethical management
is a topic that

169
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,623
companies should deal
with in modern society.

170
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:19,071
The do's and don'ts
I've talked about

171
00:14:19,072 --> 00:14:22,242
are a promise you should
keep as an intellectual.

172
00:14:22,243 --> 00:14:26,012
Everyone. Be a
passionate employee.

173
00:14:26,013 --> 00:14:27,883
I'll wrap it up. Thank
you for listening.

174
00:14:41,963 --> 00:14:45,524
How dare a molester visit the
office of the victim's husband?

175
00:14:45,525 --> 00:14:46,662
I should report
it to the police.

176
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:48,963
Director Yoo's
transfer is canceled.

177
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,672
It's a matter of time to
reveal you're an accomplice.

178
00:14:55,673 --> 00:14:57,303
You're blackmailing me.

179
00:14:58,573 --> 00:14:59,842
You're crossing the line.

180
00:14:59,843 --> 00:15:01,512
If you quit your job,
you'll fall under suspicion.

181
00:15:01,513 --> 00:15:03,912
If you use the money, the
police will track the funds.

182
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,583
You're in trouble.

183
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:13,022
Why are you worrying me?

184
00:15:13,023 --> 00:15:15,463
Pull yourself, Mr. Shin.

185
00:15:16,663 --> 00:15:18,171
How could you, as
an Audit Team leader

186
00:15:18,195 --> 00:15:20,143
who gives lectures about
company rules and ethics

187
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,032
embezzle money?

188
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:24,103
Embezzlement?

189
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:30,373
There's dust on your shoulder.

190
00:15:53,393 --> 00:15:57,802
Don't put on a mask.
Why are you long-faced?

191
00:15:57,803 --> 00:15:59,773
I know you're excited.

192
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:02,173
Take a seat.

193
00:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,373
Your transfer is canceled.

194
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:11,982
- What?
- I gave Shin Cha Il three days.

195
00:16:11,983 --> 00:16:14,746
Don't make any
trouble for three days.

196
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,879
Where is the money?

197
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,393
Make sure no one
finds it. Risk your life.

198
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,163
Off you go.

199
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:50,315
I heard the police
could trace the funds

200
00:16:50,316 --> 00:16:52,792
because the government issued
and sealed all the 50,000 won bills.

201
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:54,562
Do I look like an idiot?

202
00:16:54,563 --> 00:16:59,433
How could I imagine
taking all the money alone?

203
00:17:04,873 --> 00:17:06,272
Mr. Shin.

204
00:17:06,273 --> 00:17:07,273
Let's have a meeting.

205
00:17:16,683 --> 00:17:19,482
Kang Myeong Cheol
will do money laundering.

206
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:23,916
The government issued
and sealed all the money.

207
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,723
He can't use it
unless he launders it.

208
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:30,892
I heard the union president confess
that he committed it alone. Right?

209
00:17:30,893 --> 00:17:33,331
I don't understand why
we should find the money.

210
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:35,963
Plus, the Vice President
ordered us not to, right?

211
00:17:36,933 --> 00:17:40,926
We should find out
how he'll launder.

212
00:17:40,927 --> 00:17:42,594
There are many ways.

213
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:45,872
He can utilize Bitcoin or go
through a gambling website.

214
00:17:45,873 --> 00:17:47,366
I don't think so.

215
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:50,682
That could leave a trace. And
he should pay a huge commission.

216
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:54,883
Kang Myeong Cheol isn't that
simple-minded and ignorant.

217
00:17:56,523 --> 00:17:58,323
Seo Jin, what do you think?

218
00:17:59,923 --> 00:18:04,392
I don't know if it's right
to continue auditing

219
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:07,792
as disobeying a superior's
order as an office worker.

220
00:18:07,793 --> 00:18:11,373
Right. We're on the same page.

221
00:18:17,073 --> 00:18:20,525
As the team leader, I'll
take full responsibility.

222
00:18:20,526 --> 00:18:22,342
I'll investigate
Kang Myeong Cheol.

223
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:25,582
You investigate The Myeong if
there's something significant or unusual.

224
00:18:25,583 --> 00:18:28,974
We should find evidence
of money laundering.

225
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,353
Let's wrap it up.

226
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:42,933
Ms. Seo Jin, we should give
the money back to the old man.

227
00:19:22,873 --> 00:19:27,642
Shin Cha Il will submit his
resignation after three days

228
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:29,813
and should pay
back 3.4 billion won.

229
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:34,853
Do whatever you want.

230
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:38,877
What's the catch?

231
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:42,193
I was suspicious of you when you gave
me the authority to audit Director Yoo.

232
00:19:43,823 --> 00:19:46,562
I forgot to guess your intention
because I focused on Shin Cha Il.

233
00:19:46,563 --> 00:19:48,300
You can prevent
the company's loss

234
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:50,432
and get the resignation from the
Audit Team leader as you wish.

235
00:19:50,433 --> 00:19:53,332
That's all. There's
nothing more.

236
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,343
I'm sure you're up to something.

237
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:04,753
Won't you get out?

238
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:19,684
Oh, no.

239
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:22,933
How can we find another
company's specific details?

240
00:20:24,133 --> 00:20:25,872
Do you keep doing
this kind of work?

241
00:20:25,873 --> 00:20:28,302
Of course. It's an order
from the team leader.

242
00:20:28,303 --> 00:20:31,372
You're right. The team leader
is the king of the Audit Team.

243
00:20:31,373 --> 00:20:33,472
What are you talking about?

244
00:20:33,473 --> 00:20:34,783
Go and make some coffee for me.

245
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:49,362
(The Myeong Construction is building
an apartment in the Dongseo district.)

246
00:20:49,363 --> 00:20:50,793
(Let's visit there together.)

247
00:20:53,863 --> 00:20:56,233
(Visiting a construction
site is an overreaction.)

248
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:11,712
(The vice president
has threatened you?)

249
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:13,352
(I know how you feel because
he threatened me before.)

250
00:21:13,353 --> 00:21:16,034
(Let's figure this
out together.)

251
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,155
(Shall we go to the Ministry
of Employment and Labor?)

252
00:21:20,423 --> 00:21:22,723
(Let's go to the
construction site.)

253
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,911
I can't believe
Kang Myeong Cheol

254
00:21:38,912 --> 00:21:41,306
as an Audit Team leader,
embezzled the money.

255
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,982
I'm getting
frightened of a human.

256
00:21:44,983 --> 00:21:47,231
Don't trust people.

257
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,583
Then, your heart won't get hurt.

258
00:21:51,023 --> 00:21:54,023
I don't like to
live a life like that.

259
00:21:54,923 --> 00:21:58,243
Have you heard what the team leader
would do if we didn't find the money?

260
00:21:58,244 --> 00:22:00,092
Does he have any plans?

261
00:22:00,093 --> 00:22:03,802
Why are you worrying
about that? Don't worry.

262
00:22:03,803 --> 00:22:05,573
I'm sure we can find the money.

263
00:22:14,373 --> 00:22:16,443
Hello. May I ask you something?

264
00:22:20,483 --> 00:22:22,882
Hello. May I ask you something?

265
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,552
Hasn't something
changed recently?

266
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,252
What are you talking
about? I'm busy.

267
00:22:26,253 --> 00:22:28,263
- If you can think of anything...
- I'm busy.

268
00:22:32,493 --> 00:22:34,192
Hello.

269
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:36,663
Hasn't something
changed about working?

270
00:22:38,063 --> 00:22:41,680
They provide noodles as a meal.

271
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:43,342
They used to give
us bread and milk.

272
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:46,191
We don't need to go to a
restaurant so we can rest.

273
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:47,373
It's improved.

274
00:22:48,443 --> 00:22:49,513
Anything else?

275
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:52,153
Is there something more?

276
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:12,903
I live in a sad world.

277
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:15,073
What?

278
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:17,469
People are cold-hearted.

279
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,712
We should read other's
minds to eat something.

280
00:23:20,713 --> 00:23:23,034
If I buy this time,
you buy next time.

281
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,612
I think there's no problem.
What do you think?

282
00:23:24,613 --> 00:23:26,512
You're right.

283
00:23:26,513 --> 00:23:32,122
I think our jobs are the same.

284
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:35,173
We should be of
one mind to work well.

285
00:23:35,174 --> 00:23:37,792
How can we be of one mind
when there's no chance to be close?

286
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:41,432
I'm also frustrated.

287
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,962
Let's relieve our frustration.

288
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,032
Shall we be close?

289
00:23:46,033 --> 00:23:47,903
I know we're of one mind.

290
00:24:34,923 --> 00:24:36,852
What are you doing?

291
00:24:36,853 --> 00:24:38,622
Do you want to piece of me?

292
00:24:38,623 --> 00:24:39,993
If you don't, just leave.

293
00:24:46,393 --> 00:24:48,662
Where did you hide the money?

294
00:24:48,663 --> 00:24:49,663
What?

295
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,102
I guess you didn't hide it at
home due to a seizure and search.

296
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:56,472
You also didn't entrust it to someone
else because you deceived someone.

297
00:24:56,473 --> 00:24:58,943
I guess you've hidden it
within an area of activity.

298
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:05,853
You've committed molestation and
blackmail. Now you're slandering me.

299
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:10,753
Sir. There's a call.

300
00:25:13,493 --> 00:25:17,095
Mr. Shin, if you show
up in front of me again,

301
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,663
I won't tolerate it.

302
00:25:33,973 --> 00:25:36,582
The Myeong carried out
a restructuring last year.

303
00:25:36,583 --> 00:25:40,212
As a result, the number of the
Audit Team was reduced to 3 from 7.

304
00:25:40,213 --> 00:25:44,282
There's a rumor that it can be
delisted due to poor financial conditions.

305
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:46,793
It could make him unstable.

306
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:51,592
You did a good job.

307
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,732
I have high-level information.

308
00:25:53,733 --> 00:25:56,332
Rumor says he went bankrupt
after his stock price lost its value.

309
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:58,032
That's why he was divorced.

310
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:01,026
It's not a fictitious divorce.

311
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:03,272
I have reasonable doubts

312
00:26:03,273 --> 00:26:04,572
that we're just
biting the dust...

313
00:26:04,573 --> 00:26:06,213
That's a motive of embezzlement.

314
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:14,412
I went to The Myeong's
construction site.

315
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:15,860
The unusual thing I noticed is

316
00:26:15,861 --> 00:26:18,552
that they provide noodles
instead of bread and milk.

317
00:26:18,553 --> 00:26:20,472
Plus, they used to
pay daily wages in cash

318
00:26:20,473 --> 00:26:23,362
but now pay through
an account transfer.

319
00:26:23,363 --> 00:26:25,932
That's all I've
found out. I'm sorry.

320
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:28,902
Did they pay laborers
daily wages in cash?

321
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:30,102
Yes.

322
00:26:30,103 --> 00:26:31,162
It's weird.

323
00:26:31,163 --> 00:26:34,766
Companies pay daily wages
through an account transfer

324
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,772
because of four social
insurance and tax issues.

325
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:39,673
When did they pay in cash?

326
00:26:40,913 --> 00:26:43,212
It was early January. They
paid in cash for only 5 days.

327
00:26:43,213 --> 00:26:46,712
I heard the construction
site was popular at that time.

328
00:26:46,713 --> 00:26:48,422
Many laborers were gathered.

329
00:26:48,423 --> 00:26:52,292
Of course. They didn't need to
pay taxes if they were paid in cash.

330
00:26:52,293 --> 00:26:55,823
Search the names, genders, and ages of
The Myeong's Finance Director and Chief.

331
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:59,591
The director is Kim Chang
Geol, a 51-year-old male.

332
00:26:59,592 --> 00:27:02,132
The chief is Son Won
Seok, a 39-year-old male.

333
00:27:02,133 --> 00:27:04,586
Another chief is Lee Yeon
Ji, a 37-year-old female.

334
00:27:04,587 --> 00:27:05,833
An employee Lee Yoon Jae…

335
00:27:12,443 --> 00:27:17,412
Kang Myeong Cheol tested
money laundering by paying wages.

336
00:27:17,413 --> 00:27:21,352
Aren't you jumping
to conclusions?

337
00:27:21,353 --> 00:27:25,392
The Finance Chief Lee
Yeon Ji called him late at night.

338
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:26,822
Late at night?

339
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:28,160
They're in a
different department.

340
00:27:28,161 --> 00:27:31,832
Why did she call
him late at night?

341
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,432
What if we assume
they're accomplices?

342
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,562
I think a finance chief can
help with money laundering.

343
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:37,396
- Right?
- Yes.

344
00:27:37,397 --> 00:27:40,202
You've watched so many dramas.

345
00:27:40,203 --> 00:27:45,142
Kang Myeong Cheol must've
delivered the wages to Lee Yeon Ji.

346
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,173
- It's not a difficult thing.
- I know.

347
00:27:52,683 --> 00:27:56,953
I guess she exchanged the wages for
the money withdrawn from The Myeong.

348
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:01,285
In that way the embezzled
money was distributed

349
00:28:01,286 --> 00:28:03,763
to laborers by the
construction site staff.

350
00:28:05,693 --> 00:28:11,003
Then, it was impossible to trace
the money because it was dispersed.

351
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:18,073
She completed the work after sending the
money withdrawn from the company to him.

352
00:28:19,673 --> 00:28:24,112
The union president withdrew 3.4
billion won on December 27th last year.

353
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:27,572
Kang Myeong Cheol stole that money on the
same day at the union president's house.

354
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:31,222
If the wages were paid early in
January, it's a valid assumption.

355
00:28:31,223 --> 00:28:34,261
We can assume he
stopped money laundering

356
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:37,323
because he felt risky
when the rumor spread.

357
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:42,102
He must've tried money
laundering more after the testing.

358
00:28:42,103 --> 00:28:43,902
We need to investigate it.

359
00:28:43,903 --> 00:28:46,102
- Mr. Goo Han Soo.
- Yes.

360
00:28:46,103 --> 00:28:49,102
Search their SNSs.

361
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,772
There must be something special
between them to plan things like this.

362
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:53,842
Yes, sir.

363
00:28:53,843 --> 00:28:55,912
I'll let you know
their phone numbers.

364
00:28:55,913 --> 00:28:57,283
Yes. Thank you.

365
00:29:17,003 --> 00:29:19,003
I have high-level information.

366
00:29:20,103 --> 00:29:22,447
- High-level information?
- Yes.

367
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:24,203
If it's not this time…

368
00:29:31,683 --> 00:29:35,182
It seems like Shin Cha Il found
out a clue about money laundering.

369
00:29:35,183 --> 00:29:37,255
No. He must've found it out.

370
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:40,522
Fortunately, he hasn't
found the money yet.

371
00:29:40,523 --> 00:29:43,196
As you know, we can't
expect what will happen

372
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,892
because human-related
things are complex...

373
00:29:45,893 --> 00:29:47,063
Bring him to me.

374
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,513
Jeju island in August.

375
00:30:13,893 --> 00:30:15,013
This picture looks familiar.

376
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,662
Why didn't you
report anything yet?

377
00:30:53,663 --> 00:30:57,202
I'll report the result collectively
when the auditing is done.

378
00:30:57,203 --> 00:30:59,632
I knew you wouldn't stand back.

379
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,943
Do you know why I hate you?

380
00:31:03,103 --> 00:31:05,373
I'll tell you why.
Listen carefully.

381
00:31:06,213 --> 00:31:10,661
When I was young, I
liked playing with earth.

382
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:13,713
One day, a swarm
of ants interrupted me.

383
00:31:15,553 --> 00:31:18,023
I was thinking

384
00:31:18,923 --> 00:31:20,822
which one I would
squash by treading on it.

385
00:31:20,823 --> 00:31:23,648
At that moment,

386
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:29,203
one deviated from a line with
food much bigger than its body.

387
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:36,403
You're like that one.

388
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:40,842
Isolated hero,
egotistical person.

389
00:31:40,843 --> 00:31:43,154
And what is it?

390
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:45,412
Yeah, Don Quixote.

391
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:47,752
These are the
types I hate the most.

392
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:52,752
Isn't following the
company's rules normal?

393
00:31:52,753 --> 00:31:56,192
Why do you say 'No' when
everyone else says 'Yes.'?

394
00:31:56,193 --> 00:31:59,433
This is Shin Cha
Il. Ok, I got it.

395
00:32:01,163 --> 00:32:03,633
If you're done talking,
I'm leaving now.

396
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:11,173
I'll stomp on you to death.

397
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:20,913
If you look at this, it's like a picture
they took at a hotel on Jeju Island.

398
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:25,483
Judging from it, I
think they're a couple.

399
00:32:25,484 --> 00:32:26,893
What do you think about it?

400
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:32,833
I need absolute
evidence. Tail her.

401
00:32:34,333 --> 00:32:35,633
Yes, sir.

402
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:56,452
You shouldn't
come to me like this.

403
00:32:56,453 --> 00:32:59,023
How well do you know
Kang Myeong Cheol?

404
00:32:59,953 --> 00:33:01,993
I've had enough.

405
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:05,063
Do you know he has a girlfriend?

406
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,212
He must've explained
the escape plan to you.

407
00:33:19,213 --> 00:33:22,151
It must be like someone in
the finance department can help.

408
00:33:22,152 --> 00:33:24,413
It was possible because he
was having an affair with her.

409
00:33:25,413 --> 00:33:27,112
How can you be so
sure with this picture?

410
00:33:27,113 --> 00:33:31,852
He must've escaped with her if you
would transfer to the branch in Florida.

411
00:33:31,853 --> 00:33:36,623
Tell me where the money is
before you become more miserable.

412
00:33:39,363 --> 00:33:41,963
I can't believe how
much you've changed.

413
00:33:59,283 --> 00:34:01,753
I can't believe how
much you've changed.

414
00:35:01,943 --> 00:35:04,542
Why is she driving
so far on a weekday?

415
00:35:04,543 --> 00:35:07,082
Is she going to meet
Kang Myeong Cheol?

416
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:08,783
She might be going
to where the money is.

417
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:11,653
It's Mr. Shin.

418
00:35:13,053 --> 00:35:14,552
This is Yoon Seo Jin.

419
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:15,963
Isn't there a car tailing you?

420
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,232
I don't think there is.

421
00:35:20,233 --> 00:35:23,726
A dump truck threatened
me a moment ago.

422
00:35:23,727 --> 00:35:26,873
Be careful that you
might be dangerous.

423
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:30,462
A dump truck
threatened Mr. Shin.

424
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:31,576
We'd better be cautious.

425
00:35:31,577 --> 00:35:34,134
- Is he okay?
- I think he is.

426
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:56,947
Isn't that truck
threatening Mr. Shin?

427
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:59,872
- You finished the work well, right?
- Yes, we did.

428
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:01,553
It was Kang Myeong
Cheol who abetted them.

429
00:36:04,303 --> 00:36:05,303
What are you going to do?

430
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:07,212
I'll take a proof picture.

431
00:36:07,213 --> 00:36:08,843
Did you set it on mute?

432
00:36:14,113 --> 00:36:15,113
What should we do?

433
00:36:15,114 --> 00:36:18,028
Wait. I think I heard a sound.

434
00:36:18,029 --> 00:36:19,993
- Please wait a minute.
- Where are you going?

435
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:22,793
I'm sorry. Wait
a minute, please.

436
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:25,633
Let's go back to our car.

437
00:36:41,973 --> 00:36:44,113
I'm sure I heard some sounds.

438
00:37:15,513 --> 00:37:18,008
What are you doing? Is
there something there?

439
00:37:18,009 --> 00:37:21,371
Drivers are making
a fuss. Let's go.

440
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:22,709
Okay. Let's go.

441
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:38,403
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

442
00:37:43,643 --> 00:37:46,013
Look over there.
Tail them quickly.

443
00:38:13,503 --> 00:38:14,503
It's me.

444
00:38:16,873 --> 00:38:18,472
What were you doing?

445
00:38:18,473 --> 00:38:19,712
I'm going to have dinner.

446
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:22,613
You haven't eaten yet?
You must be hungry.

447
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:26,713
What's this sound?

448
00:38:28,413 --> 00:38:29,823
It's the sound from the TV.

449
00:38:30,983 --> 00:38:33,552
As you said,
Mr. Shin came to me.

450
00:38:33,553 --> 00:38:36,762
I'm sorry, but there's a
call from the company.

451
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:39,022
Okay. I'll hang up now.

452
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:42,092
And hang in there.

453
00:38:42,093 --> 00:38:44,682
We can use the money when
there's no problem on paper.

454
00:38:44,683 --> 00:38:48,202
If things are done, let's go
on a trip together. All right?

455
00:38:48,203 --> 00:38:49,203
All right.

456
00:39:02,823 --> 00:39:05,722
Hey. Are you done?

457
00:39:05,723 --> 00:39:07,084
Did you make a noise on purpose?

458
00:39:07,085 --> 00:39:10,434
There was no choice because
I got a call from my husband.

459
00:39:10,435 --> 00:39:11,875
Do you want me to
turn my phone off?

460
00:39:43,663 --> 00:39:45,193
Are you okay?

461
00:39:47,163 --> 00:39:48,333
Here it is.

462
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:52,933
Director Yoo must be
changing her mind, right?

463
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:17,263
Director Yoo must be
changing her mind, right?

464
00:40:24,663 --> 00:40:26,433
Aren't you in bed yet?

465
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,673
Have you eaten?

466
00:40:52,023 --> 00:40:53,562
Are you ready to
submit your resignation?

467
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:56,762
I've already prepared a
certification of 3.4 billion won.

468
00:40:56,763 --> 00:40:58,432
I still have time.

469
00:40:58,433 --> 00:41:00,803
Yeah? Good luck.

470
00:41:07,273 --> 00:41:11,782
Stay one night here. Then,
everything will be done.

471
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:14,213
- Give me your phone.
- What?

472
00:41:35,503 --> 00:41:39,743
Sir, Yoo Mi Kyung's
phone has been turned off.

473
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:53,723
Keep on working.

474
00:41:55,153 --> 00:41:56,763
Sir.

475
00:41:58,593 --> 00:42:00,992
Where is Director Yoo now?

476
00:42:00,993 --> 00:42:02,962
She disappeared
at a critical moment.

477
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:06,902
I think Mr. Shin is ready to disappear
because he couldn't find the money.

478
00:42:06,903 --> 00:42:08,532
He's not that kind of guy.

479
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:11,672
How do you know that?
You can't do anything right.

480
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:14,243
You've gotten
better at talking back.

481
00:43:34,993 --> 00:43:37,422
Kang Myeong Cheol
will be arrested soon.

482
00:43:37,423 --> 00:43:41,053
He must be shifting
the responsibility to you.

483
00:43:41,054 --> 00:43:43,285
If you cooperate with us,

484
00:43:43,286 --> 00:43:46,394
you can avoid actual punishment
because of the extenuation.

485
00:43:55,713 --> 00:44:01,153
The pamphlet the union
president made has your dream.

486
00:44:06,823 --> 00:44:09,052
I just want to
live a fairytale life.

487
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:13,392
I want to build a
fairytale village and house

488
00:44:13,393 --> 00:44:15,263
and meet a
prince in a fairytale.

489
00:44:19,333 --> 00:44:23,667
You, in my memories of college

490
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,451
were honest and confident.

491
00:44:28,264 --> 00:44:29,983
And you had many dreams.

492
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,353
Why did you change so much?

493
00:44:48,363 --> 00:44:50,962
I found Director Yoo.

494
00:44:50,963 --> 00:44:52,683
- Mr. Shin found her.
- Really?

495
00:44:52,684 --> 00:44:54,133
All of us will listen to you.

496
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:58,802
Kang Myeong Cheol did money laundering
and manipulated sources of the money

497
00:44:58,803 --> 00:45:01,212
by buying and reselling
construction vehicles.

498
00:45:01,213 --> 00:45:03,927
We should find the office
and secure a business license,

499
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:06,552
sale agreement, and distribution
agreement as evidence.

500
00:45:06,553 --> 00:45:08,138
The name of the
company is MA Distribution.

501
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:11,752
The address is 20 Dongseo-go
No. 501 Naseok building.

502
00:45:11,753 --> 00:45:13,492
What nerve he's got!

503
00:45:13,493 --> 00:45:15,552
He used offices
as a place of crime.

504
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:18,262
What a relief that Director
Yoo changed her mind.

505
00:45:18,263 --> 00:45:21,262
How can we trust her?
She tells lies habitually.

506
00:45:21,263 --> 00:45:24,521
I won't report her to the
police until I get evidence.

507
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:28,432
If it's a lie, I'll use her
again to think another way.

508
00:45:28,433 --> 00:45:29,742
What about the money?

509
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:31,628
She just knew that Kang
Myeong Choel still had the money

510
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:34,242
because the manipulation of
the sources of funds hadn't ended.

511
00:45:34,243 --> 00:45:36,782
I'll find the money by chasing
after Kang Myeong Choel.

512
00:45:36,783 --> 00:45:39,552
How will you make
him take action?

513
00:45:39,553 --> 00:45:43,583
I'll return the compliment.

514
00:45:47,123 --> 00:45:50,492
Sir. You need to
check the bulletin board.

515
00:45:50,493 --> 00:45:53,163
- Bulletin board? Why?
- You'd better check it now.

516
00:46:03,443 --> 00:46:06,483
It's a matter of time for Mi Kyung to
know it. Then, she'll reveal the truth.

517
00:46:09,343 --> 00:46:13,313
I know! We need to
find the money quickly.

518
00:46:15,753 --> 00:46:16,753
I'll call you back.

519
00:46:30,233 --> 00:46:31,263
Let's go.

520
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:38,672
Why aren't you getting out?

521
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:41,943
I'm unsure if stealing documents
in another company's office is right.

522
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:49,282
An embezzler utilizes
someone's faith.

523
00:46:49,283 --> 00:46:52,203
I don't think we're doing a bad
thing. It's to arrest that kind of person.

524
00:46:54,423 --> 00:46:57,247
I visited that old
man's house yesterday.

525
00:46:57,248 --> 00:47:02,193
But the children
were cooking rice.

526
00:47:03,363 --> 00:47:05,032
Was he sick a lot?

527
00:47:05,033 --> 00:47:08,779
He'll recover if
we find the money.

528
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,473
So, let's give it our all.

529
00:47:16,313 --> 00:47:18,213
- Let's go.
- Okay.

530
00:47:23,523 --> 00:47:24,682
It's closed.

531
00:47:24,683 --> 00:47:25,983
I'll call a locksmith.

532
00:47:28,023 --> 00:47:29,593
Hold on.

533
00:47:34,793 --> 00:47:36,606
It seems like the windows
aren't closed completely.

534
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,502
I'll try to climb the wall.

535
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:40,602
What? It's too dangerous.

536
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:43,742
The locksmith won't do as we
please. I'll try to pass the window.

537
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:45,008
Be careful.

538
00:47:45,009 --> 00:47:48,013
- What if you fall down?
- It's okay.

539
00:48:00,993 --> 00:48:02,999
Excuse me.

540
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:06,262
If I fall, please call 119.

541
00:48:06,263 --> 00:48:08,192
How can you joke
in this situation?

542
00:48:08,193 --> 00:48:09,860
I'm not joking.

543
00:48:09,861 --> 00:48:13,532
If firefighters come, ask
them to open the door of 301.

544
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,903
Please focus on
what you're doing.

545
00:48:16,033 --> 00:48:18,173
- Is the window open?
- No.

546
00:48:21,073 --> 00:48:22,213
This one is open.

547
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:36,993
I'm doing work well as
much as Mr. Shin, right?

548
00:48:38,223 --> 00:48:39,833
Hurry up and find the documents.

549
00:48:41,063 --> 00:48:42,163
Search the table.

550
00:49:14,463 --> 00:49:15,933
Wait.

551
00:49:22,773 --> 00:49:24,243
Let's scour this.

552
00:49:43,923 --> 00:49:45,693
I think this is what
we've been looking for.

553
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:49,063
- This is it, right?
- I think it is.

554
00:50:17,763 --> 00:50:19,649
Please call an insurance
company instead of me.

555
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,593
I was shocked.

556
00:50:31,503 --> 00:50:33,470
You're done.

557
00:50:33,471 --> 00:50:37,113
We'll reveal how you
did money laundering.

558
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:39,956
It's scary.

559
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:41,705
You said you would reveal?

560
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,353
How?

561
00:50:45,753 --> 00:50:48,822
I warned you not to
show up in front of me.

562
00:50:48,823 --> 00:50:50,623
I'm not going to give it to you.

563
00:50:58,403 --> 00:50:59,873
Hey, kid.

564
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,243
Without it, you can't prove
I did money laundering.

565
00:51:09,073 --> 00:51:10,342
Are you okay?

566
00:51:10,343 --> 00:51:12,313
We should take hold of him.

567
00:51:23,693 --> 00:51:24,923
Hurry up.

568
00:51:34,403 --> 00:51:35,888
Mr. Shin. I'm sorry.

569
00:51:35,889 --> 00:51:38,542
Kang Myeong Cheol took the
document away. We're pursuing him.

570
00:51:38,543 --> 00:51:42,172
He must be heading to where he
hid the money. Keep sight of him.

571
00:51:42,173 --> 00:51:43,813
Yes, sir.

572
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:03,503
Where did he go?

573
00:52:08,773 --> 00:52:12,673
Don't you remember this road?

574
00:52:33,863 --> 00:52:35,033
I found it.

575
00:52:45,543 --> 00:52:47,673
It looks like he already
took away the money.

576
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:00,092
Hey.

577
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:03,032
- Return the money to the victims.
- Let go of me when I'm still being nice.

578
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:05,163
- I won't let you go.
- Won't you?

579
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:11,063
Catch my drift at once.

580
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:16,586
Is this the police station?

581
00:53:16,587 --> 00:53:20,083
It's the construction site.
Please come here in a hurry.

582
00:53:20,084 --> 00:53:22,242
- Return the money.
- Get off me.

583
00:53:22,243 --> 00:53:23,343
Get lost!

584
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:27,113
Why are you bothering
me, you leech?

585
00:54:24,873 --> 00:54:26,913
It makes me sick
to think of you.

586
00:54:27,813 --> 00:54:29,343
Let me hit you.

587
00:54:39,883 --> 00:54:41,652
You pay the price to
go through hardships.

588
00:54:41,653 --> 00:54:42,893
Mr. Shin!

589
00:54:46,863 --> 00:54:48,562
You're making a rod
for your own back.

590
00:54:48,563 --> 00:54:50,563
I want to step on you.

591
00:54:54,703 --> 00:54:56,972
Why are you so persistent?

592
00:54:56,973 --> 00:55:00,773
No one recognizes your hard work. You're
just a hunting dog for your president.

593
00:55:38,313 --> 00:55:39,983
I got taken.

594
00:55:41,513 --> 00:55:44,083
There's no money here.

595
00:55:44,823 --> 00:55:47,893
We're all fooled.

596
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:45,542
We found it.

597
00:56:45,543 --> 00:56:46,613
Open the bag.

598
00:57:10,243 --> 00:57:14,412
Am I right? A leopard
can't change its spots.

599
00:57:14,413 --> 00:57:17,512
She thought of
petty tricks a lot.

600
00:57:17,513 --> 00:57:21,412
Judging by hiding the money in the
car trunk, she wasn't thinking straight.

601
00:57:21,413 --> 00:57:25,152
She might think she won't get caught if
she uses long-term parking at the airport.

602
00:57:25,153 --> 00:57:29,023
She got caught due to that
kind of lackadaisical thought.

603
00:57:31,263 --> 00:57:34,062
Hey. What are you looking at?

604
00:57:34,063 --> 00:57:36,112
Just leave him alone.

605
00:57:36,113 --> 00:57:37,663
I'll make you some coffee.

606
00:57:48,873 --> 00:57:53,042
I've retrieved 3 billion won for the
Nanum Housing Renovation Project.

607
00:57:53,043 --> 00:57:57,023
And the police will seize their
property to make up for the rest.

608
00:57:58,353 --> 00:58:00,753
Why are you
bothering me so much?

609
00:58:02,393 --> 00:58:03,763
I've never bothered you.

610
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:05,723
Get out.

611
00:58:36,593 --> 00:58:37,793
This is Shin Cha Il.

612
00:58:44,303 --> 00:58:45,603
Yes, sir.

613
00:58:48,073 --> 00:58:50,843
Good job. Did you
receive the message, right?

614
00:58:58,413 --> 00:58:59,475
Please understand me.

615
00:58:59,476 --> 00:59:01,783
It couldn't be helped
due to the Vice President.

616
00:59:03,013 --> 00:59:06,152
What do you think
about the Vice President?

617
00:59:06,153 --> 00:59:08,233
Do you think he is
indispensable for JU construction?

618
00:59:17,803 --> 00:59:19,562
Sir.

619
00:59:19,563 --> 00:59:22,403
May I tell the union members
that we've found the money?

620
00:59:24,173 --> 00:59:26,372
Why don't we go together...

621
00:59:26,373 --> 00:59:28,272
You go and tell them.

622
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:30,143
Yes, sir.

623
00:59:48,533 --> 00:59:50,862
(Let's go to the store
together after work.)

624
00:59:50,863 --> 00:59:53,733
(The old man told me that he
would come with the children.)

625
00:59:55,503 --> 00:59:58,373
(I have something
to do. You go alone.)

626
00:59:59,243 --> 01:00:01,743
(The children might
want to see you.)

627
01:00:13,383 --> 01:00:15,522
I didn't expect you to see me.

628
01:00:15,523 --> 01:00:17,123
I heard you have
something to say.

629
01:00:20,363 --> 01:00:22,772
Seeing you've come
straight to the airport

630
01:00:24,005 --> 01:00:26,833
you didn't trust me completely.

631
01:00:29,803 --> 01:00:31,843
I wanted to get revenge

632
01:00:33,573 --> 01:00:35,791
on him.

633
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:37,743
That's why I took
the money away.

634
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:39,542
I'm sorry.

635
01:00:39,543 --> 01:00:44,752
In court, you should
state how you deceived

636
01:00:44,753 --> 01:00:48,722
residents and employees.

637
01:00:48,723 --> 01:00:52,793
The judiciary shows there's
no leniency for embezzlers.

638
01:00:55,863 --> 01:00:59,001
You've changed a lot.

639
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:00,772
Do you know that?

640
01:01:00,773 --> 01:01:05,443
I didn't realize I had
changed before I met you.

641
01:01:06,243 --> 01:01:10,173
You don't know how much
you've changed, right?

642
01:01:12,813 --> 01:01:14,450
I know.

643
01:01:15,638 --> 01:01:17,782
Because I decided
to change myself.

644
01:01:17,783 --> 01:01:21,152
Why did you want
to change yourself?

645
01:01:21,153 --> 01:01:23,453
That's because
of people like you.

646
01:01:26,223 --> 01:01:27,850
Please forgive me.

647
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:32,602
I met a bad guy.

648
01:01:32,603 --> 01:01:34,830
You also told me

649
01:01:34,831 --> 01:01:37,032
that I was honest
and had many dreams.

650
01:01:37,033 --> 01:01:41,072
You, in front of me, are
just an embezzler in prison.

651
01:01:41,073 --> 01:01:43,172
Hey.

652
01:01:43,173 --> 01:01:45,668
I can't stay long in
this kind of place.

653
01:01:45,669 --> 01:01:47,552
You found the money.

654
01:01:47,553 --> 01:01:49,182
Please talk nicely to the
union members about me and...

655
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,993
Do I still…

656
01:01:53,643 --> 01:01:55,715
look idealistic?

657
01:02:02,833 --> 01:02:08,803
I'll do my best to show you how serious
taking advantage of other's faith is.

658
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:38,732
Eat a lot. I'll treat
you to every dish here.

659
01:02:38,733 --> 01:02:40,262
- Really?
- Of course.

660
01:02:40,263 --> 01:02:43,703
- You can enjoy it because it's not spicy.
- Thanks for the treat.

661
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:49,278
This is for Min Hui.

662
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:51,534
And this is for Min Seok.

663
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,082
Eat a lot.

664
01:02:53,083 --> 01:02:55,382
Thank you for finding my money.

665
01:02:55,383 --> 01:02:58,152
You don't need to say, 'Thank
you.' You've gone through hard times.

666
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:00,752
By the way, why isn't she here?

667
01:03:00,753 --> 01:03:04,092
Well. She's busy doing her job.

668
01:03:04,093 --> 01:03:07,022
I miss her.

669
01:03:07,023 --> 01:03:10,663
I'll bring her next time. In
return, you should eat a lot.

670
01:03:12,633 --> 01:03:14,036
Just help yourself.

671
01:03:19,473 --> 01:03:22,343
- Is it good?
- Yes, it's good.

672
01:03:23,443 --> 01:03:27,042
The union president
called me a moment ago.

673
01:03:27,043 --> 01:03:30,252
I didn't expect him
to call me from jail.

674
01:03:30,253 --> 01:03:31,952
What did he say?

675
01:03:31,953 --> 01:03:34,452
He kept apologizing.

676
01:03:34,453 --> 01:03:37,462
He said he couldn't think straight
because he was desperate for money.

677
01:03:37,463 --> 01:03:39,592
He was wailing.

678
01:03:39,593 --> 01:03:43,663
So I told him not to
cheat someone again.

679
01:03:44,663 --> 01:03:46,632
Did you forgive him?

680
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:51,172
I can't live if I hate him
although he cheated on me once.

681
01:03:51,173 --> 01:03:52,943
I don't have many days to live.

682
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:57,513
Help yourself.

683
01:04:24,673 --> 01:04:25,973
You go in first.

684
01:04:30,573 --> 01:04:33,042
What are you doing
here at this hour?

685
01:04:33,043 --> 01:04:34,953
I have something to tell you.

686
01:04:37,013 --> 01:04:41,393
I lend my hand to find
the embezzled money.

687
01:04:42,123 --> 01:04:44,360
They were all underprivileged.

688
01:04:44,361 --> 01:04:46,724
They would lose their
house without that money.

689
01:04:46,725 --> 01:04:49,345
I thought returning the
money to them was right.

690
01:04:49,346 --> 01:04:51,133
That's why I helped Mr. Shin.

691
01:04:53,133 --> 01:04:54,972
You did a good job.

692
01:04:54,973 --> 01:04:56,819
It's natural to help
your team leader.

693
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:00,173
Then, why did you interrupt
him not to find the money?

694
01:05:03,843 --> 01:05:05,454
Have you eaten dinner?

695
01:05:05,455 --> 01:05:08,030
Why don't I cook for you?

696
01:05:08,031 --> 01:05:11,253
What about Kimchi Fried
Rice? It's your favorite food.

697
01:05:12,123 --> 01:05:15,093
I'm sorry. Let's eat
together next time.

698
01:05:41,783 --> 01:05:44,820
Sir, I got it from the
information desk.

699
01:05:44,821 --> 01:05:46,483
Someone sent it
through express delivery.

700
01:06:03,603 --> 01:06:06,248
(Audit the corrupt restaurant
management on site.)

701
01:06:06,249 --> 01:06:07,459
(Otherwise, all users of
JU's restaurants including

702
01:06:07,483 --> 01:06:08,571
the cafeteria in
headquarters, will suffer.)

703
01:06:08,572 --> 01:06:10,883
(It starts from the shopping
mall construction site.)

704
01:06:27,893 --> 01:06:29,233
What's going on?

705
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:47,313
Stop eating.

706
01:06:55,153 --> 01:06:56,423
Pay attention.

707
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:59,923
Stop eating.

708
01:07:01,263 --> 01:07:04,133
(The Auditors)

709
01:07:24,483 --> 01:07:26,942
Find out what's
going on secretly.

710
01:07:26,943 --> 01:07:28,671
What if he is a lawyer?

711
01:07:28,672 --> 01:07:30,152
We should find him.

712
01:07:30,153 --> 01:07:32,508
The Audit Team will find out
everything if they search around.

713
01:07:32,509 --> 01:07:34,403
Mr. Shin is picky.

714
01:07:34,404 --> 01:07:38,227
Does everyone look like
the target of auditing to you?

715
01:07:38,228 --> 01:07:42,002
Have you been asked to do something
about the management authority?

716
01:07:42,003 --> 01:07:43,272
Where are you going?

717
01:07:43,273 --> 01:07:46,375
You should at least show me
one piece of strong evidence.

718
01:07:46,376 --> 01:07:48,037
I'll write an apology statement.

719
01:07:48,038 --> 01:07:51,360
I'll upload it to
every bulletin board.

720
01:07:51,361 --> 01:07:54,213
The problem was that we
overdid ourselves to do auditing.
