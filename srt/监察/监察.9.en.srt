3
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,255
- Why are you sitting on that seat?
- What does it matter to you?

4
00:01:14,279 --> 00:01:15,935
Well…

5
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,603
I saw something weird
but it's a bit hard to tell you here.

6
00:01:19,627 --> 00:01:22,353
Let's go inside. I'll tell you what it is.

7
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,701
What's wrong?

8
00:01:39,206 --> 00:01:43,474
Someone made a dirty and strange joke.

10
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:50,774
It must be a composite photograph.

11
00:01:50,798 --> 00:01:53,394
Someone tried to set you up.

12
00:01:53,418 --> 00:01:58,665
I heard young people
can easily edit photos like this.

13
00:01:58,689 --> 00:02:01,292
But it really looks like a real one.

14
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:05,496

23
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:10,818
Good morning.

24
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:13,431
Hey. Send me the materials

25
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:17,969

26

27

It's nothing.

28
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:33,631
Okay.

29
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:06,550
Investigate how this employee got hired
and assigned to the Audit team.

30
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:13,477
She passed with flying colors.

31
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:15,243
She also has great qualifications.

32
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:18,906
I can't audit her for the reason that
she is close to the vice president.

33
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,565
It's about an unfair employment report.

34
00:04:21,383 --> 00:04:25,752
Isn't it a problem that the Vice President
is close to a female employee?

35
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,271
Investigate it again right now.

Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.
Please come to the meeting room.

38
00:05:29,615 --> 00:05:32,469
Other employees are
starting to know her name.

39
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:35,171
What is this situation?

40
00:05:35,195 --> 00:05:36,505
Does she get connections?

41
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:39,319
Come on. We checked it out together.

42
00:05:39,343 --> 00:05:41,455
Her grades were great
and she did well at the interview.

43
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,458
Then, Is she really having an affair…

44
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:45,993
Come on.

45
00:05:46,017 --> 00:05:48,059
You're crossing the line.

46
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:51,732
A big age gap doesn't matter
if a man and a woman love each other.

47
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:53,245
You're so inflexible.

48
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,737
How can you say that
when you don't know well?

49
00:05:56,761 --> 00:05:59,006
I'm saying this because I don't know well.

50
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,246
Anyway, she fooled us. She pretended
she didn't know the Vice President.

51
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,302
I am right, right?

52
00:06:13,964 --> 00:06:19,684
My mom and Vice President have maintained
the relationship for a long.

53
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:24,088
He often visits my house

54
00:06:25,304 --> 00:06:27,091
to eat my mom's food because he likes it.

55
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:31,996
That's why I know him well.

56
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:36,609
I just didn't tell you about it

57
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,165
not to cause any misunderstanding.

58
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:41,806
What kind of relationship do they have?

59
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,207
Well, that is…

60
00:06:53,836 --> 00:06:55,796
My mom used to work
as a housekeeper in his house.

61
00:06:57,383 --> 00:07:02,393
She had worked there for a long time
when the late president was alive.

62
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:07,914
Did the vice president pull the strings
to get you hired?

63
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:09,794
No, that wasn't true.

64
00:07:09,818 --> 00:07:13,054
I heard he didn't even take part
in the executive interview due to me.

65
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,568
I'm 100% innocent.
That's a ridiculous rumor.

66
00:07:14,592 --> 00:07:18,552
Didn't you get any information from him
about the recruitment process?

67
00:07:18,576 --> 00:07:22,819
It wasn't until I passed the written test
that he knew I applied to the company.

68
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:25,949
I didn't get any information from him.

69
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:37,628
Don't you have any idea
who uploaded the photos?

70
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
I have no idea.

71
00:07:45,353 --> 00:07:47,536
I'll resume the unfair
employment investigation.

72
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,572
You can go out.

73
00:07:49,273 --> 00:07:50,280
Yes.

74
00:08:04,255 --> 00:08:06,833
Hey. What's going on?

75
00:08:06,857 --> 00:08:09,537
Are you close to the Vice President?
Is there something you and him?

76
00:08:13,413 --> 00:08:15,393
- Hey.
- Tell me before you leave.

77
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:17,902
Hey.

78
00:08:19,086 --> 00:08:21,735
Sir, what's wrong with you?

79
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,302
Why? You also want to know about it.

80
00:08:24,326 --> 00:08:26,210
I took the lead and asked her.

81
00:08:31,197 --> 00:08:32,216
Am I wrong?

82
00:09:20,914 --> 00:09:22,094
She's the one in the picture.

83
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:23,278
She must've joined the company
through the connection.

84
00:09:23,302 --> 00:09:26,036
I doubt if there's something
between the Vice President and her.

85
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,216
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

86
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
Don't talk thoughtlessly
without the least knowledge of it.

87
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:48,960
Stop following me.

88
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,099
I'll be back after getting some fresh air.

89
00:09:52,123 --> 00:09:55,072
I'm just worried about you.

90
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,912
I'm fine.

91
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:58,132
I did nothing wrong.

92
00:09:58,156 --> 00:10:00,538
I know. I believe in you.

93
00:10:18,863 --> 00:10:22,857
Sir… are those pictures true?

94
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,807
I mean, there's nothing strange about it

95
00:10:26,831 --> 00:10:30,077
but by social norm isn't the difference
in social positions so huge?

96
00:10:30,101 --> 00:10:31,854
Sir? Sir!

97
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,783

98
00:10:34,807 --> 00:10:36,040
Mr. Vice President.

99

What brings you here?

100
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,023
Where is Yoon Seo Jin?

101
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:41,321
Well…

102
00:10:41,345 --> 00:10:43,508
Do you know where she is?
No.

103
00:10:43,532 --> 00:10:44,154
You don't know?

104
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,738
She went out with Han Soo a moment ago.
She hurt her feelings by…

105
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,505
- Hurry up and call her or him.
- Yes, sir.

106
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:02,025
Mr. Vice President.

107
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,303
Hey! Come on!

108
00:11:17,327 --> 00:11:19,943
I told you that Mr. Vice
President is busy now.

109
00:11:19,967 --> 00:11:21,452
Please have an interview with me.

110
00:11:30,806 --> 00:11:32,518
There are photos of you
and Ms. Yoon Seo Jin

111
00:11:32,542 --> 00:11:34,374
on the anonymous bulletin board
where outsiders can upload materials.

112
00:11:34,398 --> 00:11:35,899
You need to explain this.

113
00:11:37,725 --> 00:11:38,529
Get out.

114
00:11:38,553 --> 00:11:41,571
Have you helped Ms.
Yoon Seo Jin to get hired?

115
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,322
I said, 'Get out.'

116
00:11:45,346 --> 00:11:48,207
When did you know she applied to
JU Construction?

117
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:49,234
Hey!

118
00:11:49,258 --> 00:11:51,362
If you don't cooperate
you're just making the situation worse.

119
00:11:51,386 --> 00:11:54,485
Then, it will make her
have a much harder time.

120
00:11:56,324 --> 00:11:59,389
Did you pull the strings in the employment
process to help Ms Yoon Seo Jin?

121
00:12:00,798 --> 00:12:03,370
Your close staff, Director Seo Gil Pyo

122
00:12:03,394 --> 00:12:07,274
was in charge of recruitment
when she was hired.

123
00:12:07,298 --> 00:12:09,607
I never did that kind of thing.

124
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:13,047
She did nothing wrong.
Don't harass the innocent.

125
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:14,905
Auditing isn't harassment.

126
00:12:16,644 --> 00:12:18,509
So you killed a person?

127
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:21,379
While auditing?

128
00:12:27,926 --> 00:12:29,253
Keep in mind.

129
00:12:30,572 --> 00:12:32,990
You'll be in trouble

130
00:12:33,832 --> 00:12:35,459
if you push Seo Jin into a corner.

131
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:42,508
If you're so worried please cooperate
and have an interview with me.

132

153

He said an external audit would start.

Why?

162
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:10,971
Isn't requesting an external audit
going too far?

163
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,798
Seo Jin and I have already gone through
an investigation

164
00:15:12,822 --> 00:15:13,993
to clarify the issue of unfair employment.

165
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:15,913
It's a president's call.

166
00:15:15,937 --> 00:15:17,764
Isn't doing an external
audit discrimination?

167
00:15:17,788 --> 00:15:23,117
It could be the best way
to remove doubt and secure justice.

168
00:15:23,141 --> 00:15:24,781
Inform Ms. Yoon Seo Jin of this decision.

Sir…

170
00:15:41,424 --> 00:15:43,088
You failed to kick me out with Mr. Shin.

171
00:15:43,112 --> 00:15:45,894
But how could you bring
an outsider to audit me?

172
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:49,329
Mr. Shin wouldn't judge his team
members fairly. It's a fair decision.

173
00:15:49,353 --> 00:15:51,342
You also cooperate with the audit.

Fair environment?
What a bullshit!

179
00:16:05,239 --> 00:16:07,045
You've always been nasty.

180
00:16:07,069 --> 00:16:09,406
You always try to beat me
whenever there's a chance.

181
00:16:11,297 --> 00:16:13,109
Wait and see.

182
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:16,960
I'll show you how I could've survived.

183
00:16:16,984 --> 00:16:19,944
If you keep acting like this the
housekeeper's daughter will be in trouble.

184
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,205
When have you two been so close?

185
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:29,698
As a brother,
have you ever eaten ramen with me?

186
00:16:29,722 --> 00:16:34,738
Sister is the only one
who cared for me when you bullied me.

187
00:16:34,762 --> 00:16:35,762
Sister?

188
00:16:38,316 --> 00:16:39,570
What a warm heart.

189
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:43,374
Is that why you got her daughter hired?

190
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,950
Don't you really have a crush on her?

191
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,679
I'll rip your mouth.

192
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,048
Don't babble on without thinking.

193
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:53,390
She's my niece.

194
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:54,885
You have a new family.

195
00:16:55,754 --> 00:16:57,488
I don't care about that kind of thing.

196
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,058
The company has many issues already.

197
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:02,310
So don't cause more problems.
Just arrange things.

198
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:06,110
Make her take charge, or you take charge.

199
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:07,865
Or you'll be in big trouble.

200
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:10,334
Off you go.

201
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:21,071
President Hwang Se Woong is in crisis.

202
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:22,844
Consecutive bad things happen.

203
00:17:22,868 --> 00:17:26,183
Industry officials doubt his leadership.

204
00:17:27,575 --> 00:17:29,951
The news about you is really harsh.

205
00:17:29,975 --> 00:17:31,504
Well.

206
00:17:31,528 --> 00:17:34,391
It's no wonder because you've achieved
nothing during the last year.

207
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,695
It's too early to drink a toast.

208
00:17:39,497 --> 00:17:43,433
No one knows who will be brought

209
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,503
to a stalemate.

210
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:19,145
You put on airs
because Hwang Se Woong was on your side

211
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:22,072
but he betrayed you.

212
00:18:28,805 --> 00:18:31,278
You make Seo Jin have a harder time.

213
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:34,007
External audit?

214
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,961
No one knows what kind of trap
Hwang Se Woong set up on it.

215
00:18:37,985 --> 00:18:40,494
Seo Jin is your team member.

216
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,038
Will you just sit back and do nothing?

217
00:18:42,858 --> 00:18:44,428
I'll take care of it.

218
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,683
I didn't expect
the President to order an external audit.

219
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:28,003
The President must've decided
to investigate it thoroughly.

220
00:19:28,027 --> 00:19:30,203
Our Audit Team must be feeling nervous.

221
00:19:30,227 --> 00:19:32,330
But this is right. This is fair.

222
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:34,894
You're right. This is a nice order.

223
00:19:48,151 --> 00:19:50,747
- My name is Seo Hee Jin.
- I'm Shin Cha Il.

224
00:19:50,771 --> 00:19:52,262
I've heard about you a lot.

225
00:19:53,017 --> 00:19:55,073
I'll start auditing now.

226
00:19:55,097 --> 00:19:58,211
We'll use that meeting room.

227
00:19:58,235 --> 00:20:00,138
Please get me all the related documents.

228
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,585
Yes, wait a minute, please.

229
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:06,087
When is the interview available?

230
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:07,911
Ms. Yoon Seo Jin is ready for it.

231
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:09,952
All right.

232
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:11,748
Let's begin.

233
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:31,155
<i>(Mr. Vice President)</i>

234
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,091
Hello.

235
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:46,817
Find who uploaded the pictures.

236
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:48,707
What?

237
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:50,871
I heard you know how
to deal with computers.

238
00:20:50,895 --> 00:20:52,856
Find who it is and bring that one to me.

239
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:55,625
Well.

240
00:20:56,575 --> 00:20:58,061
It's hard to find the one.

241
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,298
What?

242
00:21:01,322 --> 00:21:03,771
I have already asked my friend
who works for that company.

243
00:21:03,795 --> 00:21:07,804
Users can upload a post anonymously
and the site doesn't save an IP address.

244
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:08,938
So, it's hard to trace a user.

245
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:10,650
Are you saying that there is no way?

246
00:21:10,674 --> 00:21:14,083
I guess the user who posted is an employee
of our company.

247
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,915
It might be helpful if I could get
information about the site members.

248
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:18,369
But even though I get it
I can't specify who did it.

249
00:21:18,393 --> 00:21:22,236
Plus, I need a warrant
to ask for member's information.

250
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,255
Cut the crap. So you
can't find the one, right?

251
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:28,523
Has the external audit started?

252
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:31,123
I can't spill how it
goes in the department.

253
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:33,683
It's not what our audit team is in charge.

254
00:21:33,707 --> 00:21:36,163
You're Seo Jin's colleague.

255
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:37,234
Don't you worry about her?

256
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,356
What are you guys doing?

257
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:43,023
Why is Mr. Shin so incompetent?

258
00:21:43,047 --> 00:21:45,418
That's not true. We
are investigating it, too.

259
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:46,710
So

260
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:50,748
Tell me about it.

261
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,205
Inform Ms. Yoon Seo Jin of this decision.

262
00:21:56,229 --> 00:21:57,758
Sir…

263
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:59,823
Yes, sir, I'll inform her about it.

264
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:04,366
By the way what company is
in charge of the external audit?

265
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,696
It's Bareun.

266
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:09,892
Bareun is so fastidious.

267
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:11,536
How strict are they?

268
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,440
They utterly make an interviewee
tired to death.

269
00:22:14,323 --> 00:22:18,665
Should we just wait and see that
our colleague is unfairly investigated?

270
00:22:18,689 --> 00:22:19,891
No.

271
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:21,578
We'll investigate it in our own way.

272
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:27,517
I found something suspicious
in the post about Mrs. Yoon Seo Jin.

273
00:22:28,988 --> 00:22:31,409
<i>The user asked us to find
out about their relationship</i>

274
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,258
<i>before investigating
unfair employment.</i>

275
00:22:33,282 --> 00:22:35,644
The user's intention is too obvious.

276
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,518
An intention?

277
00:22:37,542 --> 00:22:39,331
The one is trying to distract attention.

278
00:22:39,355 --> 00:22:40,745
The one wants to distract
everyone's attention

279
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:42,899
from unfair employment to Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

280
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,571
So, could the user who posted the pictures
be the one?

281
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:49,611
It's quite likely.

282
00:22:49,635 --> 00:22:52,809
We don't know yet
whether there is an accomplice or not.

283
00:22:53,594 --> 00:22:54,903
Is there an accomplice?

284
00:22:54,927 --> 00:22:56,803
There are various ways
to commit unfair employment practices.

285
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:58,823
For example, educational background forgery
or fabricated grades of an employment test.

286
00:22:58,847 --> 00:23:01,037
They can also fabricate
scores from job interviews.

287
00:23:01,061 --> 00:23:02,863
We need to discover many things.

288
00:23:02,887 --> 00:23:07,430
So, we'll keep investigating
unfair employment.

289
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:08,857
Sir.

290
00:23:08,881 --> 00:23:10,677
You believe that Ms. Seo Jin is innocent.

291
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:13,263
I just believe
that the audit I did wasn't wrong.

292
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,343
Yeah…

293
00:23:15,367 --> 00:23:19,780
Have you found where the documents
from 2020, 2021, and 2023 are?

294
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:20,998
The Personnel Team's ex-leader,

295
00:23:21,022 --> 00:23:23,149
Yoon Dae Kyung and ex-Chief
Jeon Mi Ryeo were in charge

296
00:23:23,173 --> 00:23:25,184
but the team is trying
to find the documents.

297
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:28,488
Current leader Lee Cha Sun said
the documents would be in the archives

298
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,752
and added that it could be mixed up
with other materials.

299
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:34,900
Should we check all the documents
from the past four years?

300
00:23:34,924 --> 00:23:36,831
Aren't the documents
for the past two years enough?

301
00:23:36,855 --> 00:23:40,572
The company hadn't checked the errors
in the personnel and aptitude tests

302
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:43,811
from 2020 to 2023.

303
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:46,058
The personnel department dispersed
recruitment-related documents

304
00:23:46,082 --> 00:23:49,785
of this period to various archives.

305
00:23:49,809 --> 00:23:52,378
They even don't know
where the document lists are.

306
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:54,213
That's why we're struggling now.

307
00:23:54,237 --> 00:23:56,513
I couldn't expect
finding a document to be this hard.

308
00:23:56,537 --> 00:23:58,546
Moreover, Director Seo Gil Pyo handled

309
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,377
all the personnel department
work during that period.

310
00:24:02,635 --> 00:24:04,998
It's too suspicious just to ignore.

311
00:24:05,022 --> 00:24:09,531
We must find the 2020's documents.

312
00:24:09,555 --> 00:24:13,123
Yes, sir. I'll find it. Definitely.

313
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,913
When Seo Jin's false charge is cleared
Mr. Shin plans to find the real suspect.

314
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:26,366
Then, the rumor will be put down.

315
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,781
That's his plan.

316
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:32,108
That's why he accepted the external audit.

317
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:04,309
Submit a consent to check your call history
and financial transaction history.

318
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,402
I see.

319
00:25:05,426 --> 00:25:07,410
Let's wrap it up today.

320
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:11,356
Thank you. You can go home.

321
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Yes.

322
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,052
Get consent from her right away
and secure the related data.

323
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,076
Yes, sir.

324
00:25:29,089 --> 00:25:30,845
Is the next interview ready?

325
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,735
Yes, it's ready.

326
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:44,046
You must be the female version of Mr. Shin.

327
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:47,584
I'm not Mr Shin.

328
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:50,358
I'm Seo Hee Jin.

329
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,338
I'll start recording.

330
00:25:52,362 --> 00:25:55,601
Please provide details about your
relationship with Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

331
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,118
She's all right?

332
00:25:57,142 --> 00:25:59,362
She's under investigation.
I can't tell you about it.

333
00:26:00,109 --> 00:26:02,198
And please use polite language.

334
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:04,844
I'm right.

335
00:26:04,868 --> 00:26:05,612
What?

336
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:08,371
I'm right that you're
Mr. Shin's female version.

337
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,442
I'm curious about one thing.

338
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,146
Are you a hunting dog or a wolf?

339
00:26:18,583 --> 00:26:22,592
Discover their relationship.
There must be something suspicious.

340
00:26:22,616 --> 00:26:27,692
It sounds like you want me to create
a corruption that doesn't exist.

341
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:31,459
I believe we will grow to be good partners
through this opportunity.

342
00:26:31,483 --> 00:26:34,698
Your company can benefit from it.

343
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:37,801
I'll do my best.

344
00:26:39,369 --> 00:26:42,159
Which one is you?

345
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:43,679
I don't have time to joke around.

346
00:26:43,703 --> 00:26:45,575
Mr. Shin is also boring.

347
00:26:47,103 --> 00:26:48,766
I'll start the interview.

348
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:51,948
Please tell me about the relationship
with Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

349
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:57,987
What kind of story do you want to hear?

350
00:26:59,105 --> 00:27:01,195
We go way back.

351
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,523
I have plenty of times.

352
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:05,928
Then, I'll tell you about
my high school days.

353
00:27:17,787 --> 00:27:20,250
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

354
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:21,916
Why do I feel cold?

355
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,491
Do you feel cold?
I feel hot because I'm angry.

356
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:27,663
Why should I look for the documents?

357
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:31,765
Don't waste your time.
You can go home early if you find it early.

358
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,564
Hey. Why can't you relate to me?

359
00:27:33,588 --> 00:27:36,363
You're so harsh on me.

360
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:39,338
Do I tell you more harsh news?

361
00:27:39,362 --> 00:27:42,178
We have other archives to search around.

362
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,398
How many of them are left? Don't
tell me. I don't want to be discouraged.

363
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:47,913
There are two archives at the headquarters.

364
00:27:47,937 --> 00:27:51,460
There's one at Incheon
and four at Gyeonggi-do.

365
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:53,200
And two at Busan.

366
00:27:53,224 --> 00:27:54,520
What brings you here?

367
00:27:54,544 --> 00:27:55,840
I've brought snacks for you.

368
00:27:55,864 --> 00:27:57,361
I've experienced
looking for documents in an archive.

369
00:27:57,385 --> 00:27:58,787
You're going to be hungry.

370
00:27:58,811 --> 00:28:01,319
You're the best. Thank you for the food.

371
00:28:01,343 --> 00:28:03,529
- You're the best.
- Yes.

372
00:28:03,553 --> 00:28:04,827
Thank you for the food.

373
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:12,651
Have you checked Yoon Seo Jin's
college diploma?

374
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:14,879
Yes. It turns out that it's the original.
I've sent a fax now.

375
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,232
Thank you.

376
00:28:25,264 --> 00:28:28,871
<i>(Yeonseo University)</i>

377
00:28:37,323 --> 00:28:39,198
Han Soo. It's already passed
the quitting time. Let's go.

378
00:28:39,222 --> 00:28:41,634
I'll search for more. You first go home.

379
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:42,694
Do it tomorrow.

380
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,276
Leave him alone. He's warm-hearted.

381
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,127
He must be worried much about her.

382
00:28:47,151 --> 00:28:48,641
- Let's go.
- Let's go home quickly.

383
00:28:48,665 --> 00:28:50,947
Don't ask me to help more.

384
00:28:50,971 --> 00:28:53,045
- I'm leaving.
- Goodbye.

385
00:28:53,069 --> 00:28:54,304
It's okay to drink it.

386
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:10,287
These were on Director Seo's side?

387
00:29:10,311 --> 00:29:13,732
Right. But both of them transferred
to other companies.

388
00:29:13,756 --> 00:29:18,070
Ex-team Leader Yoon Dae Kyung
transferred to OWoon Co.

389
00:29:18,094 --> 00:29:19,951
And I heard

390
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:25,132
the other one went to a city in Germany.

391
00:29:25,156 --> 00:29:26,765
That's too far.

392
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:28,871
I smell something fishy.

393
00:29:29,609 --> 00:29:32,239
Why did you ask me to investigate them?

394
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:34,310
I'm going to take a very active part in it.

395
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:37,665
- What?
- And dig up more.

396
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:40,826
Find who was likely to request
Director Seo for unfair employment.

397
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:45,013
I'm sorry, but I think
that's going too far.

398
00:29:45,037 --> 00:29:49,001
- The aftermath would be…
- You do just as you're told.

399
00:29:49,025 --> 00:29:50,045
Yes, sir.

400
00:30:26,228 --> 00:30:29,165
I have something to say to you.

401
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,682
I helped with 2022's
interview as an assistant.

402
00:30:36,706 --> 00:30:38,141
And…

403
00:30:40,133 --> 00:30:41,922
Can I say things like this?

404
00:30:41,946 --> 00:30:43,842
Is there something fishy?

405
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:45,942
To think of it

406
00:30:45,966 --> 00:30:49,202
Ms. Yoon Seo Jin met the Vice President
before the interview.

407
00:30:49,226 --> 00:30:51,654
I saw them on my way
back from the restroom.

408
00:30:52,906 --> 00:30:53,756
So what?

409
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,692
I'm suspicious that she heard
the interview content in advance from him.

410
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:59,089
Are you sure?

411
00:30:59,113 --> 00:31:02,013
Had the Vice President
leaked interview questions

412
00:31:02,037 --> 00:31:04,893
to Ms. Yoon Seo Jin in advance?

413
00:31:04,917 --> 00:31:08,740
My memory is vague
because the interview happened a long ago.

414
00:31:08,764 --> 00:31:10,204
But I think he leaked the questions.

415
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:16,526
<i>I didn't!</i>

416
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,999
Calm down.

417
00:31:18,023 --> 00:31:21,851
Haven't you met the Vice President
before the interview?

418
00:31:25,403 --> 00:31:30,465
I came across him
while waiting for my turn.

419
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,632
I just said, 'Hi.'

420
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:33,796
The witness's account is different.

421
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:36,339
Who is the witness?

422
00:31:36,363 --> 00:31:38,168
I can't tell you that.

423
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:41,836
I feel so wronged.

424
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,840
What exactly did the
Vice President tell you?

425
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,954
<i>- Kim Min Soo.</i>
- Yes.

426
00:31:48,978 --> 00:31:50,179
It's your turn.

427
00:31:56,847 --> 00:31:59,843
- Are you waiting for the interview?
- Yes.

428
00:31:59,867 --> 00:32:00,929
Are you nervous?

429
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:04,303
I'd like to stay calm, but I feel nervous.

430
00:32:04,327 --> 00:32:05,971
Just relax and be yourself.

431
00:32:05,995 --> 00:32:07,463
Good luck.

432
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,078
Hey. Good luck!

433
00:32:11,102 --> 00:32:11,746
You'll be passed.

434
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:14,918
<i>He cheered up everyone.</i>

435
00:32:14,942 --> 00:32:16,472
That's all.

436
00:32:18,702 --> 00:32:21,091
You've talked with him
on the phone frequently

437
00:32:21,115 --> 00:32:22,921
and he often visited your house.

438
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:26,161
That's because he and my mom
have known each other for a long.

439
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,375
We're suspicious of your relationship with…

440
00:32:27,399 --> 00:32:28,718
You want to know

441
00:32:29,985 --> 00:32:31,385
why he visited my apartment, right?

442
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,259
I'll explain it.

443
00:32:40,773 --> 00:32:42,465
Mr. Yoon Dae Kyung?

444
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:45,529
Who are you?

445
00:32:45,553 --> 00:32:46,731
I'm Shin Cha Il

446
00:32:46,755 --> 00:32:49,516
the Audit Team leader of JU Construction.
I called you during the day.

447
00:32:49,893 --> 00:32:52,386
I told you that I don't want to meet you.

448
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,631
Why did you hide

449
00:32:54,655 --> 00:32:58,524
2020 and 2021 recruitment-related documents
when you were a team leader?

450
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:00,277
What are you talking about?

451
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:03,477
Chief Jeon Mi Ryeo was in charge
of keeping those documents.

452
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:04,630
You'd better visit her.

453
00:33:04,654 --> 00:33:07,810
I already talked to her,
who is in Europe now.

454
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:11,564
She said that it was your order
to move the documents.

455
00:33:11,588 --> 00:33:13,177
I never ordered that kind of thing.

456
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:15,507
Don't bother me, and go away.

457
00:33:15,531 --> 00:33:17,309
Where is the document list?

458
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:19,349
Is it in the headquarter's archive?

459
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:21,103
Of course, it is…

460
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:25,302
You should've stored it
in the personnel department's cabinet.

461
00:33:25,326 --> 00:33:27,376
Why is it in the archive?

462
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,437
Well…

463
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:31,316
There wasn't enough place to store it.

464
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,184
Is it illegal? Is there a problem with it?

465
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,556
It isn't illegal. But it's suspicious.

466
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,644
Why did you move the document list?

467
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:40,936
I didn't do that.

468
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,492
Come on!

469
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:49,831
Mr. Vice President.

470
00:33:50,817 --> 00:33:53,420
You have only two options.

471
00:33:53,444 --> 00:33:54,546
- What?
- First

472
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:57,760
answer my questions obediently.

473
00:33:57,784 --> 00:34:03,655
Second, let's get hit by me
and answer obediently.

474
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,950
For your information I'll be happy
if you choose the second option.

475
00:34:08,951 --> 00:34:09,985
What?

476
00:34:13,991 --> 00:34:15,992
Who did Director Seo pull the strings for?

477
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:19,140
How did you know that…

478
00:34:19,164 --> 00:34:21,424
It seems like
you're attracted to the second option.

479
00:34:22,384 --> 00:34:24,460
I'm serious. I know nothing about it.

480
00:34:24,484 --> 00:34:26,035
That's not a good answer.

481
00:34:28,031 --> 00:34:28,673
Let go of me.

482
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:30,827
Was Director Seo asked to consider
a special job position for someone?

483
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:34,247
He was in charge
of deciding on about recruitment.

484
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:36,814
The President and I just stamped the seal
on the papers after being reported.

485
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:37,657
You got it?

486
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:38,837
Do you have a proof?

487
00:34:38,861 --> 00:34:40,259
The poof that someone requested him
for unfair employment?

488
00:34:40,283 --> 00:34:41,679
The proof?

489
00:34:41,703 --> 00:34:45,045
This man was on his side.
I'll obtain the proof from him.

490
00:34:45,069 --> 00:34:47,072
So, take your hands off me.

491
00:34:47,096 --> 00:34:50,293
Please hold his hands.

492
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:58,541
I really don't know anything.

493
00:34:58,565 --> 00:35:02,514
I just input the scores as I was told.

494
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:05,341
What scores? Tell me everything.

495
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,653
The interview scores.

496
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:12,546
Director Seo ordered me to input the scores
that he changed into a computer.

497
00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:14,238
When was it?

498
00:35:14,262 --> 00:35:16,878
It was 2020.
It happened just once at that time.

499
00:35:16,902 --> 00:35:19,131
Whose scores did he change?

500
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:21,433
I don't know.

501
00:35:21,457 --> 00:35:23,735
I'll kick your ass if
you don't tell the truth.

502
00:35:23,759 --> 00:35:25,196
I'm serious.

503
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,973
We only received the application numbers.
So I don't know whose score it was.

504
00:35:27,997 --> 00:35:30,171
I also tried not to check the name.

505
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:31,679
If I knew, it would make me in trouble.

506
00:35:31,703 --> 00:35:33,645
Where is the scorecard now?

507
00:35:33,669 --> 00:35:36,211
It must be written on the document list.

508
00:35:37,976 --> 00:35:41,919
If we compare the score on the scorecard
with the computerized one

509
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:44,147
we can find out who was unfairly hired.

510
00:35:47,341 --> 00:35:48,949
<i>(Goo Han Soo)</i>

511
00:35:49,822 --> 00:35:50,730
This is Shin Cha Il.

512
00:35:50,754 --> 00:35:52,902
<i>Sir, we've found the document list.</i>

513
00:35:52,926 --> 00:35:54,496
Well done.

514
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,426
Does it include the documents
for the year 2020?

515
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,462
I see.

516
00:35:58,486 --> 00:36:00,596
Go on ahead. I'll catch up with you.

517
00:36:05,708 --> 00:36:06,802
Goodbye.

518
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,619
Have your team members found the document?

519
00:36:13,643 --> 00:36:15,858
- Where is it?
- It's the Audit Team's task.

520
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,691
You've found out the information thanks
to me. Are you playing dumb with me?

521
00:36:18,715 --> 00:36:21,517
I already knew you were cold-hearted.
But you're so brazen.

522
00:36:23,022 --> 00:36:26,122
If you want, I'll go to your office
after finishing the investigation.

523
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,171
You're not busy? Let's go quickly.

524
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:50,580
Why don't you ride shotgun?

525
00:36:51,766 --> 00:36:54,996
I feel comfortable now.
I usually sit in the back seat.

526
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,552
Let's go.

527
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,712
I'm so relieved that
we've found where it is.

528
00:37:11,736 --> 00:37:13,970
Right. It won't take long to Incheon.

529
00:37:31,382 --> 00:37:33,289
Are you really innocent?

530
00:37:35,335 --> 00:37:37,602
Why are you trying to ruin my mood?

531
00:37:37,626 --> 00:37:39,390
I mean

532
00:37:39,414 --> 00:37:43,264
you really didn't know
Mr. Seo Gil Pyo received a special request?

533
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:46,568
I hate every Audit Team leader.

534
00:37:48,322 --> 00:37:50,165
Are you ducking the question?

535
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:51,274
I didn't know it.

536
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:56,268
I'm feeling a huge sense of betrayal.

537
00:37:56,292 --> 00:37:57,813
So, shut your mouth up.

538
00:37:59,768 --> 00:38:01,617
And drive smoothly.

539
00:38:02,395 --> 00:38:03,552
I feel carsick.

540
00:38:20,873 --> 00:38:22,889
There are so many.

541
00:38:22,913 --> 00:38:24,429
We can do it.

542
00:38:24,453 --> 00:38:26,876
- This one.
- Thank you.

543
00:38:29,529 --> 00:38:31,258
- Let's start.
- Yes.

544
00:38:31,282 --> 00:38:33,145
I'll start from this
side. You take this one.

545
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:33,782
I see.

546
00:38:36,083 --> 00:38:40,123
<i>(Box file)</i>

547
00:38:54,873 --> 00:38:57,456
Excuse me. Isn't it this?

548
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,982
Have you found it?

549
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:01,310
Application materials
and interview scorecards are inside.

550
00:39:05,236 --> 00:39:06,306
I think this is it.

551
00:39:06,330 --> 00:39:09,113
With it, we can find
who was hired unfairly.

552
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:10,295
You're right.

553
00:39:10,319 --> 00:39:12,090
What a relief. Let's move it quickly.

554
00:39:12,983 --> 00:39:15,224
- Put on your clothes.
- Yes.

555
00:39:18,964 --> 00:39:21,146
- I'll carry it.
- No. I'll do it.

556
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:23,632
- It's heavy. Let's go.
- Yes.

557
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:27,557
What?

558
00:39:29,037 --> 00:39:31,116
Hello, we're here!

559
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,908
Hey, the lights turned off.

560
00:39:35,944 --> 00:39:37,637
Hey, the lights suddenly turned...

561
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,252
Hey!

562
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:44,754
Be careful.

563
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:49,725
Hey. The documents are gone.

564
00:40:20,851 --> 00:40:22,968
Get out of my way. Get lost!

565
00:40:22,992 --> 00:40:26,229
Someone stole the documents.
The one is in that car.

566
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,472
Sir!

567
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:03,832
- Start recording.
- Yes, sir.

568
00:41:05,472 --> 00:41:08,352
- Who ordered you guys to do this?
- We will never tell the truth to you.

569
00:41:09,098 --> 00:41:12,141
It's CEO Jeong. CEO Jeong ordered us.

570
00:41:12,165 --> 00:41:13,752
Who is that bastard?

571
00:41:13,776 --> 00:41:16,538
He's running a moneylending business
in Jongnam City.

572
00:41:16,562 --> 00:41:19,345
I don't know his name.
Everyone calls him CEO Jeong.

573
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:20,949
He's a loan shark.

574
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:23,686
Do you have any idea who it is?

575
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:26,188
Wait a minute.

576
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:32,528
It's me.

577
00:41:32,552 --> 00:41:35,340
CEO Jeong is Director Seo's acquaintance.

578
00:41:35,364 --> 00:41:36,651
Hey, you bastard…

579
00:41:37,984 --> 00:41:42,172
He's a loan shark in Jongnam City.
Find out who he is.

580
00:41:42,196 --> 00:41:43,211
Right now!

581
00:41:44,917 --> 00:41:46,541
He's disloyal.

582
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:50,751
Don't associate with that kind of guy.

583
00:41:52,464 --> 00:41:53,858
Is the document all right?

584
00:41:53,882 --> 00:41:56,518
There's no problem. It's the one we found.

585
00:41:58,282 --> 00:41:59,421
Did you get hurt?

586
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:01,885
It's nothing.

587
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:05,904
Wait. You drive a car and take Mr. Shin
and Vice President to the company.

588
00:42:05,928 --> 00:42:06,878
Okay.

589
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:09,045
- I'll drive.
- No. I'm fine.

590
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,299
No.

591
00:42:11,076 --> 00:42:12,765
It's me who isn't fine.

592
00:42:12,789 --> 00:42:14,346
I don't want to get in
the car you're driving.

593
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:16,872
- You drive. Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:19,059
- I'll leave first.
- I'll follow you.

595
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,372
You're our witness.

596
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:23,709
We'll bring you to the police station.

597
00:42:30,179 --> 00:42:33,289
Now, we only need to find
who was hired unfairly.

598
00:42:38,481 --> 00:42:41,430
By the way, how did you two come together?

599
00:42:44,822 --> 00:42:46,068
There was a situation.

600
00:42:47,529 --> 00:42:49,001
Did Assistant Manager Moon take

601
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:51,549
every recruitment-related
document for the year 2020?

602
00:42:51,573 --> 00:42:55,403
Yes, sir. There were the interview
scorecards and application materials, too.

603
00:42:55,427 --> 00:42:57,923
It was really hard to find the materials.

604
00:42:57,947 --> 00:42:59,749
But this man walked in without warning and…

605
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,663
Why did CEO Jeong
order you to steal the documents?

606
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:07,891
I don't know why.

607
00:43:07,915 --> 00:43:10,459
He said he'd forgive a debt
if I followed his order.

608
00:43:15,224 --> 00:43:18,300
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

609
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,104
What about you?

610
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:25,907
I'm also fine.

611
00:43:27,924 --> 00:43:31,180
What friendly the Audit Team is
to care for each other!

612
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:36,051
I didn't expect Mr. Shin
to be this warm-hearted.

613
00:43:38,935 --> 00:43:40,261
Warm-hearted?

614

Hey.

Are you okay?

619
00:44:20,021 --> 00:44:21,310
What happened?

620
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:25,634
Thugs blocked the car

621
00:44:26,521 --> 00:44:28,937
and stole the documents.

622
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:30,171
I'm sorry.

00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:34,690

No. It's not a big deal.

Okay?

639
00:46:25,432 --> 00:46:26,432
Okay.

Are we at a mourner's house?

651
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:56,847
Everyone at the company still talks
about the Vice President and Ms. Seo Jin.

652
00:47:56,871 --> 00:48:00,180
They talk like she was hired unfairly.

653
00:48:00,204 --> 00:48:01,683
They don't even know much about it.

654
00:48:02,524 --> 00:48:03,540
Where is Seo Jin?

655
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:06,674
She took the day as a holiday.
She needs a break.

656
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:08,658
I shouldn't have let them
take away the documents.

I'm sorry.

658
00:48:10,725 --> 00:48:14,000
Why did you let them get away with it?

659
00:48:14,024 --> 00:48:17,265
No. That's not his fault.
Those thugs are bad.

660
00:48:18,391 --> 00:48:20,936
I'll be back after getting some fresh air.

661
00:48:30,218 --> 00:48:32,807
I'm worried that
Mr. Assistant Manager would blame himself.

662
00:48:32,831 --> 00:48:34,816
He has a tender heart.

00:48:42,983 --> 00:48:44,183
Do you have some time to talk?

666
00:48:45,894 --> 00:48:46,908
Yes.

667
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:54,936
Won't you go to the alumni association?

668
00:48:55,769 --> 00:48:57,359
I'm not sure because I'm busy.

00:48:57,383 --> 00:49:00,899
You've never attended it.
Will you skip this time, too?

670

I thought you had something to say to me.

671
00:49:03,937 --> 00:49:07,625
I just want to know what measures
were taken against Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

672
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:09,209
Will she receive disciplinary measures?

673
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:14,610
I can't tell you something
related to auditing.

674
00:49:14,634 --> 00:49:16,791
Is that so?

675
00:49:19,765 --> 00:49:21,475
Is there anything I can help with?

676
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:23,146

680
00:49:37,324 --> 00:49:39,724
Do you want me
to extract the customer's information?

681
00:49:39,748 --> 00:49:41,483
I'm asking you because there's no way.

682
00:49:42,268 --> 00:49:43,952
Please help me.

683
00:49:45,534 --> 00:49:48,057
Sir, I've found out something.

684
00:49:48,081 --> 00:49:52,088
I've singled out those who were
close to Director Seo at that time.

685
00:49:52,112 --> 00:49:55,173
I've found a loan shark.

686
00:49:55,197 --> 00:49:56,102
Is there any special thing about him?

687
00:49:56,126 --> 00:50:00,202

I'm also curious.

00:50:47,301 --> 00:50:48,716
Did they already finish the audit?

694
00:50:53,357 --> 00:50:55,733
Mr. Shin has found out
who was hired unfairly.

699
00:51:12,323 --> 00:51:14,339
Guard the door? Is there
someone who will attach the office?

700
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:16,419
Which door should I guard?

701
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:18,812

Why are you stopping me?

00:51:25,787 --> 00:51:27,183
Please calm down.

706
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:28,296
Stop!

707
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,056
Sir. Please calm down.

708
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,630
- Please calm down.
- Where is she?

709
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:34,078
- She's in here, right?
- We're investigating her now.

710
00:51:34,102 --> 00:51:36,040
How dare you stop me.

711
00:51:36,064 --> 00:51:37,599
Please calm down.

712
00:51:46,126 --> 00:51:49,915
It's CEO Jeong. CEO Jeong ordered us.

713
00:51:49,939 --> 00:51:51,542
Who is that bastard?

714
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,215
He's running a moneylending business
in Jongnam City.

715
00:51:56,299 --> 00:51:59,887
Your Dad runs a moneylending business.

716
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:03,257
I heard the scale is the biggest
in Jongnam city.

717
00:52:04,293 --> 00:52:05,137
So what?

718
00:52:05,161 --> 00:52:08,139
Why did you order thugs
to steal the recruitment-related documents?

719
00:52:08,163 --> 00:52:09,879
I didn't do that.

720
00:52:09,903 --> 00:52:11,527
I can bring the person
who appeared on the recording

721
00:52:11,551 --> 00:52:13,335
and make you and him confront each other.

722
00:52:15,979 --> 00:52:17,783
Suit yourself.

723
00:52:17,807 --> 00:52:20,883
I also want to know why he's setting me up.

724
00:52:20,907 --> 00:52:25,022
Why would I try to steal those documents?

725
00:52:25,046 --> 00:52:27,987
Those are 2020's
employment-related documents.

726
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:31,514
That's when you were hired.

727
00:52:31,538 --> 00:52:33,998
Does it have something to do with me?

728
00:52:34,022 --> 00:52:38,065
Those materials contain proof
of unfair employment against you.

729
00:52:38,089 --> 00:52:40,429
What a nonsense.

730
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:43,240
What are you talking about?

731
00:52:43,264 --> 00:52:46,774
And I didn't know where the documents were.

732
00:52:46,798 --> 00:52:50,481
How could I order someone to steal them?

733
00:52:50,505 --> 00:52:53,842
Wasn't it you who found the document list?

734
00:52:54,632 --> 00:52:57,822
I've checked out the CCTV.

735
00:52:57,846 --> 00:53:01,122
<i>You knew that we were going
to an archive in Incheon.</i>

736
00:53:01,146 --> 00:53:04,368
<i>And you called someone.</i>

737
00:53:04,392 --> 00:53:05,720
You must've called your dad.

738
00:53:09,106 --> 00:53:10,633
Show me your cell phone.

739
00:53:12,619 --> 00:53:15,029
That is pure conjecture on your part.

740
00:53:15,739 --> 00:53:18,199
Isn't it illegal to
investigate me like this?

741
00:53:19,086 --> 00:53:21,679
Show me proof first.

742
00:53:21,703 --> 00:53:24,320
I also want to see those documents.

743
00:53:24,344 --> 00:53:26,450
Don't suspect an innocent person like me.

744
00:53:26,474 --> 00:53:30,590
What did you do from
11 to 12 on the 21 of May?

745
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:31,913
Why are you asking that?

746
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:38,530
I was at home.
I must've fallen asleep at that time.

747
00:53:38,554 --> 00:53:40,057
Why are you asking that?

748
00:53:40,081 --> 00:53:42,466
Did you use a computer before going to bed?

749
00:53:42,490 --> 00:53:46,266
I don't know what I did.
What's the matter?

750
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:49,633
Why did you post
Ms. Yoon Seo Jin's pictures online?

751
00:53:49,657 --> 00:53:51,154
Did you try to divert attention to her

752
00:53:51,178 --> 00:53:52,826
when the unfair employment
investigation began?

753
00:53:52,850 --> 00:53:55,846
What are you talking about?
I didn't post anything like that.

754
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:58,494
I know you've sensed her closeness
with the Vice President.

755
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:00,888
So, you took pictures
and uploaded them, right?

756
00:54:00,912 --> 00:54:02,085
I didn't take any pictures.

757
00:54:02,109 --> 00:54:05,998
I was surprised by their secret
relationship when I saw the pictures.

758
00:54:06,022 --> 00:54:08,417
I'm so annoyed.

759
00:54:19,809 --> 00:54:20,962
Are you okay?

760
00:54:22,222 --> 00:54:25,967
I tried my hardest to stop him. It hurts.

761
00:54:27,329 --> 00:54:30,818
It must be Assistant Manager Jeong.
She has the face of bad fortune.

762
00:54:30,842 --> 00:54:33,912
Her father must've known some thugs well
because he's a long shark.

763
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,832
The present situation indicates
that the criminal is her.

764
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,279
But we don't have a proof.

765
00:54:38,536 --> 00:54:41,525
She's your acquaintance, isn't it?

766
00:54:41,549 --> 00:54:43,117
You must be surprised.

767
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:45,120
Ah, yes…

768
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,650
I wonder if Seo Jin is okay.

769
00:54:55,674 --> 00:54:56,765
I'm also worried about her.

770
00:54:57,594 --> 00:55:00,001
I hope she doesn't skip a meal.

771
00:55:04,114 --> 00:55:06,103
It's good for you.

772
00:55:06,127 --> 00:55:08,876
Don't skip a meal
no matter how hard things are.

773
00:55:09,727 --> 00:55:11,546
I'll eat a lot to cheer up.

774
00:55:12,803 --> 00:55:15,345
I've lived life to the full.

775
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:17,394
I won't just stand still
and let the one distress me.

776
00:55:17,418 --> 00:55:18,819
You're right.

777
00:55:57,619 --> 00:56:01,155
<i>Thugs blocked the car suddenly</i>

778
00:56:01,179 --> 00:56:02,529
<i>and stole the documents.</i>

779
00:56:02,553 --> 00:56:05,500
<i>- Hey. Do you have other companies?
- No.</i>

780
00:56:50,344 --> 00:56:55,092
You're an audit team member.
How could you ask me an illegal thing?

781
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:58,809
I used to hack with you
but don't do it anymore.

782
00:57:00,612 --> 00:57:02,168
I'm sorry.

783
00:57:02,192 --> 00:57:04,296
But you've found out something, right?

784
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,608
As you know
we don't save customer's information.

785
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,256
We advertise ourselves
as an anonymous website.

786
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,600
You got it?

787
00:57:13,758 --> 00:57:15,348
Come on.

788
00:57:15,372 --> 00:57:18,306
Your look says you've found out a way.

789
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:22,131
Listen carefully.

790
00:57:22,155 --> 00:57:24,607
It's a website for office workers.

791
00:57:24,631 --> 00:57:27,355
It authenticates users
through their company emails.

792
00:57:27,379 --> 00:57:30,640
However, users normally use
an email address for public use.

793
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:33,653
Then, it's hard to
pinpoint who the user is.

794
00:57:33,677 --> 00:57:35,656
You're right, but…

795
00:57:36,417 --> 00:57:39,287
But, the user who posted those pictures
signed up on the same day.

796
00:57:39,311 --> 00:57:40,327
What?

797
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:42,955
Request permission was done at 11:30 p.m.

798
00:57:42,979 --> 00:57:46,467
and the post was uploaded around 11:50 p.m.

799
00:57:47,197 --> 00:57:49,426
Are you saying the one posted
the pictures right after signing up?

800
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,500
Yes.

801
00:57:50,524 --> 00:57:52,533
Now, you know what you should do.

802
00:57:52,557 --> 00:57:54,130
Keep quiet.

803
00:57:54,154 --> 00:57:59,900
If I find the IP address
that checks the authentication email

804
00:57:59,924 --> 00:58:02,960
I can find who the user is, right?

805
00:58:02,984 --> 00:58:04,533
Perfect.

806
00:58:04,557 --> 00:58:07,455
Make sure I didn't tell you anything. Okay?

807
00:58:14,301 --> 00:58:15,584
Bye.

808
00:58:15,608 --> 00:58:17,277
Thank you.

809
00:58:17,301 --> 00:58:19,143
- Treat me to a nice food.
- I see.

810
00:58:19,167 --> 00:58:20,602
- Bye.
- Bye.

811
00:58:26,329 --> 00:58:27,451
Sir.

812
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:29,043
I have something to say.

813
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:47,862
It's a log-in record at 11:32 p.m.

814
00:58:50,879 --> 00:58:52,600
I've found it.

815
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,899
<i>(The detailed address is
25 Seongchon-ro, Yeonsan-gu, Seoul)</i>

816

<i>(Searching for an employee)</i>

817
00:59:15,055 --> 00:59:16,129
What?

818
00:59:17,535 --> 00:59:19,227
Why does the IP refers to…

819
00:59:40,447 --> 00:59:41,583
Mr. Assistant Manager.

820
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:50,992
Hey. What brings you here?

821
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:57,632
Why did you do that?

822
00:59:58,939 --> 01:00:00,334
What are you talking about?

823
01:00:01,793 --> 01:00:06,240
Why did you post the picture?

824
01:00:20,113 --> 01:00:23,026
<i>(The Auditors)</i>

825
01:00:43,136 --> 01:00:45,454
<i>You've violated

01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:46,690
<i>Let's have an interview.</i>

827
01:00:46,714 --> 01:00:48,792
<i>We have the proof.</i>

828

<i>You've got an eye for

<i>Sir.</i>

830
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:58,895
<i>Isn't the audit
by this kind of murderer reckless?</i>

831
01:00:58,919 --> 01:01:01,017
<i>Assistant Manager Jeong's family
complained that</i>

832
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,469
<i>you had forcefully investigated
her while auditing.</i>

833
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:05,402
<i>It's an audit about you.</i>

834
01:01:05,426 --> 01:01:07,177
<i>I'm so worried.</i>

835
01:01:07,201 --> 01:01:10,180
<i>A similar incident can happen again</i>

836
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:14,184
<i>if you keep auditing like this.</i>

837
01:01:14,208 --> 01:01:18,012
<i>I will never give up.
