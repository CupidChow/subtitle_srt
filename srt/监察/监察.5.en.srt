(All characters, organizations, and
events in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:07,551 --> 00:00:08,883
(Child actors were accompanied by family and were kept safe.)

4
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:18,753
Hey!

5
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:21,493
What is going on?

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,962
He suddenly fell.

7
00:00:25,962 --> 00:00:27,403
Hurry!

8
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:32,371
Mr. Shin,

9
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,142
they gave me this at the reception.

10
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,726
They said it came via express courier.

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:41,741

00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,929
(or everyone who uses JU Construction's dining halls...)

14
00:00:52,929 --> 00:00:54,329
(will be hurt, including the cafeteria at the head office!)

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,929
(The construction site for the shopping mall...)

16
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,299
(is the first target!)

17
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,809
This is the Audit Team.

18
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,236
How did they find out?

19
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,266
Only I knew about it.

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,459
Ms. Yu has a lot...

21
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:32,159
of time on her hands.

22
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:34,575
Maybe she got a different idea.

23
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,769
Like splitting the money with Mr. Shin.

24
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,569
She betrayed everyone until the end. What are you talking about?

25
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,085
I only said that...

26
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,685
because you said no one knew about it.

27
00:01:42,709 --> 00:01:43,980
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,540
Please continue your meal.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,180
That jerk keeps on popping up in my head. I can't eat.

30
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,579
Why would you think about him while you're eating?

31
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,995
Look, sir.

32
00:01:54,019 --> 00:01:58,490
You have so many people who respect and follow you.

33
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,029
- Hello. - Hey.

34
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,029
- Hello. - Hey.

35
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,230
You're right.

36
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:09,940
Why did I waste my time on him?

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,540
Everyone, stop eating.

38
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,109
All of you!

39
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,950
Stop eating.

40
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:31,020
We're from the Audit Team.

41
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,489
Please stop eating.

42
00:02:32,659 --> 00:02:35,360
I'm sorry, but please stop eating.

43
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,260
We're from the Audit Team.

44
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:52,379
(The Auditors)

45
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,750
(Episode 5)

46
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,479
(Audit those running the construction site dining halls.)

47
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,195
Will you be able to figure out who sent the mail?

48
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,430
I checked with the courier.

49
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:09,829
The mail was left on a bench in Hongseo Park.

50
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:12,860
I can report it to the police to investigate the area...

51
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,299
Not the police.

52
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,270
Staff and laborers included,

53
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:22,339
twelve people were hospitalized.

54
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,756
Next month is the sneak preview of J-BIMS.

55
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,679
It's an important event that'll act as a turning point for the company.

56
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:31,820
We can't let any issues arise.

57
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,949
I'll speak to the head of the hospital.

58
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:36,290
I'm sure we can cover it up saying it's food poisoning.

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,836
I want you to look into it,

60
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,190
in secret.

61
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,629
(The construction site for the shopping mall...)

62
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:47,930
(is the first target!)

63
00:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,740
(President's office)

64
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:52,840
What is it?

65
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,545
Why did you make a scene to stop people from eating?

66
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,810
You'll receive the notice.

67
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,680
What will the notice say?

68
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,149
You'll find out when you get it.

69
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,050
Do you get training to annoy people?

70
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:07,489
I don't have the time for it since my work keeps me busy.

71
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,419
How did you know Ms. Yu was there?

72
00:04:11,419 --> 00:04:14,259
How did you know I met with her?

73
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,789
You little...

74
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,500
Are you testing my patience?

75
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:23,670
- Where do you think you're going? - Vice President Hwang.

76
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,440
We're at the office. What do you think you're doing?

77
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,789
Is he your lover?

78
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:43,760
Enough is enough.

79
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,529
Gosh.

80
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:03,139
We're finally done.

81
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,386
By the way, what happened?

82
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,409
We'll be sending out the notice.

83
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,050
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,579
We'll take care of it soon.

85
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,289
Han Soo.

86
00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:24,805
- Thanks for the hard work. - Good job.

87
00:05:24,829 --> 00:05:26,159
Mr. Moon,

88
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm so furious.

89
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:29,230
Come on.

90
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,170
How can they blackmail with food?

91
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:35,209
It doesn't make any sense. I feel so sorry for the cooks.

92
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,555
We're seeing unprecedented issues.

93
00:05:36,579 --> 00:05:38,980
I can't pinpoint the name,

94
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,779
but it's because of a particular someone.

95
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:42,485
How can you joke right now?

96
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,250
So many people were hospitalized.

97
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,720
I'm not joking.

98
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,096
We'll have to do the math to get the exact number,

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,966
but the damage will likely be big.

100
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:54,159
It's going to cost extra to find a new cafeteria for the workers.

101
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,529
But the bigger issue is,

102
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:00,745
if lunchtime is extended by an hour at every site for a month,

103
00:06:00,769 --> 00:06:02,630
the process will be delayed by several days.

104
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,399
That means the damage will be...

105
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:06,545
- more than a million dollars. - Exactly.

106
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,170
We should also consider the extra costs attached...

107
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:11,409
to hiring more hands to meet the construction schedule.

108
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,386
This is what I mean.

109
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,779
Ever since Mr. Shin joined...

110
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,879
Let's have a meeting.

111
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:20,450
I mean, we should do our best in our meetings.

112
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:25,865
As for the situation during lunch,

113
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:27,160
we'll tell everyone we stopped them from eating...

114
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
as a preventive measure...

115
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,700
as there was a possibility the food was spoiled.

116
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,670
This letter will remain secret.

117
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,230
"Secret?"

118
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,446
Do you mean you won't report it?

119
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:40,269
What about the person who blackmailed us?

120
00:06:40,269 --> 00:06:41,839
We'll find them.

121
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:45,115
Inform all cafeterias on site.

122
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:48,079
Tell them not to serve anything until we tell them otherwise.

123
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:50,396
Have all the workers use restaurants outside of the sites.

124
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Okay.

125
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,950
- Please help me. - Okay.

126
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:54,189
In my opinion,

127
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:57,620
we'll get another letter soon demanding money.

128
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,136
If that happens, just give them the money.

129
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,430
It's the best solution for both sides.

130
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,776
But the letter already states what they want.

131
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,529
I don't think money is what they want.

132
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:07,199
In the end, it's always money.

133
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,899
I'll check out the dining hall at the shopping mall site first.

134
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:12,170
You should go with Ms. Yoon.

135
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,670
Investigate the situation and report back to me.

136
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,779
You'll have to investigate to find out,

137
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:18,740
but even the employees of dining halls will suffer damages.

138
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,050
So it probably wasn't the doing of someone from the dining halls.

139
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,950
I'll track down the person who sent me the mail...

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,519
and investigate for corruption in operating the on-site restaurants.

141
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:30,660
People reacted instantly while they were eating.

142
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,659
I think they added some kind of poison to the food.

143
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:35,459
If we can find that out, it'll become a clue for us.

144
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,959
This is an act of terrorism.

145
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,229
I'll find them and hold them accountable.

146
00:07:40,069 --> 00:07:42,670
I think they used this method to tip off corruption.

147
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,269
When a dining hall secures a site,

148
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,969
it can earn a million dollars in just 4 to 5 years.

149
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,639
I wouldn't be surprised if there was corruption...

150
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,985
in the bidding process.

151
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:50,409
Hold on.

152
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,379
Maybe it's someone who suffered a loss...

153
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:53,680
due to the corruption in the bidding process.

154
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:56,649
Why didn't they just report it?

155
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,449
Sure, you could feel wronged,

156
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:00,690
but one shouldn't play around with food that way.

157
00:08:01,089 --> 00:08:02,389
I'm sure they have their reasons.

158
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:04,696
No matter the reason, it's unforgivable.

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,089
Let's go.

160
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,829
Where will the workers eat if you close it down?

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,599
Hang up.

162
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:16,130
I also helped the union members...

163
00:08:16,769 --> 00:08:18,070
get their money back.

164
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,170
Why did you tell us not to find the money?

165
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,820
Thank you so much.

166
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,035
There is no order in this company anymore.

167
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:42,629
That Mr. Shin is really toxic for us.

168
00:08:42,629 --> 00:08:44,360
His rudeness is infectious.

169
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,599
Are you talking about me?

170
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,505
That's not true.

171
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:50,539
I came with closed information just for you.

172
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:52,846
It's nothing useful again, is it?

173
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,509
Think again. Remember the golf club?

174
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:57,180
- That was dead scary. I'm leaving. - Hold on.

175
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,310
Be prudent, okay?

176
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,750
I'm risking my life,

177
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:07,220
reporting every piece of information to Vice President Hwang.

178
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:10,619
Promise me you won't swing that golf club.

179
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:12,820
You don't know...

180
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,960
the reason behind the commotion during lunch, right?

181
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,200
You little... It was in the announcement.

182
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,629
Good grief. That's not everything.

183
00:09:19,629 --> 00:09:21,900
I told you I had closed information.

184
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,109
Listen. Mr. Shin received a threatening letter.

185
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,240
If he doesn't audit the on-site restaurant corruption,

186
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,450
the restaurants will all be shut down.

187
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,850
As an example, they tried to kill all the workers by poisoning...

188
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:39,096
the food at the shopping mall on-site restaurant.

189
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,920
Shocking, isn't it?

190
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,850
This is a crazy piece of information.

191
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,390
Oh, gosh. Are you okay?

192
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,060
Is there an earthquake?

193
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,960
- Goodness. - What is it?

(JU Construction)

196
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,409
Why were the shopping mall on-site restaurants shut down?

197
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,079
What? Were they shut down?

198
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,850
I wonder why they shut down.

199
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,159
I asked the question.

200
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,489
Right.

201
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,059
What's with all the sweat?

202
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,129
You see, the lower-body baths I've been taking...

203
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:23,360
must've opened up my pores.

204
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,400
I'm old, as well.

205
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,670
- Where are we going? - To the site.

206
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,730
(Audit those running the construction site dining halls.)

207
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,970
(The construction site for the shopping mall...)

208
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:03,970

(When someone is controlled by a person less than them)

212
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,770
This petty guy is acting like he owns the place.

213
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:35,970
I made it clear Yangyoon Industry...

214
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,539
gets priority in the iron subcontracting...

215
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:41,270
because they have advantages in steel structures.

216
00:11:41,809 --> 00:11:44,310
But why did you arbitrarily decide on Songdan?

217
00:11:44,809 --> 00:11:45,985
Yangyoon Industry did not meet...

218
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:48,150
the due date during the Fancheng construction...

219
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,550
Stop making me flip out, you little...

220
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,879
Director Pyeon.

221
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:06,430
Do you know how much we spent on outsourcing last year?

222
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,700
Two billion dollars.

223
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,469
But you came to the Subcontract Purchase Team...

224
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,839
simply because of the on-site restaurant selection?

225
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,340
Rumors circulate if the Audit Team Manager drops by.

226
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,310
People will think we embezzled money.

227
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:23,580
Think about it. This is just humiliating us.

228
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,696
I came to interview you...

229
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,390
with my authority as the Audit Team Manager.

230
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:29,849
Answer my question.

231
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,929
- What was your name again? - It's Shin Cha Il.

232
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:35,229
Listen, Mr. Shin.

233
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:38,336
I heard you were running wild...

234
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,105
to bump up your performance.

235
00:12:41,129 --> 00:12:43,270
I understand, okay?

236
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:47,410
But don't mess around with the outsourcing purchase.

237
00:12:48,009 --> 00:12:52,239
We select all subcontractors for JU Construction.

238
00:12:52,409 --> 00:12:54,210
Nitpick at everything,

239
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,850
and we won't meet the construction starting date.

240
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,420
How did you select the on-site restaurant operation rights?

241
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,259
After posting a bidding notice, we received proposals,

242
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,259
evaluated them, offered a contract, and signed it.

243
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,029
- Happy now? - An evidential document is needed.

244
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,259
Hey!

245
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,700
Mr. Lim!

246
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,070
Bring me the on-site restaurant selection documents.

247
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
Here's the document...

248
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,279

(On-site Restaurant Subcontractor Selection Document)

251
00:13:30,179 --> 00:13:31,480
What about documents before that?

252
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,349
Before that, the subcontractor took care of it.

253
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,690
We ended the contract with them.

254
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,789
I need to ask for documents.

255
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:40,460
Tell me the contact information of that subcontractor.

256
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,859
They went bankrupt and closed the business.

257
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:51,470
Even if you entrusted...

258
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:52,570
the operating rights' bidding to the subcontractor,

259
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,339
you would've managed them.

260
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
Saying there aren't any documents...

261
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,940
sounds like the Subcontract Purchase Headquarters...

262
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,849
didn't do their job properly.

263
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:03,950
I did say the subcontractor closed...

264
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,120
but didn't say there weren't any documents.

265
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,349
- Did I? - No, you didn't.

266
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,660
I thought you needed the most recent documents.

267
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,706
- What are you waiting for? - Sorry?

268
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,306
Go and get them.

269
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,530
Understood.

270
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,610
The lists of companies that participated...

271
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,586
in the subcontractor's bidding.

272
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,849
It's three years worth, so it's quite heavy.

273
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:39,920
Right.

274
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,920
Mr. Shin.

275
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:46,589
Shall I give you a tip-off?

276
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:52,959
Mr. Lim right here.

277
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:57,640
He pretends to be overworking but steals instant coffee.

278
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,740
He even keeps...

279
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,645
printing personal stuff with a lot of color in them.

280
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:04,839
Do you know S.I.E?

281
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:07,810
Small yet indisputable embezzlement.

282
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,150
Mr. Lim sure enjoys doing that.

283
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:15,749
I can't help but think you're dying to improve your performance.

284
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:19,119
So I'm giving you a tip-off.

285
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,700
Personal use of company items without prior consent...

286
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,229
is considered business embezzlement or theft.

287
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,476
It's regarded as trivial at first...

288
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,970
but could become worse.

289
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,070
In other words,

290
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,009
it can progress into company fund embezzlement.

291
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,609
You should stop.

292
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:39,780
All right, I will.

293
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,680
And if there's any workplace violence using authority,

294
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,180
report it to the Audit Team.

(Business License)

296
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,580
I've been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years,

297
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,709
but this is a first.

298
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:15,980
Because it was a group meal,

299
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,050
I was extra careful about hygiene.

300
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,196
To think this happened.

301
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,419
Don't worry too much.

302
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:24,820
You can reopen once the investigation is over.

303
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,089
I see.

304
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,289
Japchae is the problem, yes?

305
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:33,476
Only the workers who ate japchae got food poisoning.

306
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,905
Did an outsider enter the kitchen today?

307
00:16:35,929 --> 00:16:39,370
The outsiders would've been the food ingredient deliverers.

308
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:41,370
But we do business with them.

309
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:43,640
Can I get their contact number?

310
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,280
Of course.

311
00:16:45,909 --> 00:16:48,450
How did you win the restaurant operating rights bid?

312
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,410
Well, that's...

313
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:55,890
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

314
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,589
Couldn't you manage this place properly?

315
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,630
My apologies, sir.

316
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,469
Hi.

317
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,309
I heard it was food poisoning.

318
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,580
Yes. There was a problem with the japchae.

319
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,580
Gosh, you should've been careful.

320
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,109
Prepare us a meal.

321
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,356
I'm hungry after a small lunch.

322
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,719
That specialty of yours. Soybean paste stew.

323
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,420
Get us four portions.

324
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,090
- Leave out japchae. - I will.

325
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,729
Sit down.

326
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,740
I come here for food...

327
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:53,180
when I get hungry while making my site rounds.

328
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:54,980
This is the best on-site restaurant.

329
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,009
I see.

330
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,519
Don't make a scene over one mistake. Got it?

331
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,619
But we were given a task.

332
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:03,626
It needs further investigation.

333
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:05,519
Didn't you hear Vice President Hwang?

334
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:07,329
He's telling you to stop.

335
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:08,829
What's wrong with your team?

336
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:10,529
We're not done with the interview.

337
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:11,700
It won't take long.

338
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,500
Listen, Audit Team. Have you really lost it?

339
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,700
Mr. Yang.

340
00:18:16,029 --> 00:18:17,940
Are you verbally abusing our workers?

341
00:18:18,869 --> 00:18:20,700
- Sorry? - Apologize to them.

342
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,380
What... Why...

343
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,309
Well, I'm sorry.

344
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,466
Are you not done with the interview?

345
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,650
No. We asked how this place won...

346
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,819
the restaurant operating rights bid.

347
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,059
What's this?

348
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,529
Why would you bring up...

349
00:18:41,529 --> 00:18:43,559
the operating rights over some spoiled japchae?

350
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,359
Due to the food poisoning incident,

351
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:48,269
we're investigating how the cafeteria at the head office...

352
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:50,200
and the construction site dining halls are run.

353
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,646
I see.

354
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:55,140
Let's eat... But we can eat first, right?

355
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,469
Yes, sir.

356
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,979
I don't like this. Let's switch these.

357
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:03,950
- Don't you like pork? - Gosh, no.

358
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,950
There, that's better.

359
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,289
All right. Thanks for the food.

360
00:19:11,289 --> 00:19:12,690
Enjoy the meal.

361
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,830
Who's going to get us the soybean paste stew?

362
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,130

About the Subcontracts and Procurement Director.

368
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:38,555
Could you get me his employee profile?

369
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:39,779
Oh, sure.

370
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:43,219
So, you've met Director Pyeon In Ho?

371
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:45,360
He's kind of arrogant, isn't he?

372
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:47,690
Do you know him well?

373
00:19:47,759 --> 00:19:48,959
I sure do.

374
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,930
When President Hwang Gun Woong was here,

375
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,860
Director Pyeon was his right-hand man.

376
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:55,600
But ever since President Hwang Gun Woong ended up like that,

377
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:57,170
he's lost his influence a bit.

378
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,146
He's not exactly the current president's cup of tea.

379
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,410
Not many people in the company know how he managed...

380
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,709
to become the former president's right-hand man in the first place.

381
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,479
What do you say? Shall I tell you?

382
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:12,120
Well, it's the kind of story I can't really tell you for free,

383
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,920
but was it about three years ago?

384
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,920
Someone was occupying the construction site in Osung,

385
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,959
so the construction couldn't commence.

386
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,789
They were offered five times the market price for the land...

387
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:25,029
but wouldn't budge.

388
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,106
We found out that the owner of the land...

389
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,799
was holding out, hoping to make a fortune off it.

390
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,700
Come in.

391
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:34,585
Sir.

392
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,370
Hey, you're here.

393
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,410
So? How did it go?

394
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,779
I took care of it.

395
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,309
- You did? - Yes.

396
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:43,549
Yes!

397
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,420
A few days later,

398
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,749
they were gone.

399
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,190
How do you think that happened?

400
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:52,660
Obviously, Director Pyeon In Ho took care of it.

401
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:55,059
That was when he totally lost his servile attitude...

402
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:57,029
and became rather haughty and arrogant.

403
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,559
Then he quickly landed the most influential position in the company,

404
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:02,469
Subcontracts and Procurement Director.

405
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,670
Of course, he didn't stop there.

406
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,015
Business dinners, golf, business trips.

407
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,610
He made sure to go everywhere President Hwang Gun Woong went.

408
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:13,140
I know people call him a toothless tiger now,

409
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,009
but he still manages...

410
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:17,080
over 100 subcontractors,

411
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,350
so we should never underestimate him.

We'll have to wait a bit to find out more,

415
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,529
but many things can cause an upset stomach.

416
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,840
It's very common.

417
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,916
But if someone deliberately spiked the food,

418
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,345
there's a chance a purgative was used.

Don't worry.

Oh, right. Your brother's condition has improved significantly.

423
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,989
- Really? - Let's go inside.

424
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,906
You're here.

425
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes. I hear he's doing much better now.

426
00:22:04,829 --> 00:22:06,130
Try holding his hand.

427
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:16,886
His nerves are recovering.

428
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:18,456
It's too early to hope for a complete recovery,

429
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,916
but this is a great sign.

430
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,410
The universe is helping him.

431
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,509
Yes, for sure. I'll leave you to talk.

432
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,966
Thanks for everything you've done.

433
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,049
I'll tell him everything when he wakes up.

434
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:34,660
I'll tell Dae Woong to leave the company.

435
00:22:35,289 --> 00:22:38,360
Everything at JU Construction will go back to the way it should be.

436
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,555
See? I pigged out, and I'm fine.

437
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:55,880
And the food tasted great.

438
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:57,995
I think you've interviewed enough people,

439
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,880
so tell your manager that there's nothing to investigate here.

440
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:02,850
Yes, sir.

441
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,890
- You've eaten, so do some work. - Yes, sir.

442
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:06,459

Don't you think he's acting strange today?

445
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,870
Why is he so nice to us all of a sudden?

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,039
Earlier, I saw him trying to give you one of the side dishes,

447
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,469
so I looked at him, thinking, "What's he doing?"

448
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:25,279
Then he just ate it.

449
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,209
Weird, right?

450
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,209

452
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,789

454
00:23:37,319 --> 00:23:38,519

Yes, Mr. Shin. We interviewed them.

They said people got sick because of japchae.

462

We also tracked down everyone who delivered the ingredients.

463
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:12,019
None of them went toward Hongseo Park.

464
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:15,759
As for the management rights, they said they followed the rules.

465
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:17,830
And they received a high score in the evaluation.

466
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,860
They also said they didn't know anyone in the company.

467
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,269
To find out if the food was spiked with something,

468
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:24,946
we'd have to ask the doctors.

469
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,140

476
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,989

Do you think JU Construction needs him?

487
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:30,545
A purgative? It's used to treat constipation.

That's right.

489
00:25:31,569 --> 00:25:34,809

- Okay. - Hey.

493
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,226
Why would you keep it a secret?

494
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,220

- About what? - The on-site restaurant corruption.

508

- What? - It'll be quite noisy for a while.

If someone saw you now,

519
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,465
they'd think you were involved in the corruption.

I've reviewed all the documents...

523
00:27:13,076 --> 00:27:15,362
from the past year since we started putting out a bid notice...

524
00:27:15,386 --> 00:27:16,945
and found no issues.

525
00:27:17,015 --> 00:27:18,515
I believe the problem occurred...

526
00:27:18,515 --> 00:27:20,661
during the three years when we had an agency take care of it.

527
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:22,225
During that period, 52 businesses...

528
00:27:22,225 --> 00:27:23,755
were selected to run on-site restaurants.

529
00:27:23,755 --> 00:27:26,195
Then I'll try to find out if any of those business owners...

530
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:27,425
had an acquaintance,

531
00:27:27,425 --> 00:27:30,096
a family member, or a relative...

532
00:27:30,096 --> 00:27:31,566
affiliated with the company.

533
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:35,136
To give them the right to operate those restaurants,

534
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:37,411
it had to be someone with an executive-level position.

535
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:40,405
I'll investigate every employee, starting with the executives.

536
00:27:41,945 --> 00:27:45,546
Then I'll investigate the businesses that lost the bid.

537
00:27:46,215 --> 00:27:49,221
What should we do if we identify an executive related to the case?

538
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:51,255
I'll interview them to see if they're connected...

539
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:53,485

540
00:27:54,525 --> 00:27:57,485

541
00:28:00,925 --> 00:28:03,465

How did you know Ms. Yu was there?

548
00:28:29,856 --> 00:28:32,425

No.

553
00:28:50,546 --> 00:28:53,915
No, sir. I'm not the spy.

554
00:28:55,015 --> 00:28:56,516
The truth is...

555

She's my in-law.

She didn't know what to do to support her family,

so I...

563
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:23,606
I asked Director Pyeon to give her the rights...

00:33:14,305 --> 00:33:15,752
What's this about?

621
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,146
He's doing an interview.

622
00:33:18,546 --> 00:33:19,916
Please answer.

623
00:33:19,916 --> 00:33:21,315
I did not.

624
00:33:22,185 --> 00:33:23,745
Were you asked for a favor?

625
00:33:23,745 --> 00:33:25,485
What is your problem?

626
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:31,126

saying the Audit Team can access their company phone and laptop.

629
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:39,396
It's common sense that you two have no cause to contact each other.

631

do you agree to submit a list of your assets?

- Yes. - Yes.

636
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:00,916
Give him your phone.

637
00:34:03,225 --> 00:34:04,556
Right now?

638
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:35,525
I will ask...

639
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:39,996
a few questions and if you tell even a tiny lie,

640
00:34:40,696 --> 00:34:42,496

So the note was about Director Yang.

643
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:51,635
He looks rough and tough,

644
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:53,235
but he's a timid guy.

645
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,175
I bet he's crying somewhere.

646
00:34:57,405 --> 00:34:58,775
You knew, didn't you?

647
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,545
You knew.

648
00:35:01,885 --> 00:35:03,615
I don't believe this.

649
00:35:03,615 --> 00:35:04,991
It's unbelievable.

650
00:35:05,015 --> 00:35:07,332
What do I know when my own life's so bleak?

651
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:09,062
You knew already.

652
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:10,525
I don't know.

653
00:35:15,626 --> 00:35:17,225
(The restaurant owner and director met yesterday.)

654
00:35:20,966 --> 00:35:24,582
The restaurant owner and director met yesterday.

655
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:27,005
How could they ignore each other when they're in-laws?

656
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:29,476
That's why we need to investigate.

657
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:36,045
Send these phones to forensics.

658
00:35:36,285 --> 00:35:37,785
Ms. Yoon and Mr. Gu.

659
00:35:37,785 --> 00:35:39,261
Follow me with an Audit Team box.

660
00:35:39,285 --> 00:35:40,686
An Audit Team box?

661
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:43,885
Yes, sir.

662
00:35:44,126 --> 00:35:46,425
- See you later. - Okay.

663
00:36:19,756 --> 00:36:21,795
Can I ask what's going on?

664
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:24,402
We can't tell you right now.

665
00:36:24,426 --> 00:36:25,996
- Take everything. - Yes, sir.

I checked thoroughly,

669
00:36:47,015 --> 00:36:49,286
but I couldn't find any records he contacted Director Pyeon.

670
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:52,796
He didn't send any messages or emails either.

671
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,126
What about his company credit card?

672
00:36:54,126 --> 00:36:56,826
Director Yang made a lot of small transactions.

673
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,596
Director Pyeon didn't make any strange purchases either.

674
00:37:06,236 --> 00:37:07,605
Ms. Ok.

675
00:37:07,776 --> 00:37:09,146
Yes?

676
00:37:10,975 --> 00:37:12,945
Do you recognize this person?

677
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:14,876
I don't.

678
00:37:14,876 --> 00:37:16,685
I don't think they work here.

679
00:37:16,685 --> 00:37:18,045
Okay.

680
00:37:22,256 --> 00:37:24,126
Hey, it's time to clock out.

681
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:28,596
Go home.

682
00:37:30,825 --> 00:37:32,096
Okay.

683
00:37:32,236 --> 00:37:33,695
Let's go home.

684
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,635
Competent people leave on time.

685
00:37:39,905 --> 00:37:42,246
Why is there no trace if they lobbied?

686
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:44,306
This is going to be a headache.

687
00:37:44,405 --> 00:37:45,776
Maybe they only talked about it.

688
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:47,321
That would make things difficult.

689
00:37:47,345 --> 00:37:48,745
Stop working so hard.

690
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:50,216
Mr. Shin will figure it out on his own.

691
00:37:50,216 --> 00:37:51,546
Just act like you're working.

692
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:53,586
Just pretend, okay? I'm off.

693
00:37:53,586 --> 00:37:55,255
- Bye. - Bye.

694
00:37:56,225 --> 00:37:57,325
- See you. - Bye.

695
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:59,155
- Bye. - Bye.

696
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,526
When we seized the computers...

697
00:38:04,526 --> 00:38:06,536
and brought out the audit boxes earlier,

698
00:38:06,935 --> 00:38:08,706
did you see their faces?

699
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,465
It was pretty bad, wasn't it?

700
00:38:13,106 --> 00:38:14,806
Why do you let that bother you?

701
00:38:16,575 --> 00:38:19,016
You were born to be an auditor.

702
00:38:20,075 --> 00:38:22,686
I was a bit nervous.

703
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:28,015
Maybe Mr. Yang never asked for the favor...

704
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:29,755
and that was why there was no evidence.

705
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:32,055
To be honest, the dining hall at the shopping mall site...

706
00:38:32,055 --> 00:38:33,456
looked good.

707
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:34,832
Their prices were good too.

708
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:37,166
They hid the fact that they were in-laws.

709
00:38:37,796 --> 00:38:39,841
There was no reason to hide it if they won the bidding fairly.

710
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:42,666
All they had to do was write Mr. Yang's name on the letter.

711
00:38:42,935 --> 00:38:45,876
Why did the blackmailer choose such a dangerous way?

712
00:38:45,876 --> 00:38:48,376
Because they also don't know who's behind the corruption.

713
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:51,545
They knew there was corruption behind the bidding,

714
00:38:51,745 --> 00:38:54,016
but they didn't know who was responsible.

715
00:38:56,146 --> 00:38:58,346
There's someone who satisfies these two conditions.

716
00:38:59,955 --> 00:39:02,016
The victim who unfairly lost during the bidding process.

717
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,626
Can you give Mr. Moon a call?

718
00:39:08,626 --> 00:39:09,896
Sure.

719
00:39:17,236 --> 00:39:19,535
I uploaded a list of the businesses that didn't make the cut...

720
00:39:19,535 --> 00:39:20,905
on our shared folder.

721
00:39:24,405 --> 00:39:26,946
(List of Rejected On-site Restaurants)

722
00:39:29,216 --> 00:39:30,885
I think I found it.

723
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:36,455
This restaurant didn't make the cut for the shopping mall site,

724
00:39:36,455 --> 00:39:38,085
and they went bankrupt afterward.

725
00:39:38,185 --> 00:39:40,496
They were located close to the shopping mall site too.

726
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:42,326
Good. By the way,

727
00:39:43,066 --> 00:39:44,402
where did Mr. Shin go?

728
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:45,695
It doesn't look like he went home.

729
00:39:46,595 --> 00:39:48,565
Let's head out for now and report to him on the way.

730
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:49,905
Okay.

731
00:39:57,475 --> 00:39:59,346
Ms. Yoon, over here.

732
00:40:06,916 --> 00:40:08,155
Anyone home?

733
00:40:08,756 --> 00:40:10,025
Who is it?

734
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:13,725
I'm sorry for visiting you so late.

735
00:40:13,725 --> 00:40:15,701
Would it be possible to speak with you?

736
00:40:15,725 --> 00:40:17,071
Who are you?

737
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:19,465
We're from the Audit Team at JU Construction.

738
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:25,806
- Hello. - Hello.

739
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:32,416
JU Construction's Audit Team?

740
00:40:32,916 --> 00:40:33,946
What is this about?

741
00:40:33,946 --> 00:40:35,316
I understand that you tried to run an on-site restaurant...

742
00:40:35,316 --> 00:40:36,562
at our shopping mall site.

743
00:40:36,586 --> 00:40:38,385
But after that, your restaurant closed down.

744
00:40:38,385 --> 00:40:39,655
I wonder...

745
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:42,161
if something happened.

746
00:40:42,185 --> 00:40:44,985
Why are you asking about that now?

747
00:40:45,296 --> 00:40:47,126
When we talked back then,

748
00:40:47,126 --> 00:40:50,166
JU Construction said it had nothing to do with them.

749
00:40:50,325 --> 00:40:53,235
What do you mean?

750
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:56,206
Would you mind explaining one more time?

751
00:40:56,566 --> 00:40:58,405
We're investigating internal corruption.

752
00:40:58,405 --> 00:41:00,736
If you tell us, we might be able to help you.

753
00:41:00,736 --> 00:41:03,082
Didn't you say you were from the Audit Team?

754
00:41:03,106 --> 00:41:04,976
Why are you acting innocent?

755
00:41:05,515 --> 00:41:07,416
Gosh.

756
00:41:07,816 --> 00:41:11,786
The subcontractor holds the right to the dining halls on site.

757
00:41:11,916 --> 00:41:13,715
In order to win the bidding,

758
00:41:13,916 --> 00:41:15,985
you have to pay the subcontractor money under the table.

759
00:41:16,655 --> 00:41:18,585
It was supposed to be my turn,

760
00:41:18,626 --> 00:41:20,855
but they suddenly claimed the system changed.

761
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:23,196
How much money did you give, and to whom?

762
00:41:23,196 --> 00:41:24,565
I paid 50,000 dollars.

763
00:41:24,926 --> 00:41:27,795
I paid the subcontractor 50,000 dollars.

764
00:41:28,196 --> 00:41:29,705
You can say that I was on the luckier side.

765
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:31,506
A lot of people paid way more than that.

766
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:33,135
Why didn't you report it to the police?

767
00:41:33,676 --> 00:41:35,922
How could you give someone that much money so easily?

768
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:36,975
I heard I wouldn't be able to retrieve it...

769
00:41:36,975 --> 00:41:38,346
even through the police.

770
00:41:39,515 --> 00:41:41,376
So I went to JU Construction,

771
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:44,286
and they told me it had nothing to do with you.

772
00:41:45,185 --> 00:41:47,585
I was told to speak directly with the subcontractor.

773
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:51,126
Instead, you cornered me...

774
00:41:51,126 --> 00:41:53,496
and said bribing was nothing to be proud of.

775
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:56,896
Do you have proof that you gave them money?

776
00:41:56,896 --> 00:41:59,496
Anything will do.

777
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:03,405
Just a minute.

778
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,885
I don't know why I did that either.

779
00:42:20,685 --> 00:42:22,985
I was desperate then.

780
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,256
A paper even covered a story on him.

781
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:29,965
I had no reason to doubt.

782
00:42:31,896 --> 00:42:33,565
That money was everything to me.

783
00:42:41,575 --> 00:42:43,675
- We're back. - We're back.

("I’ll Choose an On-Site Restaurant Like My Mother’s")

786
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:54,761
The man in the picture...

787
00:42:54,785 --> 00:42:57,801
is the manager of the subcontractor who took 50,000 dollars as a bribe.

788
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,226
But there wasn't much of a proof.

789
00:43:05,196 --> 00:43:07,236
(Choi Kwang Hyun of Choi Kwang Food...)

790
00:43:12,705 --> 00:43:14,705
Looking at how she told us everything,

791
00:43:14,705 --> 00:43:17,105
I don't think she's the blackmailer.

792
00:43:17,446 --> 00:43:19,146
But it wasn't a waste of time.

793
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:22,275
We were able to find out there was corruption.

794
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:24,215
However,

795
00:43:24,615 --> 00:43:26,715
there's one thing I don't want to believe.

796
00:43:27,486 --> 00:43:30,326
It looks like someone from our company decided...

797
00:43:30,626 --> 00:43:32,496
to overlook the subcontractor's corruption.

798
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:43,936
How does the director know the manager of the subcontractor?

799
00:43:44,466 --> 00:43:47,605
It must be the director then.

800
00:43:47,905 --> 00:43:50,346
He could give the subcontractor power over the management.

801
00:43:50,876 --> 00:43:51,946
Right?

802
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:54,045
He's more likely than Mr. Yang.

803
00:43:54,916 --> 00:43:58,146
Now all the puzzles are going into their places.

804
00:43:58,646 --> 00:44:01,185
Mr. Shin, let's interview the director.

805
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:02,732
We'll find a hole when we interview him.

806
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:05,655
We'll be able to find the blackmailer fast.

807
00:44:07,026 --> 00:44:08,255
You can go home now.

808
00:44:08,756 --> 00:44:10,496
Okay. See you tomorrow.

809
00:44:24,245 --> 00:44:26,046
Stop making me flip out, you little...

810
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:27,776
Small yet indisputable embezzlement.

811
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:30,486
Mr. Lim sure enjoys doing that.

812
00:44:30,486 --> 00:44:32,486
Ms. Ok, do you know who this is?

813
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:35,316
The manager of the subcontractor who took 50,000 dollars as a bribe.

814
00:44:35,316 --> 00:44:37,686
Who do you take me for?

815
00:44:46,696 --> 00:44:48,796
- Welcome home. - I'm home.

816
00:44:48,796 --> 00:44:51,011
- You look happy today. - I am.

817
00:44:51,035 --> 00:44:52,905
Did you find the one who toyed around with food?

818
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:55,781
Not yet. But I think we're onto them.

819
00:44:55,805 --> 00:44:59,316
- Really? - Mr. Shin is being careful,

820
00:44:59,316 --> 00:45:00,575
but I have a good feeling.

821
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:01,615
Why is that?

822
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,401
Because I played a part in narrowing down the possibilities.

823
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:05,781
That's really cool.

824
00:45:06,282 --> 00:45:08,981
I'm sure you still have a lot to learn.

825
00:45:08,981 --> 00:45:11,421
I'm Gu Han Soo, you know. I'm a fast learner.

826
00:45:11,421 --> 00:45:12,621
I'll go get changed.

827
00:45:13,021 --> 00:45:15,391
- Good luck, Gu Han Soo! - Thank you.

(JU Construction)

829
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:43,839
I'm going to see the Subcontract Purchase Team.

830
00:46:01,528 --> 00:46:03,029
I'd like to request for an interview.

831
00:46:03,059 --> 00:46:04,859
Do as you please.

832
00:46:11,238 --> 00:46:12,709
You know him, don't you?

833
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:14,085
What if I do?

834
00:46:14,109 --> 00:46:16,654
Did you know he swindled money...

835
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:18,439
in exchange for promising people the on-site restaurant?

836
00:46:18,439 --> 00:46:20,408
Why must I know about that?

837
00:46:20,408 --> 00:46:22,355
Because you're the person in charge.

838
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,879
Why was the subcontractor given the right to manage it?

839
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:27,749
Back in the day,

840
00:46:27,749 --> 00:46:29,359
we had a lot of work to do.

841
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,759
So we split up the load with our subcontractors.

842
00:46:33,459 --> 00:46:35,165
Those people...

843
00:46:35,189 --> 00:46:37,899
are people who help us.

844
00:46:38,828 --> 00:46:41,268
Did you give them the management right?

845
00:46:43,298 --> 00:46:44,739
If I did,

846
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:47,109
are you going to hold me responsible?

847
00:46:47,738 --> 00:46:49,138
Look here.

848
00:46:50,138 --> 00:46:55,185
We manage over 100 subcontractors, got it?

849
00:46:55,209 --> 00:46:56,924
That place is another subcontractor.

850
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,848
Whether subcontractors take bribes or not...

851
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:02,795
can't be managed by the Purchase Team.

852
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:04,594
We're already busy as is...

853
00:47:04,618 --> 00:47:08,459
pressing those subcontractors to meet the due date!

854
00:47:10,258 --> 00:47:11,728
I see.

855
00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:15,069
This is about me golfing together, right?

856
00:47:15,368 --> 00:47:17,174
Our company executives...

857
00:47:17,198 --> 00:47:19,868
go golfing with the subcontractor workers.

858
00:47:22,269 --> 00:47:24,308
I've got a lot to settle today.

859
00:47:24,709 --> 00:47:25,749
Leave.

860
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:28,748
You're being audited, Director Pyeon.

861
00:47:29,749 --> 00:47:31,819
Rejecting the interview is your right as the auditee,

862
00:47:31,819 --> 00:47:33,288
so I'll back off.

863
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:36,919
But this will be on the official record.

864
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,959

Good grief.

873
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:28,739

A relative of Director Yang Jae Seung...

876
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:43,119
was running an on-site restaurant.

877
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:47,759
We're investigating if Director Pyeon In Ho was solicited.

878
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:50,059
You'll get nothing out of it.

879
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,998
Why? Because there was no solicitation.

880
00:48:57,999 --> 00:49:00,539
I'll be plain honest with you.

881
00:49:00,709 --> 00:49:03,239
Listen carefully. Believe it or not, it's the truth.

882
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:05,378
The two had a meal together.

883
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:08,048
Mr. Yang paid for it with his personal credit card.

884
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:11,348
He simply recommended the wife during the meal.

885
00:49:11,348 --> 00:49:12,619
Recommended, okay?

886
00:49:12,848 --> 00:49:13,848
That was it.

887
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:16,059
The fact that a superior bought a meal and made a recommendation...

888
00:49:16,059 --> 00:49:18,059
means he used his authority to put pressure.

889
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:20,258
In your eyes, everything is corrupted,

890
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:22,128
and everyone fools the other. Right?

891
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:25,329
Director Pyeon doesn't even own a house.

892
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,699

Mr. Yang and Director Pyeon...

896
00:49:41,649 --> 00:49:43,718
handed them in, having lost the workers' faith...

897
00:49:43,718 --> 00:49:44,949
due to the unreasonable audit.

898
00:49:46,189 --> 00:49:48,919
If the two leave the company like this,

899
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,759
the construction contract we won will take a big hit.

900
00:49:53,258 --> 00:49:56,528
Bring me one solid piece of evidence!

901
00:50:04,399 --> 00:50:05,838
You owe an apology, don't you?

00:50:30,629 --> 00:50:32,358
and post it...

905
00:50:33,669 --> 00:50:34,969
on every intranet forum.

906
00:50:37,569 --> 00:50:38,938
So you're human, too.

907
00:50:43,278 --> 00:50:44,539
An agency?

908
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:47,649
Gosh, I was on the Audit Team for four years...

909
00:50:47,649 --> 00:50:50,225
but had no idea that was the case for our on-site restaurants.

910
00:50:50,249 --> 00:50:52,765
It was none of our concern when Mr. Kwak was here.

911
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:53,988
That was our prime.

912
00:50:53,988 --> 00:50:55,918
And everything is blowing up now.

913
00:50:56,658 --> 00:50:57,734
Right.

914
00:50:57,758 --> 00:51:00,059
Mr. Shin will fix things.

915
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:02,574
What is he? A doctor to fix things?

916
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:04,528
Look at you people.

917
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:14,739
I will upload an apology letter...

918
00:51:15,269 --> 00:51:16,909
on the intranet forum.

919
00:51:20,979 --> 00:51:23,378
We'll stop auditing the on-site restaurants.

920
00:51:23,548 --> 00:51:26,219
Mr. Shin. Why all of a sudden?

921
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:28,449
There's no evidence.

922
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:30,919
The tip-off was made through a threat,

923
00:51:30,919 --> 00:51:32,234
so it's not credible.

924
00:51:32,258 --> 00:51:34,489
In conclusion, the audit was unreasonable.

925
00:51:35,089 --> 00:51:37,229
What about the person who sent the threatening letter?

926
00:51:37,229 --> 00:51:39,158
We should find them, no?

927
00:51:39,158 --> 00:51:40,929
It was a laxative.

928
00:51:40,968 --> 00:51:42,528
Stop fussing over a prank.

929
00:51:43,198 --> 00:51:44,899
Mr. Gu and Ms. Yoon.

930
00:51:44,899 --> 00:51:47,338
Put up the apology letter on all bulletin boards.

931
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:50,539
The on-site restaurants will run again as soon as...

932
00:51:50,539 --> 00:51:52,949
the hospital identifies the medicine composition.

933
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:55,249
Gradually, starting tomorrow,

934
00:51:55,249 --> 00:51:57,955
starting with our cafeteria, the restaurants will reopen.

935
00:51:57,979 --> 00:52:00,519
Mr. Shin, if we reopen the cafeteria,

936
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:02,119
it could become a target again.

937
00:52:16,169 --> 00:52:18,468
(Letter of Apology)

938
00:52:19,238 --> 00:52:20,568
Greetings,

939
00:52:20,769 --> 00:52:22,469
executives and staff members of JU Construction.

940
00:52:22,939 --> 00:52:24,609
This is Audit Team Manager Shin Cha Il.

941
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:25,979
(Letter of Apology)

942
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:28,408
Firstly, my apologies...

943
00:52:28,408 --> 00:52:30,495
for demoralizing everyone...

944
00:52:30,519 --> 00:52:33,989
with an unreasonable audit despite the lack of sufficient evidence.

945
00:52:34,388 --> 00:52:38,165
My deepest apologies for causing pain, anxiety,

946
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:40,159
and extreme concern.

947
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:42,459
It was my carelessness to launch an audit...

948
00:52:42,459 --> 00:52:44,758
with a report that had little or no credibility.

949
00:52:44,758 --> 00:52:45,758
(Letter of Apology)

950
00:52:46,328 --> 00:52:47,929
Another apologies...

951
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,598
to Director Yang Jae Seung and Director Pyeon In Ho...

952
00:52:50,598 --> 00:52:51,969
for causing damage.

953
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:54,168
I am filled with regret.

954
00:52:54,339 --> 00:52:56,539
Please accept my sincere apology.

955
00:52:56,539 --> 00:52:57,578
(Subcontracts and Procurement Director Pyeon In Ho)

956
00:52:57,609 --> 00:52:58,838
As of this moment,

957
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:01,048
the on-site restaurant operation rights audit...

958
00:53:01,048 --> 00:53:02,608
will be suspended.

959
00:53:03,178 --> 00:53:05,248
From now on, I will exercise prudence.

960
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:09,148
I will endeavor to conduct a proper audit.

961
00:53:09,758 --> 00:53:12,659
My sincerest apologies once again.

962
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:16,458
I don't understand.

963
00:53:17,899 --> 00:53:19,298
Why did Mr. Shin...

964
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:21,329
It must be President Hwang's order.

965
00:53:22,328 --> 00:53:24,568
Do you really think he's obeying his order?

966
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,168
We're talking about Mr. Shin.

967
00:53:26,638 --> 00:53:27,738
I doubt it.

968
00:53:27,738 --> 00:53:29,139
Remember?

969
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:33,079
An audit team member gets paid to work for their private interest.

970
00:53:37,019 --> 00:53:38,519
(Uncle)

971
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:42,918
Let me answer this call.

972
00:53:42,988 --> 00:53:44,559
Okay. I'll take that.

973
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:49,347
(Letter of Apology)

974
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,415
This is Yoon Seo Jin.

975
00:53:59,439 --> 00:54:00,708
Don't talk. Just listen.

976
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:03,708
I don't think I gave you an answer back then.

977
00:54:04,278 --> 00:54:06,809
Had the union members' money not been found,

978
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:10,318
the company would've suffered a huge blow to its reputation.

979
00:54:11,479 --> 00:54:13,789
I didn't stop them from finding it.

980
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:17,259
I had a plan of my own.

981
00:54:19,019 --> 00:54:20,289
Shin Cha Il...

982
00:54:20,859 --> 00:54:24,458
prioritizes his cause more than the company's interest.

983
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,128
I'm different from him.

984
00:54:27,928 --> 00:54:30,199
Rather than a useless cause,

985
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:32,199
I will do...

986
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:35,708
what I must to protect our company...

987
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,278
and workers.

988
00:54:40,649 --> 00:54:42,278
I feel like a stranger, right?

989
00:54:43,048 --> 00:54:44,378
But listen.

990
00:54:44,819 --> 00:54:46,588
The company...

991
00:54:47,218 --> 00:54:48,619
is like a battlefield to me.

992
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,318
I must be a savage to protect my family.

993
00:54:52,928 --> 00:54:54,889
And you know who I consider my family, right?

994
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:58,458
It's you and my older sister.

995
00:55:00,428 --> 00:55:02,344
I'll go to my sister's house today.

996
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:04,039
Shall we grab dinner together?

997
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:05,968
All right, Uncle.

998
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:07,208
Great.

999
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:18,418
Come in.

1000
00:55:19,718 --> 00:55:21,919
Goodness, Mr. Yang.

1001
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:23,688
You had it tough until now.

1002
00:55:24,218 --> 00:55:25,419
I knew it.

1003
00:55:25,419 --> 00:55:27,789
I knew you were innocent.

1004
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:28,828
You would never, right?

1005
00:55:28,828 --> 00:55:30,798
You would never do such a reckless thing.

1006
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:32,599
You're upright. What is it?

1007
00:55:37,738 --> 00:55:40,209
I may be leaving, but I'm always on your side.

1008
00:55:40,209 --> 00:55:42,838
I'll be more than happy as long as you remember that.

1009
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:51,079
- Aren't you going home? - I will.

1010
00:55:51,419 --> 00:55:53,625
But Mr. Shin is nowhere to be seen.

1011
00:55:53,649 --> 00:55:54,849
Gosh.

1012
00:55:55,448 --> 00:55:58,089
Since the audit is over, how about some fried chicken and beer?

1013
00:55:58,089 --> 00:56:00,265
I'm afraid I have plans tonight.

1014
00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:01,634
I'm in a rush, too.

1015
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:04,404
Goodness gracious, you're all lousy.

1016
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,798
I'm off.

1017
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:07,728
We're leaving first, Han Soo.

1018
00:56:08,229 --> 00:56:10,239
- Okay. Bye. - Go home.

1019
00:56:27,118 --> 00:56:29,559
(Letter of Apology)

1020
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:38,329
Oh, right. Your brother's condition has improved significantly.

1021
00:56:39,129 --> 00:56:42,004
I'll tell Dae Woong to leave the company.

1022
00:56:42,028 --> 00:56:45,269
Everything at JU Construction will go back to the way it should be.

1023
00:56:47,408 --> 00:56:48,838
It should go back...

1024
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:52,478
to how it should be.

1025
00:57:13,328 --> 00:57:14,428
(Contents of the threatening note)

1026
00:57:14,428 --> 00:57:16,638
(Including the cafeteria at the head office!)

1027
00:57:19,399 --> 00:57:20,739
Hang on.

1028
00:57:20,908 --> 00:57:24,838
Only the staff are allowed to eat at our cafeteria.

1029
00:57:25,479 --> 00:57:27,748
Does this really involve an insider?

1030
00:57:48,528 --> 00:57:50,169
(Manager Shin Cha Il)

1031
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:58,340
Mr. Shin joined the team about 20 days ago.

1032
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:01,771
The blackmailer knew...

1033
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,581
our team had a new manager.

1034
00:58:08,011 --> 00:58:09,651
Someone in the company...

1035
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:16,121
The blackmailer is an insider.

1036
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,360
Mr. Shin...

1037
00:58:19,861 --> 00:58:21,390
knew that already.

1038
00:58:21,491 --> 00:58:23,830
We'll stop auditing the on-site restaurants.

1039
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,861
Gradually, starting tomorrow,

1040
00:58:25,861 --> 00:58:28,801
starting with our cafeteria, the restaurants will reopen.

1041
00:58:28,801 --> 00:58:30,701
Mr. Shin, if we reopen the cafeteria,

1042
00:58:30,701 --> 00:58:32,300
it could become a target again.

1043
00:58:32,370 --> 00:58:33,741
He reduced the targets...

1044
00:58:33,741 --> 00:58:36,416
from all the restaurants to just our cafeteria...

1045
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,311
and announced the audit was over...

1046
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:41,610
to goad the blackmailer to attack.

1047
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,890
(Dark Soy Sauce)

1048
01:01:09,701 --> 01:01:11,061
Mr. Shin, over there!

1049
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,921
Tell me what floor it stops at.

1050
01:01:39,361 --> 01:01:40,631
The rooftop.

1051
01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:47,471
(Stairwell)

1052
01:01:53,671 --> 01:01:54,841
(Rooftop)

1053
01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:33,881
(The Auditors)

1054
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:35,151
(Special thanks to Cho Han Cheul,)

1055
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,350
(Woo Ji Hyun, Hong Soo Hyun, Kim Soo Jin.)

1056
01:02:54,477 --> 01:02:55,913
Did you send this?

1057
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:58,354
The Audit Team caught the blackmailer.

1058
01:02:58,378 --> 01:03:00,148
How about we approach them first...

1059
01:03:00,148 --> 01:03:02,589
so they can report to us freely...

1060
01:03:02,613 --> 01:03:04,753
by putting up this notice?

1061
01:03:05,383 --> 01:03:06,569
What's he doing?

1062
01:03:06,593 --> 01:03:08,893
I want to report workplace bullying.

1063
01:03:09,553 --> 01:03:10,939
- Yoon Woo. - Don't come closer!

1064
01:03:10,963 --> 01:03:12,022
What's this for?

1065
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,293
I never bullied or verbally abused anyone.

1066
01:03:14,363 --> 01:03:16,632
I heard President Hwang told you to let it go.

1067
01:03:17,403 --> 01:03:18,732
J-BIMS is almost done,

1068
01:03:18,732 --> 01:03:21,173
and I get how anxious you are about it.

1069
01:03:22,102 --> 01:03:24,078
It's no fun to release it at once.

1070
01:03:24,102 --> 01:03:25,543
I'll make him wither away.

1071
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:27,813
Slowly.
