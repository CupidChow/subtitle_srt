<i>(The Auditors)</i>

2
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:00,057
Arrest the Union president!

3
00:01:00,081 --> 00:01:03,537
Arrest him! Take responsibility!

4
00:01:03,561 --> 00:01:05,857
A fraudulent embezzlement occurred.

5
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:09,561
The president of Nanum Housing
renovation union scammed its members.

6
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:13,327
The housing division head agreed

7
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:15,947
that JU Construction was accountable.

8
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:17,577
The victims lost 3.4 billion won

9
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:21,587
on December 27th last year.

10
00:01:21,611 --> 00:01:23,277
- Goo Han Soo.
- Yeah.

11
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:26,097
Introduce
Nanum Housing Renovation Project to us.

12
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:28,931
Oh, well…

13
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:32,177
It's community project
initiated by JU Construction,

14
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:36,531
aiming at rebuilding
for low-income families, and…

15
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:43,457
The project is of small scale,
only involving willing residents.

16
00:01:43,481 --> 00:01:45,617
So it goes well.

17
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,127
The members are entitled to benefits
like low-interest loans

18
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,587
and lots of company support.

19
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:52,131
Yeah, that's right.

20
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:56,537
So, the 3.4 billion won loan was embezzled?

21
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:59,747
The Union project's budget
only amounts to 3.4 billion?

22
00:01:59,771 --> 00:02:01,677
Normally, they handle billion-won projects.

23
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,831
For Union members, that's lifetime savings.

24
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:08,331
Let's start the audit.

25
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:14,221
We're doing this for those
who were betrayed and lost hope.

26
00:02:14,991 --> 00:02:17,577
Isn't that the police's job?

27
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:21,901
We'll start with the
housing division director.

28
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,501
Yes, sir.

29
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:40,291
This is Yoo Mi Kyung
from the housing division.

30
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:08,041
Sir, here comes Director Yoo.

31
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:25,031
I'm Shin Cha Il,
leader of the audit team.

32
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:28,351
Please cooperate with us.

33
00:03:30,401 --> 00:03:31,401
You are…

34
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,061
<i>(The Auditors)</i>

35
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:50,997
The issue is about the Nanum Housing
Renovation Project launched last January.

36
00:03:51,021 --> 00:03:53,917
Union members are accusing the president

37
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:57,081
and you are also
accountable for missing funds.

38
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:17,431
The Union president
came with a business plan

39
00:04:18,651 --> 00:04:20,367
signed by the members.

40
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:25,227
I had no reason not to approve the
withdrawal for someone with a proxy stamp.

41
00:04:25,251 --> 00:04:27,507
That business plan was fake.

42
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,797
You didn't verify it properly.

43
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:32,987
I was busy with performance approvals
for each department.

44
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:34,011
That's just an excuse.

45
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,501
I didn't expect this…

46
00:04:38,301 --> 00:04:40,401
I know those members are struggling…

47
00:04:41,611 --> 00:04:43,371
It's the president who deceived us…

48
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,111
How are you doing?

49
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:53,797
I really worry about you…

50
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:57,077
Miss, we are in the middle of
an embezzlement interview right now.

51
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:59,451
Please cease it.

52
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,821
Let's reschedule it.

53
00:05:09,701 --> 00:05:13,267
Mr. Shin and Director Yoo graduated from
the same university, the same department.

54
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,407
Mr. Shin is two years older than her.

55
00:05:15,431 --> 00:05:22,117
I guess they used to date, or…

56
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:24,657
Don't be silly.

57
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:26,737
If graduating from the same place
means they used to date,

58
00:05:26,761 --> 00:05:28,741
I must have dated Myung Sun
from marketing too.

59
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,117
Did you see, guys?

60
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:36,481
Director Yoo got teary-eyed
the moment she saw Mr. Shin.

61
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:41,387
If she cried, it must've been
Mr. Shin who called it off.

62
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,421
I know it!

63
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:47,247
Director Yoo is married…
Speculating like this seems a little…

64
00:05:47,271 --> 00:05:49,577
Just chatting among ourselves.

65
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:53,421
Small talk like this fuels rumors.
Rumors are like malicious comments.

66
00:05:54,211 --> 00:05:57,007
I agree. Hansoo, you're too much.

67
00:05:57,031 --> 00:05:58,957
- What?
- You're too mean.

68
00:05:58,981 --> 00:06:02,431
- Me?
- Stop disseminating rumors.

69
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:08,651
Just one more interview please.

70
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,817
Sir, are you heading
for the Nanum housing area?

71
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,837
Yes.

72
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:31,491
Can I come? I know that neighborhood well
and can assist you.

73
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,117
Check Director Yoo's
financial card transactions.

74
00:06:37,141 --> 00:06:38,141
Okay.

75
00:06:45,401 --> 00:06:47,367
As expected, he doesn't
care about school ties,

76
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:50,961
regional connections,
or relationships.

77
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:53,377
Truly fair and just.

78
00:06:53,401 --> 00:06:57,271
He just lacks humanity.
Stop beating around the bush.

79
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:10,647
You have two choices.

80
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:12,397
First, you can deny everything.

81
00:07:12,421 --> 00:07:15,057
Second, admit and apologize.

82
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,334
If you choose the first one,

83
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:19,147
I'm going to release the CCTV
video of you burning the laptop.

84
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:22,951
- I'm sorry.
- Now JU Construction is doing well.

85
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:40,731
Hey, Mr. Shin.

86
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:52,517
I need some condolence money.
But I got a pay cut, so I'm short on money.

87
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,751
Can you chip in?

88
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:58,361
Sounds like you're joking,
I'll just laugh it off.

89
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,251
You bastard…

90
00:08:15,501 --> 00:08:17,371
- This area?
- Yeah.

91
00:08:18,391 --> 00:08:22,207
There are 8 houses and 9 buildings
with multiple units lining the alley.

92
00:08:22,231 --> 00:08:25,421
They are the 17 members
of the Nanum Housing Renovation Project.

93
00:08:26,561 --> 00:08:28,561
This place urgently needs repairs.

94
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:33,411
You're Seo Jin, huh?

95
00:08:34,151 --> 00:08:37,207
Oh, it's you.

96
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:40,997
It's been a while. Is your mom alright?

97
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,021
Yes, she is.

98
00:08:44,391 --> 00:08:46,087
Hi, Min Hee and Min Seok.

99
00:08:46,111 --> 00:08:47,471
Hello.

100
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,881
He leads the audit team.

101
00:08:52,411 --> 00:08:53,851
Where does the Union president live?

102
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:18,541
How do you know him?

103
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:26,317
I've even come to this house
with the police before.

104
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,457
The police acted like
he would catch him right away,

105
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:31,307
but it's been two months
without any updates.

106
00:09:31,331 --> 00:09:33,927
That's why people went to protest.

107
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,737
How did you know the Union president?

108
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:39,091
He has lived in the same neighborhood
with us for ten years.

109
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,527
Looks like a leaflet handed out
by the Union president, huh?

110
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:47,281
He said he'd let us live in such a
fancy house, so we just stamped it.

111
00:09:50,661 --> 00:09:52,747
Is there any evidence
showing he's withdrawn the money?

112
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:57,177
After I kept nagging the police,
they showed me this.

113
00:09:57,201 --> 00:10:00,667
Then I showed it to other Union members.

114
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:03,907
Look, that was 3.4 billion.

115
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:07,597
What makes you certain
that Director Yoo was part of this?

116
00:10:07,621 --> 00:10:12,287
She's the one who approved all this,
so of course, she was part of it!

117
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,797
Sir, that's not what he mean.

118
00:10:14,821 --> 00:10:19,322
Director Yoo wouldn't have come to the
company if there had been any collusion.

119
00:10:19,346 --> 00:10:22,399
It's she who opened the warehouse.
It's like letting a thief in!

120
00:10:23,402 --> 00:10:25,903
We've lost our life savings…

121
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:28,229
Until we catch the Union president,

122
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,626
the blame is all on her.

123
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:45,208
Why are you picking at it?

124
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:48,509
Well, why is this so salty?

125
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:50,400
I have high blood pressure.

126
00:10:50,424 --> 00:10:53,751
And Director Yang is in trouble.

127
00:10:53,775 --> 00:10:55,118
How can I have an appetite?

128
00:10:55,142 --> 00:10:57,896
Just eat something tasty
to help you get over this.

129
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:04,117
Want me to set up a meeting with him?

130
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:05,141
How?

131
00:11:16,795 --> 00:11:19,194
- Hello.
- I've got good news for you.

132
00:11:19,218 --> 00:11:21,748
You heard about the
matter this morning, huh?

133
00:11:21,772 --> 00:11:25,345
It's related to the approval made
by Director Yoo of the Housing Division…

134
00:11:25,369 --> 00:11:26,792
Get to the point!

135
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,497
Oh, sorry…

136
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,788
I heard Director Yoo

137
00:11:30,812 --> 00:11:32,668
and Mr. Shin are alumni.

138
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,958
Rumor has it that they were

139
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:37,251
in a relationship before.

140
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,781
Oh, look at you.

141
00:11:44,887 --> 00:11:46,727
Are you afraid of
the Housing Minister's power?

142
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:51,713
You don't have to spend money on the
funeral of the vice minister's grandmother.

143
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:52,759
How much is it?

144
00:11:52,783 --> 00:11:53,783
50,000 won.

145
00:11:54,524 --> 00:11:55,594
Are you kidding?

146
00:11:55,618 --> 00:11:57,571
Don't you know the Anti-Corruption Act
for Public Officials?

147
00:11:57,595 --> 00:11:59,813
Hwang Geon-woong
didn't go this far, though.

148
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:27,215
Hello. Sir.

149
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:30,231
I am here to give my condolences.

150
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:31,692
Thank you.

151
00:12:31,716 --> 00:12:33,186
Is the construction going well?

152
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:36,058
Have you handled the Tower Crane accident?

153
00:12:36,845 --> 00:12:37,988
Yeah, kind of.

154
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,675
Grandpa!

155
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:44,532
Our grandson should live in a world
without such accidents…

156
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:45,740
Don't be silly.

157
00:12:47,004 --> 00:12:51,986
He'll live in a world
without financial worries.

158
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,577
You want some allowance?

159
00:12:53,601 --> 00:12:54,976
Thank you.

160
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:12,792
Hello.

161
00:13:12,816 --> 00:13:15,968
Hi, it's me, Ok Ah Jeong.
I've checked Yoo's card transactions.

162
00:13:15,992 --> 00:13:18,142
It seems that she has only
paid for staff dinners.

163
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,037
Just in case, I interviewed
the Housing Division staff.

164
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:24,284
They all said Yoo was taken advantage of
by the Union president.

165
00:13:24,308 --> 00:13:25,308
I see.

166
00:13:26,268 --> 00:13:28,975
If she was deceived, what happens next?

167
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,568
She remains at fault.

168
00:13:30,592 --> 00:13:32,432
She was negligent during
the approval process.

169
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:37,200
Does she have to take responsibility
for the 3.4 billion won?

170
00:13:37,224 --> 00:13:40,559
If it wasn't deliberate embezzlement,
JU Construction should compensate.

171
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,831
However, there will be disciplinary action.

172
00:13:42,855 --> 00:13:44,300
Even legal action if necessary.

173
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:59,852
Park the car please, then you can go home.

174
00:13:59,876 --> 00:14:00,876
Huh?

175
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:18,106
You're curious about what they'll say,
aren't you?

176
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:52,967
We might get caught by him.

177
00:14:52,991 --> 00:14:55,521
Well, we can just say
we came for a drink.

178
00:14:57,374 --> 00:14:58,428
What do you like to drink?

179
00:15:03,322 --> 00:15:05,291
Feels like a relief now.

180
00:15:07,385 --> 00:15:09,127
How have you been lately?

181
00:15:14,267 --> 00:15:15,790
Let's proceed with the interview.

182
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,771
How did you come to know
the Union president?

183
00:15:23,012 --> 00:15:24,475
Things haven't been going well for me.

184
00:15:24,499 --> 00:15:26,473
I'm not interested in your personal life.

185
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:28,638
How did you come to
know the Union president?

186
00:15:31,324 --> 00:15:36,358
He requested the housing project
over the phone.

187
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:40,365
Our performance wasn't up to
par this quarter, so we went for it.

188
00:15:40,389 --> 00:15:42,670
When did you find out the president
had withdrawn the money?

189
00:15:42,694 --> 00:15:44,804
The police told me.

190
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:46,388
I was questioned by the police
that day.

191
00:15:48,391 --> 00:15:51,158
I was shocked,

192
00:15:51,182 --> 00:15:54,072
but I told them everything I knew.

193
00:15:55,177 --> 00:15:56,538
Have you…

194
00:15:58,103 --> 00:16:00,509
met the Union president privately?

195
00:16:00,533 --> 00:16:02,818
Why would I meet him privately?

196
00:16:04,272 --> 00:16:05,842
Are you doubting me now?

197
00:16:05,866 --> 00:16:07,964
Have you?

198
00:16:07,988 --> 00:16:10,945
I was just happy to see you.

199
00:16:10,969 --> 00:16:13,175
Can't you treat me like you used to?

200
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:15,844
Are you having financial problems?

201
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:17,143
Why are you asking like that?

202
00:16:17,846 --> 00:16:19,219
Do you think I embezzled the money?

203
00:16:19,243 --> 00:16:22,467
I know you've applied for
transfer to the Florida branch.

204
00:16:27,334 --> 00:16:28,334
Right.

205
00:16:30,186 --> 00:16:31,390
I got divorced.

206
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:34,106
I just want to leave this place.

207
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,636
Can't believe I'm showing

208
00:16:40,644 --> 00:16:43,297
this side of me to you…

209
00:16:46,289 --> 00:16:47,949
She is crying again.

210
00:16:48,849 --> 00:16:50,656
He's making her cry.

211
00:16:51,872 --> 00:16:54,037
Isn't this aggressive audit
illegal right now?

212
00:16:55,837 --> 00:16:58,672
Peeping is actually worse legally.

213
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,050
No way.

214
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:16,447
Thanks for taking me home.

215
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:19,421
I'll take responsibility

216
00:17:20,215 --> 00:17:21,875
for my mistake.

217
00:17:23,198 --> 00:17:24,718
I won't dodge it.

218
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,653
So, tell me your story.

219
00:17:28,677 --> 00:17:30,684
How did you join the audit team?

220
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:37,097
You've changed a lot.

221
00:17:37,121 --> 00:17:39,960
In college, you weren't scary at all.

222
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:44,680
You were kind, warm,

223
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,192
and cool.

224
00:17:47,216 --> 00:17:49,273
I will do the computer forensics tomorrow.

225
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,549
Did you see it?

226
00:18:17,573 --> 00:18:19,240
Does this really make sense?

227
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,996
He can't distinguish
between work and personal matters…

228
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,555
I think he's just helping her
because she got hurt.

229
00:18:24,579 --> 00:18:26,461
No, there was something going on.

230
00:18:26,485 --> 00:18:28,706
You're drunk. Let's go.

231
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,164
No, I'm not drunk.

232
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:33,911
I need to check if he will come out.

233
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,392
I'm leaving.

234
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:45,385
Mr. Shin.

235
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:49,234
We had such a good time back in school.

236
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,391
A 30-degree blade gives you
better cutting power

237
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:58,903
and allows for more detailed work.

238
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:04,994
Why did you choose the major architecture?

239
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:07,821
To help my dad.

240
00:19:08,571 --> 00:19:11,919
Don't use super glue.
It can melt the foam board.

241
00:19:14,732 --> 00:19:16,774
I chose it because I want to live
in a fairy tale.

242
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:21,538
Build fairy tale houses
in a fairy tale village,

243
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:24,234
and meet a fairy tale guy.

244
00:19:48,969 --> 00:19:50,299
Two billion won per house?

245
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:55,255
Are you saying our house in Yang Hee-dong
got scammed too?

246
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:59,937
If we had stayed there,
we would've been scammed too.

247
00:19:59,961 --> 00:20:01,841
If Daewoong hadn't gotten us this house…

248
00:20:03,498 --> 00:20:06,812
Lately, he hasn't been eating well
and seems a bit irritable.

249
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,278
Is something wrong at work?

250
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:29,760
How's you new leader?

251
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,058
Is everything ok?

252
00:20:33,084 --> 00:20:37,063
The boss even brought in outsiders
to get rid of me.

253
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:39,199
It sucks…

254
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,335
I had nowhere to turn,

255
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:44,452
but having you makes me feel secure.

256
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:48,253
If anyone bothers you, tell me.

257
00:20:48,277 --> 00:20:49,277
I will punish…

258
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,387
It's done, anything else?

259
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:55,866
Just name it.

260
00:21:23,876 --> 00:21:25,879
What smells…

261
00:21:25,903 --> 00:21:28,997
Geez, Han Soo!

262
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,199
Hey!

263
00:21:31,232 --> 00:21:32,368
Ouch!

264
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,942
- Are you not going to work?
- What time is it?

265
00:21:33,966 --> 00:21:36,634
Nice going!

266
00:21:54,436 --> 00:21:56,296
Hey sir,

267
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,955
you said the interview is a priority,

268
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:02,302
but it turns out dating was
more important to you.

269
00:22:06,174 --> 00:22:09,906
You were mean to Mr. Bae,

270
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:13,705
but so gentle with Director Yoo.

271
00:22:13,729 --> 00:22:16,920
You're like… the…

272
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,710
Sweet boy!

273
00:22:20,145 --> 00:22:23,483
You made me leave the audit team

274
00:22:23,507 --> 00:22:26,356
because I trust people too easily.

275
00:22:27,408 --> 00:22:29,735
But why do you act like that?

276
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:34,162
Mr. Shin Cha Il!

277
00:22:37,717 --> 00:22:39,289
You are so…

278
00:22:39,313 --> 00:22:41,689
Lovey dovey.

279
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:45,346
Please…

280
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:49,448
Please love me too.

281
00:22:50,283 --> 00:22:51,702
Just as you like her, please.

282
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:06,027
What's got you looking so miserable?

283
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:07,852
Smile at the workplace.

284
00:23:14,243 --> 00:23:16,638
Hi, is our leader here?

285
00:23:16,662 --> 00:23:18,262
He went to the ethics committee.

286
00:23:18,286 --> 00:23:19,388
What? Why?

287
00:23:19,412 --> 00:23:21,250
Check the bulletin board.

288
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,274
Look at this!

289
00:23:31,797 --> 00:23:33,503
What's this? For real?

290
00:23:41,489 --> 00:23:44,427
This morning, Director Yoo called.

291
00:23:44,451 --> 00:23:48,870
She said that yesterday,
Mr. Shin used the interview

292
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:52,529
as an excuse to get her drunk.
While she was drunk, he followed her home.

293
00:23:53,259 --> 00:23:55,890
Luckily, she regained
consciousness just in time…

294
00:23:55,914 --> 00:23:57,633
She almost got raped.

295
00:23:59,235 --> 00:24:03,396
She's in the hospital now, traumatized.

296
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,615
What's the point of this?
It's clearly sexual assault.

297
00:24:09,056 --> 00:24:11,893
Still hung up on your ex?

298
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:12,958
Is it true?

299
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:20,116
- No, it's not.
- Playing dumb, huh?

300
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,175
What about the photos?

301
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:26,390
Why are you hesitating?

302
00:24:26,414 --> 00:24:29,052
Mr. Cho, what's there left to consider?

303
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:33,073
If we can't resolve this internally
and trigger legal action,

304
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,566
the company's image will be damaged

305
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:37,699
The photos are clear enough to prove it.

306
00:24:38,472 --> 00:24:39,472
I agree.

307
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,736
If this don't get solved by next week,

308
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,920
Director Yoo will be transferred
to the Florida office.

309
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:48,055
Handle it before then.

310
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:54,530
Huh?

311
00:24:56,071 --> 00:24:57,048
What the…

312
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:59,544
Yoo is under audit herself,

313
00:24:59,568 --> 00:25:00,859
so we need to watch her closely.

314
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:06,556
Mind your own business.

315
00:25:15,961 --> 00:25:18,846
It's a bit strange, huh?

316
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:21,135
Does it make sense

317
00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:24,314
that he committed sexual assault?

318
00:25:24,338 --> 00:25:26,098
I can't believe it.

319
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:28,714
There might be a misunderstanding…

320
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:31,231
- Right?
- What misunderstanding?

321
00:25:31,255 --> 00:25:34,395
A person who looks innocent
may have more lewd thoughts inside.

322
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:36,419
What an innocent wage earners.

323
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:39,691
Get back to work.

324
00:25:47,121 --> 00:25:49,144
You met the team leader yesterday, huh?

325
00:25:49,168 --> 00:25:50,653
Do you know what happened?

326
00:25:54,644 --> 00:25:58,378
I learned that mixing cocktails
and beer is a recipe for disaster.

327
00:25:58,402 --> 00:25:59,473
I lost my memory.

328
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:04,502
<i>Han Soo, and Seo Jin.
Come to the underground parking lot.</i>

329
00:26:04,526 --> 00:26:07,011
Seo Jin, we should go.

330
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:14,307
Did you see anyone suspicious
while following me yesterday?

331
00:26:14,331 --> 00:26:17,863
No, I didn't.

332
00:26:17,887 --> 00:26:19,092
What about you, Seo Jin?

333
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:22,293
I didn't see anyone either. Sorry.

334
00:26:22,317 --> 00:26:24,301
If you're going to stalk me next time,
do a better job.

335
00:26:24,325 --> 00:26:27,035
If I were the embezzler,
you would have made a fatal mistake.

336
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:41,581
From now on, we'll find out
who took the photos.

337
00:26:43,588 --> 00:26:46,149
It is likely that Yoo's accomplice
took those photos.

338
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:47,673
Yes, you are right.

339
00:26:49,587 --> 00:26:52,336
I'm sorry about yesterday,

340
00:26:53,561 --> 00:26:56,901
but you need to explain
so I can understand.

341
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,848
What is your relationship with her?

342
00:27:03,131 --> 00:27:04,731
We're just senior and junior colleagues.

343
00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:13,297
The Ministry of Employment and Labor
will conduct a thorough investigation

344
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:16,204
if an employer fails to
investigate workplace

345
00:27:16,228 --> 00:27:18,650
sexual harassment and assault cases.

346
00:27:21,384 --> 00:27:24,414
As it is, the company could be tarnished
as allowing sexual harassment.

347
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:27,810
Why should we bear that risk?

348
00:27:27,834 --> 00:27:29,262
Who is he anyway!

349
00:27:29,286 --> 00:27:31,978
Mr. Shin will handle that,

350
00:27:32,002 --> 00:27:33,180
so mind your own business.

351
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:38,648
I can't focus on my work
because of that bastard!

352
00:27:41,672 --> 00:27:42,926
This is all because of me, huh?

353
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:45,913
You brought in that bastard to push me out?

354
00:27:47,225 --> 00:27:48,289
Get out.

355
00:27:54,264 --> 00:27:58,023
Unlike those pampered boys,

356
00:27:58,835 --> 00:28:01,200
I grew up being beaten by my father.

357
00:28:01,224 --> 00:28:03,440
So, I'm very perceptive.

358
00:28:04,806 --> 00:28:07,701
Looks like you're about to take a risk.

359
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,186
If you want to stay
in that position a bit longer,

360
00:28:13,475 --> 00:28:15,227
it's best to get rid of that bastard.

361
00:28:32,325 --> 00:28:35,027
Judging by the angle of the photo,
it was taken from one place.

362
00:28:35,051 --> 00:28:37,686
And from inside a car
as we see the reflection.

363
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:50,833
It looks like here.

364
00:28:50,857 --> 00:28:52,981
We should find the car
that was parked here yesterday.

365
00:28:53,005 --> 00:28:55,223
We'll need to check
the CCTV cameras in the area.

366
00:28:56,362 --> 00:28:57,703
Mr. Shin!

367
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:07,333
How dare you come
back to the victim's house?

368
00:29:08,825 --> 00:29:09,978
Who are you?

369
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:13,878
I'm the husband of the woman
harassed by you last night.

370
00:29:16,417 --> 00:29:18,061
This is a misunderstanding.

371
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:21,184
Our team leader didn't do it.

372
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,288
Just shut up.

373
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,088
Did you take the photo?

374
00:29:27,112 --> 00:29:28,362
Yeah, I did.

375
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:32,253
Did you plan this with Yoo Mi Kyung?

376
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:37,694
You've got a vivid imagination.

377
00:29:38,396 --> 00:29:39,777
My goal is simple.

378
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:43,157
To keep you out of my wife's workplace.

379
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:46,734
You're in the picture too, so stop whining.

380
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:58,094
Seo Jin, go to the hospital
and interview with Yoo.

381
00:29:58,118 --> 00:30:01,062
Jo Gyeong Suk from Ethics Management
should know the hospital's location.

382
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:02,801
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

383
00:30:03,512 --> 00:30:05,257
The husband might be there too.

384
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:07,313
She said she got divorced from him.

385
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:11,253
So that man is her ex husband?

386
00:30:11,277 --> 00:30:15,476
Director Yoo is up to all sorts
to stir up trouble in the audit.

387
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,452
Verify the facts and report back.

388
00:30:18,476 --> 00:30:19,490
I see.

389
00:30:24,162 --> 00:30:26,138
Give me a call when you're free.

390
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:27,469
Just a moment please.

391
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,632
Okay.

392
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,325
It seems there was no sexual harassment,

393
00:30:35,349 --> 00:30:38,199
and the photos are taken by her ex-husband?

394
00:30:40,191 --> 00:30:41,507
Director Yoo got divorced?

395
00:30:43,489 --> 00:30:45,677
Got it.

396
00:30:45,701 --> 00:30:46,985
Good job.

397
00:31:00,085 --> 00:31:02,902
Hello, sir.

398
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:06,044
Our company has always been
not that good.

399
00:31:07,387 --> 00:31:08,845
I just wanted to ask

400
00:31:09,604 --> 00:31:12,792
about Deomyeong Construction's
redevelopment projects.

401
00:31:19,977 --> 00:31:21,977
Hey, stop!

402
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:29,505
- What's wrong?
- The deputy secretary, ah.

403
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:32,661
He's in charge of construction machinery
maintenance, permits, everything.

404
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:35,511
Just give him a golf set saying
the compatibility isn't good.

405
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:39,509
Even if we fight,
we still must get the work done.

406
00:31:39,533 --> 00:31:42,419
Why should I give it to him?
And it's already used.

407
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,304
You have to give this,
so it doesn't feel like a burden.

408
00:31:44,328 --> 00:31:46,819
This one's worth 30 million won.

409
00:31:46,843 --> 00:31:49,044
And 50,000 won for condolence?

410
00:31:49,068 --> 00:31:52,527
He's just thinking it
as golf course green fees.

411
00:31:52,551 --> 00:31:53,971
I'm not going to do that anymore.

412
00:31:57,586 --> 00:32:00,679
If he gets upset,
he'll put faulty stamps on the machines.

413
00:32:00,703 --> 00:32:02,827
Last time, we were
beaten up because of that.

414
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:03,998
Time has changed…

415
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,093
Sucks!

416
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:07,351
Time?

417
00:32:08,108 --> 00:32:10,314
Time is changing drastically,

418
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:15,061
but for us, it'll be just
gutter water till we die.

419
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:17,664
That's the point.

420
00:32:43,556 --> 00:32:44,765
Oh, gosh.

421
00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:46,746
If they were in a relationship,

422
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:49,930
how did sexual harassment occur?

423
00:32:49,954 --> 00:32:54,049
Yoo is in a difficult situation right now.
As Mr. Cha is in the audit team,

424
00:32:54,073 --> 00:32:58,614
he tried to flirt with his ex
using his authority,

425
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:00,261
but Yoo is married,

426
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:01,966
so she said "It is not right".

427
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:05,749
Nevertheless, he still loves her,

428
00:33:06,553 --> 00:33:08,553
so he pushed it too hard. But she said no.

429
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:13,872
I'll going to report this to the
Vice President. Are you sure?

430
00:33:13,896 --> 00:33:15,115
Sure.

431
00:33:16,396 --> 00:33:17,448
Bye.

432
00:33:30,567 --> 00:33:31,567
Sir!

433
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:37,008
What are you doing?

434
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:38,203
Yoo isn't here right now.

435
00:33:38,227 --> 00:33:39,947
I act with the authority of the audit team.

436
00:33:45,388 --> 00:33:46,567
Apologize.

437
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,972
To the manager, and to us.

438
00:33:47,996 --> 00:33:50,018
You're disrespecting our whole team.

439
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,275
I have nothing to apologize for.

440
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:52,790
Then explain yourself!

441
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:54,190
About your sexual harassment
against our director.

442
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:56,191
Right, you should apologize.

443
00:33:56,215 --> 00:33:57,981
Put down her items and just leave.

444
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:00,417
- Explain.
- What the hell is going on?

445
00:34:03,814 --> 00:34:04,814
Such a mess…

446
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:08,162
Did the head office
employees create the Union?

447
00:34:10,061 --> 00:34:12,062
It's pathetic…

448
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:17,045
No wonder the housing department's
performance is hitting rock bottom.

449
00:34:17,069 --> 00:34:18,320
Just get back to work.

450
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:20,281
Focus on your work!

451
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:38,174
Stalking?

452
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:41,782
I got divorced from him
because he was too obsessive about me,

453
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:43,934
but he still tried to visit me.

454
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:46,453
I reported him but it was no use.

455
00:34:46,477 --> 00:34:49,307
I guess he was waiting for me
in front of my house yesterday as well.

456
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:52,313
As soon as Shin left,
he asked me who I was with…

457
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:56,175
I said it was my co-worker
and he said he would make Shin get fired.

458
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:00,329
He said he would kill me
if I didn't follow what I was told to do.

459
00:35:00,353 --> 00:35:04,266
Everyone at work thinks
that he sexually harassed you.

460
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,647
Please tell him that I'm very sorry,

461
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,721
and I'm going to reveal the truth.

462
00:35:26,762 --> 00:35:27,955
Yes.

463
00:35:37,798 --> 00:35:40,305
Vice President, the thing is…

464
00:35:41,337 --> 00:35:43,833
About the case of sexual harassment
by Shin Cha Il…

465
00:35:43,857 --> 00:35:46,579
He knew Director Yoo's
situation is not good…

466
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:50,113
so he tried to abuse his power…

467
00:35:50,137 --> 00:35:52,844
but since Director Yoo is a married woman,
so she said no…

468
00:35:52,868 --> 00:35:55,216
but he was recalling their old memories…

469
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,846
Asking if she can't really…

470
00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:00,099
I think I'm sure that's what happened.

471
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,914
You know what.

472
00:36:02,938 --> 00:36:05,736
I thought wielding a golf club
was too typical…

473
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,755
Do you want to play golf?

474
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,259
But there's nothing better than this.

475
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:09,989
What do you mean?

476
00:36:10,013 --> 00:36:12,328
You'll find out now.

477
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,070
Hello, this is Shin Cha Il.

478
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:33,541
Hello, Shin.
We've just finished interviewing.

479
00:36:35,672 --> 00:36:38,317
She said she was stalked by her ex-husband.

480
00:36:38,341 --> 00:36:40,622
She said that she couldn't help it
because of the threats…

481
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:43,487
and also she said she's very sorry.

482
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:46,167
It's a ploy to lower the audit power.

483
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:50,185
There's no way she could've done it
because of that.

484
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,675
Everyone does it
when embezzlement becomes a purpose.

485
00:36:54,094 --> 00:36:57,281
A thorough abuse of faith is a start.

486
00:36:57,305 --> 00:36:58,392
Wrap it up.

487
00:37:07,622 --> 00:37:09,324
- Chief Ok.
- Yes, sir.

488
00:37:09,348 --> 00:37:11,917
May I have the personal information
of Director Yoo's husband?

489
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:13,509
Sure, I will get it for you.

490
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:31,860
Let's talk a little more.

491
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,660
We'll be interviewing again tomorrow.

492
00:37:35,684 --> 00:37:37,515
I'm talking about us.

493
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,240
Shin.

494
00:37:43,097 --> 00:37:44,456
Are you still alone?

495
00:37:57,512 --> 00:38:00,202
Did you just let him leave?

496
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:01,297
I'm coming up.

497
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:24,460
If everything is a lie like Shin said,

498
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:27,266
it means that Director Yoo was
in cahoot with his ex-husband.

499
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:29,303
Then, what about the Union president?

500
00:38:30,547 --> 00:38:32,920
They could be all in cahoots.

501
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:33,836
What?

502
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,747
The only person missing is
the Union president right now,

503
00:38:36,771 --> 00:38:39,056
so chances are he has the money.

504
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:40,861
But the thing is…

505
00:38:40,885 --> 00:38:42,806
that the relationship between Director Yoo
and the Union president is…

506
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,321
unlikely to be that trustworthy.

507
00:38:45,251 --> 00:38:47,182
I think we should find out the relationship
between

508
00:38:47,206 --> 00:38:48,749
the ex-husband and the Union president.

509
00:38:48,773 --> 00:38:50,289
Right, but…

510
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:55,578
If three people are accomplices…

511
00:38:55,602 --> 00:38:57,661
it is shocking.

512
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:00,360
This shouldn't be that shocking
considering you work as an auditor.

513
00:39:01,946 --> 00:39:03,582
People even kill each other over money.

514
00:39:05,374 --> 00:39:06,465
You're right.

515
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:09,033
See you tomorrow.

516
00:39:11,906 --> 00:39:13,105
Bye.

517
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,660
Hey.

518
00:39:29,684 --> 00:39:31,725
- You must've been busy today.
- Yes.

519
00:39:34,524 --> 00:39:36,619
What's going on with you?

520
00:39:36,643 --> 00:39:39,391
- Nothing.
- Hello, my son!

521
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:44,127
Mom.

522
00:39:44,151 --> 00:39:45,151
Dad.

523
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,900
We're auditing the Director…

524
00:39:47,924 --> 00:39:49,947
of the Housing Department
for embezzlement right now.

525
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,760
What a nasty person!

526
00:39:51,784 --> 00:39:54,718
What type of individual engages
in embezzlement?

527
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:55,938
They abuse trust thoroughly.

528
00:39:55,962 --> 00:39:58,779
How far do you think they can abuse faith?

529
00:39:58,803 --> 00:40:01,064
You'd better ask your dad.

530
00:40:01,088 --> 00:40:02,306
I've never embezzled.

531
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:03,653
I know you've been
pocketing from the counter.

532
00:40:03,677 --> 00:40:05,498
I don't even know where the counter is.

533
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:08,136
- Han Soo.
- Yes.

534
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,818
Shameless people who lie
engage in embezzlement.

535
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:14,443
We need to take action to ensure
that people like that tell the truth.

536
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:17,228
Do you remember you fell
while running during a company picnic,

537
00:40:17,252 --> 00:40:19,116
and I piggy-bagged you and ran?

538
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,863
That's how we were caught
in our secret relationship in the company,

539
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:22,798
and we got married.

540
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:23,980
Think about that day.

541
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:25,004
- My god.
- That day.

542
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,242
He is unbelievable.

543
00:40:29,044 --> 00:40:30,242
Get home and have some rest.

544
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:46,623
Mr. Shin!

545
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:51,623
Did you just let him leave?

546
00:40:53,254 --> 00:40:54,254
I'm coming up.

547
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:24,981
Hello.

548
00:41:28,677 --> 00:41:30,602
About what you said last time…

549
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,907
that you think the money is
on the Union president's hand.

550
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:35,921
Then, why don't we try to find him?

551
00:41:37,176 --> 00:41:38,794
How can we possibly find the Union
president

552
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:40,133
who the police haven't even found?

553
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:42,474
Wouldn't Shin be able to find him?

554
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:44,175
Let me ask him.

555
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,261
And we can…

556
00:41:45,285 --> 00:41:49,614
meet the members
and track the Union president in detail.

557
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,998
Shin will be transferred tomorrow,

558
00:41:53,842 --> 00:41:55,282
so we got to do everything we could.

559
00:41:56,284 --> 00:41:59,045
Why are you guys talking about work
even before you get to the office?

560
00:42:01,279 --> 00:42:04,299
Say hello verbally, guys.

561
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:08,937
'Come to my office now.'

562
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:11,650
He likes me too much.

563
00:42:52,835 --> 00:42:54,678
Please follow me.

564
00:42:54,702 --> 00:42:56,678
How about trying to
find the Union president?

565
00:42:56,702 --> 00:42:57,996
I was about to.

566
00:43:06,021 --> 00:43:07,406
He loves me.

567
00:43:09,443 --> 00:43:10,453
Come in.

568
00:43:12,325 --> 00:43:14,678
How was the exclusive information?

569
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:27,810
I found the word 'dream mountain'
which is a mountaineering club…

570
00:43:27,834 --> 00:43:30,144
through Director Yoo's search word
and the blog she visited.

571
00:43:30,168 --> 00:43:32,242
She is a member of the club.

572
00:43:32,266 --> 00:43:33,833
Considering the hiking supplies…

573
00:43:33,857 --> 00:43:35,954
and the ribbon of the mountaineering club
at the Union president's house…

574
00:43:35,978 --> 00:43:39,043
It is likely that the Union president is
a member of the same mountaineering club.

575
00:43:39,067 --> 00:43:42,865
Then, maybe they first met there
and plotted embezzlement.

576
00:43:42,889 --> 00:43:44,581
That's what we're going to ask…

577
00:43:44,605 --> 00:43:46,245
the president of the mountaineering club.

578
00:43:46,889 --> 00:43:49,900
Would the president
of the mountaineering club know about this?

579
00:43:49,924 --> 00:43:51,477
Would he tell us even if he knows?

580
00:43:59,416 --> 00:44:01,731
Here it is, acorn jelly.

581
00:44:02,471 --> 00:44:04,472
- How do you like the food?
- It's nice.

582
00:44:04,496 --> 00:44:06,482
Hello, please have a seat.

583
00:44:06,506 --> 00:44:08,426
Hi, we're from the audit team
of JU Construction.

584
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:10,731
Mr. Shin.

585
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:27,120
They are members of the club,
but I don't know them very well.

586
00:44:27,144 --> 00:44:30,565
You look too close to them to say that.

587
00:44:30,589 --> 00:44:32,122
It's because we were taking a picture…

588
00:44:32,146 --> 00:44:35,166
Sir, please have a look at these people.

589
00:44:36,798 --> 00:44:38,632
They are a couple who
have been trying so hard

590
00:44:38,656 --> 00:44:40,489
for 10 years to get a
house and get married.

591
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:43,433
They are calling off their marriage
due to the damage of the embezzlement.

592
00:44:43,921 --> 00:44:45,795
He became paralyzed in his spine,

593
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:47,961
so he was trying to get a house
that has a wheelchair path.

594
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:48,999
He's a victim of fraud.

595
00:44:49,777 --> 00:44:52,073
This grandfather tried to get a house
with the life insurance payouts…

596
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:54,306
of his son and daughter-in-law
to live with his grandchildren…

597
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:56,727
That's enough.

598
00:44:56,751 --> 00:44:58,518
Criminal concealment will result
in up to three years in prison,

599
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:00,542
or a fine of up to five million won.

600
00:45:02,376 --> 00:45:03,666
Oh Chang Sik.

601
00:45:04,689 --> 00:45:05,981
Do you know where he is?

602
00:45:14,027 --> 00:45:18,036
Chang Sik used to run
a pretty big restaurant.

603
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:19,966
But it didn't go well.

604
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:22,778
So he would try to get over it by hiking…

605
00:45:22,802 --> 00:45:25,637
Show people the picture of the Union
president and check out the guests.

606
00:45:25,661 --> 00:45:27,736
I got a phone call from him
a couple of days ago.

607
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,845
He asked if Yoo Mi Gyung was
coming to the club these days.

608
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:34,234
I told him to turn himself in to the police
instead of asking about her.

609
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:36,640
I'm a friend of him,
so I couldn't report him to the police.

610
00:45:37,662 --> 00:45:40,085
It's in a mountain lodge
of Jeongaksan Mountain.

611
00:45:40,834 --> 00:45:42,046
Hello, sir.

612
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:43,466
Have you seen this person before?

613
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:45,987
Have you seen him in your lodge?

614
00:45:46,011 --> 00:45:47,521
No, I haven't.

615
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:50,028
Have you seen this person before?

616
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:53,389
No, I haven't seen him before.

617
00:45:53,413 --> 00:45:55,937
- Are you sure you haven't?
- I'm sure.

618
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,124
I hope he is here.

619
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:16,939
Hello, how many people are you?

620
00:46:16,963 --> 00:46:19,425
- On your own? This way, please.
- Sure.

621
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,787
Welcome.

622
00:46:23,811 --> 00:46:25,340
What would you like to have?

623
00:46:25,364 --> 00:46:28,354
<i>(I'm at a restaurant and I found him.)</i>

624
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,099
Hey!

625
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:32,928
I'll have sliced boiled meat…

626
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:35,802
- I'll have a bowl of noodles, please.
- You're taking ages to order.

627
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,656
A bowl of noodles!

628
00:46:52,152 --> 00:46:54,228
- Hey, you ordered food.
- Sorry.

629
00:46:54,252 --> 00:46:55,352
Where are you going?

630
00:46:59,457 --> 00:47:01,315
No way!

631
00:47:03,017 --> 00:47:04,296
Union president!

632
00:47:16,773 --> 00:47:17,749
What the hell?

633
00:47:17,773 --> 00:47:19,316
Sir!

634
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,438
Are you okay?

635
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:10,708
Oh Chang Sik. Let's get down.

636
00:48:11,629 --> 00:48:12,756
Who the hell are you?

637
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,500
I'm from the audit team of JU Construction.

638
00:48:42,355 --> 00:48:43,641
That's the Union president!

639
00:48:55,854 --> 00:48:58,291
Thank you for finding the Union president.

640
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:01,013
We can get our money back now,
can't we?

641
00:49:05,106 --> 00:49:07,176
After the investigation,
you will be able to find your money.

642
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,218
Are you sure?

643
00:49:09,395 --> 00:49:10,926
I'm sure you will.

644
00:49:11,981 --> 00:49:14,192
Everyone, we can get our money back!

645
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:16,476
Let's give them a round of applause!

646
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,857
He exercises his right to remain silent.

647
00:49:38,881 --> 00:49:40,214
He doesn't say a word.

648
00:49:40,238 --> 00:49:42,559
In this case, it's hard
to get the money back.

649
00:49:56,509 --> 00:49:57,509
Mr. Shin!

650
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:02,765
Where is our money?

651
00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:05,009
I think the investigation
will be prolonged.

652
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:06,283
You'd better get home and wait.

653
00:50:06,307 --> 00:50:07,670
What?

654
00:50:07,694 --> 00:50:09,913
What if he spent all the money?

655
00:50:23,345 --> 00:50:26,162
The money was Min Suk's mom and dad's…

656
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:29,645
life insurance payouts.

657
00:50:29,669 --> 00:50:32,145
I shouldn't have got greedy.

658
00:50:32,169 --> 00:50:34,261
You will find the money, sir.

659
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:36,908
Right, don't worry about it.

660
00:51:03,981 --> 00:51:05,585
Embezzlers.

661
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:10,536
They are really bad people.

662
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,293
If the Union president
doesn't tell the truth,

663
00:51:12,317 --> 00:51:14,437
we need to stop Director Yoo
from leaving the country.

664
00:51:19,977 --> 00:51:21,444
Why aren't you sleeping?

665
00:51:21,468 --> 00:51:22,960
Where are you going?

666
00:51:22,984 --> 00:51:25,986
I need to feed the puppy.

667
00:51:26,010 --> 00:51:29,017
Are you talking about the puppy
that was in the Union president's house?

668
00:51:29,041 --> 00:51:31,142
You're so nice, Min Hee.

669
00:51:31,166 --> 00:51:33,468
I took care of him.

670
00:51:33,492 --> 00:51:36,067
A scary man was going to take him to…

671
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:39,732
Who is the scary man?

672
00:51:42,341 --> 00:51:43,712
It's all fine.

673
00:51:43,736 --> 00:51:46,094
The man told us not to tell anyone.

674
00:51:46,945 --> 00:51:49,288
I will protect you. Don't worry.

675
00:51:49,312 --> 00:51:51,312
I will protect you, too.

676
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:55,465
Did you guys see a man
while feeding the puppy there?

677
00:51:56,878 --> 00:51:58,594
A man who's not living around here?

678
00:52:03,743 --> 00:52:05,437
I had a picture…

679
00:52:08,078 --> 00:52:10,409
Was it him?

680
00:52:26,048 --> 00:52:27,303
Hello, it's Shin Cha Il.

681
00:52:37,045 --> 00:52:39,021
I wish you all the best, Director Yoo.

682
00:52:39,045 --> 00:52:40,266
Thank you.

683
00:52:41,477 --> 00:52:45,597
Thanks for supporting me
and working with me all this time.

684
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:49,276
I will remember every
one of you wherever I am.

685
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:50,947
Love you guys, the Housing Department!

686
00:52:50,971 --> 00:52:52,754
We love you, Director Yoo!

687
00:52:52,778 --> 00:52:55,239
Please don't forget us
even if you're in the States.

688
00:52:55,263 --> 00:52:57,458
Right, please don't forget us.

689
00:52:57,482 --> 00:52:59,201
Maybe we should visit her one day.

690
00:52:59,225 --> 00:53:01,225
That's a great idea!

691
00:53:02,803 --> 00:53:05,488
Please cooperate in the interview
at the audit office.

692
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,159
Mr. Shin!

693
00:53:09,183 --> 00:53:11,049
I'm leaving today.

694
00:53:11,073 --> 00:53:13,981
I will wrap it up well, so don't worry.

695
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:28,181
I would like to cooperate,
but I'm running out of time for my flight.

696
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,427
Please make it short.

697
00:53:29,451 --> 00:53:31,451
Do you know
that the Union president got arrested?

698
00:53:32,802 --> 00:53:34,610
Did he get arrested?

699
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:37,367
That's great.

700
00:53:37,391 --> 00:53:39,556
I felt sorry to leave like this.

701
00:53:40,485 --> 00:53:41,789
Have you found the money?

702
00:53:44,882 --> 00:53:46,192
No, I haven't.

703
00:53:47,942 --> 00:53:49,942
Because your husband has the money.

704
00:53:52,457 --> 00:53:54,938
Shin, what's your problem?

705
00:53:54,962 --> 00:53:56,563
The Union president gave testimony.

706
00:53:56,587 --> 00:53:59,812
He's a fraud. Do you believe what he said?

707
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:02,359
You suggested embezzling
the sharing housing maintenance project

708
00:54:02,383 --> 00:54:05,522
to the Union president
who you met at the mountaineering club.

709
00:54:05,546 --> 00:54:08,682
The Union president accepted the proposal,

710
00:54:08,706 --> 00:54:11,728
and when the Union president came
to see you with the 3.4 billion won…

711
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:14,193
that was approved by
you as business expenses,

712
00:54:14,217 --> 00:54:18,639
you and the Union president headed
to the bar to toast.

713
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:23,541
But the Union president realized
that the money had gone missing.

714
00:54:26,374 --> 00:54:27,863
Are you sure
that you kept the bag of money here?

715
00:54:27,887 --> 00:54:30,584
I'm sure. It's driving me crazy!

716
00:54:30,608 --> 00:54:32,294
You are not lying, are you?

717
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:33,676
To steal the money.

718
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:37,049
What? To steal the money?

719
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,892
The 50,000 won notes are all stamped
and sealed by the government.

720
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:44,004
You said it could be
tracked by serial numbers.

721
00:54:45,433 --> 00:54:48,132
How can I steal that
kind of money on my own?

722
00:54:49,502 --> 00:54:52,584
You need to hide till I contact you.

723
00:54:52,608 --> 00:54:53,696
You want me to hide?

724
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,770
We need to find the money!

725
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:57,794
You're the only person who has evidence.

726
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:00,678
Don't act foolishly.

727
00:55:00,702 --> 00:55:04,517
Your ex-husband stole the money.

728
00:55:05,374 --> 00:55:09,414
As the Union president realized that,
he gave testimony.

729
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:11,878
Director Yoo is leaving
for the US tomorrow.

730
00:55:11,902 --> 00:55:13,466
Her husband will leave soon as well.

731
00:55:15,121 --> 00:55:19,552
If you keep silent,
you will have all the charges.

732
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,925
My ex-husband…

733
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:27,281
took the money?

734
00:55:27,305 --> 00:55:29,024
It's a fake divorce, isn't it?

735
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,883
You imitated the embezzlement
of The Myung Construction,

736
00:55:32,907 --> 00:55:34,510
where Kang Myung Chul is working at.

737
00:55:36,221 --> 00:55:39,181
Just like The Myung Construction
which concealed embezzlement by employees,

738
00:55:39,725 --> 00:55:41,965
You would have thought
JU Construction would do the same.

739
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:45,447
How dare you…

740
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:48,712
He's got nothing to do with this.

741
00:55:48,736 --> 00:55:50,154
There's a witness.

742
00:55:51,872 --> 00:55:55,199
There's a witness who saw that Kang
Myung Chul stole the bag of money.

743
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:08,443
If you say you have seen me,

744
00:56:08,467 --> 00:56:11,695
I will take the puppy, okay?

745
00:56:11,719 --> 00:56:14,174
He said he wore a black hat
with K on it.

746
00:56:14,986 --> 00:56:16,947
The cap…

747
00:56:16,971 --> 00:56:19,214
Isn't it what your husband
used to wear often?

748
00:56:20,708 --> 00:56:24,908
Director Yoo, there is
testimony and a witness.

749
00:56:24,932 --> 00:56:26,696
You need to stop this
and give them their money back.

750
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,212
Without the money…

751
00:56:30,284 --> 00:56:31,924
their lives will get tough.

752
00:56:36,425 --> 00:56:37,493
Please.

753
00:56:40,996 --> 00:56:42,499
Yoo Mi Kyung,
the director of the Housing Department…

754
00:56:42,523 --> 00:56:44,339
conspired with the Union president…

755
00:56:44,363 --> 00:56:46,883
to embezzle the cost
of the sharing housing maintenance project.

756
00:56:47,365 --> 00:56:51,346
You made a scandal to buy time to flee
to the Florida branch,

757
00:56:51,370 --> 00:56:53,669
and tried to confuse people
by making up a story about a stalker,

758
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:54,693
but you failed.

759
00:56:56,634 --> 00:56:57,774
I need to…

760
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:00,471
I need to go to the airport.

761
00:57:00,495 --> 00:57:01,575
I have to get on the plane.

762
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,028
The transfer to the Florida branch
will be canceled.

763
00:57:08,602 --> 00:57:10,624
There are two options.

764
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:12,920
The first is to admit it
and turn yourself to the police.

765
00:57:12,944 --> 00:57:16,329
The second is to insist on your innocence
and increase the sentences.

766
00:57:17,399 --> 00:57:20,271
I can give you advice
to choose the first one,

767
00:57:20,295 --> 00:57:22,892
and apologize to your team members
that you love.

768
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:25,234
So the members…

769
00:57:26,593 --> 00:57:27,987
would get hurt less.

770
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:38,023
I will report to the President.

771
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,344
You'll have to attend the police station,
so get ready.

772
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:10,780
I would like to report on the embezzlement
of the sharing housing project.

773
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:15,516
Director Yoo, if you
help us find the money,

774
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,820
I will make sure to write a petition.

775
00:58:16,844 --> 00:58:17,991
Me, too.

776
00:58:19,398 --> 00:58:22,170
If you can find the money,
you will get off the hook.

777
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:24,427
Director Yoo, come out.

778
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:25,970
What's the matter?

779
00:58:25,994 --> 00:58:27,793
She needs to be here
because we're interviewing her.

780
00:58:27,817 --> 00:58:29,728
Be quiet. It's the Vice President's order.

781
00:58:29,752 --> 00:58:31,752
Director Yoo, come out now.

782
00:58:32,756 --> 00:58:33,769
Right now!

783
00:58:38,963 --> 00:58:41,885
You're acting just like Shin.
Why are you making a fuss?

784
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:53,446
The Vice President will handle
the case of the director, Yoo Mi Kyung.

785
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:57,374
The Vice President has the authority of the
audit, you'd better go and report to him.

786
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:02,992
Do you have any reason
why you made a decision like that?

787
00:59:24,814 --> 00:59:28,229
I heard everything from the President
of The Myung construction.

788
00:59:28,253 --> 00:59:31,405
So you thought we would
pretend not to know, didn't you?

789
00:59:35,477 --> 00:59:36,851
Don't chicken out.

790
00:59:36,875 --> 00:59:38,944
If you listen to me,

791
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:40,968
it will all go along as you planned.

792
00:59:44,459 --> 00:59:48,336
I heard you didn't give him a golf club
after you blew up golf?

793
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:50,391
What are you thinking?

794
00:59:50,415 --> 00:59:52,270
Undersecretary Ahn's totally upset,

795
00:59:53,097 --> 00:59:55,104
I heard there will be a special inspection

796
00:59:55,128 --> 00:59:56,948
of all the machines
at the Inpo construction site next week?

797
00:59:56,972 --> 00:59:59,577
They are even strengthening the structural
safety of construction machinery.

798
00:59:59,601 --> 01:00:00,601
Then…

799
01:00:01,416 --> 01:00:03,696
We're out of construction.

800
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,942
Your position will be in jeopardy.

801
01:00:06,966 --> 01:00:09,328
I'm having dinner
with Undersecretary Ahn tomorrow.

802
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:10,592
About the case of Director Yoo…

803
01:00:11,988 --> 01:00:16,220
I think we'll take the rap for her
if things go wrong.

804
01:00:18,423 --> 01:00:19,703
You'd better follow what I said.

805
01:00:30,628 --> 01:00:33,916
Vice President, I took Director
Yoo out of the audit office.

806
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,182
Take her to the airport.

807
01:00:39,946 --> 01:00:42,180
Director,
I'm certain that she has embezzled money.

808
01:00:42,204 --> 01:00:44,226
- Be quiet!
- There must have been something wrong.

809
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,802
I said to be quiet.
What do you know about this?

810
01:00:49,613 --> 01:00:50,702
Director Yoo.

811
01:00:50,726 --> 01:00:52,846
Director Yoo, what are you doing?
Get on the elevator.

812
01:01:16,311 --> 01:01:17,518
Hello, it's Shin Cha Il.

813
01:01:17,542 --> 01:01:19,988
<i>Director took her out
to get her to the airport.</i>

814
01:01:21,183 --> 01:01:24,319
<i>He said it's the Vice President's order.</i>
Should we really let her go?

815
01:01:25,296 --> 01:01:27,103
Why aren't you coming to report?

816
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:32,583
Didn't the President tell you?

817
01:01:35,027 --> 01:01:37,004
- The embezzlement of business expenses…
- Cut it out.

818
01:01:37,028 --> 01:01:38,564
This is my decision.

819
01:01:38,588 --> 01:01:41,749
Transferring Director Yoo
to the Florida brand as planned.

820
01:01:41,773 --> 01:01:43,705
The end of the story.

821
01:01:43,729 --> 01:01:45,449
The company can't lose out.

822
01:01:46,190 --> 01:01:49,506
It's a wrong decision to sit on the
sidelines of an employee's embezzlement.

823
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,553
- Please reconsider.
- What if I don't want to?

824
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:53,319
I joined JU Construction
because I was given

825
01:01:53,343 --> 01:01:54,962
the full authority to audit corruption.

826
01:01:54,986 --> 01:01:56,151
Please consider…

827
01:01:57,619 --> 01:01:58,751
my opinion.

828
01:02:00,705 --> 01:02:02,308
You're annoyed, aren't you?

829
01:02:02,332 --> 01:02:03,774
But there's nothing you can do.

830
01:02:03,798 --> 01:02:07,305
I have the authority of the audit office…

831
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:08,568
that you held like a shield.

832
01:02:12,716 --> 01:02:14,824
They are eking out their living,

833
01:02:14,848 --> 01:02:16,454
but they got fooled by the Union president.

834
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:19,813
We don't need anything but money.

835
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:30,959
Goo Han Soo.

836
01:02:30,983 --> 01:02:32,621
Yes, sir.

837
01:02:32,645 --> 01:02:33,672
You are doing the right thing.

838
01:02:33,696 --> 01:02:37,485
Shin Cha-il, the head of the audit team,
the hero of justice.

839
01:02:37,509 --> 01:02:40,439
But I'm the boss now.

840
01:02:40,463 --> 01:02:43,259
You know what are the consequences
of insubordination, right?

841
01:02:45,110 --> 01:02:46,232
Director Yoo.

842
01:02:47,255 --> 01:02:49,275
Stop her from going to the airport.

843
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:51,463
Leave no stone unturned.

844
01:02:51,487 --> 01:02:52,721
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

845
01:02:57,110 --> 01:02:58,275
Shin Cha Il.

846
01:03:00,033 --> 01:03:01,239
You're fired.

847
01:03:09,643 --> 01:03:12,182
<i>(The Auditors)</i>

848
01:03:33,371 --> 01:03:34,804
You made the embezzlement
led by the employee

849
01:03:34,828 --> 01:03:36,261
as the sole culprit of the Union president,

850
01:03:36,285 --> 01:03:37,877
so we will audit the Vice President.

851
01:03:38,946 --> 01:03:41,937
What do you think of
the Vice President, Shin?

852
01:03:41,961 --> 01:03:43,961
Do we need him in JU construction?

853
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:49,776
Tell me where the money is
before you get more pathetic.

854
01:03:50,486 --> 01:03:52,470
Please give the money back.

855
01:03:52,494 --> 01:03:55,501
Your resignation is guaranteed
by 3.4 billion won.

856
01:03:55,525 --> 01:03:58,045
If you can't find the money,
you'll need to give the money back.

857
01:03:58,363 --> 01:04:01,051
I will do my best to show you…

858
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:03,075
how great the crime of using faith is.
