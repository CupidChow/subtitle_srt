00:00:47,592 --> 00:00:49,692
<i>(The Auditors)</i>

2
00:01:20,028 --> 00:01:22,354
Didn't you see someone
rushing to the rooftop?

3
00:01:22,378 --> 00:01:23,498
I didn't see anyone.

4
00:01:26,258 --> 00:01:28,168
I was chasing the blackmailer.

5
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:31,344
It doesn't seem like you've captured him.

6
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:34,744
I thought you were outstanding
enough to catch him.

7
00:01:34,768 --> 00:01:36,504
I'll find him.

8
00:01:36,528 --> 00:01:38,288
Please find him as soon as possible.

9
00:01:51,168 --> 00:01:52,024
It's me.

10
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:54,928
<i>I lost track of him.
Come to the control room.</i>

11
00:01:56,128 --> 00:01:57,128
Yes, sir.

12
00:02:12,368 --> 00:02:15,528
He entered the Welfare Floor
which doesn't require an employee card.

13
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:20,184
That is where an outsider hardly knows.

14
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:24,448
He must've known the company structure
if you look where he moved around.

15
00:02:26,048 --> 00:02:27,408
Then, he is really…

16
00:02:38,008 --> 00:02:43,008
<i>(The Auditors)</i>

17
00:02:44,168 --> 00:02:49,544
You're the best. You taught him a lesson.

18
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:53,184
He must've got a scar.

19
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:57,224
I guess he's dispirited now.

20
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:58,504
Is that enough?

21
00:02:58,528 --> 00:03:02,968
No. He humiliated you.

22
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:08,008
I mean. He embarrassed you.

23
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:19,248
Do you think he really looks dispirited?

24
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:32,744
Did the blackmailer really appear?
You were amazing.

25
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:35,504
What are you saying?
He failed to capture him.

26
00:03:35,528 --> 00:03:38,464
What if he didn't give up
and succeeded in putting drugs in the food?

27
00:03:38,488 --> 00:03:40,344
Today's lunch might be…

28
00:03:40,368 --> 00:03:42,264
Oh, no. I skipped breakfast.

29
00:03:42,288 --> 00:03:45,744
He failed to put drugs
in the food. Don't worry.

30
00:03:45,768 --> 00:03:48,240
I also announced that
they should strengthen

31
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:51,024
access control and
reexamine ingredients again.

32
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:54,768
How did you know he would appear?

33
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:59,464
Let's have a meeting related to this case.

34
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,688
Let's talk about the details then.

35
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:07,888
By the way, where is Goo Han Soo?

36
00:04:13,248 --> 00:04:16,328
These are employees of our clients.

37
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:23,024
Wasn't there a man
with a black uniform, hat, and a mask?

38
00:04:23,048 --> 00:04:25,144
His height was this much.

39
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:29,064
We sometimes wear masks
but no one else does today.

40
00:04:29,088 --> 00:04:30,664
No one wears a hat, too.

41
00:04:30,688 --> 00:04:31,688
Yes.

42
00:04:33,448 --> 00:04:36,056
Visitors in the morning were
all female reporters

43
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,464
who came to interview
the ethics management department.

44
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,624
I see. Thank you.

45
00:04:42,648 --> 00:04:43,688
Thank you.

46
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,288
Hello, sir.

47
00:04:59,408 --> 00:05:01,504
I'm Goo Han Soo from the Audit Team.

48
00:05:01,528 --> 00:05:02,744
- Hello.
- Hello.

49
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:03,984
I'll help you.

50
00:05:04,008 --> 00:05:05,688
Thank you so much.

51
00:05:08,048 --> 00:05:11,464
JU Construction's employees are all kind.

52
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:14,069
He said he felt his mother from me.

53
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:17,664
He always gives me
instant coffee sticks and snacks.

54
00:05:17,688 --> 00:05:18,864
You're going to the supply room, right?

55
00:05:18,888 --> 00:05:20,464
Right.

56
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,584
I'll push it.

57
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:22,768
Thank you.

58
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:27,688
Weren't you uncomfortable before?

59
00:05:29,448 --> 00:05:30,448
What?

60
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:35,864
I felt sorry when I took the supplies
at the outsourcing head office.

61
00:05:35,888 --> 00:05:38,208
I know that was your job.

62
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,264
Thank you for your understanding.

63
00:05:41,288 --> 00:05:43,568
I'll push it now. Thank you.

64
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:45,944
Thank you.

65
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:46,624
Goodbye.

66
00:05:46,648 --> 00:05:48,128
Be careful.

67
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:53,368
I saw the apology.
Was it a simple incident?

68
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:57,848
I'm sorry, but I can't say it now.

69
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,704
But we work for the employees.

70
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:03,728
Feel free to report any difficulties to us.

71
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:08,088
If I report, does something bad change?

72
00:06:10,008 --> 00:06:13,064
Of course,
the difficulties won't bother you anymore.

73
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:14,208
Please report to us.

74
00:06:28,408 --> 00:06:30,448
<i>(Justice and safety is my faith.)</i>

75
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:49,048
<i>(Cafeteria Fraud. Victims lost
their families and money, too…)</i>

76
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:04,088
Me, too.

77
00:07:05,248 --> 00:07:09,064
Where have you been? Did you have lunch?

78
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,904
I just ate bread.

79
00:07:10,928 --> 00:07:13,064
Employees shouldn't skip a meal.

80
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,424
Today, many people skipped lunch.

81
00:07:15,448 --> 00:07:17,624
I understand it
because Mr. Shin and Han Soo were busy.

82
00:07:17,648 --> 00:07:20,784
And the deputy director
suddenly felt pain in his stomach.

83
00:07:20,808 --> 00:07:22,464
Do you really think so?

84
00:07:22,488 --> 00:07:25,304
He just skipped a meal because
he's worried there's a drug in the food.

85
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,304
I felt the same way.

86
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:27,408
Let's go in.

87
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:39,448
Go to the cafeteria and eat something.

88
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:42,424
We ate lunch there, but we're fine.

89
00:07:42,448 --> 00:07:44,344
I'm serious.

90
00:07:44,368 --> 00:07:49,808
I feel sick to my stomach.
I really feel chilly and nauseous.

91
00:07:51,648 --> 00:07:52,848
Let's have a meeting.

92
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:56,328
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

93
00:07:57,288 --> 00:08:01,744
I tried to induce the blackmailer
but failed to run after him.

94
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,656
The cafeteria will
strictly manage access control

95
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,344
and install extra CCTVs
to prevent the recurrence of the accident.

96
00:08:07,368 --> 00:08:11,864
I've checked the guest list to see
who visited the company that morning.

97
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,824
No one was suspicious.

98
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:15,876
We failed to induce him.
So, we should go back to square one.

99
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,368
Let's reveal his identity by searching
for data and apprehending a situation.

100
00:08:20,608 --> 00:08:25,504
It's like finding a needle in a haystack.
We don't know where to begin.

101
00:08:25,528 --> 00:08:28,864
Given that he threatened us to investigate
the corrupt cafeteria management,

102
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:35,024
he might be the victim
who failed to win a bid.

103
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,442
<i>He knew who the team leader was,</i>

104
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:38,784
<i>although it's only been 20
days since I was assigned.</i>

105
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:40,889
<i>He also knew that the cafeteria
would resume its business.</i>

106
00:08:40,913 --> 00:08:43,184
<i>It's a notice only posted
on the bulletin board.</i>

107
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,744
<i>He is the one who can enter
the company and cafeteria freely.</i>

108
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:49,544
He also knew precisely
about the company structure.

109
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:52,144
Are you saying he's one of the employees?

110
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:55,584
If he failed to win a bid,
he would run a restaurant.

111
00:08:55,608 --> 00:08:58,784
Could an office worker run a restaurant
while working at the company?

112
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,184
Do you think he did run a store himself?

113
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:02,104
In cases like this, the family
runs a business instead.

114
00:09:02,128 --> 00:09:05,142
Internal regulation doesn't
limit employees' families from

115
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,224
running a construction site cafeteria.

116
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:09,224
<i>I'm a drop in the ocean.</i>

117
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,688
<i>Many people gave more money than me.</i>

118
00:09:12,568 --> 00:09:15,864
What if the family member of the
blackmailer gave money to the agency?

119
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,024
Based on the agency's past behaviors,
the odds of that are pretty high.

120
00:09:19,048 --> 00:09:22,864
Why did he recklessly put drugs in the food
although he lost money?

121
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:26,064
He also knew he'd be severely punished
if someone died.

122
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:29,808
He might've lost
something more significant than money.

123
00:09:32,888 --> 00:09:37,128
If he lost his family member,
he would lose his reason.

124
00:09:38,248 --> 00:09:40,968
My dad was dead from overwork.

125
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,528
To meet the deadline, he hadn't slept
for a few days, then he fell down.

126
00:09:46,328 --> 00:09:49,784
But, it was really tough to get
recognized as an industrial accident.

127
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:53,064
Have you achieved recognition
of industrial accidents?

128
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:55,824
I barely achieved it after a legal
battle over a couple of years.

129
00:09:55,848 --> 00:09:57,624
If I couldn't win the battle,

130
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:00,384
I would be mad and do whatever.

131
00:10:00,408 --> 00:10:02,384
I felt wronged a lot.

132
00:10:02,408 --> 00:10:07,384
I didn't care about going to jail
at that moment.

133
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:10,603
You've got the recognition of
industrial accidents and are living well.

134
00:10:10,627 --> 00:10:12,648
Your dad must be resting in peace.

135
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:17,584
JU Construction entrusted
management authority to the agency

136
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:20,264
for three years under the former CEO.

137
00:10:20,288 --> 00:10:26,264
The investigation range is four years
including the recent one year.

138
00:10:26,288 --> 00:10:32,064
Find every bereaved employee
and the names of the deceased

139
00:10:32,088 --> 00:10:33,824
on the Family Event bulletin board.

140
00:10:33,848 --> 00:10:37,624
Divide the period and get it
done quickly by working together.

141
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:38,904
Yes, sir.

142
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:44,408
Assistant Manager Moon, you're a fast
worker. Gather and arrange materials.

143
00:10:47,928 --> 00:10:49,088
Yes, sir.

144
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:13,328
Please check this out.

145
00:11:24,048 --> 00:11:25,104
I'm done.

146
00:11:25,128 --> 00:11:30,104
Between the people who failed to win a bid
and the employee's dead family members,

147
00:11:30,128 --> 00:11:31,904
find a name that matches.

148
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:33,208
Yes, sir.

149
00:11:36,448 --> 00:11:38,368
Han Soo and Seo Jin. Here it is.

150
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:08,136
In three cases the name of the
person who failed to win a bid

151
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,864
and the name of the employee's
dead family member are the same.

152
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:12,264
You two go to the first case's restaurant.

153
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:13,717
The names of the restaurant's owner

154
00:12:13,741 --> 00:12:17,608
and the civil engineering department
leader's dead father are the same.

155
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:24,464
It's hard to investigate
one case out of the three.

156
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:27,048
This employee resigned seven months ago.

157
00:12:31,888 --> 00:12:33,848
- Chief Ok.
- Yes.

158
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:38,568
<i>I heard you have acquaintances
in every department. Is it true?</i>

159
00:12:42,048 --> 00:12:43,424
What brought you here?

160
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:44,704
Do you want to get some coffee?

161
00:12:44,728 --> 00:12:45,944
Sounds good.

162
00:12:45,968 --> 00:12:48,384
I have something to ask you.

163
00:12:48,408 --> 00:12:54,384
Do you know Lee Sun Hyung
who worked in this department?

164
00:12:54,408 --> 00:12:55,584
She resigned.

165
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:59,968
Did her sister-in-law
run a cafeteria at the construction site?

166
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,584
Welcome. Are you two?

167
00:13:04,608 --> 00:13:06,248
Please take a seat where you want to sit.

168
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:07,664
Actually

169
00:13:07,688 --> 00:13:10,544
we're from the JU Construction Audit Team.

170
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:14,328
May I ask you something
about Lee Dong Cheol?

171
00:13:15,248 --> 00:13:18,928
I'm Lee Dong Cheol. What brings you here?

172
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,688
Mr. Vice President.

173
00:13:49,528 --> 00:13:54,184
Something serious is happening
inside the Audit Team.

174
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,864
The low-level employees
of that team rushed out of the office.

175
00:13:57,888 --> 00:14:02,144
And Mr. Shin also went out for something.

176
00:14:02,168 --> 00:14:03,384
He's maybe on outside duty.

177
00:14:03,408 --> 00:14:04,888
I don't think so.

178
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:10,384
Where have you been?

179
00:14:10,408 --> 00:14:14,064
I guess you visited
the technology development office again.

180
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:18,064
Don't you think
you've partially focused on J-BIMS?

181
00:14:18,088 --> 00:14:21,304
Of course, I should focus on it.
Our future depends on this project.

182
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:24,944
Our future? Yes, it's important.

183
00:14:24,968 --> 00:14:27,083
But I think you should pay attention

184
00:14:27,107 --> 00:14:30,064
to the fundamental task
of the construction companies.

185
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,184
Have you visited the
construction site recently?

186
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,784
If you visit the construction site

187
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:36,743
as much as you visit
the technology development office,

188
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,144
the speed of construction
work will increase.

189
00:14:39,168 --> 00:14:42,064
I'm not sure
how fast the construction speed would be.

190
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:46,088
But I can see how much
you stew yourself over the J-BIMS.

191
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,424
This is Shin Cha Il.

192
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:06,784
Do you remember Lee Sun Hyung
who resigned seven months ago?

193
00:15:06,808 --> 00:15:10,664
I found out that her sister-in-law
ran a cafeteria at the construction site.

194
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:12,864
But she was running many stores.

195
00:15:12,888 --> 00:15:17,544
Even if she didn't win a bid,
I don't think it did damage her.

196
00:15:17,568 --> 00:15:19,944
Did you find out the cause of his death?

197
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:22,304
He died in a car accident,

198
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:25,984
and his brother who quit the job
is studying in the UK.

199
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,408
Thank you for your efforts.

200
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,920
<i>(Sir, he's a homonym. It's not him.)</i>

201
00:15:51,688 --> 00:15:54,248
Are you interested in that job?

202
00:15:55,648 --> 00:15:58,784
Do you remember the restaurant
that was in this location two years ago?

203
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:02,464
It's called Hangunchan Restaurant,
and the owner name was Lee Kyung Sook.

204
00:16:02,488 --> 00:16:06,384
Of course, I remember.
I used to have lunch here all the time.

205
00:16:06,408 --> 00:16:07,864
It's such a shame.

206
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:09,904
Has anything happened?

207
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:13,033
The owner chipped some money in to open
a restaurant for the construction site.

208
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:14,504
But she ended up getting scammed.

209
00:16:14,528 --> 00:16:17,704
Because of that, this restaurant
was eventually put up for auction.

210
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:22,184
Nobody seems to hold out
in this place for long since then.

211
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,504
Have you recently heard about the owner?

212
00:16:25,528 --> 00:16:29,904
Don't get me started.
She passed away about three months ago.

213
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:32,064
I found out about it late,
so I wasn't able to make a condolence call.

214
00:16:32,088 --> 00:16:35,608
I felt so sad when I heard the news.

215
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,528
I gotta go.

216
00:17:16,488 --> 00:17:19,408
The blackmailer is one of the subcontract
purchase headquarters employees.

217
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:23,648
Yes, tomorrow.

218
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:26,448
Be prepared.

219
00:17:54,368 --> 00:17:55,568
Hello, sir.

220
00:18:06,568 --> 00:18:09,848
You must be tired, but
you came to work early.

221
00:18:11,288 --> 00:18:13,544
I'm always tired.

222
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:16,008
You must've been tired
yesterday in particular.

223
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:19,528
Because you had to run away.

224
00:18:20,848 --> 00:18:22,968
What are you talking about?

225
00:18:39,768 --> 00:18:40,808
Chief Im!

226
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:44,768
Chief Im.

227
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:47,704
Are you okay, ma'am?

228
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,528
I'm okay.

229
00:19:25,888 --> 00:19:27,528
Did you send it by yourself?

230
00:19:28,448 --> 00:19:31,144
You told me to investigate corruption
in the construction site restaurant.

231
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:33,904
Following the audit, no
issues were identified.

232
00:19:33,928 --> 00:19:36,288
It's not that nothing happened.

233
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:39,328
You just couldn't find anything.

234
00:19:46,168 --> 00:19:47,648
Please tell me why.

235
00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:55,248
Tell me now if you do not wish to be
regarded as a meaningless criminal.

236
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,768
My mother…

237
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:08,744
<i>Wow, it's spacious!</i>

238
00:20:08,768 --> 00:20:11,264
<i>My mother was so happy…</i>

239
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:13,362
<i>to finally receive the permit
to run a restaurant…</i>

240
00:20:13,386 --> 00:20:15,426
<i>at the JU Construction site
after waiting for years.</i>

241
00:20:16,408 --> 00:20:17,424
<i>But…</i>

242
00:20:17,448 --> 00:20:18,608
<i>You're now a rich person.</i>

243
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:22,224
<i>- What's all this?
- What are these?</i>

244
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:24,184
<i>What are you doing in my restaurant?</i>

245
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,784
<i>Who are you…</i>

246
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,944
<i>- What do you mean by that?
- We are the owners.</i>

247
00:20:27,968 --> 00:20:30,904
<i>In fact, someone else received the permit.</i>

248
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,914
<i>It turns out that my mother was informed…</i>

249
00:20:32,938 --> 00:20:35,504
<i>that she could have the permit
by paying a bribe to an agency.</i>

250
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:38,664
<i>And she paid the agency 200 million won.</i>

251
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:40,584
<i>We went to the agency
and tried to figure out,</i>

252
00:20:40,608 --> 00:20:42,071
<i>But they made an excuse,</i>

253
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:45,313
<i>saying that the permit was not
for this year, but for two years later.</i>

254
00:20:46,608 --> 00:20:48,208
<i>It was a scam.</i>

255
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,423
<i>I don't have money, I've
pulled all the money I have,</i>

256
00:20:51,447 --> 00:20:53,744
<i>so I'm at a loss to pay back
my loan interest right now…</i>

257
00:20:53,768 --> 00:20:55,464
<i>We were supposed to sign a contract later…</i>

258
00:20:55,488 --> 00:20:56,944
<i>Didn't you draw up a contract?</i>

259
00:20:56,968 --> 00:20:59,424
<i>Can't we get our money back?</i>

260
00:20:59,448 --> 00:21:01,984
<i>We can help but it's not easy.</i>

261
00:21:02,008 --> 00:21:04,064
<i>Oh my.</i>

262
00:21:04,088 --> 00:21:06,264
<i>There's no evidence that we paid the money…</i>

263
00:21:06,288 --> 00:21:08,568
<i>(Audit Office)</i>

264
00:21:10,768 --> 00:21:12,608
<i>(Reporting to the audit team)</i>

265
00:21:18,408 --> 00:21:19,408
<i>What's this?</i>

266
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:24,728
<i>I also reported it to the Audit Team,
but there was no response.</i>

267
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:31,784
I tried to find out how this fraud started…

268
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:34,909
by moving the department
to the subcontract purchase headquarters.

269
00:21:36,248 --> 00:21:38,228
But all I found out was…

270
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:39,979
that the company was not responsible for it

271
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:41,892
due to the end of the
contract with the agency.

272
00:21:43,088 --> 00:21:45,088
What do you think about that, sir?

273
00:21:46,528 --> 00:21:47,904
<i>Don't you have any documents from before?</i>

274
00:21:47,928 --> 00:21:50,784
<i>We entrusted the operation rights
to an agency back then,</i>

275
00:21:50,808 --> 00:21:52,688
<i>and the contract with the agency ended.</i>

276
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:57,233
The agency committed
fraud regarding the permit

277
00:21:57,257 --> 00:22:00,568
to run JU Construction's
on-site restaurant.

278
00:22:01,288 --> 00:22:03,933
But JU Construction said
they're not responsible for anything,

279
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:06,738
and they didn't investigate anything.

280
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:10,288
Do you think it makes sense?

281
00:22:11,328 --> 00:22:14,984
<i>There are more than 100 subcontractors
that we manage.</i>

282
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:16,464
<i>That's a subcontractor as well…</i>

283
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:19,129
<i>How can the purchasing department manage…</i>

284
00:22:19,153 --> 00:22:21,997
<i>whether the subcontractor
receives a bribe or not?</i>

285
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:31,924
No matter what the situation is,
you chose the wrong way.

286
00:22:31,948 --> 00:22:34,244
Im Jung Yoon, the chief of the
subcontract purchase headquarters…

287
00:22:34,268 --> 00:22:37,284
sent a threatening letter to the company,
causing a major scare…

288
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:41,188
and you seriously damaged the safety of
the construction site by drugging the food.

289
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:46,948
I propose the dismissal
of Chief Im Jung Yoon.

290
00:22:54,988 --> 00:22:57,028
I think this has gone wrong…

291
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,644
File this.

292
00:22:59,668 --> 00:23:00,828
Yes, sir.

293
00:23:01,908 --> 00:23:03,028
You're doing well.

294
00:23:07,108 --> 00:23:10,164
I have a stomachache. I will be back soon.

295
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,388
I have a bad stomach.

296
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:21,030
Please handle the resignation
of Chief Im due to health reasons…

297
00:23:21,054 --> 00:23:22,814
and wrap it up without
any criminal charges.

298
00:23:23,628 --> 00:23:27,331
As I said before,
we're about to announce J-BIMS…

299
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:28,395
so let's leave it at that.

300
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,508
Is there anything else you want to report?

301
00:23:34,708 --> 00:23:36,753
There is no legal liability
for JU construction…

302
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:39,478
about the agency
defrauding bidders of money…

303
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,404
under the pretext of operating rights.

304
00:23:42,428 --> 00:23:44,558
However, as the company entrusted
the operation rights to the agency,

305
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:46,404
I would like to suggest
taking moral responsibility,

306
00:23:46,428 --> 00:23:50,804
and supporting the victims' legal costs.

307
00:23:50,828 --> 00:23:53,718
We can transform the company into one
that fulfills its ethical responsibilities.

308
00:23:53,742 --> 00:23:54,444
I like that.

309
00:23:54,468 --> 00:23:56,353
And it's true
that the subcontract purchase headquarters…

310
00:23:56,377 --> 00:23:58,589
neglected to manage the agency,

311
00:23:58,613 --> 00:24:00,724
and sat on the sidelines.

312
00:24:00,748 --> 00:24:03,154
For him to take responsibility,
I suggest giving the head…

313
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,404
of the subcontract purchase, Pyeon,
a three-month pay cut...

314
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:07,868
Let's have him transferred
to Sanpo factory.

315
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:28,998
Vice President…

316
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:32,604
the audit team caught the guy
who sent the threatening letter.

317
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:34,284
It's an internal employee.

318
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:38,644
But they decided to fire him
and not make it a big deal.

319
00:24:38,668 --> 00:24:41,764
Because we have a momentous occasion.

320
00:24:41,788 --> 00:24:47,044
Shin posted an apology on the bulletin
board saying that he would not audit.

321
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:49,924
But apparently, that was a trap…

322
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:53,268
to open the cafeteria
to lure the blackmailer there.

323
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:55,924
<i>I will post an apology.</i>

324
00:24:55,948 --> 00:24:57,319
<i>I will announce it…</i>

325
00:24:59,203 --> 00:25:01,204
<i>on every board in the office.</i>

326
00:25:01,228 --> 00:25:07,564
And to take responsibility
for not managing the agency properly,

327
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:08,788
President…

328
00:25:11,132 --> 00:25:14,884
got the head of the subcontract purchase
transferred to a suburban office.

329
00:25:14,908 --> 00:25:18,468
I wouldn't catch in the crossfire, would I?

330
00:25:20,988 --> 00:25:24,268
This brat thinks of me as a big pushover.

331
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:41,308
Who's in charge of this?

332
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,588
Yes, President.

333
00:25:48,368 --> 00:25:52,948
Sorry? Sanpo?…

334
00:25:55,808 --> 00:26:00,024
President, what did I do wrong?

335
00:26:00,048 --> 00:26:01,258
Please tell me…

336
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:16,593
That's why you hired a
new audit team leader.

337
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,978
How dare you transfer me?

338
00:26:28,884 --> 00:26:29,884
Hey.

339
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:31,584
Yes, sir.

340
00:26:31,608 --> 00:26:33,098
Are you happy now?

341
00:26:33,838 --> 00:26:35,318
Are you?

342
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:37,948
Just you wait.

343
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:44,438
See what happens
when President Hwang Geon Woong comes back.

344
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:32,238
The company decided
not to press criminal charges.

345
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:36,504
I understand how you feel…

346
00:27:36,528 --> 00:27:42,988
But please remember
that there were a lot of victims of this.

347
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:46,254
How are the workers?

348
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:49,578
Some people are still hospitalized,
but they will be okay.

349
00:27:55,358 --> 00:27:57,367
Chief Im.

350
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:59,774
Can I ask…

351
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:06,098
How your mother passed away?

352
00:28:18,708 --> 00:28:25,118
I wanted to let people know
that my mother was wronged somehow…

353
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:32,194
<i>My mother had a hard time…</i>

354
00:28:32,218 --> 00:28:34,368
<i>so she got a serious illness.</i>

355
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:38,055
<i>She said she lost all my marriage funds,</i>

356
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:40,079
<i>so she couldn't let me pay
for the hospital bill.</i>

357
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:44,238
<i>On a cold day at the river…</i>

358
00:28:53,538 --> 00:28:54,808
Goo Han Soo.

359
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:01,228
What was I supposed to do?

360
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,748
There are people who have been affected,
but no one is responsible for that.

361
00:29:08,668 --> 00:29:14,118
Should I have just put up with it
and kept reporting it here and there?

362
00:29:17,028 --> 00:29:18,978
Even if no one is giving me an answer…

363
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:23,788
including the Audit Team.

364
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,538
I've sent Chief Im home.

365
00:30:10,508 --> 00:30:14,604
This happened due to
our complacency as well.

366
00:30:14,628 --> 00:30:18,074
We could have prevented it
if we checked the report two years ago.

367
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:22,144
But everyone turned a blind eye.

368
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:25,804
Everyone was indifferent
because it was an external issue.

369
00:30:25,828 --> 00:30:30,268
Eventually, even innocent
internal employees got damaged.

370
00:30:31,498 --> 00:30:36,678
Please do your audit thoroughly
to prevent this from happening again.

371
00:30:53,158 --> 00:30:54,304
Are you heading home?

372
00:30:54,328 --> 00:30:55,328
Yes, sir.

373
00:30:58,098 --> 00:30:59,724
- Bye.
- See you later.

374
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:01,538
See you tomorrow.

375
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:10,378
If the audit team doesn't audit properly,
such a tragedy could occur.

376
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,928
Everyone will see us as an audit team…

377
00:31:13,952 --> 00:31:16,326
that takes action
when they get a threatening letter.

378
00:31:27,308 --> 00:31:29,018
Enjoy the food.

379
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,159
Han Soo is here.

380
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:35,184
Why is he just going up?

381
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:37,708
Leave him alone.

382
00:31:46,468 --> 00:31:48,654
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

383
00:31:48,678 --> 00:31:52,878
<i>Even if no one is giving me an answer
including the audit team.</i>

384
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,248
Hello.

385
00:32:49,118 --> 00:32:52,578
I think it's trust
that we need in the Audit Team.

386
00:32:55,298 --> 00:32:57,030
We need to get close
to the employees first…

387
00:32:57,054 --> 00:32:59,564
so they can report anytime.

388
00:32:59,588 --> 00:33:02,328
To make them think we are on the same side…

389
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:04,352
How about posting this announcement?

390
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:09,428
That's a good opinion.

391
00:33:13,171 --> 00:33:14,528
I agree.

392
00:33:15,794 --> 00:33:19,684
It feels a bit awkward…

393
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:21,438
but one more vote for approval!

394
00:33:25,578 --> 00:33:29,858
Gathering all your opinions…

395
00:33:30,878 --> 00:33:32,598
I agree 50%.

396
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:37,428
Please, sir.

397
00:33:48,476 --> 00:33:51,654
Wow, what is this?

398
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:55,364
The audit team is trying hard
to build strength.

399
00:33:55,388 --> 00:33:56,334
Write a report.

400
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:57,471
About…

401
00:33:57,495 --> 00:34:01,354
forecast for construction orders
in the second half of the year?

402
00:34:01,378 --> 00:34:03,378
Everything about Shin Cha Il.

403
00:34:03,402 --> 00:34:04,659
About that,

404
00:34:04,683 --> 00:34:07,584
I came to the office early
in the morning the other day,

405
00:34:07,608 --> 00:34:10,471
and looked into the resume of Shin.

406
00:34:10,495 --> 00:34:12,651
So I know about him well…

407
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,694
He went to Sunghan university…

408
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,484
Everything that's not on the resume.

409
00:34:16,508 --> 00:34:18,060
If the contents are poor,

410
00:34:18,084 --> 00:34:20,623
a personnel appointment will be posted
next to this one.

411
00:34:27,038 --> 00:34:30,628
It's nice to go for lunch with you.

412
00:34:31,658 --> 00:34:33,881
I hope the menu is good today.

413
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,654
What's the menu for today?

414
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:39,958
Stir-fried squid and pork cutlet and…

415
00:34:48,852 --> 00:34:51,009
It looks like we have a lot of work to do.

416
00:34:51,033 --> 00:34:53,034
You know I only agreed 50%.

417
00:34:53,058 --> 00:34:55,409
You gathered all our opinions.

418
00:34:55,433 --> 00:34:57,474
You need to put up with…

419
00:34:57,498 --> 00:35:00,378
Let's decide who will be in charge
of the Internet report bulletin board.

420
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:05,191
You can be in charge, Goo Han Soo.

421
00:35:08,795 --> 00:35:10,648
Yes, sir. I'll do my best!

422
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:12,674
Good luck.

423
00:35:12,698 --> 00:35:13,858
Thank you.

424
00:35:29,258 --> 00:35:30,388
What brought you here?

425
00:35:32,518 --> 00:35:36,324
I came here because I heard
that Gun Woong seems to be on the mend.

426
00:35:36,348 --> 00:35:37,954
I told him.

427
00:35:37,978 --> 00:35:40,534
That's good. How is he?

428
00:35:40,558 --> 00:35:43,663
He got better.

429
00:35:43,687 --> 00:35:45,281
He will become conscious soon.

430
00:35:55,128 --> 00:36:00,524
It's not the time to talk about it, but
the performance of the business is poor.

431
00:36:00,548 --> 00:36:03,418
The stock price is down at the bottom.

432
00:36:04,318 --> 00:36:06,139
The economic sentiment index is the worst.

433
00:36:06,163 --> 00:36:08,784
There is also a lot of uncertainty
in the real estate market.

434
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:11,454
I have no choice
but to reduce the amount of sales…

435
00:36:11,478 --> 00:36:14,824
That's why it's hard to be the president.

436
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:17,924
Because the president needs
to get through the current situation.

437
00:36:17,948 --> 00:36:19,074
Once J-BIMS is completed,

438
00:36:19,098 --> 00:36:21,514
the competitiveness of orders
will dramatically increase.

439
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:24,724
Alright, I'm looking forward to it.

440
00:36:24,748 --> 00:36:26,273
How's everything with Dae Woong?

441
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,570
Are you getting along?

442
00:36:30,018 --> 00:36:34,518
The last thing I want to see is the
brothers arguing over management rights.

443
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:39,838
I wish your father had distributed well.

444
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:03,754
<i>(JU Construction's
vision and innovation!)</i>

445
00:37:03,778 --> 00:37:04,264
<i>(J-BIMS presentation demonstration)</i>

446
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,159
Vision and innovation?

447
00:37:07,448 --> 00:37:11,518
That's nice.

448
00:37:32,368 --> 00:37:33,408
Hello.

449
00:37:37,178 --> 00:37:39,818
Can I have a gukbap here, please?

450
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:42,968
Hello, sir.

451
00:37:44,558 --> 00:37:47,148
I don't feel like eating
alone. Can I join you?

452
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,024
Do you often have dinner out?

453
00:38:05,048 --> 00:38:06,444
No one at home today?

454
00:38:06,468 --> 00:38:08,064
There's no one all the time.

455
00:38:08,088 --> 00:38:09,598
Alright, you live alone…

456
00:38:10,778 --> 00:38:13,048
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the food.

457
00:38:17,738 --> 00:38:19,088
Sir…

458
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:24,078
The Audit Team has been changing
since you came.

459
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:28,118
Should I say it became a proper audit team?

460
00:38:29,498 --> 00:38:33,728
I feel proud and responsible these days
as a member of an audit team.

461
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:35,439
And…

462
00:38:37,088 --> 00:38:40,494
My new goal is to become someone like you.

463
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:44,854
I'm not still convinced by you saying
that we have to doubt everyone…

464
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:48,703
But even if you said it,
you trust the team members, don't you?

465
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:53,418
Enjoy the food.

466
00:38:57,798 --> 00:38:59,268
It looks delicious.

467
00:39:37,378 --> 00:39:41,394
<i>I feel proud and responsible these days
as a member of an audit team.</i>

468
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:44,398
<i>My new goal is to become someone like you.</i>

469
00:39:55,638 --> 00:39:56,714
<i>What's going on?</i>

470
00:39:56,738 --> 00:40:00,355
<i>About the audit report of the
building material purchase you wrote…</i>

471
00:40:00,379 --> 00:40:04,124
<i>You reviewed that had
been approved already.</i>

472
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:06,818
<i>You're the team's next ace.
I feel reassured.</i>

473
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:12,334
<i>What's wrong? Is there an issue?</i>

474
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:15,988
<i>I found something strange
while checking the purchase lists.</i>

475
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:19,181
<i>I should've explained you in advance.</i>

476
00:40:19,205 --> 00:40:21,721
<i>Our youngest must have been shocked
as it's your first time.</i>

477
00:40:21,745 --> 00:40:25,674
<i>You are right, the actual amount
of steel purchased is 300 tons.</i>

478
00:40:25,698 --> 00:40:30,214
<i>Then, why is it shown
that the company paid for 420 tons?</i>

479
00:40:30,238 --> 00:40:33,258
<i>Because the remaining
amount is reflected here.</i>

480
00:40:34,024 --> 00:40:36,134
<i>There were advanced purchases.</i>

481
00:40:36,158 --> 00:40:40,727
<i>Every time they purchase,
they get benefited.</i>

482
00:40:40,751 --> 00:40:44,651
<i>Even so, shouldn't we report accurately?</i>

483
00:40:45,678 --> 00:40:47,847
<i>You are right.</i>

484
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:51,521
<i>But as the construction goes on,
there are a lot of additional costs.</i>

485
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:55,291
<i>It's a hassle to always be accurate.</i>

486
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:02,107
<i>Do you think I'm getting bribed
to keep my mouth shut on this?</i>

487
00:41:02,131 --> 00:41:03,194
<i>I didn't mean that…</i>

488
00:41:03,218 --> 00:41:05,441
<i>Do you think I will destroy this place?</i>

489
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,601
<i>I didn't mean to say that…</i>

490
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:09,734
<i>Cha Il, don't bother these little things,
focus on the big.</i>

491
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:12,505
<i>Auditing is all about
looking at the big picture.</i>

492
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:15,478
<i>Let's go.</i>

493
00:41:35,018 --> 00:41:36,018
Good Morning.

494
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,031
Good Morning.

495
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:45,471
Good Morning!

496
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:00,911
Don't come near me!

497
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:09,191
I'm whistle blowing on workplace bullying.

498
00:42:11,545 --> 00:42:12,321
Yoon Woo!

499
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:13,814
Don't come!

500
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,231
Okay. Okay, put out
the fire and let's talk.

501
00:42:20,425 --> 00:42:21,565
I said don't come near me!

502
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:30,585
This crazy bastard,
who do you think you are to start a fire?

503
00:42:33,378 --> 00:42:34,378
Is it fun?

504
00:42:35,218 --> 00:42:36,411
Get back to work!

505
00:42:38,918 --> 00:42:40,074
Take care of it.

506
00:42:40,098 --> 00:42:42,037
Yoon Woo, are you fine?

507
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:52,862
The informant's
psychological state is unstable,

508
00:42:52,886 --> 00:42:54,785
it is better to give him some time.

509
00:42:56,898 --> 00:42:59,960
I heard you were
Oh Yoon Woo's colleague as well.

510
00:42:59,984 --> 00:43:01,887
Yes.

511
00:43:01,911 --> 00:43:04,413
He was considered for the
most Popular Employee Award,

512
00:43:04,437 --> 00:43:05,991
because of his good personality.

513
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:09,738
I don't know
how he even thought of starting a fire.

514
00:43:10,451 --> 00:43:12,571
I wonder how hard time
he must have had with his boss.

515
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:18,431
I wonder how much he was harassed…

516
00:43:18,455 --> 00:43:21,554
But is there anyone in the Technology
Development Team who would do that?

517
00:43:21,578 --> 00:43:23,421
Never heard of it.

518
00:43:23,445 --> 00:43:24,944
Isn't that team super busy right now

519
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:26,971
as they have the J-BIMS
Demonstration coming up?

520
00:43:31,825 --> 00:43:32,825
This is Shin Cha Il.

521
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:36,505
Okay.

522
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,351
We will do the interview
after I meet with the President.

523
00:43:45,071 --> 00:43:46,479
I heard there was an incident at the lobby.

524
00:43:46,503 --> 00:43:48,494
And the Audit Team took him.

525
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:51,831
Yes, we plan to investigate as soon
as the informant is in stable condition.

526
00:43:53,225 --> 00:43:54,478
I wanted to ask you about it.

527
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:24,352
I had my network scour
for it at full capacity,

528
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:29,134
I'm sure of it,
Shin Cha Il is a disgusting person.

529
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:33,605
I didn't know he would go this far.

530
00:44:35,278 --> 00:44:39,194
Sir, why don't you go
to the Audit office and spill it out?

531
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:43,791
I'm sure he will be embarrassed
in front of his team and walk out.

532
00:44:46,305 --> 00:44:47,958
It's no fun spilling it out all at once.

533
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:53,458
I'm going to stop him, slowly.

534
00:44:58,785 --> 00:45:04,171
Yoon Woo, tell me what happened this time.

535
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:09,371
Why do you look so worn out?

536
00:45:11,338 --> 00:45:12,591
So upsetting.

537
00:45:13,645 --> 00:45:16,291
You were really happy when you
moved to the Tech Development Team.

538
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:18,338
I was…

539
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:22,418
I really wanted to be in that team.

540
00:45:26,798 --> 00:45:29,948
The Audit team will
do our best to help you,

541
00:45:29,972 --> 00:45:33,858
so don't worry and tell us
everything that happened.

542
00:45:39,878 --> 00:45:41,943
You said you were constantly bullied by

543
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:44,565
Mr. Park Jae Hwan from
the Tech Development team.

544
00:45:45,818 --> 00:45:48,258
Do you remember when
did the bullying start?

545
00:45:54,858 --> 00:45:58,641
I'm not certain,
but it has been approximately 3-4 months.

546
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,345
Is there a specific reason that you

547
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:05,851
decided to report it after
bearing it for this long?

548
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:08,591
It was my motto to work for the

549
00:46:08,615 --> 00:46:10,820
Tech Development team
ever since I joined the company.

550
00:46:10,844 --> 00:46:12,704
More than anything,

551
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,987
I took pride in being a part of the
J-BIMS Demonstration,

552
00:46:16,591 --> 00:46:23,258
that plays an important role
in shaping this company's future.

553
00:46:25,098 --> 00:46:27,297
That's why I endured
through the difficulties.

554
00:46:32,298 --> 00:46:33,698
<i>Good Morning, Sir.</i>

555
00:46:50,465 --> 00:46:53,467
<i>Sir, I think there is an error
in the server access system.</i>

556
00:46:53,491 --> 00:46:54,771
<i>It's not an error.</i>

557
00:46:55,531 --> 00:46:56,167
<i>Yes?</i>

558
00:46:56,191 --> 00:47:00,106
<i>From now on,
you cannot access the J-BIMS server.</i>

559
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:03,191
<i>We deactivated your access, already
received confirmation from Section Chief.</i>

560
00:47:07,725 --> 00:47:11,094
<i>Are you saying, I cannot participate
in J-BIMS development anymore?</i>

561
00:47:11,118 --> 00:47:14,198
<i>Yes, you have been excluded.</i>

562
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,667
<i>There are other works, too.</i>

563
00:47:17,691 --> 00:47:22,487
<i>The security team asked for something.
Here, do this.</i>

564
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:24,551
<i>The other employees
are busy with the Demonstration.</i>

565
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:43,465
I could not accept getting excluded
from the J-BIMS Demonstration.

566
00:47:44,185 --> 00:47:47,998
In other words, they are asking me
to leave the Development Team.

567
00:47:51,085 --> 00:47:52,525
You must have worked so hard for it.

568
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:07,365
I have to analyze the situation. Ms. Seo
Jin, please lead the interview this time.

569
00:48:09,285 --> 00:48:10,021
Me?

570
00:48:10,045 --> 00:48:12,405
The more you do interviews,
the more you get the hang of it.

571
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:15,724
Lead the conversation
and get as much information as you can.

572
00:48:17,111 --> 00:48:19,011
Be focused.

573
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:30,365
You can go inside.

574
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:01,618
I'm sorry, I'm not a very organized person.

575
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:03,518
Please have a seat.

576
00:49:10,725 --> 00:49:15,281
You made it here quick. It hasn't been long
that you informed you were coming.

577
00:49:15,305 --> 00:49:18,314
It's a simple interview
so it's better to get done with it quick.

578
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:19,338
Sure.

579
00:49:20,218 --> 00:49:25,058
Please excuse me as I may not be able
to give you enough time for the interview.

580
00:49:26,918 --> 00:49:28,447
Can I borrow this?

581
00:49:28,471 --> 00:49:29,471
Just a moment.

582
00:49:34,798 --> 00:49:37,378
Please use this, that looks crumbled.

583
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:43,278
I'll start with the interview.

584
00:49:44,225 --> 00:49:48,238
Oh Yoon Woo reported that he was bullied
by Manager, Mr. Park Jae Hwan.

585
00:49:51,198 --> 00:49:54,325
It's my fault, a self-immolation attempt…

586
00:49:55,331 --> 00:50:00,694
I apologize that I didn't know Yoon Woo
was going through a difficult phase.

587
00:50:00,718 --> 00:50:03,287
I heard both of them
are in charge of the same tasks.

588
00:50:03,311 --> 00:50:05,941
Yes, cost optimization engine development.

589
00:50:05,965 --> 00:50:09,254
Mr. Park is the main
and Yoon Woo is the support.

590
00:50:09,278 --> 00:50:14,151
Oh Yoon Woo said that he was verbally
abused. What do you think about that?

591
00:50:22,338 --> 00:50:25,241
Chief Park is a sensitive person.

592
00:50:25,265 --> 00:50:27,974
He played an important role
in the team and had a lot of work.

593
00:50:27,998 --> 00:50:32,564
Yoon Woo who supported the team,
made a lot of mistakes and had a weak base.

594
00:50:33,745 --> 00:50:36,765
Chief Park scolded him
a lot and got angry, too.

595
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:40,307
But it's difficult to say
that he verbally abused him.

596
00:50:40,331 --> 00:50:44,367
What was the reason to kick out Yoon Woo
from the J-BIMS Demonstration?

597
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:48,544
It was Mr. Park's idea.
He was worried he might be a hindrance.

598
00:50:50,371 --> 00:50:53,911
I feel sorry for Yoon
Woo, but work comes first.

599
00:51:09,405 --> 00:51:13,744
This is Shin Cha Il from the Audit Team.
I am requesting for an interview.

600
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:38,658
Hello, this is Yoon Seo Jin from the Audit
Team. I am requesting for an interview.

601
00:51:57,845 --> 00:51:58,845
That is Chief Park right?

602
00:51:59,951 --> 00:52:02,427
Why does the perpetrator look so down?

603
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:05,647
People might think he
was the one to get bullied.

604
00:52:05,671 --> 00:52:06,671
Right?

605
00:52:08,891 --> 00:52:13,254
Yoon Woo, it's been so long.
Why don't you come more often?

606
00:52:13,278 --> 00:52:15,907
Exactly. Dad, where's the chicken?

607
00:52:15,931 --> 00:52:18,851
Right now! Right now! Let's go, Let's go.

608
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:26,989
Yoon Woo, you said our chicken is
delicious, but why don't you come often?

609
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:28,587
Did you find some other place?

610
00:52:28,611 --> 00:52:29,611
Right?

611
00:52:30,845 --> 00:52:33,761
I was stuck with some work.

612
00:52:33,785 --> 00:52:40,478
What work? Why didn't you tell me?
We could have solved it together.

613
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:43,005
Have a good meal.

614
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:47,398
Yoon Woo, first have this.

615
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:52,301
You know, it's chicken
when we are stressed.

616
00:52:52,325 --> 00:52:54,985
At our place chicken
is really good, eat up.

617
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:04,328
It's delicious right! Stress relieved
right! Shall we have beer too?

618
00:53:07,405 --> 00:53:11,185
Yoon Woo, Team leader has
given you time off so rest well.

619
00:53:11,209 --> 00:53:13,858
So, don't think much, now let's eat up.

620
00:53:17,538 --> 00:53:22,587
Okay, here, take another one.

621
00:53:22,611 --> 00:53:24,465
See I gave you two, you know I care right?

622
00:53:26,111 --> 00:53:27,738
You have to eat to strengthen up.

623
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:32,791
Good to see you smiling!
Dad, Beer please.

624
00:53:33,991 --> 00:53:37,354
Oh Yoon Woo and Chief Park's arguments
are contradictory.

625
00:53:37,378 --> 00:53:40,694
Why do you think Chief Park bullied you?

626
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,741
Is he like that with other employees too?

627
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:46,711
I know I lack a lot.
But, he speaks harshly to me.

628
00:53:47,445 --> 00:53:51,521
<i>We are still waiting on the solution right?
It delays other work, too.</i>

629
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:54,438
<i>I'm sorry, I'll complete
it within this week.</i>

630
00:53:55,165 --> 00:53:57,714
<i>Yes, please. Meeting over.</i>

631
00:53:57,738 --> 00:53:59,958
<i>Thank you.</i>

632
00:54:01,945 --> 00:54:03,838
<i>Yoon Woo, please wait.</i>

633
00:54:05,265 --> 00:54:07,931
<i>How many times
do I need to tell you?</i>

634
00:54:07,955 --> 00:54:11,811
<i>Why do you have a brain
if you don't use it at all?</i>

635
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:20,741
You pointed out his in competencies. But,
you didn't verbally abuse him, did you?

636
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:22,105
No, I didn't.

637
00:54:25,718 --> 00:54:31,461
<i>How many times do I need
to tell you correct this?</i>

638
00:54:31,485 --> 00:54:32,607
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

639
00:54:32,631 --> 00:54:37,744
<i>Others are getting affected by delays
on our side. Please think while working.</i>

640
00:54:40,765 --> 00:54:43,881
Do you have any evidence or anyone
to testify regarding the verbal abuse?

641
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:47,558
Of course, there is none! I have
never bullied or verbally abused him.

642
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,998
<i>I'm sorry, the simulation seems
to be difficult at the moment.</i>

643
00:54:58,022 --> 00:55:01,474
<i>I will get back to you with
this as soon as possible.</i>

644
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:04,425
<i>What kind of meeting preparation is this?</i>

645
00:55:05,271 --> 00:55:06,385
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

646
00:55:09,011 --> 00:55:12,251
<i>Oh Yoon Woo, how could you
do a mistake on the attachment?</i>

647
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:13,974
<i>I'm so embarrassed right now.</i>

648
00:55:13,998 --> 00:55:16,798
<i>Are you trying to screw me up
because you have ill feelings towards me?</i>

649
00:55:18,118 --> 00:55:23,067
<i>If that's the case, let's talk it out. It's
difficult for me to continue like this.</i>

650
00:55:23,091 --> 00:55:25,653
Always when it was two
of us or over the phone.

651
00:55:25,677 --> 00:55:28,799
Since our team had strict security
program installed on our phones,

652
00:55:28,823 --> 00:55:29,951
we cannot voice record.

653
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,474
<i>Yes, Chief.</i>

654
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:35,471
<i>Are you in your right mind?</i>

655
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,707
<i>Why can't someone even
send an email properly?</i>

656
00:55:40,731 --> 00:55:44,187
<i>You are purposely trying to screw me up
and make me look bad, right?</i>

657
00:55:44,211 --> 00:55:45,361
<i>No...</i>

658
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:50,154
<i>You use your brain to screw me up
instead of using it for work.</i>

659
00:55:50,178 --> 00:55:54,365
<i>Such an incompetent, unlucky brat.</i>

660
00:56:09,558 --> 00:56:15,454
I may not be good enough,
but excluding me from the J-BIMS is unfair.

661
00:56:15,478 --> 00:56:18,438
It's almost at the last stage of the
Demonstration and running out of time.

662
00:56:18,885 --> 00:56:23,121
Instead of being of help,
he is just a hindrance.

663
00:56:23,145 --> 00:56:27,794
Honestly, I wish Yoon Woo leaves the team.

664
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:28,818
For everyone's sake.

665
00:56:32,011 --> 00:56:33,151
I'm back.

666
00:56:34,605 --> 00:56:36,838
What do the other team members say?

667
00:56:43,631 --> 00:56:48,294
<i>He gets in a lot of trouble.
I guess, he lacks competence.</i>

668
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:51,727
<i>But chief is a really good person,
so he doesn't say much.</i>

669
00:56:51,751 --> 00:56:54,201
<i>If it was someone with a temper…</i>

670
00:56:54,225 --> 00:56:55,941
<i>Chief Park often gets annoyed.</i>

671
00:56:55,965 --> 00:56:58,405
<i>He was not like this before
but it's getting worse day by day.</i>

672
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:02,040
<i>Yoon Woo does make a lot of mistakes.</i>

673
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:04,934
<i>I heard he was good
when he worked under Chief Shin.</i>

674
00:57:04,958 --> 00:57:07,566
<i>Chief Park oversees
Yoon Woo's work very discretely.</i>

675
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:13,681
<i>So whenever anything is late or goes wrong,
he blames Yoon Woo.</i>

676
00:57:13,705 --> 00:57:17,419
<i>Have you ever heard Chief
Park verbally abuse Yoon Woo</i>

677
00:57:17,443 --> 00:57:19,821
<i>or bring up his home environment?</i>

678
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:25,661
<i>Yes? Bring up the fact that he is adopted?
I think that's a bit too much.</i>

679
00:57:25,685 --> 00:57:30,867
<i>Chief Park… may be sensitive,
but he is not trash to bring that up.</i>

680
00:57:30,891 --> 00:57:33,930
<i>Even though we are busy and
may not look interested in others,</i>

681
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:37,511
<i>if we see things happening,
we won't turn a blind eye.</i>

682
00:57:39,645 --> 00:57:41,925
Oh Yoon Woo is making things up.

683
00:57:42,845 --> 00:57:45,591
It's ambiguous and we lack evidence.

684
00:58:03,058 --> 00:58:04,058
Yes, Sir.

685
00:58:05,145 --> 00:58:07,995
It's been long since
you came to my place.

686
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:08,961
Wait.

687
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,107
It's okay.

688
00:58:10,131 --> 00:58:11,761
I can go to my house.

689
00:58:11,785 --> 00:58:15,914
What are you saying?
Just rest here till tomorrow.

690
00:58:15,938 --> 00:58:18,978
I'll finish up work at office and be back.
Let's have a nice dinner together.

691
00:58:24,085 --> 00:58:29,374
Does no one from your team know
that Chief Park bullied you?

692
00:58:29,398 --> 00:58:31,746
Everybody just knows that he scolded me.

693
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:34,904
He used harsh words
when it was only two of us.

694
00:58:35,858 --> 00:58:39,121
What about the Section Chief?
Does he get angry too?

695
00:58:39,145 --> 00:58:42,004
Never, the Section Chief
is a really nice person.

696
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:49,874
Yes, Section Chief.

697
00:58:49,898 --> 00:58:51,814
<i>How do you feel now?</i>

698
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:53,398
I am better now.

699
00:58:55,845 --> 00:59:00,794
I am granting you special leave for 10
days. <i>Please rest and let's meet up later.</i>

700
00:59:00,818 --> 00:59:05,271
The Demonstration will end in 10 days.

701
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:09,474
Am I completely excluded
from the J-BIMS Demonstration?

702
00:59:09,498 --> 00:59:12,987
It's not possible to have you participate
in J-BIMS at this time.

703
00:59:13,011 --> 00:59:16,914
We are too tight on schedule to work
out our emotions towards each other.

704
00:59:16,938 --> 00:59:20,198
No, I'll be in the office right away.

705
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:24,691
Yes?

706
00:59:26,811 --> 00:59:28,118
Okay.

707
00:59:29,998 --> 00:59:31,111
I understand.

708
00:59:34,078 --> 00:59:35,767
You can't report back to work on J-BIMS?

709
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:41,741
He says I'm on leave,
but he is actually asking me to drop off.

710
00:59:41,765 --> 00:59:44,445
I'll get back to the office
and let the Audit Team know about this.

711
00:59:59,371 --> 01:00:04,644
Section Chief Jihoon granted leave to
Yoon Woo and asked him to drop off J-BIMS.

712
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:09,718
It's been decided to work on Yoon
Woo's report after the J-BIMS is over.

713
01:00:10,825 --> 01:00:14,791
Then, nothing changes for Yoon Woo.
We have to investigate further.

714
01:00:16,658 --> 01:00:20,081
There is no evidence
to the verbal abuse argument.

715
01:00:20,105 --> 01:00:23,521
That's because Development Team's special
case that makes recording impossible.

716
01:00:23,545 --> 01:00:26,166
We received testimonies from
Development Team team-members

717
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:28,811
that they never witnessed Chief
Park verbally abused Yoon Woo.

718
01:00:29,798 --> 01:00:32,818
As of now, Yoon Woo's report
is just a one-side claim.

719
01:00:33,571 --> 01:00:35,265
Considering the situation,

720
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:40,067
we will separate Chief Park and Yoon
Woo until the demonstration is over.

721
01:00:40,091 --> 01:00:42,134
We will decide whether Yoon Woo
is return back to the Development team

722
01:00:42,158 --> 01:00:44,118
or transfer to other team
after the demonstration.

723
01:00:45,138 --> 01:00:46,978
<i>I'll go to the Audit
Office and let them know.</i>

724
01:00:47,805 --> 01:00:49,753
<i>The President already
asked Audit Team Manager</i>

725
01:00:49,777 --> 01:00:51,725
<i>to stop the investigation
and cause an issue.</i>

726
01:00:53,058 --> 01:00:56,238
Is it because of the President?

727
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:03,038
Did he ask you to cover up this issue?

728
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:07,436
Is this what you meant
when you said Audit Team

729
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:09,891
should always look at
things with suspicion?

730
01:01:11,225 --> 01:01:14,898
How painful must it be
for Yoon Woo to think of self-immolation?

731
01:01:16,411 --> 01:01:19,568
I understand how important
the Demonstration is,

732
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:23,367
but is it worth ignoring someone's life?
I don't think so.

733
01:01:23,391 --> 01:01:28,827
I'm not ignoring him. We are just
postponing our decision for 10 days.

734
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:30,987
Why does the victim have to excluded?

735
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:34,638
Yoon Woo did his best for the
J-BIMS Development for the past year.

736
01:01:36,931 --> 01:01:41,361
Do we have turn a blind eye on bad things
for the sake of company's profit?

737
01:01:41,385 --> 01:01:43,740
You have lost your sense
of judgement and are biased

738
01:01:43,764 --> 01:01:46,398
because of your personal feelings
towards the informant.

739
01:01:48,385 --> 01:01:51,705
Is that so? How about this?

740
01:01:52,998 --> 01:01:55,785
What if someone is trying to
leak company's important technology?

741
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:02,147
What do you mean?

742
01:02:02,171 --> 01:02:05,097
You may cover up employees getting bullied.

743
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:09,585
But, I'm sure you are going to
investigate a big case like this.

744
01:02:41,565 --> 01:02:45,347
This is where they place bets
on illegally leaked information.

745
01:02:45,371 --> 01:02:47,681
- Is it…
- J-BIMS.

746
01:02:47,705 --> 01:02:50,554
The only thing important to us is evidence.

747
01:02:50,578 --> 01:02:57,891
It's disgusting to criticize bribery
while treating one's life as meaningless.

748
01:02:59,731 --> 01:03:01,069
Think before you answer.

749
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:03,118
It might be decisive
factor to report the incident

750
01:03:03,142 --> 01:03:05,167
to the police as soon
as this investigation ends.

751
01:03:05,191 --> 01:03:07,601
The Demonstration cannot be messed up.

752
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:12,405
I have found evidence regarding the leaking
of important technology at the J-BIMS.
