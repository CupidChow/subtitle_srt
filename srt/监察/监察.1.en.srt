2
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:20,246
Nothing, right? Try to check this.

3
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,494
Please approve this.

4
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,054
Isn't that the head of the inspection team?

5
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,030
Did someone make a mistake?

6
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,742
- Who?
- I don't know.

7
00:02:37,735 --> 00:02:39,218
He's going into Director Kang's room?

8
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,377
What's wrong with you?

9
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:51,711
Should I question you here?

10
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,432
Please tell me what's going on.

11
00:03:11,456 --> 00:03:13,119
I'm busy with the budget allocation.

12
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,181
You forged a company stamp, right?

13
00:03:31,093 --> 00:03:32,093
What?

14
00:03:41,862 --> 00:03:43,908
You're saying that I made this?

15
00:04:09,392 --> 00:04:10,955
Finance Manager Kang Riquan,

16
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:13,838
September 17, 2 p.m.
at Namyoung Bank's Myeongdong branch,

17
00:04:13,862 --> 00:04:16,322
you created a fake account
using the company's name.

18
00:04:16,346 --> 00:04:19,448
After that, you designated a beneficiary
and made sure to deposit the money

19
00:04:19,472 --> 00:04:20,713
20 million won.

20
00:04:20,737 --> 00:04:24,167
Oh, I paid it back a month later
after cashing out the money.

21
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,627
Do you admit to embezzlement?

22
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:26,982
Sir, sir!

23
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,185
I have a disease
called thoracic aortic aneurysm.

24
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,044
It's a disease that costs a lot of money.

25
00:04:32,068 --> 00:04:35,294
I can't miss the treatment period so I use
the company's money first to get treated.

26
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,825
To live, okay?

27
00:04:37,748 --> 00:04:39,615
I did it because I'm trying to live.

28
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,131
Please consider a leniency.

29
00:04:47,146 --> 00:04:49,287
You have two options.

30
00:04:49,311 --> 00:04:51,060
First, you quit on your own.

31
00:04:51,084 --> 00:04:53,331
Second, the company will give
you retirement due to disobedience.

32
00:04:53,355 --> 00:04:56,446
If you choose the second one,
we'll proceed to the police station.

33
00:04:58,105 --> 00:05:00,032
Didn't I pay back the same amount?

34
00:05:00,792 --> 00:05:02,284
If the company lent it to me for a while…

35
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,261
The company is not a bank.

36
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,597
Now choose. First or second?

37
00:05:06,621 --> 00:05:08,183
It's one month. One month.

38
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,167
Didn't I put it back after a month?

39
00:05:16,305 --> 00:05:19,243
I've worked hard for 20 years.

40
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:22,977
How can you kick me out so coldly
over a mistake?

41
00:05:30,454 --> 00:05:31,454
Sir!

42
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:37,086
My daughter is really good at ballet.

43
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,476
If I quit the company here,
I will take away my daughter's dream.

44
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,007
What company would accept me at this age?

45
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,687
So, so, please.

46
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:47,195
Please save me, sir.

47
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:48,640
Please, sir.

48
00:05:48,664 --> 00:05:50,125
2 million won…

49
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,242
It was a test, wasn't it?

50
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,439
Your objective is…

51
00:06:09,743 --> 00:06:11,524
a deposit for debt settlement

52
00:06:12,938 --> 00:06:14,267
for 25 billion won.

53
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:23,112
If this debt payment deposit is lost, you
know the company is going bankrupt, right?

54
00:06:25,324 --> 00:06:27,871
With a forged stamp,

55
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:30,223
you want to creat a phisical account.

56
00:06:31,021 --> 00:06:33,177
You even did deposit
and withdrew rehearsal.

57
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:39,472
It's a complete betrayal for the company
to entrust you with finances.

58
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:42,254
Sir, that's...

59
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:53,354
You're…

60
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:55,675
taking away

61
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,434
the dreams

62
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,473
of all the employees

63
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:04,966
in our company.

64
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:14,589

00:09:04,145 --> 00:09:06,419
Sir, let's take a love shot together.

68

Oh my gosh!

69
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,318
Oh, it's cold!

70
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:15,664
Since it's the last company dinner,
I feel like the beer is going crazy.

71
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,820
Hey, I'm disappointed
that it's the last one. Sir,

72
00:09:17,844 --> 00:09:19,626
we're not going to see each other again.

73
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,024
Let's see. Good job, everyone.

74
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:26,610
Even if I leave,
you guys have to survive there.

75
00:09:28,142 --> 00:09:29,825
I really have a lot to say.

76
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:32,508
I mean, CEO Hwang Se Woong,
what a shit of CEO.

77
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:35,966
The moment he was promoted,
he only thinks of himself.

78
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:39,794
He treated our audit team leader coldly
and made him quit.

79
00:09:39,818 --> 00:09:41,521
Does this make sense?

80
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:43,202
But you'll be the team leader if I left.

81
00:09:43,226 --> 00:09:46,669
No, that's not what I'm saying right now.
You know that, sir.

82
00:09:46,693 --> 00:09:48,466
I'm just really sad.

83
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,130
I'm upset.

84
00:09:50,154 --> 00:09:52,681
I heard it's because of
CEO Hwang Se Woong and

85
00:09:52,705 --> 00:09:55,232
Vice President Hwang
Dae Woong's power struggle.

86
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:59,384
Even if Hwang Se Woong is the president,
the vice president is still a big shot.

87
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:02,290
You guys have to take the right side.

88
00:10:02,314 --> 00:10:05,486
Which side should I take then?

89
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,002
Is it Hwang Se Woong or Hwang Dae Woong?

90
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:13,077
Anyway, our audit team is dying thanks
to the fight between the two brothers.

91
00:10:13,101 --> 00:10:15,718
Chief, I'm here.

92
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:18,142
- I will support you firmly from the back.
- Oh, that's nice.

93
00:10:18,507 --> 00:10:19,780
- Assistant Manager Moon,
- Yes?

94
00:10:19,804 --> 00:10:21,249
You're good at taking sides.

95
00:10:22,428 --> 00:10:23,419
Thank you.

96
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:26,093
Then I'll side with the deputy manager.

97
00:10:26,117 --> 00:10:28,374
See? Goo Han Soo, that was good.

98
00:10:28,398 --> 00:10:30,812
Hey, Goo Han Soo,
how could you left me and go to him?

99
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:31,827
Of course.

100
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:34,577
Manager, the deputy manager
is higher than the manager.

101
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:36,350
Do your best.

102
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,894
Seo Jin, who do you want to side with?

103
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,268
Well, does the side matter?
We are all in the same company anyway.

104
00:10:42,292 --> 00:10:44,306
Oh, you're not fun.

105
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:47,009
- Seo Jin is so smart.
- Thank you.

106
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:50,204
Don't give your life to the company,
either. You'll end up like me.

107
00:10:50,228 --> 00:10:55,533
What are you talking about to the them.
We need to risk our life for work.

108
00:10:57,478 --> 00:10:58,798
You're here?

109
00:10:58,822 --> 00:11:00,602
I heard you couldn't come
because you were doing overtime.

110
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,966
How am I not coming when my friend is
going?

111
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:05,056
I have to buy him some drinks, right?

112
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,286
It's not like I'm dying.
Why are you consoling me.

113
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:10,150
Just congratulate me.

114
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:11,486
I'll pour you a drink.

115
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,501
Oh, yes, yes.

116
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,436
You'll have chicken for the side dish.

117
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:20,904
Han Soo is always so sweet.

118
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:23,022
I'm the one who raise him.

119
00:11:23,046 --> 00:11:25,628
You, even if I go, take care of my friend.

120
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:27,362
Of course. Don't worry.

121
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,643
- Okay, let's have a drink.
- Yes.

122
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,994
Congratulations.

123
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,713
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

124
00:11:40,964 --> 00:11:43,831
I can't drink. I had to work overtime.

125
00:11:43,855 --> 00:11:45,408
Okay.

126
00:11:45,432 --> 00:11:48,393
Oh, is this my wife or a daughter?

127
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,776
Okay, I got it. Okay.

128
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,713
Oh, why did you come out?

129
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:55,143
Did you talk to your daughter?

130
00:11:55,167 --> 00:11:58,724
She's been nagging
since she got married now.

131
00:12:00,289 --> 00:12:04,226
Look, my daughter is pretty, isn't she?
She's the prettiest when she smiles.

132
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,686
But she doesn't look like you at all.

133
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:10,207
That's why she's pretty.
She looks like her mom.

134
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:11,699
It's cold, let's go in.

135
00:12:11,723 --> 00:12:13,115
No, I have to go.

136
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,428
I paid all the tab. Yeah.

137
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:16,615
I'm sure it costed a lot.

138
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,381
Oh, it's nothing.

139
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,451
Thank you.

140
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:22,310
It must have been hard for you
to work overtime these days.

141
00:12:22,334 --> 00:12:24,592
It's okay, it's not even new to me.

142
00:12:24,616 --> 00:12:25,639
It must be hard for you.

143
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,404
But I'm glad
that the Tower Crane incident ends well.

144
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:30,505
Yeah, well, that's good.

145
00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:32,147
Oh, take this.

146
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:35,739
You step on something on site last time
and you damaged your shoes.

147
00:12:35,763 --> 00:12:37,383
Wear this.

148
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:40,274
Sir, sir!

149
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:42,063
Thank you so much.

150
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,203
What? You're thanking me?

151
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:45,227
Thank you.

152
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:47,396
Go have more fun. Yeah.

153
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,731
- It's too bad.
- I'm going to go.

154
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:52,145
Sir, I'll treat this well.

155
00:12:52,169 --> 00:12:53,177
Okay.

156
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,715
Hey, let's have one more drink.

157
00:13:03,371 --> 00:13:05,199
Let's see each other again, okay.

158
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:06,472
We will keep in touch.

159
00:13:06,496 --> 00:13:08,160
Goodbye.

160
00:13:08,184 --> 00:13:10,700
- Now, Chief. Ok.
- Yes?

161
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:11,715
Assistant Manager Moon.

162
00:13:11,739 --> 00:13:15,465
- What are you doing?
- Goo Han Soo, Yoon Seo Jin.

163
00:13:15,489 --> 00:13:18,364
From now on, walk in a line. Let's go!

164
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:21,144
I need to catch the
last train. I'll go first.

165
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,825
I have to go, too.

166
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:24,168
I'll pay for the taxi.

167
00:13:24,192 --> 00:13:26,118
Sir! It's not the trend to hold onto the

168
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:28,261
youngsters just for
drinks anymore nowadays.

169
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,847
Let's go home now.

170
00:13:29,871 --> 00:13:33,465
Then, Mr. Moon, Mr. Ok, everyone, let's go!

171
00:13:33,489 --> 00:13:35,754
- Let's go. Let's go.
- No, I, sir…

172
00:13:35,778 --> 00:13:36,871
Goodbye.

173
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,199
Take care.

174
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,144
This? Mr. Bae gave it to me as a gift.

175
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:49,340
Last time, I went to the construction site,
and my shoes were damaged.

176
00:13:49,364 --> 00:13:52,248
Does audit department allow to receive that
from other employees?

177
00:13:52,272 --> 00:13:55,732
I also gave the eel
juice to Mr. Bae last time.

178
00:13:55,756 --> 00:13:58,740
I don't have any other hidden purpose.
It's just a gift, so what's the matter?

179
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:01,896
But we're working in the audit team.

180
00:14:02,694 --> 00:14:04,586
As the youngest member of the team,

181
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,862
let's cheer up so that we can
maintain this good atmosphere.

182
00:14:07,886 --> 00:14:09,486
Love the country, love the team members!

183
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:14,678
I love my country,
but why do I need to love my team members?

184
00:14:14,702 --> 00:14:17,170
It's just a company
that people go to earn money anyway.

185
00:14:17,194 --> 00:14:19,101
I'm going to go first
because of the last train.

186
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,741
Oh, Seo Jin, wait a minute.

187
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:24,287
Take a taxi with this. We have
money left in our expenses allocation.

188
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:26,991
You were supposed to use this
when you're late for working overtime.

189
00:14:27,655 --> 00:14:28,655
That…

190
00:14:29,538 --> 00:14:32,061
Company dinner is also one of the tasks.

191
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:33,322
Go home safely.

192
00:14:35,414 --> 00:14:36,414
Okay.

193
00:15:14,092 --> 00:15:16,242
You're not going to work
just because the team leader leaves?

194
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:20,320
I'll do that, so get ready to go to work,
Mr. Han Soo.

195
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:22,999
I'll just help you with this, mom.

196
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:26,742
By the way, since the team leader left,

197
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:29,904
will my son be able to work
properly at the company?

198
00:15:29,928 --> 00:15:33,436
The audit office doesn't necessarily work
only with the team leader. We'll be fine.

199
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,194
My son has grown up and goes to work now.

200
00:15:37,218 --> 00:15:38,703
When was it in high school?

201
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:40,376
It feels like it was only
a few days ago when

202
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,805
you went crazy about being the
white hacker or a white cracker.

203
00:15:42,829 --> 00:15:44,414
I'm proud of you, my son.

204
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:54,032
That's right. I was going
to be a white hacker.

205
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:56,478
But back then, I was immature.

206
00:15:56,502 --> 00:16:01,486
I was in my teenage year, so I didn't
listen to you and just made troubles.

207
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,525
Mom!

208
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:04,988
Dad!

209
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:07,173
Who else are you going
to give this money to?

210
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:09,899
It rained yesterday,
so the waste paper was all wet.

211
00:16:09,923 --> 00:16:11,537
If we give Ga Young's
grandmother this 10,000 won,

212
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,839
she doesn't have to live without
worrying about rain for three days.

213
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:16,393
And it's okay for me to live in pain
for 30 years because of you?

214
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:19,620
But we get a pension.
We also got money from Kyung Ryul.

215
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:21,534
When did Kyung Ryul even come?

216
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:23,667
Mom, mom, mom, dad will get hurt.

217
00:16:26,589 --> 00:16:28,737
Hey, you thief! Goo Seok Goo!

218
00:16:49,537 --> 00:16:52,857
JU Construction shares
fell to a new low today,

219
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,794
are you okay?

220
00:16:54,818 --> 00:16:55,896
I have to be okay.

221
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:00,557
You're good at breathing.

222
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:03,065
I was worried a lot
when I heard it fall to 90.

223
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,518
I have to go to the company.

224
00:17:09,534 --> 00:17:11,734
I heard Hwang Dae Woong is
on an overseas business trip.

225
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:16,876
The company isn't working well because
you give a lot of work to people like that.

226
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,556
Don't give him work.

227
00:17:20,388 --> 00:17:23,157
I'm going to kick him out
as soon as he wakes up.

228
00:17:31,327 --> 00:17:33,014
Sir!

229
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,166
We're daily workers, so instead
of industrial accident treatment,

230
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,653
they said they'd give us
a suspension in March.

231
00:17:38,677 --> 00:17:39,816
He's busy.

232
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,191
The executive director said he promised,

233
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:45,559
- Sir!
- Okay, I'll get back to you.

234
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,450
The executive director promised us.

235
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:50,653
What's going on?

236
00:17:51,691 --> 00:17:53,559
Oh, he's a worker of
the Tower Crane incident,

237
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,451
and he said there's not
much compensation given…

238
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,480
I heard that we provided support
for treatment costs.

239
00:17:59,504 --> 00:18:01,729
I'm not sure about the details.

240
00:18:33,682 --> 00:18:35,815
Oh, fuck. Why there's no call coming?

241
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:36,892
That scares me.

242
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,596
Is this broken? Why can't I hear anything?

243
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:44,886
It has been a month since the team leader
left, but why they haven't contact me yet?

244
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,916
Be patient. There will be good news soon.

245
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:52,133
Don't worry, deputy manager.
You'll get there soon.

246
00:18:52,157 --> 00:18:54,946
- That's good.
- So, today's lunch

247
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:56,852
should be paid by the reserve team leader.

248
00:18:57,993 --> 00:18:59,941
There's a revolving sushi restaurant that
just opened,

249
00:18:59,965 --> 00:19:01,173
should I make a reservation now?

250
00:19:01,197 --> 00:19:02,579
No.

251
00:19:02,603 --> 00:19:09,055
- Omakase.
- Omakase.

252
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,215
What do you think? It's okay, right?

253
00:19:10,239 --> 00:19:12,082
I'll just eat separately
in the company cafeteria.

254
00:19:12,106 --> 00:19:13,119
Ah…

255
00:19:13,143 --> 00:19:14,268
Yoon Seo Jin,

256
00:19:15,924 --> 00:19:17,080
I'll give you one more.

257
00:19:17,932 --> 00:19:19,992
Just eat at the cafeteria.
So much for sushi.

258
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:23,080
I'm about to beat all of you. Go away!

259
00:19:23,104 --> 00:19:24,728
Oh, not again…

260
00:19:24,752 --> 00:19:26,361
There are still so many small dishes left…

261
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:28,181
It's only this big,
and bean sprout as the side dish…

262
00:19:28,205 --> 00:19:30,736
Seojin, is the company's
cafeteria really good?

263
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,237
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

264
00:19:32,261 --> 00:19:33,806
There's nothing to eat.

265
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,107
It's all dry and twisted.

266
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:36,877
It's so insincere.

267
00:19:36,901 --> 00:19:39,440
It looks just like how much it costs,
the side dish…

268
00:19:39,464 --> 00:19:43,846
Is this a chick leg or a chicken leg?

269
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,706
The soup is totally a dung soup.

270
00:19:46,409 --> 00:19:48,049
This for 7,000 won?

271
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:49,737
If you don't like it, you can eat out.

272
00:19:51,366 --> 00:19:52,345
What did you say?

273
00:19:52,369 --> 00:19:54,259
Sir, sir!

274
00:19:54,283 --> 00:19:56,455
Well, if you do this,
you won't feel good even if you leave work.

275
00:19:56,479 --> 00:19:59,104
The cafeteria is quite chaotic.

276
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:00,801
The cyber audit department has filed a
report,

277
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,198
so why hasn't it been addressed yet?

278
00:20:02,222 --> 00:20:05,065
Han Soo, shouldn't you the audit office
take the initiative here?

279
00:20:05,089 --> 00:20:07,268
How am I supposed to handle this?

280
00:20:07,292 --> 00:20:11,519
It must have been hard for
the lady to cook, let's just…

281
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,707
The audit office is to be held accountable.

282
00:20:17,746 --> 00:20:20,489
There is no country of origin mark,
no ingredients are disclosure,

283
00:20:20,513 --> 00:20:23,678
poor taste and quantity.
There's a probability of embezzlement.

284
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:27,402
May I ask who you are?

285
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:29,120
I'm here for an interview.

286
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:31,611
I was told that tasting the food
gives you an idea about the company,

287
00:20:31,635 --> 00:20:32,644
so I came to the cafeteria.

288
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:35,891
JU Construction seems
to have lost its taste

289
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:37,460
because the audit staff is incompetent.

290
00:20:37,484 --> 00:20:38,725
Incompetent?

291
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:42,008
Sir, if you come for an interview,
your focus should solely be on that.

292
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,375
What kind of behavior is it?

293
00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:45,227
And if you knew me,
you wouldn't dare mention 'incompetent'.

294
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:47,813
I'm going to be the audit team leader.

295
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:51,032
I've never heard of
incompetence in my life. Is that so?

296
00:20:51,056 --> 00:20:54,091
If you've never heard of it, means
the people around you are also incompetent.

297
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,349
Are you sure you're here for an interview?

298
00:20:56,373 --> 00:20:57,850
I wasn't informed of any of that.

299
00:20:57,874 --> 00:20:58,740
It appears they didn't inform you,

300
00:20:58,764 --> 00:21:00,224
which may speak to their
assessment of your incompetence.

301
00:21:00,248 --> 00:21:01,505
Excuse me.

302
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:03,423
Hang in there, sir.
He's doing that on purpose.

303
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:05,349
He's just picking a fight on purpose.

304
00:21:05,373 --> 00:21:08,021
Hey, there's something you need to know.

305
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:11,158
At JU Construction, we
absolutely do not hire individuals

306
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:13,291
who spout nonsense and lack humanity.

307
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,236
If someone criticizes your work,
you should be thinking about correcting it.

308
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,369
Talking about meaningless humanity?

309
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:21,846
You just don't know how to audit.

310
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:24,533
How do you know
that we're the staff of the audit office?

311
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:31,330
Excuse me, we're asking you here?

312
00:21:31,354 --> 00:21:33,576
Don't be disappointed if you fail the
interview, whichever department you're in.

313
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
It's an interview
for the audit team's team leader.

314
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:38,974
Team leader Moon!

315
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:40,888
He said audit team's team leader.

316
00:21:40,912 --> 00:21:42,435
He's talking nonsense.

317
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:50,965
It's been vacant for a month
and we're interviewing external candidates?

318
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:53,223
What a disgrace!

319
00:21:53,247 --> 00:21:56,653
I know, I think the boss
has a different idea.

320
00:21:57,511 --> 00:21:58,512
Hey, you!

321
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,785
Can't you see me?

322
00:22:03,879 --> 00:22:05,745
I was preoccupied with reviewing documents.

323
00:22:05,769 --> 00:22:06,973
This guy!

324
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,842
You claim to see documents but not me?

325
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:15,850
No, sir.

326
00:22:15,874 --> 00:22:17,954
Send your name and department
to my secretary office.

327
00:22:19,632 --> 00:22:20,922
I'm sorry, executive director.

328
00:22:23,555 --> 00:22:25,406
I'm sad, too.

329
00:22:26,376 --> 00:22:31,827
In the past, I could fire you in one go,
but now it affects personnel evaluation.

330
00:22:39,665 --> 00:22:41,992
No, why did they even held
an interview when they have me

331
00:22:42,016 --> 00:22:44,760
who is not short of attitude, work
performance, and work ability?

332
00:22:44,784 --> 00:22:46,691
No, why? Oh, you guys

333
00:22:46,715 --> 00:22:49,659
never doubted I'd be promoted
to team leader too, right?

334
00:22:49,683 --> 00:22:51,207
This is weird.

335
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,774
There was no external
recruitment information

336
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:54,340
for the audit team leader
as far as I know too.

337
00:22:54,364 --> 00:22:55,695
Then it seems implausible.

338
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,547
It's inconceivable that
news of such significance

339
00:22:57,571 --> 00:22:59,093
would evade Ms. Moon's attentive radar.

340
00:22:59,117 --> 00:23:02,164
I hold a reasonable assumption
that he must have been mistaken.

341
00:23:02,188 --> 00:23:03,641
- That's right.
- Wait!

342
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:05,938
They're having an interview
in the small meeting room.

343
00:23:05,962 --> 00:23:07,402
Interview for the audit team leader.

344
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,469
It got caught on the antenna.

345
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:10,493
But, why?

346
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:12,829
The position might
already be filled internally,

347
00:23:12,853 --> 00:23:14,687
and the ongoing interview could
merely be a procedural gesture.

348
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:16,241
What do you mean?

349
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:19,444
He already knew we're from the audit team.

350
00:23:19,468 --> 00:23:22,530
That's probably because he heard Mr. Kim
talk about the audit office.

351
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:23,827
He looked confident.

352
00:23:23,851 --> 00:23:26,108
Such rudeness can only be exhibited
by his confidence.

353
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:29,733
Are you talking about dereliction of duty
or corrective action? It's all about work.

354
00:23:31,265 --> 00:23:32,550
Goo Han Soo,

355
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:33,564
no, no.

356
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:36,066
- No, you should go to the conference room.
- Me?

357
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:38,768
Go see how things are going.

358
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,323
- Make it a bit faster.
- Yes.

359
00:23:45,096 --> 00:23:46,659
What's your motive of application?

360
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:49,286
I applied because I wanted to catch a rat.

361
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,340
What? In today's world,
there are no rats in a building like this?

362
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:55,286
And even if there's a rat

363
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,598
we'll call a pest control to catch it.

364
00:23:57,622 --> 00:24:00,674
Why did you have an interview…
What are you talking about?

365
00:24:00,698 --> 00:24:06,026
JU Construction has a lot of rats.
I'll change all the company if you want.

366
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:09,088
Don't beat around the bush,
just say it directly.

367
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:14,453
In 2019, 700 million embezzled
for manipulating the balance proof system.

368
00:24:14,477 --> 00:24:17,922
In 2020, 900 million was embezzled
due to fabrication of stamp impression.

369
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:21,297
And in 2021, 1.3 billion was embezzled
due to executive breach of trust.

370
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,172
It was ground up by the rats.

371
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,064
So you can stop it? How?

372
00:24:28,088 --> 00:24:29,908
The manipulation of the
proof-of-balance system

373
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:31,713
can be prevented by
weekly financial audits.

374
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,783
The fabrication of the stamp
impression can be detected in

375
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,853
the early stages through a
detailed audit of the account.

376
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:39,853
Executive breach can be prevented
by activating special audits.

377
00:24:39,877 --> 00:24:42,259
What purpose do such
principled measures serve…

378
00:24:42,283 --> 00:24:45,391
JU Construction currently appears to
lack any substantial principled actions.

379
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:46,501
Oh, my!

380
00:24:49,017 --> 00:24:51,317
You often change jobs,
is there a reason to that?

381
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:55,925
After I catch all these rats,
I will change company.

382
00:24:55,949 --> 00:24:59,833
To a place where rats are swarming,
JU Construction.

383
00:24:59,857 --> 00:25:01,519
This guy!

384
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,123
Sir, do I have to keep listening to this?

385
00:25:04,147 --> 00:25:07,399
JU Construction is a leading
company in Korea's construction

386
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,569
and ranked 12th in the business world.

387
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:14,210
If you want to regain that reputation
and not make your employees unemployed,

388
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:16,194
you need to declare an
emergency audit system.

389
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:21,702
Before it's late.

390
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:28,851
Hello.

391
00:25:29,742 --> 00:25:33,554
I heard that there's an interview
for the audit team's team leader?

392
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:35,718
- Is that right?
- Yes, we're interviewing inside.

393
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,470
Seems like you're not here for an interview

394
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,222
You're here to give
us a lesson, so get out.

395
00:25:58,918 --> 00:26:00,238
What happened?

396
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:02,699
What is it? Hurry, hurry.

397
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:03,777
That person,

398
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:06,769
was kicked out.

399
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:09,386
- It's done, right?
- I won't see him again.

400
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:12,238
See. What did I say?

401
00:26:12,262 --> 00:26:13,269
I was right.

402
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:15,785
Now I'm the team leader.

403
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:17,136
Then, let's do our work.

404
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:23,099
<i>Have a great day.</i>

405
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,177
<i>Word of encouragement for today.</i>

406
00:26:25,201 --> 00:26:28,099
<i>Only I can make my life shine.</i>

407
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:31,582
<i>Only I hold the power
to illuminate my own path in life.</i>

408
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:35,879
Only I can make my life shine.

409
00:26:37,004 --> 00:26:40,293
Only I hold the power
to illuminate my own path in life.

410
00:26:50,613 --> 00:26:51,706
Thank you.

411
00:26:57,739 --> 00:26:59,410
- Hello.
- Hello.

412
00:26:59,434 --> 00:27:01,129
Hello.

413
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,326
Hello?

414
00:27:03,436 --> 00:27:04,928
Hello.

415
00:27:04,952 --> 00:27:06,521
- Hello?
- Hello.

416
00:27:09,389 --> 00:27:11,482
- Hello?
- Hello.

417
00:27:11,506 --> 00:27:12,685
Hello.

418
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:30,569
Excuse me.

419
00:27:30,593 --> 00:27:32,623
You can't come in here.

420
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,639
Only the auditor knows the password…

421
00:27:36,023 --> 00:27:39,315
Why would I be aware of the password
and occupy the team leader's seat?

422
00:27:39,339 --> 00:27:40,362
Goo Han Soo.

423
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:41,666
Because you are the team leader…

424
00:27:43,042 --> 00:27:46,425
How did you know my name…

425
00:27:46,449 --> 00:27:49,403
Joined JU Construction
with chin-up in July 2022.

426
00:27:49,427 --> 00:27:51,644
Was appointed to the audit office through
a friendship with the last team leader.

427
00:27:51,668 --> 00:27:53,737
Has been working for 6
months and told you can transfer

428
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:56,407
to the Florida branch after
working in the audit office for 3 years.

429
00:27:56,431 --> 00:27:58,696
Did you do background check on me?

430
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,036
Let's go in two and a half years!

431
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,645
I won't forget the team leader and senior
who got me into the audit office.

432
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,355
Good morning. Oh?

433
00:28:24,379 --> 00:28:26,721
Seems like everyone is here.

434
00:28:26,745 --> 00:28:30,941
Starting today, he will be working
with us in the audit office.

435
00:28:30,965 --> 00:28:32,129
- Mr. Shin…
- Shin Cha Il.

436
00:28:32,153 --> 00:28:34,410
Mr. Shin Cha Il.

437
00:28:34,434 --> 00:28:38,512
This is the audit team's Deputy Chief
Yeom Kyung Seok, Manager Ok Ga Jang, and…

438
00:28:38,536 --> 00:28:41,402
I know. Mr. Moon Sang Ho, Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.

439
00:28:43,184 --> 00:28:45,755
Well, let's figure it out step by step...

440
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:46,864
Let's get into a meeting.

441
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:54,846
Why are you cutting off
when your superior is talking?

442
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,989
I don't get it, really.

443
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,278
Get in there, Mr. Director!

444
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:07,791
I already introduce
myself at the cafeteria,

445
00:29:07,815 --> 00:29:10,229
so let's discuss about the
audit schedule right away.

446
00:29:10,253 --> 00:29:12,466
On January 16, we will
audit the Tower Crane

447
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:15,014
that was constructed
among the crowd apartments.

448
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:17,794
Why are we auditing that?

449
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:19,924
Yeah, the injured already
got treatment for the injured,

450
00:29:19,948 --> 00:29:21,591
and we've given insurance for Tower Crane.

451
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:23,318
It has been wrapped up.

452
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:25,177
I don't think you know yet,

453
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,857
conducting an audit at this
point incurs a business loss

454
00:29:26,881 --> 00:29:28,264
because the construction
has already resumed.

455
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:30,213
Are you aware of the
cause behind the collapse?

456
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:30,983
The collapse?

457
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:33,826
It was on the news that the wind
blew so hard that it collapsed…

458
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,587
There was a strong wind
warning on January 16th,

459
00:29:35,611 --> 00:29:36,964
but during the time of the accident,

460
00:29:36,988 --> 00:29:38,873
the wind
speed was less than 10 meters per second.

461
00:29:38,897 --> 00:29:41,545
Tower Cranes are not
that weak in wind-proof.

462
00:29:41,569 --> 00:29:43,069
Then why did you say that?

463
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,514
Are you asking me that now?

464
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,931
You're being complacence and incompetent,

465
00:29:52,661 --> 00:29:53,762
being lazy.

466
00:29:56,318 --> 00:29:57,692
Auditors,

467
00:29:59,638 --> 00:30:03,287
hiding the cause of the accident
means there's a fraud.

468
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:05,881
I've never seen a rootless
and unbranched fraud.

469
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,756
I'll find them all and cut them out.

470
00:30:09,069 --> 00:30:10,443
What should I start with?

471
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:13,119
Let's start with an interview
with the field director.

472
00:30:13,143 --> 00:30:15,855
The field director didn't do anything
wrong, why are you interviewing him.

473
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:17,999
Is there any proof
that he's not doing anything wrong?

474
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:21,019
He's not the type to hide
and do anything like that.

475
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:22,300
I'm asking for a proof.

476
00:30:22,324 --> 00:30:23,503
That's because,

477
00:30:26,308 --> 00:30:27,464
I trust the field director.

478
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:29,190
- I don't believe him.
- But…

479
00:30:29,214 --> 00:30:32,503
From now on, we will reorganize
according to our work capabilities.

480
00:30:32,527 --> 00:30:35,191
Prepare all the materials
related to Tower Crane.

481
00:30:36,246 --> 00:30:38,144
How long should I set the period?

482
00:30:38,168 --> 00:30:40,832
From the groundbreaking date of the site
to the date of the accident.

483
00:30:40,856 --> 00:30:42,746
Mr. Goo Han Soo, please follow me.

484
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:43,800
Me?

485
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:50,145
Yoon Seo Jin,

486
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:53,340
You're very motivated, I see.

487
00:31:02,177 --> 00:31:06,825
Well, I missed the timing earlier.

488
00:31:06,849 --> 00:31:12,143
Mr. Bae Young Sik has worked
at our company for more than 20 years.

489
00:31:12,167 --> 00:31:15,012
He has been there since before we change
the CEO,

490
00:31:15,036 --> 00:31:17,166
and he's so good with his work too.

491
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,706
- Goo Han Soo!
- Yes.

492
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,955
You don't suit to work in audit team.

493
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:23,930
Change to different department.

494
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:26,791
- Sorry?
- I'll give you a week.

495
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:27,839
Change your department.

496
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:49,104
No, what did I do wrong? Please tell me.

497
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:50,728
No, you have to tell me so I can…

498
00:32:03,944 --> 00:32:05,515
Where is the field director's seat?

499
00:32:06,515 --> 00:32:07,843
Hello.

500
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,843
But who are you to come all of a sudden?

501
00:32:09,867 --> 00:32:12,507
He's the new team leader.

502
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:13,858
Hello.

503
00:32:13,882 --> 00:32:15,616
It's over there.

504
00:32:25,809 --> 00:32:27,222
Doesn't he have a desktop?

505
00:32:27,246 --> 00:32:29,691
Mr. Bae uses a laptop.

506
00:32:33,346 --> 00:32:34,652
Oh, no.

507
00:32:34,676 --> 00:32:36,550
What are you doing, sir?

508
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:38,418
You can't do that when
the owner is not here.

509
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:50,148
What is it?

510
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:52,890
Why are you searching
through someone else's desk?

511
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:55,141
Please fill out the consent form
and let's start an interview.

512
00:32:55,165 --> 00:32:59,630
I'm so busy with the wall construction,
what is this all about?

513
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,360
Sir!

514
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,610
What's wrong with you all of a sudden, huh?

515
00:33:08,634 --> 00:33:09,962
Please bring me the laptop.

516
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:13,509
Mr. Bae, Mr. Bae!

517
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:20,769
Mr. Bae, where are you going?

518
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:25,644
Mr. Bae!

519
00:33:29,535 --> 00:33:32,145
Mr. Bae, where are you going? Wait for me.

520
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:34,215
Get out of my way! Get out of my way!

521
00:33:34,239 --> 00:33:36,433
Mr. Bae, Mr. Bae!

522
00:33:36,457 --> 00:33:38,753
Mr. Bae, stop for a second.

523
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:43,253
Mr. Bae, please talk to me.

524
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,425
Mr. Bae,

525
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:51,980
Really.

526
00:33:52,004 --> 00:33:53,074
Mr. Bae,

527
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:59,199
why are you running away?

528
00:33:59,223 --> 00:34:02,263
Hey, Han Soo, how
could you do this to me?

529
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:03,292
What?

530
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:06,378
You come in with new team leader
and wants to audit me?

531
00:34:06,402 --> 00:34:07,839
No, it's not that.

532
00:34:07,863 --> 00:34:09,870
Dont get closer.

533
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:12,182
Mr. Bae, it's me Han Soo.

534
00:34:12,206 --> 00:34:13,637
I said, don't come.

535
00:34:13,661 --> 00:34:15,105
Mr. Bae Young Sik!

536
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:22,508
Why did you lie about the cause
of the collapse of Tower Crane?

537
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,447
Why are you asking me that?

538
00:34:31,471 --> 00:34:34,252
I'm asking because you're the person
being responsible for the site.

539
00:34:34,276 --> 00:34:36,400
I just did what I was ordered to.

540
00:34:36,424 --> 00:34:38,209
Who ordered it?

541
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:40,076
The deputy manager
never said he approve it.

542
00:34:48,576 --> 00:34:50,278
Give me the laptop, please.

543
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:51,419
Why would I give it to you?

544
00:34:51,443 --> 00:34:53,966
It's not yours. It's from the company.

545
00:34:54,935 --> 00:34:57,544
Let me talk to him.

546
00:34:57,568 --> 00:34:59,552
It seems like Mr. Bae is misunderstanding…

547
00:35:03,194 --> 00:35:04,232
something…

548
00:35:07,569 --> 00:35:10,374
Han Soo, what's wrong with that guy?

549
00:35:10,398 --> 00:35:13,140
Sir, let me talk to him, please?

550
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,148
Mr. Bae!

551
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:23,447
I think it's because it's rusty. Call 911!

552
00:35:23,471 --> 00:35:24,915
Get someone!

553
00:35:24,939 --> 00:35:27,259
Wait, it's Mr. Bae!

554
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:29,204
Mr. Bae, Mr. Bae!

555
00:35:42,375 --> 00:35:44,535
Even the police can't come like this
without a warrant.

556
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:47,117
What if you hurt someone?

557
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:54,976
Are you okay?

558
00:35:56,585 --> 00:35:59,773
I'll send the laptop to forensics
and conduct an audit on the financials.

559
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:02,766
We are conducting a full re-investigation
of the Tower Crane accident.

560
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,518
Mr. Bae, it needs to be stabilized first.

561
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:07,393
What caused the Tower Crane to collapse?

562
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:10,073
Tell me now. It will reduce
the level of disciplinary action.

563
00:36:10,097 --> 00:36:11,393
Please stop.

564
00:36:12,511 --> 00:36:15,116
Do you really have to ask him that now?

565
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:20,843
I'll bring the staff
members on site to you.

566
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:22,976
- Han Soo.
- Yes?

567
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,914
I prefer a single room.
Give me a single room.

568
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:29,101
Is there any reason
why you shouldn't be with the field staff?

569
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,161
- Answer me.
- Han Soo, this man is killing me.

570
00:36:40,185 --> 00:36:41,712
Give me a single room quickly.

571
00:36:41,736 --> 00:36:42,837
Please help me.

572
00:36:49,694 --> 00:36:52,997
Mr. Bae is here? Is he hurt?

573
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:54,646
It's not a big injury.

574
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:57,107
Why is the Mr. Bae
avoiding the field staff?

575
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,435
Probably because he's sorry.

576
00:36:59,459 --> 00:37:03,361
JU Construction promised us a full-time
position, but he couldn't keep it.

577
00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:06,625
Did Mr. Bae ask for money and valuables
under the pretext of a full-time employee?

578
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,044
Oh my, he's the one who pays for the taxi

579
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:13,901
when you go to a company
dinner, what more could you ask for.

580
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:17,534
He's also the one who saved Mr. Choi
during the Tower Crane accident.

581
00:37:17,558 --> 00:37:19,073
Who's the driver of Tower Crane?

582
00:37:19,097 --> 00:37:21,159
He was discharged from the hospital.
He was given a single room.

583
00:37:21,183 --> 00:37:22,284
He's already discharged?

584
00:37:22,308 --> 00:37:26,394
Mr. Bae handled it well,
so he only broke one leg.

585
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:29,011
I think you misunderstood something.

586
00:37:29,035 --> 00:37:33,809
Mr. Bae even asked the executive director
to let make us a full-time employee.

587
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:35,497
Although it didn't go well…

588
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:37,958
Mr. Bae really is a nice guy.

589
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:44,841
Han Soo, I'm really sorry earlier.

590
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:48,411
I got scared since you say
I'm going to be audited.

591
00:37:49,122 --> 00:37:51,014
What happened to my laptop?

592
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:53,552
The team leader took
all the smashed pieces.

593
00:37:54,674 --> 00:37:57,603
What's going on? Tell me.

594
00:38:00,163 --> 00:38:03,455
Is there really a separate cause
for Tower Crane's collapse?

595
00:38:03,479 --> 00:38:05,951
No, that's not it.

596
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:12,787
If it's a natural disaster, we can
shorten the resumption of construction.

597
00:38:12,811 --> 00:38:14,772
This is all discussed with the higher ups.

598
00:38:14,796 --> 00:38:16,756
Do you think I decide
all of that by myself?

599
00:38:17,982 --> 00:38:19,240
Oh, it hurts.

600
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,576
- Han Soo.
- Yes?

601
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,028
Don't let anyone visit me.

602
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:24,489
Yes, sure.

603
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,640
Why did you do that?

604
00:38:34,664 --> 00:38:36,375
A person got hurt.

605
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,468
Is an audit more important than people?
It can't be more of a priority.

606
00:38:38,492 --> 00:38:40,749
This is the result of complacent audit
from the beginning.

607
00:38:40,773 --> 00:38:44,742
He wanted to shorten the resumption
of Tower Crane construction.

608
00:38:44,766 --> 00:38:46,070
He said he was ordered to do so.

609
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:48,398
- I'll do the interview.
- Let Mr. Bae rest.

610
00:38:51,937 --> 00:38:54,304
Did you get a bribe from Mr. Bae?

611
00:38:54,328 --> 00:38:55,328
What?

612
00:38:57,122 --> 00:38:58,522
What are you talking about…

613
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,794
It's Shin Cha Il.

614
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:07,774
Yes, okay.

615
00:39:24,664 --> 00:39:26,171
Here is your coffee.

616
00:39:27,086 --> 00:39:28,710
When you're having a hard time…

617
00:39:29,641 --> 00:39:32,749
Do you agree if I say
that my worklife is going to be twisted?

618
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,383
- Of course.
- Thank you.

619
00:39:35,375 --> 00:39:36,437
Have a drink.

620
00:39:36,461 --> 00:39:40,169
How can you put an outsider
on the audit team? Huh?

621
00:39:48,802 --> 00:39:49,935
What happened?

622
00:39:49,959 --> 00:39:51,599
You don't look good.

623
00:40:01,523 --> 00:40:04,343
What do you know about digging up work?

624
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:06,257
There's an audit because there's a fraud.

625
00:40:07,467 --> 00:40:11,633
Fraud? The information provided
is supervised by the vice president.

626
00:40:11,657 --> 00:40:13,081
It's the vice president's decision

627
00:40:13,105 --> 00:40:15,079
to publish an article
about a natural disaster.

628
00:40:15,103 --> 00:40:17,178
It's not your job to mess
with the spokesman.

629
00:40:17,202 --> 00:40:19,598
I'll tell the vice president
when I meet him,

630
00:40:19,622 --> 00:40:20,973
that the decision was wrong.

631
00:40:20,997 --> 00:40:22,255
This guy.

632
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:25,411
Don't poke around and stop it now,

633
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:28,020
and bring me Mr. Bae's laptop.

634
00:40:31,542 --> 00:40:35,432
How did you know I had the laptop?

635
00:40:36,186 --> 00:40:37,740
Did Mr. Bae told you?

636
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:39,656
What if he does?

637
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,000
Then it became a connection
between the executive director and Mr. Bae.

638
00:40:42,024 --> 00:40:43,859
What? This fucker.

639
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:48,609
Do you know who I am?

640
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:52,912
I've been working with JU Construction
since the chairman's time.

641
00:40:52,936 --> 00:40:55,511
Did you promise Mr. Bae Young Sik that you

642
00:40:55,535 --> 00:40:58,357
would hire the workers
as full-time employees?

643
00:40:59,139 --> 00:41:00,701
Was there a price?

644
00:41:01,521 --> 00:41:04,169
Wow, this is driving me crazy.

645
00:41:04,193 --> 00:41:06,240
You look very funny at me.

646
00:41:06,264 --> 00:41:08,060
Just bring me the laptop.

647
00:41:09,493 --> 00:41:12,016
Yes, I'll bring it to you…

648
00:41:13,297 --> 00:41:17,320
after I asked the forensics
to find out what's in it.

649
00:41:22,202 --> 00:41:23,616
No, that punk!

650
00:41:28,981 --> 00:41:34,161
Mr. Bae's 7th and 8th ribs were broken
and his shin was cracked.

651
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:37,716
Do you know what he says to me
for committing such ruthless violence?

652
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,638
"Change to other departments".
He said I didn't suit being an auditor.

653
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:41,989
Does this make sense? Really?

654
00:41:42,013 --> 00:41:45,510
It's worse than I expected.
Oh, my head hurts.

655
00:41:45,534 --> 00:41:47,229
Where are the headache pills?

656
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:50,252
This is a misjudgment.

657
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:53,974
I think we need to find out
why Mr. Bae ran away.

658
00:41:53,998 --> 00:41:56,721
He said he was scared
when Mr. Shin suddenly came to audit him.

659
00:41:56,745 --> 00:42:00,042
Of course he was scared.
Because he might be blamed for it.

660
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:03,152
He fell from the 3rd floor
because of the team leader.

661
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:04,917
It's the third floor. That height…

662
00:42:05,927 --> 00:42:07,458
Director Seo Gil Pyo came up to me.

663
00:42:07,482 --> 00:42:10,669
Please upload all the due date, items,
and payment documents.

664
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:14,498
What about the executive director?

665
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:30,655
How can someone who doesn't even know
how to audit be the audit team leader?

666
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,834
What do you think?

667
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:33,826
I've never had a hard day like today.

668
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,967
I think today is the hardest day
since I joined the company.

669
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:37,926
Look. My eyes are
going to pop out, right?

670
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,983
What should I do?

671
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:41,522
You don't know? It was always like that.

672
00:42:41,546 --> 00:42:44,878
- How about a cold beer?
- That's nice.

673
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:46,112
No, listen to me.

674
00:42:46,136 --> 00:42:48,706
- I told you, the team leader is weird.
- Good job, everyone.

675
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,956
Ah, these punks.

676
00:42:53,450 --> 00:42:56,542
Hey, don't worry. I'll take care of
everything. Yeah, I'll take care of it.

677
00:42:56,566 --> 00:42:58,453
- I'll get going.
- Goodbye.

678
00:42:58,477 --> 00:43:00,059
Seo Jin, how will you go home?

679
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,503
I'll take the bus.

680
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:02,596
Let's go together.

681
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,057
But I really don't understand.

682
00:43:07,081 --> 00:43:10,557
How can you appoint someone like that
as the team leader of the audit office?

683
00:43:10,581 --> 00:43:11,732
He's a total gangster.

684
00:43:12,598 --> 00:43:15,899
The problem started when Mr. Bae fled.

685
00:43:15,923 --> 00:43:18,884
I told you, He got scared
when he heard about auditing.

686
00:43:18,908 --> 00:43:21,268
If there's nothing to hide,
there's nothing to be afraid of.

687
00:43:22,451 --> 00:43:24,833
Do you doubt Mr. Bae, Yoon Seo Jin?

688
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:29,055
Then, do you believe Mr. Bae?

689
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:31,024
- Of course.
- Without any proof?

690
00:43:33,172 --> 00:43:37,266
I think the team leader was right.
You don't fit the audit department.

691
00:43:46,996 --> 00:43:50,089
What? Look at the executive
director's work history?

692
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:53,840
I really want him
to be just a complete cornerstone.

693
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,762
Does he really wanna die?

694
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:57,778
He was so anxious to die.

695
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:02,095
But why did the president hire an outsider
as a team leader?

696
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:03,228
Why do you think so?

697
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:05,593
It's because all the insiders
are vice president's people.

698
00:44:05,617 --> 00:44:08,921
That's why he brings such a nuthead
like Shin Cha Il inside.

699
00:44:08,945 --> 00:44:11,445
He wants to hold the
audit office in his hands.

700
00:44:12,437 --> 00:44:15,938
How's the atmosphere at work these days?
Isn't it a mess?

701
00:44:15,962 --> 00:44:18,181
We have to kick Shin Cha Il out.

702
00:44:18,205 --> 00:44:21,627
Then, vice president Yeom
will naturally get a chance.

703
00:44:21,651 --> 00:44:26,167
Sir, who am I? It's been four years
since I've worked in the audit office.

704
00:44:26,191 --> 00:44:29,400
Once you set a target,
it's not that hard to win them.

705
00:44:29,424 --> 00:44:32,496
I don't need a long word, I need a summary.

706
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,785
Shin Cha Il has Mr. Bae's laptop.

707
00:44:34,809 --> 00:44:36,386
Retrieve it right away.

708
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:39,316
Laptop? I'll bring it directly to you.

709
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,278
Don't just talk big.

710
00:44:42,654 --> 00:44:43,885
Please believe me.

711
00:44:44,988 --> 00:44:46,292
Just wait and see.

712
00:44:49,547 --> 00:44:50,971
I'm home.

713
00:44:50,995 --> 00:44:53,483
Han Soo, have a beer with Kyung Ryeol.

714
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:56,976
Oh, it has been a long time
since I last saw you.

715
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,355
Hello, sir.

716
00:44:58,379 --> 00:45:01,395
Mr. Ahn, why are you eating so slow?

717
00:45:01,419 --> 00:45:04,480
He's serving as a colonel, our Mr. Goo.

718
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,036
Since we're gathered like this,

719
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:08,786
it reminds me of when we
worked together in the office.

720
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:12,668
That time when they
were dating in the company.

721
00:45:13,716 --> 00:45:16,511
By the way, didn't you go to Vietnam?

722
00:45:16,535 --> 00:45:18,699
That's your mom's story.

723
00:45:18,723 --> 00:45:20,915
He went around looking for investors.

724
00:45:20,939 --> 00:45:23,556
Fortunately, the factory is going well now.

725
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:27,118
She don't even know that
and keep saying to kill him…

726
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:29,025
Just eat this.

727
00:45:29,049 --> 00:45:32,484
I deserved to be killed.
I suddenly showed up after two years.

728
00:45:32,508 --> 00:45:34,507
Hey, if you hadn't lent me 30 million won,

729
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:37,249
I wouldn't have been able to
go around meeting investors.

730
00:45:37,273 --> 00:45:38,964
Thank you very much.

731
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:40,675
Thank you, sir.

732
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:44,389
Do your business well.
I really didn't expect your return.

733
00:45:44,413 --> 00:45:46,686
He can't be trusted.

734
00:45:47,483 --> 00:45:51,600
Dad? Did you know he'd come back?

735
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,348
Of course, because I
believe in Kyung Ryeol.

736
00:45:54,372 --> 00:45:55,394
What's the proof?

737
00:45:55,418 --> 00:45:57,988
The depth of faith is up to me.

738
00:45:58,012 --> 00:46:00,262
That's why I'm the proof.

739
00:46:00,286 --> 00:46:02,965
Oh, that's cool.

740
00:46:02,989 --> 00:46:04,572
That's what my manager said.

741
00:46:22,176 --> 00:46:25,079
You should've be careful. Oh, my.

742
00:46:27,462 --> 00:46:30,855
Take this.
So you won't step on it like last time.

743
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:32,663
Your shoes are broken. Wear these.

744
00:46:32,687 --> 00:46:34,316
Mr. Bae! Thank you.

745
00:46:38,343 --> 00:46:42,366
Yes, the depth of faith is up to me.

746
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,682
I'm the proof. I'll prove it.

747
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:02,999
Do you know the reason for the collapse?

748
00:47:03,023 --> 00:47:04,917
The wind blew so hard that it collapsed…

749
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:07,718
During the time of the accident, the wind
speed was less than 10 meters per second.

750
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,971
Why did you lie about the cause
of Tower Crane collapse?

751
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:12,322
I just did what I was ordered.

752
00:47:12,346 --> 00:47:13,682
Who ordered you?

753
00:47:14,695 --> 00:47:18,069
Don't get involved and stop it now.
I'm JU Construction History.

754
00:47:41,988 --> 00:47:45,301
I've never seen a person like that before.

755
00:47:45,325 --> 00:47:48,613
If the corporate hierarchy collapses,
aren't they all going to fall apart?

756
00:47:48,637 --> 00:47:50,612
Is there a place
where it's going to fall apart?

757
00:47:50,636 --> 00:47:52,608
It's been five years since my
father died and turned bankrupt.

758
00:47:52,632 --> 00:47:54,117
I don't even know where
the floor is anymore.

759
00:47:54,141 --> 00:47:56,263
I'm completely disoriented.
I can't even tell where the ground is.

760
00:47:56,287 --> 00:47:57,771
You're going to get back on your feet.

761
00:47:57,795 --> 00:48:02,176
Yes, that's why I hired someone like
Shin Cha Il as the audit team leader.

762
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,528
I need a change.

763
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:06,708
Then you can just hire him.
Why did you have an interview?

764
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:08,481
Are you warning me?

765
00:48:08,505 --> 00:48:10,473
To endure his insults, calling me a rat?

766
00:48:13,247 --> 00:48:17,227
There will be a problem
when the vice president gets back.

767
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:25,088
I'm the president, executive director Seo.

768
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:32,666
I'll leave now.

769
00:48:44,047 --> 00:48:47,754
It's nothing difficult. Just tell me
what you're doing like yesterday.

770
00:48:47,778 --> 00:48:51,430
You know you'll be kicked out of the audit
office if the team leader said so, right?

771
00:48:51,454 --> 00:48:53,735
It's not just you,
even Mr. Bae is going to be kicked out.

772
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:58,309
What should I do?

773
00:48:58,333 --> 00:48:59,653
This is a war.

774
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:03,866
Oh, what about the team leader?

775
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,070
It seemed like you were going to be
a subcontractor of Tower Crane.

776
00:49:06,094 --> 00:49:08,163
Oh really? Good job.

777
00:49:08,187 --> 00:49:09,187
Yes?

778
00:49:14,563 --> 00:49:15,897
This is a war.

779
00:49:15,921 --> 00:49:18,928
Get Mr. Bae's laptop if you want to end it
with just one nuclear bomb.

780
00:49:18,952 --> 00:49:20,225
If you bring the laptop,

781
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:21,787
- You'll be transferred to Florida.
- Transferred.

782
00:49:21,811 --> 00:49:23,468
- Mr. Bae can return to his position.
- Return.

783
00:49:23,492 --> 00:49:25,727
- Team leader, out.
- Out.

784
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:26,741
- Got it?
- Yes.

785
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:28,297
- You can do it, right?
- Yes.

786
00:49:28,321 --> 00:49:29,329
Good.

787
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,784
You're going to the Myeong Tower right?
Let's go together.

788
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:42,132
You don't know the owner
of the Myeong Tower well.

789
00:49:42,156 --> 00:49:44,745
I know him well because I've
received work support in the past.

790
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:47,683
I'll introduce you to the team leader.

791
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:55,267
Yes, I restored it to it's original state
like before it was smashed…

792
00:49:55,291 --> 00:49:56,642
and I removed the password.

793
00:50:53,435 --> 00:50:54,705
No way!

794
00:51:24,935 --> 00:51:25,935
Sir…

795
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:29,505
Do you have Tower Crane info
on the laptop?

796
00:51:31,475 --> 00:51:32,715
You don't need to know.

797
00:51:35,865 --> 00:51:38,295
You stated that I am not the right match
for this position.

798
00:51:39,985 --> 00:51:41,725
Could you explain why?

799
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:47,885
You trust people, don't you?

800
00:51:49,345 --> 00:51:51,081
Is that a problem?

801
00:51:51,105 --> 00:51:54,801
JU Construction can't be handled
with just document checks.

802
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:58,461
Numerous holes are already present.
Holes gnawed by rats.

803
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:02,261
We need to question people
so as to catch those rats.

804
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:06,375
You can't pull that off with blind trust
based solely on familiarity.

805
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:11,345
So I don't need you.

806
00:52:15,105 --> 00:52:16,315
Then…

807
00:52:18,475 --> 00:52:20,515
Do you suspect everyone?

808
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:24,105
Well… then

809
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:26,885
you must be terribly lonely.

810
00:53:09,505 --> 00:53:14,191
Trolleys jib is from Germany,
hoisting mechanism is from Taiwan.

811
00:53:14,215 --> 00:53:14,831
And no manufacturer for the counterweight.

812
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:16,291
Each component boasts
a distinct year of manufacture.

813
00:53:16,315 --> 00:53:19,515
This type of Tower Crane is called
Frankenstein Tower.

814
00:53:21,765 --> 00:53:24,661
You're talking about such a gruesome name!

815
00:53:24,685 --> 00:53:28,781
You rented out makeshift products
as if they're finished goods.

816
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,461
How much did you give to Seo Gil Pyo?

817
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:35,275
Come on! Stop talking nonsense!

818
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:47,281
There are two options.

819
00:53:47,305 --> 00:53:49,141
First, admit to false delivery and testify.

820
00:53:49,165 --> 00:53:51,721
Second, deny embezzlement
and face criminal prosecution.

821
00:53:51,745 --> 00:53:54,785
If you choose the second one,
Myung Tower will have to shut down.

822
00:53:57,695 --> 00:54:02,191
Can you step out for a moment?
I need to talk to him personally.

823
00:54:02,215 --> 00:54:03,215
Please wait outside.

824
00:54:43,425 --> 00:54:47,421
Take it easy, just tell me
what they're up to like yesterday.

825
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:51,361
It's up to him whether you get kicked
out of the audit department.

826
00:54:51,385 --> 00:54:53,665
It's not just you. Mr. Bae, either.

827
00:55:41,595 --> 00:55:43,355
Please let it slide.

828
00:55:44,915 --> 00:55:47,481
Please, I beg you, only this time.

829
00:55:47,505 --> 00:55:50,411
If this gets exposed,
we're to be closed down.

830
00:55:50,435 --> 00:55:53,611
I'll make sure to issue
genuine certificates…

831
00:55:53,635 --> 00:55:55,291
Only two options.

832
00:55:55,315 --> 00:55:57,015
I'll wait for your answer.

833
00:56:49,395 --> 00:56:51,251
He has been discharged.

834
00:56:51,275 --> 00:56:55,445
Thanks to Mr. Bae, he only broke one leg.

835
00:57:05,845 --> 00:57:08,515
Sir, Mr. Shin Cha Il has visited here.

836
00:57:37,235 --> 00:57:39,251
Aren't we returning to the office, huh?

837
00:57:39,275 --> 00:57:40,281
Going to the hospital.

838
00:57:40,305 --> 00:57:41,335
Hospital?

839
00:57:42,415 --> 00:57:44,085
You're a declining visitor.

840
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,275
Ugh!

841
00:58:17,585 --> 00:58:18,925
Get out!

842
00:58:19,975 --> 00:58:20,995
Get out!

843
00:58:23,955 --> 00:58:25,365
I said get out!

844
00:58:28,285 --> 00:58:29,555
Hey! Get out!

845
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:37,111
Get out! Out of the car!

846
00:58:37,135 --> 00:58:38,395
What the…

847
00:58:47,675 --> 00:58:49,165
Catch him!

848
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:39,231
Father!

849
00:59:39,255 --> 00:59:40,745
Please help!

850
00:59:42,385 --> 00:59:43,705
Father!

851
00:59:46,465 --> 00:59:47,565
Father!

852
00:59:50,245 --> 00:59:52,475
Sir, sir!

853
00:59:55,105 --> 00:59:56,165
Sir!

854
01:00:02,215 --> 01:00:03,395
Mr. Shin!

855
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:15,145
Are you ok?

856
01:00:24,525 --> 01:00:25,945
Where is the laptop?

857
01:00:26,975 --> 01:00:28,651
Looks like they took it.

858
01:00:28,675 --> 01:00:30,325
Even the black box is not here.

859
01:00:32,655 --> 01:00:33,795
Please stop the car.

860
01:00:34,835 --> 01:00:36,091
You need to go to the hospital.

861
01:00:36,115 --> 01:00:38,845
You really should get
checked for a concussion.

862
01:00:39,995 --> 01:00:41,265
Stop the car.

863
01:00:49,415 --> 01:00:50,415
Let's go.

864
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:39,181
Hello.

865
01:01:39,205 --> 01:01:42,485
Sir, I got word
that Mr.Bae disappeared from the hospital.

866
01:02:05,605 --> 01:02:07,485
It's obvious now.

867
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:12,675
Speak of the devil, and he really appears.

868
01:02:15,495 --> 01:02:17,161
Give me the laptop.

869
01:02:17,185 --> 01:02:18,581
What the hell are you talking about?

870
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:20,721
In your time, violence may have worked.

871
01:02:20,745 --> 01:02:23,101
But now, there are many eyes
watching and rational laws,

872
01:02:23,125 --> 01:02:25,641
so you could be criminally punished.

873
01:02:25,665 --> 01:02:27,111
- Hey!
- Mr. Shin.

874
01:02:27,135 --> 01:02:30,801
Even if it's a disciplinary decision,
that's inevitable, it's pointless.

875
01:02:30,825 --> 01:02:33,091
There's such a thing as
aggravated punishment.

876
01:02:33,115 --> 01:02:34,781
Mr. Shin, too rude!

877
01:02:34,805 --> 01:02:36,061
Just leave him.

878
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,725
Let's wait and see.

879
01:02:38,905 --> 01:02:41,611
You were the final decision-maker
for purchasing the Tower Crane.

880
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:45,911
You purchased it with an unclear
manufacturing year at full price.

881
01:02:45,935 --> 01:02:49,471
The difference was recovered by you,
from Myung Tower.

882
01:02:49,495 --> 01:02:53,191
That weak Tower Crane
finally injured someone,

883
01:02:53,215 --> 01:02:58,755
and you claimed the cause of the case
was the wind to cover up the…

884
01:02:59,595 --> 01:03:00,725
That's fun.

885
01:03:01,985 --> 01:03:04,275
You're a good comedian.

886
01:03:05,225 --> 01:03:06,381
Can you prove it?

887
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:07,755
Please give me the laptop.

888
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:13,891
You dare to talk about something
you can't prove.

889
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,481
I'll bring you up at the board of directors
for defamation of character.

890
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:19,451
You will be the
shortest-lived audit leader.

891
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:22,221
I've ever had.

892
01:03:22,245 --> 01:03:26,605
Someone is hiding the injury of
the Tower Crane operator.

893
01:03:28,335 --> 01:03:32,965
I think it's Mr. Bae.
What do you think, sir?

894
01:03:49,455 --> 01:03:51,511
The vice president is over there.

895
01:03:51,535 --> 01:03:52,965
You are doomed.

896
01:03:54,365 --> 01:03:55,455
You'd better be careful.

897
01:04:20,835 --> 01:04:23,275
Oh, hey.

898
01:04:26,215 --> 01:04:28,065
Good to see you.

899
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,181
Are you alright?

900
01:04:30,205 --> 01:04:32,221
Yeah.

901
01:04:32,245 --> 01:04:33,725
This is Director Yang.

902
01:04:38,325 --> 01:04:40,411
Mr. Shin, say hello to him.

903
01:04:40,435 --> 01:04:43,101
Hurry and come!

904
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,111
Who is he?

905
01:04:44,135 --> 01:04:46,675
He's the new audit team leader.

906
01:04:47,705 --> 01:04:48,905
The audit team leader?

907
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,495
What's with that jerk's stare?
