Hey! Wake up!

Shin Cha Il!

00:00:49,726 --> 00:00:51,067
Hey!

00:00:56,036 --> 00:00:57,105

Hey, Director Chae. Director Chae!

12
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:19,257
Director Chae, wake up!

13
00:01:24,866 --> 00:01:26,336
Are you all right?

Shin Cha Il,

17
00:02:07,965 --> 00:02:09,364
are you okay?

18
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,165
What about you, Mr. Hwang? Are you okay?

19
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,374
I'm not okay, punk.

20
00:02:26,544 --> 00:02:27,821
Hang in there.

21
00:02:27,845 --> 00:02:29,214
They're almost here.

22
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:33,415
You're so spiteful.

23
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:37,693
(Paramedic)

24
00:02:37,694 --> 00:02:39,424
This patient breathed in a lot of smoke.

25
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,563
Connect him to an oxygen mask and prepare some Arformoterol.

26
00:02:41,564 --> 00:02:42,871
- Okay. - Okay.

27
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,233
Emergency patient coming through!

(Hanjoo University Hospital)

29
00:02:51,974 --> 00:02:53,374
You should get treated too.

30
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:55,304
Excuse me, can someone take a look at him?

31
00:02:55,574 --> 00:02:56,975
Please follow me.

(Emergency Medical Center)

33
00:03:21,865 --> 00:03:23,235
Uncle.

34
00:03:24,175 --> 00:03:25,534
What about Mr. Shin?

35
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:27,844
He's being treated.

36
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,705
What about you? Are you okay?

37
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,543
I'm fine.

38
00:03:32,544 --> 00:03:35,385
But what happened?

39
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:42,883
- A slush fund? - Yes. Shin Cha Il is like a rat.

40
00:03:42,884 --> 00:03:45,770
He's been going around poking his nose in everything.

41
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:48,024
He also came to me to ask me questions.

42
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:50,725
But it's not true, is it?

43
00:03:50,764 --> 00:03:53,135
So that was the money...

44
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,205
Director Chae was talking about.

45
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,945
I realized why Director Chae had approached me before.

46
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,975
It was a trap set by Hwang Se Woong.

47
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:07,915
That was why I went straight to the funeral home.

48
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:38,344
Darn it.

49
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:26,724
That was what happened.

50
00:05:30,724 --> 00:05:31,970
You can't leave.

51
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:33,565
You need rest.

52
00:05:33,664 --> 00:05:35,280
How is the patient who came in with us?

53
00:05:35,304 --> 00:05:38,210
It doesn't look very good. He's still unconscious.

54
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:40,075
You shouldn't be moving around either.

55
00:05:40,934 --> 00:05:42,305
Are you okay?

56
00:05:44,275 --> 00:05:45,275
I'm okay.

57
00:05:45,276 --> 00:05:47,014
No, he's not okay.

58
00:05:47,015 --> 00:05:48,243
Please help me stop him.

59
00:05:48,244 --> 00:05:50,084
He shouldn't be moving so much.

60
00:05:50,145 --> 00:05:52,660
Doctor, no one in the world can stop this stubborn man.

61
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,084
Don't worry.

62
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:56,455
I won't hold the hospital responsible.

63
00:06:04,895 --> 00:06:06,510
We must stop the cremation.

64
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,765
Otherwise, the evidence of the homicide will disappear.

65
00:07:08,765 --> 00:07:10,325
Mr. Shin, over there.

66
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,334
Stop them.

67
00:07:27,984 --> 00:07:29,460
Who are you people?

68
00:07:29,484 --> 00:07:30,945
Hurry up and move your car!

69
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:38,294
Mr. Shin, what's the matter?

70
00:07:45,734 --> 00:07:47,365
It must be stopped.

71
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,041
What?

72
00:07:49,065 --> 00:07:51,164
We must leave for the cremation.

73
00:07:51,205 --> 00:07:52,534
We're late.

74
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,234
The body must get an autopsy.

75
00:07:55,104 --> 00:07:57,305
Mr. Hwang Gun Woong was killed.

76
00:07:58,075 --> 00:08:00,645
Mr. Shin, what kind of behavior is this?

77
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,315
What...

78
00:08:07,825 --> 00:08:09,555
What do you mean?

79
00:08:09,755 --> 00:08:12,024
Who are you saying killed my husband?

80
00:08:13,095 --> 00:08:14,324
Are you out of your mind?

81
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:16,565
Hold on. Answer me.

82
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,234
Who killed my husband?

83
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,855
Vice President Hwang Dae Woong.

84
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:05,414
After Vice President Hwang visited the hospital,

85
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:07,875
President Hwang Gun Woong passed away.

86
00:09:12,555 --> 00:09:14,314
What's the plan?

87
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,225
An autopsy is needed...

88
00:09:16,685 --> 00:09:18,454
to resolve the suspicion.

89
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:24,564
Do it.

90
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:25,965
- Yu Seon? - No.

91
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:29,335
Do it now.

92
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:42,090
But how do we stop the cremation?

93
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:45,191
We'll tell them Hwang Se Woong is suspicious.

94
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:46,654
They won't believe it.

95
00:09:47,315 --> 00:09:49,000
There's no concrete evidence.

96
00:09:49,024 --> 00:09:50,385
Then what do we do?

97
00:09:54,024 --> 00:09:57,725
I will accuse you as a murder suspect.

98
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:00,964
A suspect? What do you mean by that?

99
00:10:00,965 --> 00:10:02,363
It's simply a bait.

100
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:03,811
Even so, that's a bit...

101
00:10:03,835 --> 00:10:05,204
No.

102
00:10:05,874 --> 00:10:07,235
Let's do that.

103
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:10,444
Yu Seon will react to it right away with it.

104
00:10:10,874 --> 00:10:12,245
In return,

105
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:14,985
you must catch Hwang Se Woong for sure.

106
00:10:33,935 --> 00:10:35,235
Sir.

107
00:10:45,874 --> 00:10:48,145
I'm the one being treated as a murderer.

108
00:10:49,144 --> 00:10:51,414
But why do you look worse than me?

109
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,765
Are you all right, Mr. Shin?

110
00:11:09,864 --> 00:11:12,235
- Head to the hospital at once. - Understood.

111
00:11:30,024 --> 00:11:31,324
Thank you.

112
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:35,324
Don't get up.

113
00:11:35,325 --> 00:11:37,164
You still need to be treated.

114
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:40,835
What about the autopsy?

115
00:11:40,864 --> 00:11:42,080
It has started.

116
00:11:42,104 --> 00:11:45,135
As it's a high-profile case, it'll be conducted with urgency.

117
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,434
And Mr. Chae?

118
00:11:47,435 --> 00:11:49,304
He's still unconscious.

119
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,605
But President Hwang...

120
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,885
moved him to Naseon General Hospital's VIP room.

121
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,360
Get some more rest.

122
00:12:00,384 --> 00:12:01,954
We're out of time.

123
00:12:02,654 --> 00:12:03,753
I must see him.

124
00:12:03,754 --> 00:12:05,094
Only family members can visit him.

125
00:12:05,095 --> 00:12:06,153
You can't meet him right now.

126
00:12:06,154 --> 00:12:08,141
I must meet his family at the least.

127
00:12:08,165 --> 00:12:09,524
Mr. Shin.

128
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:11,911
What is wrong with you?

129
00:12:11,935 --> 00:12:15,204
Why are you risking your life in audits?

130
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:17,564
One's life...

131
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,204
depends on the audit.

132
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,784
Mr. Gu, come with me.

133
00:12:28,984 --> 00:12:30,345
Ms. Yoon.

134
00:12:30,744 --> 00:12:32,755
Investigate the fire site.

135
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:53,704
Everything burned down.

136
00:12:54,234 --> 00:12:56,273
Nothing can be used as evidence.

137
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:58,544
I don't see any CCTVs around, either.

138
00:13:13,624 --> 00:13:14,924
Mr. Shin.

139
00:13:15,825 --> 00:13:17,424
I want to know, too.

140
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:21,804
Why do you go that far and risk your life in audits?

141
00:13:45,595 --> 00:13:46,895
Excuse me.

142
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,141
Hi.

143
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,811
I'm Gu Han Soo from the JU Construction Audit Team.

144
00:13:52,835 --> 00:13:55,365
Oh, I see. Hi.

145
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:58,273
What brought you here?

146
00:13:58,274 --> 00:14:00,335
How's Mr. Chae doing?

147
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:03,845
He breathed in a lot of smoke. We need to wait and see.

148
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:07,215
But he's getting better.

149
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,891
That's a relief.

150
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,985
May we see him for a moment?

151
00:14:19,624 --> 00:14:21,154
You can't go in.

152
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,600
We're from the JU Construction Audit Team.

153
00:14:24,624 --> 00:14:27,763
We'll leave as soon as we see Mr. Chae's condition.

154
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:30,064
Only family members can visit him.

155
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:41,645
Murder?

156
00:14:42,415 --> 00:14:44,983
What on earth is going on?

157
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:46,454
Vice President Hwang.

158
00:14:46,915 --> 00:14:48,954
Aren't you innocent?

159
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:50,424
Mr. Yang.

160
00:14:51,254 --> 00:14:52,595
Do you trust me?

161
00:14:54,124 --> 00:14:56,965
What? Me?

162
00:14:57,494 --> 00:15:01,164
Of course, I trust you.

163
00:15:09,144 --> 00:15:11,845
Mr. Yang. Can you give us some privacy?

164
00:15:12,675 --> 00:15:13,975
Sure.

165
00:15:25,295 --> 00:15:26,595
Seo Jin.

166
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:29,024
Get off the case.

167
00:15:29,965 --> 00:15:31,395
"Get off the case?"

168
00:15:31,935 --> 00:15:33,511
Why all of a sudden?

169
00:15:33,535 --> 00:15:35,965
I can't help but get worried.

170
00:15:36,465 --> 00:15:39,534
Look at Shin Cha Il and Director Chae.

171
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,875
If even you get hurt...

172
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,151
I can't let that happen.

173
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:46,645
Get off the case for your mom's sake.

174
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,444
Should I transfer you to a different department?

175
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:53,585
I'll resign.

176
00:15:55,984 --> 00:15:56,984
All right.

177
00:15:56,985 --> 00:15:59,454
But only after I see the end of this case.

178
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:02,595
Seo Jin...

179
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:08,903
- What is it? - Mr. Hwang Dae Woong.

180
00:16:08,904 --> 00:16:10,034
You're arrested without a warrant...

181
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,434
on suspicion of murdering Hwang Gun Woong.

182
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:13,804
You have the right not to make unfavorable statements...

183
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:16,074
and appoint an attorney. Understood?

184
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,274
- Take him. - Yes, sir.

185
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,274
Fine.

186
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:23,515
Put that away.

187
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:27,554
Don't worry.

188
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:29,954

The autopsy revealed the circumstances of the murder.

Some drug was injected.

I wonder too.

The only fingerprint we could find on it was yours.

222
00:19:02,005 --> 00:19:03,775
You'd better tell the truth.

223
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:08,420

No, I mean...

337
00:26:47,643 --> 00:26:52,212
That's right. He did invite them out to a casual meal once,

00:29:24,093 --> 00:29:25,879
- a right to be here. - What?

370
00:29:25,903 --> 00:29:28,803
He's a witness who will make a very important statement.

371
00:29:30,633 --> 00:29:32,033
Shall we begin?

372
00:29:38,213 --> 00:29:40,758
Embezzling from an illegal slush fund,

373
00:29:40,782 --> 00:29:42,219
bribery,

374
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,283
and murder of an older brother.

375
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:47,553
You want me gone for destroying the company's reputation.

376
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:49,192
That punk there...

377
00:29:49,193 --> 00:29:51,822
is a piece of trash.

378
00:29:52,493 --> 00:29:55,162
Whoever did that deserves to be dismissed.

379
00:29:55,622 --> 00:29:56,738
Right?

380
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,162
Right.

381
00:30:01,862 --> 00:30:03,479
For the exact same charges,

382
00:30:03,503 --> 00:30:04,902
I suggest...

383
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:07,872
we vote to dismiss President Hwang.

384
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:09,611
What are you on about?

385
00:30:09,612 --> 00:30:10,912
President Hwang Se Woong...

386
00:30:10,913 --> 00:30:13,841
should be fired for embezzlement, amassing a slush fund,

387
00:30:13,842 --> 00:30:16,252
bribing a high-ranking government official,

388
00:30:16,253 --> 00:30:17,683
and also...

389
00:30:17,953 --> 00:30:19,652
for murder.

390
00:30:20,052 --> 00:30:21,622
That is my agenda.

391
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,392
Can that be proven?

392
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:29,061
Are you saying we should listen to this nonsense?

393
00:30:29,062 --> 00:30:30,763
I can prove it.

394
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:33,233
That's why I brought with me...

395
00:30:34,102 --> 00:30:35,463
a witness.

396
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:37,733
Let's begin.

397
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:40,672
Take a seat.

398
00:30:47,842 --> 00:30:49,713
I'm Audit Team Manager Shin Cha Il.

399
00:30:53,883 --> 00:30:54,634
(Motion to Dismiss President Hwang)

400
00:30:54,983 --> 00:30:57,591
This is how Director Chae Jong Woo and President Hwang Gun Woong...

401
00:30:57,592 --> 00:30:59,723
put together the slush fund.

402
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:02,831
Even after President Hwang was admitted to the hospital,

403
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:04,791
Archcle Design continued to operate.

404
00:31:04,792 --> 00:31:07,861
In other words, the slush fund increased.

405
00:31:07,862 --> 00:31:09,732
That must've been Director Chae's doing.

406
00:31:09,733 --> 00:31:11,109
You're right.

407
00:31:11,133 --> 00:31:14,172
But the actual owner and spender is someone else.

408
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:21,088
Archcle's money went into developing J-BIMS and research...

409
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:23,183
at Yulnyeong Factory.

410
00:31:23,282 --> 00:31:24,983
Both projects...

411
00:31:25,582 --> 00:31:28,183
were President Hwang Se Woong's main objectives.

412
00:31:35,122 --> 00:31:36,562
Is there proof...

413
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:38,909
that Archcle's money went to those two projects?

414
00:31:38,933 --> 00:31:42,061
It was laundered via many routes before flowing to the two projects,

415
00:31:42,062 --> 00:31:43,503
so it's impossible to trace.

416
00:31:45,332 --> 00:31:47,043
So you have no proof?

417
00:31:58,512 --> 00:32:00,622
Director Chae left these records.

418
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:06,793
These accounts and ledgers record the cash flow.

419
00:32:07,322 --> 00:32:09,392
There's also a taped call...

420
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:11,193
with President Hwang Se Woong.

421
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,808
I need to make J-BIMS again.

422
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,463
Send the money within the week.

423
00:32:15,562 --> 00:32:18,149
Send a million dollars to fund Yulnyeong Factory's research.

424
00:32:18,173 --> 00:32:20,318
Give more business to Archcle Design.

425
00:32:20,342 --> 00:32:22,179
We need to collect more money.

426
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:23,642
Hurry.

427
00:32:24,413 --> 00:32:27,243
Do you admit to misappropriating the slush fund?

428
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:29,783
The slush fund...

429
00:32:30,112 --> 00:32:32,283
was put together by Gun Woong.

430
00:32:32,312 --> 00:32:34,422
I only spent it to better the company.

431
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:38,352
Yes, that's correct. Hwang Gun Woong put together the slush fund.

432
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:41,162
But after he passed out and was admitted,

433
00:32:41,163 --> 00:32:42,939
you managed it yourself.

434
00:32:42,963 --> 00:32:44,832
Yes, I did.

435
00:32:45,532 --> 00:32:46,532
Mr. Shin.

436
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,861
You said yourself that the money...

437
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:52,003
went into developing J-BIMS and modular building research.

438
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:54,879
Yes. I spent it all on company business.

439
00:32:54,903 --> 00:32:56,142
Is that a problem?

440
00:32:56,143 --> 00:32:57,271
Cut out the nonsense.

441
00:32:57,272 --> 00:32:58,571
That's embezzlement!

442
00:32:58,572 --> 00:32:59,943
Embezzlement?

443
00:33:00,112 --> 00:33:02,242
Can you prove I spent a single cent on myself?

444
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:03,252
That doesn't matter.

445
00:33:03,253 --> 00:33:04,558
It does matter.

446
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:07,828
There's a court ruling that if a slush fund's spent on business,

447
00:33:07,852 --> 00:33:09,453
it's not embezzlement.

448
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:11,498
If the court doesn't say it's illegal,

449
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:12,993
who are you to say it is?

450
00:33:14,863 --> 00:33:15,931
Is that true?

451
00:33:15,932 --> 00:33:17,032
It is.

452
00:33:17,033 --> 00:33:18,692
There is judicial precedent.

453
00:33:20,263 --> 00:33:22,303
Will you fire me...

454
00:33:23,872 --> 00:33:25,373
for working hard for the company?

455
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:32,572
You didn't spend the money solely on the company.

456
00:33:33,883 --> 00:33:35,243
What?

457
00:33:35,783 --> 00:33:39,112
Recently, JU Construction's President Hwang Se Woong...

458
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:42,322
sent me a gift through someone from his office.

459
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:46,598
But I swear on my sons' lives...

460
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:47,962
that I accepted it...

461
00:33:47,963 --> 00:33:52,239
thinking it was a gift set that cost under 30 dollars.

462
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:54,303
However, I checked last night,

463
00:33:54,403 --> 00:33:56,479
and found cash in the box.

464
00:33:56,503 --> 00:33:59,572
I reported it immediately to MOLIT.

465
00:34:00,073 --> 00:34:02,672
I plan to sue President Hwang...

466
00:34:02,972 --> 00:34:06,882
for deceiving me and giving me a bribe.

467
00:34:07,283 --> 00:34:12,313
I will cooperate with authorities in the investigation,

468
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:17,669
and if anyone were to attempt the same with me,

469
00:34:17,693 --> 00:34:21,862
I promise before the people that I will not turn a blind eye.

470
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:24,368
How did you get Undersecretary Ahn to flip?

471
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:27,002
Director Chae made recordings...

472
00:34:27,003 --> 00:34:28,663
whenever he delivered a bribe.

473
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:31,279
There are three large. Please do us the favor.

474
00:34:31,303 --> 00:34:32,703
Put it in the back.

475
00:34:35,642 --> 00:34:37,788
This isn't all.

476
00:34:37,812 --> 00:34:39,041
It's not all?

477
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:41,143
No. Wait and see.

478
00:34:43,053 --> 00:34:45,783
I was trying to get him to lift some restrictions.

479
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:47,922
I'll say this again.

480
00:34:48,483 --> 00:34:50,652
I spent it all for and on the company.

481
00:34:50,693 --> 00:34:52,723
If restrictions are lifted,

482
00:34:53,062 --> 00:34:54,391
it will benefit...

483
00:34:54,392 --> 00:34:56,333
not just us but the whole industry.

484
00:34:56,593 --> 00:34:59,232
Who would dare condemn me?

485
00:35:03,803 --> 00:35:06,803
He told me to look into the Chungon Sports Complex deal.

486
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:10,112
He wants to keep Hwang Dae Woong in line.

487
00:35:12,713 --> 00:35:14,942
He didn't hesitate to harm the business in order to ruin...

488
00:35:14,943 --> 00:35:17,413
Hwang Dae Woong's chances at taking over.

489
00:35:18,952 --> 00:35:20,623
That's professional negligence.

490
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:25,768
It's obvious what will happen if he were to take over.

491
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:27,092
I had to take him out...

492
00:35:27,093 --> 00:35:28,723
like you would a cockroach.

493
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,792
Am I wrong?

494
00:35:41,102 --> 00:35:42,572
You fools.

495
00:35:43,912 --> 00:35:46,382
You don't know what's truly right.

496
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:47,913
Hwang Se Woong.

497
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,288
What?

498
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:51,712
Do you want me to watch as they vote to dismiss me?

499
00:35:52,153 --> 00:35:54,359
I'm not interested. Do what you will.

500
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:56,752
I'm not done listing what you did wrong.

501
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,993
- What? - I said...

502
00:36:01,193 --> 00:36:02,839
the exact same charges.

503
00:36:02,863 --> 00:36:04,292
You...

504
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,563
took a life.

505
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:14,572
Are you...

506
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:17,473
resorting to framing me now?

507
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:00,783
What did we just watch?

508
00:37:01,182 --> 00:37:02,723
I want an explanation.

509
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:04,529
I will...

510
00:37:04,553 --> 00:37:06,422
explain for you.

511
00:37:17,303 --> 00:37:18,632
No way.

512
00:37:25,472 --> 00:37:26,911
When Audit Team found out...

513
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:29,951
about the slush fund, Mr. Hwang Se Woong tried...

514
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:33,013
to kill me and Mr. Shin.

515
00:37:34,153 --> 00:37:35,482
Director Chae.

516
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:41,268
But Director Chae and I didn't die.

517
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,991
When he heard we were recovering,

518
00:37:42,992 --> 00:37:46,333
he attempted to murder Director Chae again.

519
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,871
Mr. Shin predicted you would do this...

520
00:37:49,872 --> 00:37:51,803
and gave me a warning.

521
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:54,272
You must be prepared.

522
00:37:54,303 --> 00:37:56,913
Mr. Hwang Se Woong will stir up trouble again.

523
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,658
So I got prepared.

524
00:38:00,682 --> 00:38:02,783
They say he's improving.

525
00:38:26,472 --> 00:38:29,788
I had to persuade the doctor as well as my wife...

526
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:31,342
to act like I was dead for a day.

527
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,882
Then we passed over the flash drive,

528
00:38:34,283 --> 00:38:36,212
hoping you'd get the punishment you deserve.

529
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,658
You should come clean now.

530
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:40,422
"Come clean?"

531
00:38:40,423 --> 00:38:42,058
What is he talking about?

532
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:44,893
This wasn't the first time Mr. Hwang tried to murder someone.

533
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,922
He already killed someone else using the same method.

534
00:38:50,332 --> 00:38:51,933
Former president Hwang Gun Woong.

535
00:38:56,772 --> 00:38:58,132
Stop your nonsense!

536
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,703
On the night of June 4th,

537
00:38:59,972 --> 00:39:03,172
Mr. Hwang Se Woong arrived at the hospital before his brother.

538
00:39:05,872 --> 00:39:07,741
After Mr. Hwang Dae Woong left,

539
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:10,612
Mr. Hwang Se Woong entered the ward carefully...

540
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:13,382
via the security cameras' blind spot.

541
00:39:42,783 --> 00:39:45,581
Just like that, he murdered Mr. Hwang Gun Woong...

542
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,482
and left the hospital room.

543
00:39:50,122 --> 00:39:52,322
These needles were found in his office.

544
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:54,391
Hello, Vice President Hwang.

545
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,092
The president is away at the moment.

546
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,291
I left something here. I'll be quick.

547
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,592
Okay.

548
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,342
The safe is now unlocked.

549
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:29,893
Gosh.

550
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:35,402
The same drug in the needle...

551
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:38,933
was found in the body of the late Mr. Hwang Gun Woong.

552
00:40:40,242 --> 00:40:42,402
He'll be charged with bribery,

553
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:45,442
attempted murder, and murder.

554
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:51,683
How could you do that to your own brother?

555
00:41:07,662 --> 00:41:09,263
It's over for you.

556
00:41:14,403 --> 00:41:17,072
It looks like the tables have turned.

557
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:19,473
President Hwang!

558
00:41:20,883 --> 00:41:22,482
He brought it upon himself.

559
00:41:24,852 --> 00:41:26,583
He brought it upon himself.

560
00:41:41,062 --> 00:41:42,803
(JU Construction)

561
00:41:55,383 --> 00:41:56,982
I'm curious about something.

562
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,723
Why did you scout me?

563
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,423
(President Hwang Se Woong)

564
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:15,132
I'm someone who would audit you too.

565
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:16,549
Are you okay with that?

566
00:42:16,573 --> 00:42:20,103
If you need to clean up what's stopping JU from progressing,

567
00:42:21,272 --> 00:42:22,603
feel free to do it.

568
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:25,272
I wanted...

569
00:42:25,912 --> 00:42:27,712
to develop JU Construction...

570
00:42:29,283 --> 00:42:31,853
in fairness and justice.

571
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:36,022
But corruption was everywhere.

572
00:42:37,622 --> 00:42:39,053
When facing evil,

573
00:42:40,562 --> 00:42:42,962
sometimes you need to become evil too.

574
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:48,063
Isn't that your theory?

575
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,433
I was the same.

576
00:43:00,412 --> 00:43:01,712
That's sophistry.

577
00:43:02,412 --> 00:43:03,581
No matter how hard you sugarcoat it,

578
00:43:03,582 --> 00:43:06,652
you're the biggest and the most dangerous rat.

579
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:11,792
And there are no other options for you...

580
00:43:13,263 --> 00:43:15,462
aside from having the law punish you.

581
00:43:18,533 --> 00:43:19,862
Mr. Hwang Se Woong.

582
00:43:21,263 --> 00:43:23,201
You're under arrest...

583
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:25,549
for murder, attempted murder, and bribery against public servants.

584
00:43:25,573 --> 00:43:27,101
You have the right to remain silent...

585
00:43:27,102 --> 00:43:28,271
and refuse to answer questions.

586
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,612
You have the right to consult an attorney...

587
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:33,072
Arrest him.

588
00:43:33,883 --> 00:43:35,183
Let's go.

589
00:44:05,928 --> 00:44:07,837
What? Hey, look at that.

590
00:44:08,597 --> 00:44:10,437
JU Construction has a new president.

591
00:44:10,508 --> 00:44:11,907
Will it be okay now?

592
00:44:11,908 --> 00:44:13,036
(Hwang Dae Woong appointed as president)

593
00:44:13,037 --> 00:44:14,588
(JU Construction announces roadmap for overcoming crisis)

594
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:17,348
Please allow me to be over the top today,

595
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:19,118
Vice President Hwang. No, President Hwang.

596
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,235
I'm feeling cheeky today.

597
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,318
Go, President Hwang Dae Woong!

598
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:26,628
Go, President Hwang Dae Woong!

599
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:29,358
Yes!

600
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,405
A big congratulations to you.

601
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:34,238
My son had to repeat his senior year three times...

602
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,068
before finally getting accepted to the university I went to.

603
00:44:36,069 --> 00:44:37,238
I'm even happier today...

604
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:38,968
because that's his life.

605
00:44:38,969 --> 00:44:42,184
You becoming president is directly related to my life.

606
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,809
I'm so ecstatic.

607
00:44:45,028 --> 00:44:49,027
By the way, the position for the vice president is vacant.

608
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:50,799
Someone should fill...

609
00:44:51,098 --> 00:44:53,068
I'm certain someone was suspicious...

610
00:44:53,069 --> 00:44:55,839
of me being a murderer before.

611
00:44:57,178 --> 00:44:58,538
Wasn't that you, Mr. Yang?

612
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:01,048
Me? Gosh, no.

613
00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:03,418
There's no way.

614
00:45:03,419 --> 00:45:06,478
When I asked you if you trusted me, you hesitated. Right?

615
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,588
Mr. Hwang, at the time,

616
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:12,217
there was so much fog surrounding me.

617
00:45:12,218 --> 00:45:14,757
I couldn't see anything before me.

618
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:16,657
I'm weak, I'm just a human.

619
00:45:16,658 --> 00:45:19,197
However, I held on...

620
00:45:19,198 --> 00:45:20,798
to that string of hope.

621
00:45:20,799 --> 00:45:23,739
If it wasn't for my respect and trust in you, I wouldn't be...

622
00:45:24,198 --> 00:45:26,268
You're not made to be a vice president.

623
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:28,168
Please, Mr. Hwang!

624
00:45:28,169 --> 00:45:30,708
I've been supporting you for over 30 years.

625
00:45:30,709 --> 00:45:33,307
We worked together for over 30 years!

626
00:45:33,308 --> 00:45:35,211
Pour about this much.

627
00:45:35,235 --> 00:45:36,306
(Lemon)

628
00:45:40,848 --> 00:45:43,487
You must all be tired. Please have a drink.

629
00:45:43,488 --> 00:45:46,194
- Thank you. - Nice.

630
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:47,827
What is this? It's not coffee.

631
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,628
We've been having too much coffee.

632
00:45:49,629 --> 00:45:51,128
- I'll enjoy it. - Okay.

633
00:45:51,129 --> 00:45:52,858
Lemon tea.

634
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:54,869
Hey, this is nice.

635
00:45:54,999 --> 00:45:56,128
Did you make it yourself?

636
00:45:56,129 --> 00:45:57,938
To wash each lemon one by one...

637
00:45:57,939 --> 00:46:00,268
and to slice them takes too much time.

638
00:46:00,269 --> 00:46:02,438
- So I bought it. - I see.

639
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:04,807
Han Soo, this is so refreshing.

640
00:46:04,808 --> 00:46:06,648
Things have been so dramatic.

641
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:08,349
I don't ever want to go through that again.

642
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:10,319
Seo Jin.

643
00:46:10,948 --> 00:46:12,777
- I'm in your care. - Gosh.

644
00:46:12,778 --> 00:46:14,565
I'm not the one being promoted.

645
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:17,058
What's with you? Seo Jin's not the President.

646
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:19,489
- But I'm in your care, too. - Oh, my.

647
00:46:22,328 --> 00:46:24,558
Mr. Shin. Drink one.

648
00:46:29,528 --> 00:46:30,898
Let's have our meeting.

649
00:46:32,598 --> 00:46:33,969
Right.

650
00:46:34,339 --> 00:46:36,608
- Let's go. - Okay.

651
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:38,237
The sum of the amount spent...

652
00:46:38,238 --> 00:46:40,978
and the amount contracted also match.

653
00:46:41,149 --> 00:46:43,449
The papers had no issues.

654
00:46:43,718 --> 00:46:46,018
Great work. We'll end the meeting here.

655
00:46:46,118 --> 00:46:47,424
Mr. Shin.

656
00:46:47,448 --> 00:46:49,694
We had a lot of work until now.

657
00:46:49,718 --> 00:46:52,518
How about a team dinner to loosen up a bit?

658
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:54,205
It sounds like a good idea.

659
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:57,205
We have yet to hold your welcoming party, Mr. Shin.

660
00:46:57,229 --> 00:46:59,534
I'm in.

661
00:46:59,558 --> 00:47:01,929
I'm in, too.

662
00:47:06,069 --> 00:47:07,438
All right.

663
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:23,018
Did you come here...

664
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:25,858
to feel a sense of superiority?

665
00:47:33,129 --> 00:47:35,205
- Tell me the truth. - About what?

666
00:47:35,229 --> 00:47:38,498
When Gun Woong lost consciousness for the first time a year ago.

667
00:47:39,968 --> 00:47:41,608
Was that really an accident?

668
00:47:43,238 --> 00:47:44,737
Why do you want to know that?

669
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:46,108
Answer me.

670
00:47:56,658 --> 00:47:58,288
It was an accident.

671
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:07,226
(1 year ago)

672
00:48:12,069 --> 00:48:13,909
What brought you all the way here?

673
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:29,188
Why did you promote Dae Woong to an executive?

674
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:30,935
He was to be transferred to the province.

675
00:48:30,959 --> 00:48:32,094
That was the plan.

676
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:34,029
But he turned out to be perceptive...

677
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:36,358
and sharp.

678
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:38,659
Right. I can drive him hard.

679
00:48:38,859 --> 00:48:41,904
Is it because he grew up being cautious?

680
00:48:41,928 --> 00:48:44,199
Don't you know he's lobbying people in secret?

681
00:48:44,569 --> 00:48:45,737
He's a piece of trash.

682
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:48,645
That's the least anyone does in business. It's a custom.

683
00:48:48,669 --> 00:48:51,284
He's better than you who's doing nothing but acting all clean.

684
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:52,639
Don't you agree?

685
00:48:52,678 --> 00:48:53,978
So what?

686
00:48:54,649 --> 00:48:56,549
Are you using the slush fund as well?

687
00:48:57,549 --> 00:48:59,918
- What? - Did you think I wouldn't know?

688
00:48:59,948 --> 00:49:01,418
Archcle Design.

689
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:04,858
You created a shell company to raise slush funds.

690
00:49:05,319 --> 00:49:06,557
What? Are you planning...

691
00:49:06,558 --> 00:49:08,364
to increase your share by collecting stocks with that?

692
00:49:08,388 --> 00:49:12,027
You may not know it, but a president needs such money.

693
00:49:12,028 --> 00:49:13,028
"President?"

694
00:49:13,029 --> 00:49:16,228
You're one simply because you were born earlier than me.

695
00:49:19,299 --> 00:49:20,739
This jerk...

696
00:49:23,269 --> 00:49:26,208
You deluded yourself your whole life.

697
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:30,549
Se Woong.

698
00:49:31,778 --> 00:49:34,619
You didn't lose the presidency because you were younger than me.

699
00:49:34,749 --> 00:49:36,449
Guess what Father said.

700
00:49:36,549 --> 00:49:38,659
"Hwang Se Woong is like a snake."

701
00:49:38,859 --> 00:49:40,219
"He's wicked."

702
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:42,628
"I'm unable to read him."

703
00:49:43,258 --> 00:49:45,259
"Keeping him by my side is too risky."

704
00:49:47,499 --> 00:49:48,745
Woong.

705
00:49:48,769 --> 00:49:51,599
Even Father cast you aside.

706
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:55,708
Goodness.

707
00:50:04,448 --> 00:50:05,819
Gosh.

708
00:50:09,618 --> 00:50:11,719
What's this?

709
00:50:19,729 --> 00:50:21,199
Se Woong.

710
00:50:21,669 --> 00:50:23,268
Help me, Se Woong.

711
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:25,538
I feel dizzy.

712
00:50:26,269 --> 00:50:28,168
Come help me, Se Woong.

713
00:50:28,908 --> 00:50:30,239
Hey.

714
00:50:31,078 --> 00:50:32,708
Call...

715
00:50:33,649 --> 00:50:37,009
Call the ambulance, will you?

716
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:42,418
Listen. I feel weird.

717
00:50:42,419 --> 00:50:44,219
The world is spinning.

718
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:56,569
Se Woong...

719
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:01,608
It's tough, so don't withstand it.

720
00:51:02,669 --> 00:51:04,679
I'll take care of everything from now on.

721
00:51:05,738 --> 00:51:08,279
I'll change everything, including the company.

722
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,049
So...

723
00:51:12,379 --> 00:51:13,918
Stop withstanding it.

724
00:51:42,008 --> 00:51:43,648
That was an accident.

725
00:51:46,249 --> 00:51:48,018
An inevitable...

726
00:51:49,488 --> 00:51:50,819
accident.

727
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:28,489
Look at you, Shin Cha Il.

728
00:52:28,629 --> 00:52:30,558
You seem a bit relaxed.

729
00:52:30,629 --> 00:52:32,429
Is it because I'm the President?

730
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,099
Can't you respond when someone makes a joke?

731
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:43,869
I didn't know it was a joke.

732
00:52:46,439 --> 00:52:49,509
I'm the immediate superior of the Audit Team now.

733
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,549

What's this?

736
00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:09,004
Are you quitting because I'm the President?

737
00:53:09,028 --> 00:53:10,398
No.

738
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,597
It's because my job here is done.

739
00:53:12,598 --> 00:53:15,509
No. You're not done yet.

740
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,639
So work here for at least another year.

741
00:53:21,848 --> 00:53:24,254
I know how much you care about the company.

742
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:27,648
However, how you're devoted is quite dangerous and aggressive.

743
00:53:27,919 --> 00:53:29,295
Be careful.

744
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:32,458
You can continue to act arrogant while working for me, all right?

745
00:53:32,459 --> 00:53:33,858
Excuse me.

00:54:13,927 --> 00:54:15,863
Aren't you going to drink, Mr. Shin?

750
00:54:15,887 --> 00:54:17,258
I'm good.

751
00:54:17,657 --> 00:54:20,098
I've always been curious.

752
00:54:20,668 --> 00:54:22,928
Is that how you usually talk?

753
00:54:23,398 --> 00:54:24,673
I know, right?

754
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:27,213
Because you're always too formal,

755
00:54:27,237 --> 00:54:30,337
there's a wall between us. You feel very distant, Mr. Shin.

756
00:54:30,438 --> 00:54:32,738
You're doing that on purpose, right?

757
00:54:34,907 --> 00:54:36,508
I've always been like that.

758
00:54:46,188 --> 00:54:48,087
I was joking.

759
00:54:52,258 --> 00:54:54,828
- It was a joke. - You're like an auditing robot.

760
00:54:55,827 --> 00:54:58,644
Mr. Shin. Let's often have meals together.

761
00:54:58,668 --> 00:54:59,997
It's nice and all, isn't it?

762
00:54:59,998 --> 00:55:01,337
He's right.

763
00:55:02,608 --> 00:55:05,678
I have something to inform everyone.

764
00:55:08,378 --> 00:55:10,048
I handed in...

765
00:55:10,717 --> 00:55:12,548
my resignation letter to the President today.

766
00:55:13,517 --> 00:55:17,247
As of today, I'm resigning from the manager position.

767
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:18,886
What...

768
00:55:18,887 --> 00:55:21,334
So, today is your last day of work?

769
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,573
This is a farewell party, not a welcoming party.

770
00:55:24,597 --> 00:55:26,457
Are you transferring to a new company?

771
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,298
Nothing has been decided yet.

772
00:55:28,398 --> 00:55:31,598
Then can't you work with us longer?

773
00:55:31,697 --> 00:55:33,968
I still have a lot to learn.

774
00:55:36,907 --> 00:55:39,408

775
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:41,948

Okay. Let's do that.

00:56:05,568 --> 00:56:07,013
Okay. Here we go.

Good job, sir.

787
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:17,848
You did great, sir.

00:56:18,217 --> 00:56:19,678
I'm sorry, sir.

Do you think...

791
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:44,808
I'll do well?

792
00:56:47,608 --> 00:56:49,078
You asked...

793
00:56:49,878 --> 00:56:52,417
why I risked my life to audit.

794
00:56:56,117 --> 00:57:00,187
Something happened not long after I started as an auditor.

795
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:02,463
I noticed...

796
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:05,604
the amount of rebars we bought didn't correspond with the expenses.

797
00:57:05,628 --> 00:57:06,696
What about this?

798
00:57:06,697 --> 00:57:10,227
Your audit report on the procurement of construction materials.

799
00:57:10,228 --> 00:57:13,236
We did purchase 300 tons of rebar.

800
00:57:13,237 --> 00:57:15,814
Why did you pay the company for 420 tons, then?

801
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:17,977
Why? Do you think I'm taking a cut...

802
00:57:17,978 --> 00:57:19,777
to let someone steal rebars?

803
00:57:19,778 --> 00:57:21,306
- No, but... - That we'll use less rebars...

804
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:22,806
and let our buildings crumble?

805
00:57:22,807 --> 00:57:24,517
That's not what I'm saying.

806
00:57:25,778 --> 00:57:27,024
Let's get back to work.

807
00:57:27,048 --> 00:57:30,048
I believed my superior's vague explanation.

808
00:57:30,987 --> 00:57:32,317
No.

809
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:35,758
It was more like I didn't want to cause trouble.

810
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:38,734
I should trust someone on my team.

811
00:57:38,758 --> 00:57:40,227
I shouldn't doubt.

813
00:57:42,528 --> 00:57:43,928
At which site?

00:57:44,938 --> 00:57:46,267
Dad.

815
00:57:50,068 --> 00:57:52,337
It's dangerous. You can't get closer.

816
00:57:54,248 --> 00:57:55,624
You can't go inside.

817
00:57:55,648 --> 00:57:57,008
- Hey. - No.

818
00:57:57,617 --> 00:57:59,147
Stay with me!

819
00:58:00,847 --> 00:58:02,493
Will you get more help?

820
00:58:02,517 --> 00:58:04,417
We'll all die at this rate!

821
00:58:32,378 --> 00:58:33,817

822
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:36,348

Father!

824
00:58:39,787 --> 00:58:43,234
I never supported you the way other dads did.

825
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:45,897
And you still got into a great construction company.

826
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:47,258
Good luck.

827

829
00:59:02,608 --> 00:59:03,977
And so...

830
00:59:04,447 --> 00:59:06,747
because I turned from the truth,

831
00:59:06,778 --> 00:59:09,488
- Father! - a building project collapsed,

832
00:59:10,717 --> 00:59:12,618
and I lost my father.

833
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,397
That's when I realized...

834
00:59:24,068 --> 00:59:25,468
that auditing...

835
00:59:25,637 --> 00:59:29,607

837

where trust means something.

838
00:59:57,498 --> 00:59:59,037
But until then,

839
00:59:59,938 --> 01:00:03,308
you must keep a clear outlook.

That's a list of transactions on your company credit card.

01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:37,298
There are extra ingredients today.

920
01:04:37,969 --> 01:04:39,267
To celebrate my promotion.

921
01:04:39,268 --> 01:04:41,115
Should I find a place to open a restaurant?

922
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:43,108
- I'll find a place for you. - You will?

923
01:04:51,688 --> 01:04:53,019
Han Soo.

924
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:55,488
No more embezzling from now on.

925
01:04:55,489 --> 01:04:56,595
What?

926
01:04:56,619 --> 01:04:58,988
- Hey. - You can't steal anymore.

927
01:04:58,989 --> 01:05:00,559
Here, Mother.

928
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:01,959
Thank you.

929
01:05:02,228 --> 01:05:03,428
You've changed, Han Soo.

930
01:05:03,429 --> 01:05:04,644
I haven't.

931
01:05:04,668 --> 01:05:05,727
He's a traitor.

932
01:05:05,728 --> 01:05:07,715
You should change a bit too.

933
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:09,098
I'm way too cute already.

934
01:05:09,099 --> 01:05:10,345
You're what?

935
01:05:10,369 --> 01:05:12,068
You still haven't grown up.

936
01:05:12,069 --> 01:05:13,568
- That hurts. - Darn you.

937
01:05:13,569 --> 01:05:15,878
You still haven't grown up.

938
01:06:24,179 --> 01:06:25,979
My gosh.

939
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:28,819
Mr. Shin Cha Il?

940
01:06:32,189 --> 01:06:33,489
Who are you?

941
01:06:42,299 --> 01:06:44,659
My name is Kim Si Hyun. That's where I work.

942
01:06:45,828 --> 01:06:48,538
You've caught plenty of little rats.

943
01:06:49,698 --> 01:06:52,139
Now, let's go and catch a big one.

944
