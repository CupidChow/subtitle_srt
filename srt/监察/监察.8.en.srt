2
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:56,955
Two things are necessary to achieve a goal.

3
00:00:56,979 --> 00:00:59,822
Those are passion and patience.

4
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:04,389
You can rest for a while
but shouldn't give up.

5
00:01:05,509 --> 00:01:08,988
Let me introduce our destination to you.

6
00:01:09,012 --> 00:01:12,582
This is the completed J-BIMS.

7
00:01:20,679 --> 00:01:24,839
Who, when, where, what, how, and why.

8
00:01:24,863 --> 00:01:26,830
These are 6Ws

9
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:30,982
Please remember this.

10
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:32,780
Someone has accessed the cloud.

11
00:01:32,804 --> 00:01:38,359
It's the keyword for the completed J-BIMS

12
00:01:38,383 --> 00:01:40,476
I'll introduce from now on.

13
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:46,192
The 3D rendering technique shows us
the completed building

14
00:01:46,216 --> 00:01:48,785
if I put the blueprint.

15
00:01:49,516 --> 00:01:52,431
It also calculates information value
for maintenance levels after construction.

16
00:01:52,455 --> 00:01:55,515
With its VR function
you can see a whole different level of…

17
00:01:59,084 --> 00:02:00,084
What's going on?

18
00:02:05,097 --> 00:02:06,402
What are you doing?

19
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:24,855
I have one question.

20
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:27,924
Is it him again?

21
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,338
What the hell

22
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:48,478
are you doing here?

23
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:11,096
<i>(The Auditors)</i>

24
00:03:11,829 --> 00:03:13,458
What do you mean…?

25
00:03:13,482 --> 00:03:14,937
Are you sure you're a reporter?

26
00:03:18,243 --> 00:03:20,319
What are you talking about?

27
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:22,430
What on earth are you doing?

28
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:24,414
Don't you know
how important this presentation is?

29
00:03:25,723 --> 00:03:27,603
Please allow me time
to explain what's going on.

30
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:38,328
You should

31
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,558
provide a good explanation.

32
00:03:46,498 --> 00:03:49,131
You haven't written a single sentence.

33
00:03:49,155 --> 00:03:50,655
Well…

34
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:52,701
I tend to write
after listening to what the speaker says…

35
00:03:52,725 --> 00:03:57,714
Why is your camera zoomed in
only on the letters on the screen?

36
00:04:01,798 --> 00:04:05,860
Are you nitpicking my reporting method?

37
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:06,932
Of course not.

38
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:10,821
I don't need to nitpick you
because you're not a reporter.

39
00:04:10,845 --> 00:04:11,672
What?

40
00:04:11,696 --> 00:04:15,226
You're a broker who came here
to contract over the J-BIMS

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,010
that General Manager
Lee Ji Hoon has leaked.

42
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:21,901
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

43
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,442
Does it make sense?

44
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:30,511
General Manager Lee Ji Hoon has leaked
the demo version of J-BIMS

45
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:33,805
and contacted buyers on the dark web.

46
00:04:35,705 --> 00:04:38,397
But the demo wasn't perfect.

47
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:40,910
The General Manager planned to trade
J-MIBS through this opportunity

48
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:42,659
by supplementing its insufficient part.

49
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:45,366
He's saying bullshit…

50
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:49,104
You've requested Director Park something
while preparing the presentation.

51
00:04:49,128 --> 00:04:52,655
Make sure to put this image on the screen

52
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:55,648
12 minutes after I start the presentation.

53
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:57,683
Five Ws and one H.

54
00:04:57,707 --> 00:04:59,309
That's the image.

55
00:05:01,894 --> 00:05:03,601
<i>(Five Ws and one H)</i>

56
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,649
Isn't that the cloud's password?

57
00:05:09,564 --> 00:05:11,924
<i>(The reset password for the cloud is 5W1H.)</i>

58
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,292
- It's…
- Is it true?

59
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,370
Yes.

60
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,710
It's true.

61
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,192
The broker disguised himself as a reporter
and received the J-BIMS

62
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,969
using the password.

63
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:35,780
Do you have a proof?

64
00:05:35,804 --> 00:05:38,144
How can you set me up like this
without any proof?

65
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:42,502
What kind of nonsense is it?

66
00:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,987
Everything will be discovered
if you check it out.

67
00:05:57,227 --> 00:06:00,083
You flippantly talked as you pleased.
Why aren't you checking it out?

68
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:03,272
Simple reason.
You didn't download J-BIMS on this laptop.

69
00:06:04,714 --> 00:06:08,857
You already knew we were observing you so
you accessed the cloud to cause confusion

70
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:10,580
but didn't download it.

71
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,691
Mr. President.

72
00:06:14,715 --> 00:06:17,953
Should I bite the bullet of this bullshit?

73
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,615
I've worked my ass off for the company.

74
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:22,039
Is the return for my effort treating me
as an industrial spy?

75
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:29,199
I'm not in the mood for
doing the presentation.

76
00:06:45,258 --> 00:06:46,482
General Manager.

77
00:06:49,238 --> 00:06:50,586
If you're innocent

78
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,523
please keep the presentation.

79
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:58,561
You have only one option.

80
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:03,466
Turn yourself in and go to jail.

81
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:09,331
Are you going to keep acting like this?

82
00:07:10,584 --> 00:07:12,464
Mr. President, I can't
put up with him anymore.

83
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:18,474
I know you sensed
that Director Park and I joined forces.

84
00:07:18,498 --> 00:07:21,439
He asked me if I had
something to do with you.

85
00:07:21,463 --> 00:07:23,927
Doesn't he already sense it?

86
00:07:23,951 --> 00:07:25,226
Two things are necessary...

87
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,668
So, you signaled the
broker to change the plan.

88
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,892
Those are passion and patience.

89
00:07:36,892 --> 00:07:41,037
While keeping this tumbler
you never didn't drink directly from it.

90
00:07:44,215 --> 00:07:45,408
I wonder why.

91
00:07:50,862 --> 00:07:52,148
It's because

92
00:07:53,775 --> 00:07:56,252
it's not a normal tumbler.

93
00:08:01,878 --> 00:08:03,859
It looks like a USB is inside the tumbler.

94
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,459
You felt trading through
the cloud is dangerous.

95
00:08:10,483 --> 00:08:14,203
So, you took the risk of moving the J-BIMS
to this storage device.

96
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:19,918
Director Park.

97
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:23,045
Go to prepare the presentation.
I'll wrap it up here.

98
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,290
Then, I'll go first.

99
00:08:25,314 --> 00:08:26,314
Thank you.

100
00:08:34,103 --> 00:08:35,250
<i>(Copying the file)</i>

101
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:42,797
You suggested a different deal
to the broker with a preset sign.

102
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:46,976
That's why the broker didn't download it.

103
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,083
Please remember this.

104
00:08:51,107 --> 00:08:52,774
It's the keyword.

105
00:08:58,236 --> 00:09:02,118
I bet there's J-BIMS inside it.

106
00:09:06,236 --> 00:09:07,356
Isn't it?

107
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,963
Get him!

108
00:10:45,549 --> 00:10:47,823
Open the door.
There's no way you can get away.

109
00:11:18,195 --> 00:11:19,374
Sir.

110
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:20,801
Please calm down.

111
00:11:21,782 --> 00:11:22,978
General Manager.

112
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:24,927
You're just making the situation serious.

113
00:11:34,241 --> 00:11:35,638
Everyone.

114
00:11:37,047 --> 00:11:40,109
This is the only J-BIMS left.

115
00:11:41,887 --> 00:11:43,409
What are you talking about?

116
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:47,251
I uninstalled every program on the server
as soon as I entered the office.

117
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,151
You're saying bullshit.

118
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:54,790
Director Park. Check out if
what he said is correct or not.

119
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,570
There isn't any J-BIMS. All is gone.

120
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,151
Why don't we make a deal?

121
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:25,504
Stop it.

122
00:12:25,528 --> 00:12:27,056
If you turn yourself in now

123
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:29,234
you'll get a plea bargain.

124
00:12:29,258 --> 00:12:31,093
If so, would you give me 50 billion won?

125
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:36,174
It must take huge money
and time to re-create J-BIMS.

126
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:39,978
Above all, I'm the only one who can
implement the critical technique for it.

127
00:12:40,002 --> 00:12:42,171
It's not that you created it alone.

128
00:12:43,356 --> 00:12:44,038
Hey.

129
00:12:44,062 --> 00:12:45,227
It's the program
all development department employees made

130
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,025
by working day and night.

131
00:12:47,049 --> 00:12:48,611
All employees?

132
00:12:49,342 --> 00:12:52,461
The incompetent like you guys
couldn't have done anything.

133
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,551
You couldn't have
created J-BIMS without me.

134
00:13:01,517 --> 00:13:02,658
Hey.

135
00:13:03,897 --> 00:13:06,197
Do you think you can get away with it?

136
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:08,737
I know.

137
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:11,300
The die is cast.

138
00:13:13,264 --> 00:13:15,754
You promise to plead
for my plea bargain, right?

139
00:13:15,778 --> 00:13:17,206
Of course, I do.

140
00:13:18,504 --> 00:13:19,642
So

141
00:13:21,424 --> 00:13:22,424
Please give it to me.

142
00:13:39,425 --> 00:13:42,204
Come to think of it
I memorized the original in my head.

143
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:43,531
It's just a copy.

144
00:13:43,555 --> 00:13:46,180
If I return it to you there's nothing
left I can negotiate with you.

145
00:13:46,204 --> 00:13:49,538
I should leave only the original
to make a better bargain.

146
00:14:02,677 --> 00:14:05,545
You, crazy!
Don't you know how precious it is?

147
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:06,755
Take him away.

148
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:16,742
Mr. President. It's only possible
to make the J-BIMS with my help.

149
00:14:16,766 --> 00:14:19,111
If you plead for a favorable handling of me
I'll re-create it.

150
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,903
I'll wait for your call.

151
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,813
Director Park. You helped me a lot.
What a shame.

152
00:14:28,837 --> 00:14:30,754
I never helped you.

153
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:32,524
You just exploited me.

154
00:14:32,548 --> 00:14:35,371
Are you trying to get out of it now?

155
00:14:35,395 --> 00:14:37,620
You're my accomplice.

156
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,105
I really didn't know about it.

157
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,342
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:50,366 --> 00:14:52,346
You don't need to apologize to me.

159
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,736
Follow me.

160
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:22,500
Se Woong.

161
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,492
Why did you entrust that bastard
with an important work?

162
00:15:26,516 --> 00:15:31,129
Some shareholders are saying
that you need better judgment.

163
00:15:32,073 --> 00:15:34,610
You should make up for your mistake.

164
00:15:41,763 --> 00:15:43,254
Don't be disappointed.

165
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:45,682
You can make that program again.

166
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:48,992
We've been operating the company well
without that kind of thing.

<i>(President Hwang Se Woong)</i>

168
00:16:27,107 --> 00:16:31,467
I really didn't know that the general
manager tried to leak the J-BIMS.

169
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:35,604
But it's true that

170
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,974
I helped the leak process by his orders.

171
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:42,878
I apologize
to every development department employee.

172
00:16:43,704 --> 00:16:44,846
I'm sorry.

173
00:16:49,788 --> 00:16:52,754
And to Oh Yoon Woo…

174
00:17:04,928 --> 00:17:06,201
I'm sorry.

175
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:11,834
Mr. Oh Yoon Woo witnessed the general
manager trying to leak the data by chance.

176
00:17:11,858 --> 00:17:15,398
That's why Lee Ji Hoon ordered me
to bully Mr. Oh Yoon Woo

177
00:17:15,422 --> 00:17:18,547
and kick him out of the department.

178
00:17:20,195 --> 00:17:24,243
He didn't know what it was
when he witnessed the leak process.

179
00:17:24,267 --> 00:17:28,452
Yoon Woo was expelled
from the department he likes

180
00:17:28,476 --> 00:17:31,673
without knowing why.

181
00:17:31,697 --> 00:17:34,773
I continuously used violent language

182
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:38,918
and got angry at him
while exaggerating a tiny mistake

183
00:17:38,942 --> 00:17:41,070
as a big one.

184
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,942
Mr. Oh Yoon Hoo isn't incompetent.
He's worth his salt.

185
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:51,890
I followed the superior's
unreasonable orders

186
00:17:51,914 --> 00:17:54,250
and bullied and insulted

187
00:17:56,487 --> 00:17:57,970
innocent Mr. Oh Yoon Woo.

188
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:02,491
I apologize with all my heart.

189
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,536
You can transfer
to the other department if you want.

190
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,600
No.

191
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,804
I want to keep working in this department.

192
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,718
I'm sorry.

193
00:18:53,945 --> 00:18:55,831
Why didn't you report it to me in advance?

194
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:58,347
I already told you
about the risk of the data leak.

195
00:18:59,258 --> 00:19:01,626
You didn't tell me the trade was going
to happen on the presentation date.

196
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:04,511
The chance was high
but I wasn't 100% sure.

197
00:19:04,535 --> 00:19:07,509
I had to catch him red-handed
not to make him get away with the program.

198
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,773
I didn't want to be interrupted
by any unexpected things.

199
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,360
I'm the president.

200
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,896
Are you treating me as an unexpected thing?

201
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,457
Anyway, how are you
dealing with the matter?

202
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:23,552
It's true that Director Park helped
the leak process

203
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:26,284
although he didn't mean it.

204
00:19:26,308 --> 00:19:28,136
Depending on the result
of the police investigation

205
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,869
I'll take disciplinary action against him.

206
00:19:29,893 --> 00:19:32,524
And I've reinstated Oh Yoon Woo
to the technology development department.

207
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:34,068
I don't care about that kind of thing.

208
00:19:34,748 --> 00:19:36,027
What about J-BIMS?

209
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:38,347
Technology development employees
including Director Park

210
00:19:38,371 --> 00:19:40,699
told me that Lee Ji
Hoon's role is important

211
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:42,967
but isn't irreplaceable.

212
00:19:42,991 --> 00:19:45,170
Then, why was Lee Ji Hoon so confident?

213
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:47,461
That's his arrogant attitude.

214
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:51,526
Those greedy normally express themselves
as an indispensable person as an excuse

215
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:54,336
and often make trouble.

216
00:19:57,578 --> 00:19:58,607
You can go.

217
00:20:19,564 --> 00:20:22,607
I didn't expect this
kind of thing to happen.

218
00:20:22,631 --> 00:20:25,601
I think a bad thing happens a lot.

219
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:28,327
What a spectacular day, huh?

220
00:20:28,351 --> 00:20:31,249
Right. I was surprised by the money.

221
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:33,022
You heard what Lee Ji Hoon said, right?

222
00:20:33,046 --> 00:20:35,658
It seemed like he really made a deal
to receive 50 billion won.

223
00:20:35,682 --> 00:20:39,783
Isn't it worth a try if it's
50 billion won? Right?

224
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:43,555
Do you think 50 billion
won justifies a crime?

225
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:46,753
It's a figure of speech.
I'm joking.

226
00:20:49,928 --> 00:20:51,393
Thank you for your hard work.

227
00:20:52,768 --> 00:20:54,171
You did a good job.

228
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:55,266
What?

229
00:20:58,648 --> 00:20:59,812
Thank you.

230
00:20:59,836 --> 00:21:02,380
You're the one who worked hardest.

231
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:04,059
Everyone, wrap it up and go home.

232
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,635
I'll leave.

233
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,576
Goodbye.

234
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,076
Oh, you've got a compliment.

235
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:15,175
- Let's go home.
- Yes.

236
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:16,251
Let's go.

237
00:21:19,426 --> 00:21:21,777
Do you remember

238
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,945
when the police arrested Lee Ji Hoon?

239
00:21:23,969 --> 00:21:27,135
He laughed at that time.

240
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,959
He hadn't shown the
slightest bit of remorse.

241
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:33,002
He acted like he did something fun…

242
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:37,372
He'll change his tune
after one day in jail.

243
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:39,959
And he can't regard what
he did as fun anymore.

244
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,466
Right.

245
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:48,378
I was touched by Mr. Shin's compliment
when he left the office.

246
00:21:48,402 --> 00:21:49,725
Why?

247
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:52,674
It's obvious that he trusted
my opinion from the beginning

248
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:54,298
that there might be technology leakages.

249
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,750
That's right
even though he had his own reason.

250
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:03,156
I can't believe he trusted me
because he used to say

251
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,166
"Do you trust people? I don't."

252
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:08,103
Don't you think I've gained his trust?

253
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:13,808
I have lots to say to you
but I'll hold my tongue.

254
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:17,746
Anyway, you played a
part in solving the case.

255
00:22:19,222 --> 00:22:20,515
You did a great job.

256
00:22:22,056 --> 00:22:23,185
Thank you.

257
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:26,221
Then, what about having something
to eat together?

258
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:28,933
Eat together?

259
00:22:28,957 --> 00:22:33,094
Yoon Woo will join later.
Let's have a staff dinner.

260
00:22:34,893 --> 00:22:35,893
What do you say?

261
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:39,689
Okay. I'll join you.

262
00:22:39,713 --> 00:22:41,761
What are you going to eat?

263
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:43,600
Do you like chicken?

264
00:22:45,933 --> 00:22:47,695
I'm serious.

265
00:22:47,719 --> 00:22:49,621
It's exactly 15,000 won.

266
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:52,724
Go home.

267
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:57,024
I felt sorry for an old lady selling
vegetables so I bought some.

268
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:59,421
You bought so many times from her.

269
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:01,823
I'll nag you if you do it again.

270
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:07,874
You look so hot when you fold a box.

271
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:10,317
Shut your mouth up before I fold you, too.

272
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:13,745
- You're even tough.
- Don't touch me.

273
00:23:13,769 --> 00:23:16,247
- You like it.
- Stop it.

274
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:19,474
You can't hit me.

275
00:23:20,218 --> 00:23:21,844
I'm back.

276
00:23:22,911 --> 00:23:24,112
Hello.

277
00:23:26,831 --> 00:23:28,994
They're my parents.

278
00:23:29,018 --> 00:23:31,178
For your information
it's true that they were fighting.

279
00:23:34,103 --> 00:23:35,279
Hello.

280
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,962
By the way, who are you?

281
00:23:44,161 --> 00:23:45,434
Isn't it the first time?

282
00:23:46,581 --> 00:23:48,418
He's never brought a woman to the store.

283
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:49,938
I'm so curious.

284
00:23:50,801 --> 00:23:53,384
It can be nothing.
He might've brought her as a colleague.

285
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:54,877
But we also used to be colleagues.

286
00:23:57,014 --> 00:23:58,480
I can hear your voice.

287
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:00,802
Don't let the ridiculous imagination
possess you.

288
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:03,001
Please serve an abundant meal.
Yoon Woo will come soon.

289
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,652
- I see.
- Yoon Woo will come?

290
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:11,831
You and Han Soo are in the same department.
So you see him every day, right?

291
00:24:11,855 --> 00:24:12,670
Right.

292
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:16,266
As you know, he's very kind.

293
00:24:17,261 --> 00:24:19,543
Yes, he is.
He's kind and is good-tempered.

294
00:24:19,567 --> 00:24:21,384
I've had a lot of help from him.

295
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:23,147
Really?

296
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:26,985
You know, a helper can be a lover.

297
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:29,287
You know what I'm saying.

298
00:24:29,311 --> 00:24:31,953
Mom. Please take Dad out.

299
00:24:31,977 --> 00:24:34,840
Honey. Let's talk about
what we were talking about.

300
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,494
- Enjoy your meal.
- Yes.

301
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,628
Thank you.

302
00:24:37,652 --> 00:24:40,021
I'll treat you to a
delicious chicken again.

303
00:24:41,546 --> 00:24:42,857
Try it.

304
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:44,569
The chicken in our store tastes excellent.

305
00:24:44,593 --> 00:24:45,803
Okay.

306
00:24:45,827 --> 00:24:48,394
- Why don't we eat it with Yoon Woo?
- Okay.

307
00:24:51,376 --> 00:24:52,610
Hello.

308
00:24:52,634 --> 00:24:54,154
You're here.

309
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:56,881
You came at just the right time.

310
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:58,222
Is there something happened?

311
00:24:58,246 --> 00:24:59,684
No.

312
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:01,476
Have a seat here.

313
00:25:07,483 --> 00:25:10,837
This case has become lucky for us.

314
00:25:10,861 --> 00:25:16,367
The project Mr. President
has pushed has failed.

315
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:20,709
I have a great feeling that we can
also kick Mr. Shin out of the company.

316
00:25:20,733 --> 00:25:23,961
When will you unveil the secret?

317
00:25:23,985 --> 00:25:25,676
What a scam bag the man is!

318
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,770
Mr. Shin? He's crazy.

319
00:25:28,794 --> 00:25:29,805
No. Lee Ji Hoon.

320
00:25:30,534 --> 00:25:31,856
Ah, Lee Ji Hoon.

321
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,462
Forget about him.
He's nothing but a swindler.

322
00:25:34,486 --> 00:25:38,493
You should focus on
kicking Mr. President out

323
00:25:38,517 --> 00:25:42,126
to possess his position.

324
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:47,268
I begin to see a new glimmer of hope.

325
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:49,224
The situation is on our side.

326
00:25:52,958 --> 00:25:54,296
- Drink.
- Yes, sir.

327
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,436
The weather is good.

328
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:12,390
Don't you feel this delicious chicken
relieves your stress?

329
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:13,758
Yes. It's good.

330
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:14,782
Okay.

331
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:18,247
- How is it?
- It's good.

332
00:26:18,271 --> 00:26:23,058
It's spicy and sweet.
It's really good.

333
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:25,002
It tastes better with a sauce.

334
00:26:28,975 --> 00:26:30,065
Help yourself.

335
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,229
Hey.

336
00:26:33,935 --> 00:26:35,949
I know you've worked a lot for me.

337
00:26:35,973 --> 00:26:37,339
You, too.

338
00:26:39,242 --> 00:26:40,342
I'm sorry.

339
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:42,544
Thank you.

340
00:26:45,595 --> 00:26:46,625
Hey.

341
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:52,844
Don't try to hurt yourself
no matter how tough things are.

342
00:26:52,868 --> 00:26:56,025
If things become tough again

343
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,314
please tell us.

344
00:26:59,338 --> 00:27:01,330
- You got it?
- I got it.

345
00:27:06,604 --> 00:27:10,975
You're lucky
because you have someone you can rely on

346
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:13,239
when things are tough.

347
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:17,345
Thank you.

348
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:21,045
I don't expect you
to say that kind of warm words.

349
00:27:23,025 --> 00:27:25,632
- Let's make a toast.
- Okay.

350
00:27:25,656 --> 00:27:27,265
Let's make a slogan.

351
00:27:27,289 --> 00:27:29,033
What about "Love your colleague
as much as you love your country"?

352
00:27:29,057 --> 00:27:30,298
What?

353
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:32,028
Are you serious?

354
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:33,337
Don't you have another one?

355
00:27:33,361 --> 00:27:34,361
You don't like it?

356
00:27:36,148 --> 00:27:37,241
What about WHUS?

357
00:27:37,265 --> 00:27:39,710
- What matters
- is having an unyielding spirit.

358
00:27:39,734 --> 00:27:40,345
Why didn't you say it?

359
00:27:40,369 --> 00:27:41,179
I did it.
No, you didn't.

360
00:27:41,203 --> 00:27:42,148
- I did it.
- I saw that you didn't say it.

361
00:27:42,172 --> 00:27:45,507
- I really did it.
- Well, I'll turn a blind eye to it.

00:28:25,729 --> 00:28:27,920
Good morning. Thank you for your service.

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,582
Good morning.

00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:36,408
Good morning.

371
00:28:51,255 --> 00:28:53,636
Six cups of Iced Americano, please.

372
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,494
- Please wait a moment.
- Yes.

373
00:29:00,094 --> 00:29:01,442
Good morning.

374
00:29:01,466 --> 00:29:02,980
Good morning.

375
00:29:07,649 --> 00:29:10,175
Sir. Here it is.

376
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:13,846
Thank you.

377
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:16,102
I'm a bit disappointed by you.

378
00:29:18,669 --> 00:29:20,953
Will you audit me?
It's just a cup of coffee.

379
00:29:23,695 --> 00:29:24,856
It's just a joke.

380
00:29:25,949 --> 00:29:27,092
Enjoy it.

381
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:29,651
He makes me cringy.

382
00:29:29,675 --> 00:29:31,051
I bought it for you.

383
00:29:31,075 --> 00:29:34,909
I can't drink a cold one.
As I said, I have a gum disease.

384
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:37,779
- Then, I'll take it back.
- If you take it back, you're cold-hearted.

385
00:29:37,803 --> 00:29:39,171
- Thank you.
- Yes.

386
00:29:40,036 --> 00:29:41,916
Have a cup of coffee.

387
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,318
Thank you.

388
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:45,720
- Have a cup of coffee.
- Thank you.

389
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:46,878
Hey.

390
00:29:47,937 --> 00:29:49,581
Thank you.

391
00:29:54,568 --> 00:29:57,955
<i>(The Audit Team)</i>

392
00:30:13,114 --> 00:30:14,283
Sir.

393
00:30:14,307 --> 00:30:16,208
You'd better check this out.

394
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:27,551
Do you think this is trustworthy?

395
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:29,467
I don't know yet whether it's true or not.

396
00:30:29,491 --> 00:30:32,093
It's uploaded online anonymously.

397
00:30:32,117 --> 00:30:35,703
But it's the talk of the town
in many internet communities.

398
00:30:35,727 --> 00:30:37,609
The story is quite specific

399
00:30:37,633 --> 00:30:41,070
so it's obvious that it
refers to our company.

400
00:30:41,094 --> 00:30:43,768
I think we need to look into this matter.

401
00:30:44,609 --> 00:30:47,081
Search for more detailed information
and report it to me.

402
00:30:47,105 --> 00:30:48,105
Yes, sir.

403
00:30:53,681 --> 00:30:54,910
What's going on?

404
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:56,414
Haven't you read it?

405
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:03,088
Unfair employment?

406
00:31:03,949 --> 00:31:05,042
Unfair employment?

407
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,424
Who did it?

408
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:07,775
Show me the post.

409
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,836
I'm curious.

410
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:15,643
Jx Construction can hire you
if you have connections.

411
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:18,770
I know someone who had no
prize in a contest had low grades

412
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:20,715
and didn't study much.

413
00:31:20,739 --> 00:31:22,580
But he's working at this company

414
00:31:22,604 --> 00:31:24,315
because his father has a connection
with an executive.

415
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:26,858
I didn't expect him
to have a powerful supporter.

416
00:31:26,882 --> 00:31:28,289
He just said his parents
ran a small business.

417
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:31,483
Despite how hard I studied the chance
to pass the application process was low.

418
00:31:31,507 --> 00:31:33,216
I get angry and feel wronged.

419
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,805
I hope the company will do justice
to every applicant.

420
00:31:34,829 --> 00:31:37,632
Jx Construction?
It's obvious that it's our company.

421
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:41,235
The user has attached a photo
and screenshot of the chat window.

422
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:43,241
It seems like he failed
to pass the application process

423
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:45,491
although his grade was high.

424
00:31:45,515 --> 00:31:48,876
If it's true, he must've felt wronged.

425
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,683
How can we believe an anonymous comment?

426
00:31:50,707 --> 00:31:52,832
It has a high chance of being a headcanon.

427
00:31:52,856 --> 00:31:54,807
I was also asked the same question.

428
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,697
- What was it?
- Look at this one.

429
00:31:57,721 --> 00:32:00,554
"Your grade is low. What's the reason?"

430
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:03,715
He's saying our company has hired someone
who couldn't ask the question.

431
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,404
I was asked the same question.

432
00:32:05,428 --> 00:32:07,028
What about you?

433
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:09,187
My grade is high.

434
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:11,966
I guess you weren't doing well at college.

435
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,346
I neglected my duties as a student
because I was hooked on hacking.

436
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,655
That's nothing to brad about.

437
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,297
Anyway, is it the
recruitment two years ago?

438
00:32:19,321 --> 00:32:23,044
Yes, but it's a common interview question.

439
00:32:23,068 --> 00:32:25,910
Look at this comment.
This user seems like one of our employees.

440
00:32:25,934 --> 00:32:29,304
It says, 'I know someone acting foolish
who was hired two years ago.

441
00:32:29,328 --> 00:32:32,220
I wonder who he is.

442
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:34,155
Haven't you heard something from colleagues
who were hired at the same time?

443
00:32:34,179 --> 00:32:37,233
Wasn't there someone under suspicion
about how to get hired?

444
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:39,484
I haven't heard anything.
What about you?

445
00:32:42,166 --> 00:32:43,530
I guess she knows something.

446
00:32:43,554 --> 00:32:45,527
Tell me.

447
00:32:45,551 --> 00:32:47,025
It's Mr. Goo Han Soo.

448
00:32:50,806 --> 00:32:51,639
I'm not.

449
00:32:51,663 --> 00:32:54,041
Everyone was wondering

450
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:56,221
whether you had a
connection with the company.

451
00:32:56,245 --> 00:32:59,013
As you know, you made some mistakes
while receiving training.

452
00:32:59,037 --> 00:33:02,450
Each group competed in a memory game.
Your team finished dead last due to you.

453
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:06,647
I was in bad condition
because I had an upset stomach from lunch.

454
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:08,356
Anyway, I don't have a connection.

455
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,458
Really? Are you sure?

456
00:33:10,482 --> 00:33:13,391
I was hired fair and
square with my ability.

457
00:33:13,415 --> 00:33:15,830
Your excuse sounds unconvincing.

458
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:19,784
This post has mushroomed.

459
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:21,479
It can cause trouble.

460
00:33:21,503 --> 00:33:23,787
Some reporters already
left their contact numbers.

461
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:24,871
They want to have
an interview with the company.

462
00:33:24,895 --> 00:33:28,308
When a story goes viral reporters
tend to write an article about it.

463
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:30,302
You're right.

464
00:33:34,442 --> 00:33:36,082
This is Yoon Seo Jin from the Audit Team.

465
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:39,622
What?

466
00:33:40,855 --> 00:33:42,280
Broadcasting company?

467
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:56,494
Has a press release been released?

468
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:00,308
Online newspapers dealing with gossip
have already released news about it.

469
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:03,444
Broadcasters and newspapers have started
to ask for interviews with us.

470
00:34:03,468 --> 00:34:04,889
We should start an investigation

471
00:34:04,913 --> 00:34:07,095
to ascertain whether it
actually happened or not.

472
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:09,388
What about writing a report
to debunk it's wrong?

473
00:34:09,412 --> 00:34:11,829
You tell the press it's groundless.

474
00:34:11,853 --> 00:34:13,354
And start the investigation silently.

475
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:14,523
No, we shouldn't respond like that.

476
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:17,282
We should make it clear that
we're investigating the matter now.

477
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:20,152
If we don't debunk it

478
00:34:21,051 --> 00:34:23,454
the public can think
there was an unfair employment process.

479
00:34:24,718 --> 00:34:26,911
The atmosphere at work isn't good
because we lost the J-BIMS.

480
00:34:26,935 --> 00:34:29,607
This employment-related rumor
can be demanding for us.

481
00:34:29,631 --> 00:34:31,987
What if the rumor is true?

482
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:35,684
Even if we say the rumor is groundless
to avoid gossip

483
00:34:35,708 --> 00:34:38,096
the company can get a blow

484
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,539
if the press finds evidence
of unfair employment.

485
00:34:50,202 --> 00:34:51,562
If you don't mind, I'll get going.

486
00:35:01,815 --> 00:35:04,129
He's so stubborn.

487
00:35:09,822 --> 00:35:13,872
Based on the post
he's expected to be an applicant in 2022.

488
00:35:14,762 --> 00:35:17,551
First, you secure
2022's employment-related documents.

489
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:21,081
Then, schedule the interviews with people
in charge of recruitment.

490
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:26,247
Mr. Goo Han Soo and Ms. Yoon Seo Jin.
I'll rule out you two.

491
00:35:26,271 --> 00:35:28,205
- What?
- Yes, sir.

492
00:35:28,229 --> 00:35:29,616
I'll focus on auditing the finance

493
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,603
and accounting departments
for the next quarter.

494
00:35:31,627 --> 00:35:33,701
Everyone except for two.
Keep up the good work.

495
00:35:33,725 --> 00:35:34,793
Yes, sir.

496
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:40,608
Why are you disappointed?

497
00:35:40,632 --> 00:35:43,986
It's natural to rule out
the interested parties.

498
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:47,492
I know, but it feels like
I've become a criminal.

499
00:35:47,516 --> 00:35:49,473
I also feel like I'm held in suspicion.

500
00:35:49,497 --> 00:35:51,014
Isn't there something
you feel guilty about?

501
00:35:51,038 --> 00:35:52,554
If there is, you'd better spit it out now.

502
00:35:52,578 --> 00:35:56,090
I don't feel guilty.
I was hired by passing the employment exam.

503
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:59,097
Why don't you two be investigated first?

504
00:35:59,121 --> 00:36:02,154
If there isn't any problem
you can ask to return to work.

505
00:36:03,421 --> 00:36:04,845
Can we do that?

506
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:05,833
I agree.

507
00:36:05,857 --> 00:36:07,134
I'll talk to the leader.

508
00:36:07,158 --> 00:36:09,804
You call the personnel department
and make a schedule.

509
00:36:09,828 --> 00:36:10,575
Yes, sir.

510
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:12,910
I know someone in that department.
We can finish the check quickly.

511
00:36:12,934 --> 00:36:13,551
Okay.

512
00:36:13,575 --> 00:36:15,734
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

513
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,126
I heard something happened again.

514
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,048
There's no rest for the company.

515
00:36:35,072 --> 00:36:38,756
I think the CEO can be sacked soon.

516
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,126
What do you think?

517
00:36:41,797 --> 00:36:44,162
You can also be sacked.

518
00:36:44,906 --> 00:36:45,946
Please look forward to it.

519
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:51,069
I'll look forward to it.

520
00:36:57,036 --> 00:36:58,886
He's so arrogant.

521
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:00,454
I don't understand him.

522
00:37:00,478 --> 00:37:03,524
By the way, it'll be interesting

523
00:37:03,548 --> 00:37:06,384
to fire the arrogant one.

524
00:37:17,976 --> 00:37:19,096
Hello.

525
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,399
Please take a seat.

526
00:37:26,487 --> 00:37:28,549
Thank you for your cooperation
although it was a request in a rush.

527
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:30,957
To be honest, I don't feel good.

528
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:34,779
Do you have to make this fuss
due to a post online?

529
00:37:35,788 --> 00:37:38,636
There's already news about it.

530
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:41,684
You'll feel wronged if
you are under suspicion.

531
00:37:41,708 --> 00:37:43,271
We've decided that clearing
up a misunderstanding

532
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,268
through a quick investigation

533
00:37:44,292 --> 00:37:45,523
would be best.

534
00:37:48,848 --> 00:37:52,944
This is the interview video.
These are the evaluation cards.

535
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:55,576
And the personnel and
aptitude test documents.

536
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,708
Thank you.

537
00:37:56,732 --> 00:37:58,145
What about the other data?

538
00:37:58,169 --> 00:38:00,080
There is a bunch of data
about the application process.

539
00:38:00,104 --> 00:38:02,041
We're too busy to bring it here.

540
00:38:02,065 --> 00:38:04,209
You take it yourself.

541
00:38:04,233 --> 00:38:05,343
I see.

542
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,517
She's edgy today.

543
00:38:13,533 --> 00:38:14,649
Where is the data?

544
00:38:14,673 --> 00:38:15,939
It's in the underground archive.

545
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:17,382
I'll go there now.

546
00:38:17,406 --> 00:38:21,302
Okay. I'm going to check the video
and these things first at the office.

547
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:22,603
Yes, sir.

548
00:38:22,627 --> 00:38:24,253
I'm leaving now.

549
00:38:24,277 --> 00:38:27,007
Are you going alone?
There must be a bunch of data.

550
00:38:27,031 --> 00:38:29,055
Why don't you give me a hand?

551
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:31,901
Our team leader told me
not to help you guys. I'm sorry.

552
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,647
You can get the key from the security team.

553
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:35,106
- Excuse me?
- I'm sorry.

554
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,452
Why did she ask if she wouldn't help me?

555
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:57,181
Every department saves the documents here
so the volume is tremendous.

556
00:38:57,205 --> 00:38:59,831
- Feel free to look around.
- Thank you.

557
00:39:04,705 --> 00:39:05,719
Let's do this.

558
00:39:14,344 --> 00:39:16,547
I think your team is going to make a fuss.

559
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:19,718
Hello, Mr. Vice President.

560
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,582
Don't call me like that.

561
00:39:22,606 --> 00:39:24,522
No one is here.
Feel comfortable.

562
00:39:25,778 --> 00:39:27,425
I can't do that. We're at the company.

563
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:30,829
By the way, what brings you here?

564
00:39:31,831 --> 00:39:35,733
Even though I'm the vice president
sometimes, I want to rest.

565
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,507
When on earth will you stop smoking?

566
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:47,774
The stress from trying to quit smoking
is much more harmful.

567
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:51,048
You're always making the same excuse.

568
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:53,761
I'll drop by your house soon.

569
00:39:53,785 --> 00:39:56,187
I'm dying for your mom's galbijjim.

570
00:39:56,905 --> 00:39:58,017
Okay.

571
00:39:58,041 --> 00:39:59,862
Mom will like it
when she hears you like her food.

572
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:01,926
She may be complaining
as saying it's demanding to cook galbijjim.

573
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,021
So, you're the one who wants to eat it.

574
00:40:03,045 --> 00:40:04,320
- Me?
- Yes.

575
00:40:04,344 --> 00:40:05,391
<i>(Yoon Seo Jin)</i>

576
00:40:05,415 --> 00:40:09,556
<i>My goal is to be a project manager</i>

577
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,834
<i>who handles every task.</i>

578
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:13,925
<i>When I become a project manager</i>

579
00:40:13,949 --> 00:40:18,251
<i>I want to experience
managing a project perfectly</i>

580
00:40:18,275 --> 00:40:20,745
from the beginning to the end.

581
00:40:21,976 --> 00:40:23,856
She's a smart woman.
It's no wonder she passed.

582
00:40:25,662 --> 00:40:26,961
By the way, why am I watching the video?

583
00:40:26,985 --> 00:40:30,410
You're the one who
asked me, 'May I help you?'

584
00:40:30,434 --> 00:40:34,092
That was just a courtesy.

585
00:40:35,431 --> 00:40:36,609
Anyway, it's done, right?

586
00:40:36,633 --> 00:40:38,460
Are you kidding?

587
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:40,191
We've still got 100 applicants.

588
00:40:40,215 --> 00:40:42,334
Good luck.

589
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:45,701
Hey. Let's fight.
You're going to pay for this.

590
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:46,927
I'm serious.

591
00:40:46,951 --> 00:40:47,951
Wait.

592
00:40:48,785 --> 00:40:51,767
It's weird. I can't find it.

593
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:52,992
What do you mean?

594
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:00,918
No!

595
00:41:03,005 --> 00:41:04,675
I did personnel and aptitude tests.

596
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:06,300
No one can be hired
without taking the test.

597
00:41:06,324 --> 00:41:08,091
There's no record about it.

598
00:41:08,115 --> 00:41:09,427
No way.

599
00:41:18,255 --> 00:41:21,006
There was a webcam working.
There must be a video.

600
00:41:27,331 --> 00:41:31,125
How could I be here
without taking the test?

601
00:41:31,149 --> 00:41:32,851
That's what I was going to ask you.

602
00:41:33,975 --> 00:41:36,120
Do you think I hacked
the program to get hired?

603
00:41:37,655 --> 00:41:38,789
Did you?

604
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,792
Sir.

605
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,200
You're so mean.

606
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:10,980
Is it possible to hack employment data?

607
00:42:11,004 --> 00:42:12,650
Shouldn't he work for the Natio
if he is that skillful?

608
00:42:12,674 --> 00:42:13,834
Sir, please.

609
00:42:13,858 --> 00:42:16,507
I was just saying.

610
00:42:16,531 --> 00:42:17,774
- Chief Ok.
- Yes.

611
00:42:17,798 --> 00:42:20,037
Visit the agency for the test

612
00:42:20,061 --> 00:42:23,402
- and examine the related data again.
- Yes, sir.

613
00:42:23,426 --> 00:42:25,836
- Please do it right now.
- Yes, sir.

614
00:42:31,356 --> 00:42:32,443
It's weird.

615
00:42:33,163 --> 00:42:33,827
What do you mean?

616
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:36,798
Is he acting like that
because he's worried about Han Soo?

617
00:42:36,822 --> 00:42:38,983
Maybe not. That's the
last thing he would do.

618
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:42,919
He just asked you to do what
should be done. I'm probably right.

619
00:42:42,943 --> 00:42:44,522
He could've fooled me.

620
00:42:47,124 --> 00:42:48,359
Mr. Han Soo.

621
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,495
Hey. Please wait.

622
00:42:57,629 --> 00:42:59,870
You already know Mr. Shin's personality.

623
00:43:00,676 --> 00:43:03,268
I know. I know well.

624
00:43:03,292 --> 00:43:05,125
That's why I'm more disappointed.

625
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:10,288
I thought he had some faith in me.

626
00:43:10,312 --> 00:43:12,803
But I think I was wrong.

627
00:43:12,827 --> 00:43:14,528
He's still had no faith in me.

628
00:43:14,552 --> 00:43:17,576
His belief is to doubt everything.

629
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,744
Is that the right one?

630
00:43:19,768 --> 00:43:21,960
He must feel lonely if he lives like that.

631
00:43:24,432 --> 00:43:27,465
He might've chosen
to live like that on his will.

632
00:43:38,304 --> 00:43:39,624
There are really a bunch of them.

633
00:43:40,324 --> 00:43:42,615
I've found their application forms.

634
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:43,859
I'll check them out right away.

635
00:43:43,883 --> 00:43:45,292
I want to help you

636
00:43:45,316 --> 00:43:48,617
but I should go to the agency
that was in charge of the test.

637
00:43:48,641 --> 00:43:49,630
What?

638
00:43:49,654 --> 00:43:51,265
They already gave
you the test-related data.

639
00:43:51,289 --> 00:43:52,699
I couldn't find Han Soo's results.

640
00:43:52,723 --> 00:43:54,366
What? What are you talking about?

641
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:58,356
Every applicant took the test online
on the same day.

642
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,850
There are everyone's results

643
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:02,309
but I couldn't find Han Soo's.

644
00:44:02,333 --> 00:44:04,111
His results could be omitted.

645
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:07,017
The documents in the
archive were topsy-turvy.

646
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:08,382
It was really hard to find them.

647
00:44:08,406 --> 00:44:09,650
That makes sense.

648
00:44:09,674 --> 00:44:11,702
I'll go to the agency

649
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:14,054
so would you please
find his results in the archive?

650
00:44:14,078 --> 00:44:15,007
Yes, sir.

651
00:44:15,031 --> 00:44:16,947
Then, I should examine these later.

652
00:44:16,971 --> 00:44:18,225
There's no one I can entrust them to now.

653
00:44:18,249 --> 00:44:19,751
Well…

654
00:44:20,748 --> 00:44:22,162
There he is.

655
00:44:22,186 --> 00:44:24,198
Deputy Director Yum,
please take care of it.

656
00:44:24,222 --> 00:44:25,267
- You can do it.
- No.

657
00:44:25,291 --> 00:44:28,365
I can't do it. I'm busy.
I'm going to be very busy.

658
00:44:28,389 --> 00:44:30,070
Excuse me? I won't do it.

659
00:44:30,094 --> 00:44:31,561
Sir.

660
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,207
If you ask me politely, I'll help you.

661
00:44:33,231 --> 00:44:34,566
I'll be back.

662
00:44:37,931 --> 00:44:39,671
It must be my lucky day.

663
00:44:42,157 --> 00:44:43,388
It's weird.

664
00:44:43,412 --> 00:44:46,811
There's no log-in record of Goo Han Soo.

665
00:44:47,517 --> 00:44:48,712
Are you sure?

666
00:44:50,017 --> 00:44:51,017
Yes.

667
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:57,791
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

668
00:44:57,815 --> 00:45:01,437
<i>There's no log-in record of him.</i>

669
00:45:01,461 --> 00:45:03,327
I see. Thank you.

670
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:47,171
You're still clumsy at tailing.

671
00:45:49,474 --> 00:45:51,150
I'm not tailing you.

672
00:45:51,174 --> 00:45:52,543
If not, what are you doing?

673
00:45:55,647 --> 00:45:57,114
Please buy me some drinks.

674
00:46:05,715 --> 00:46:06,791
Are you

675
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:09,894
really suspicious of me?

676
00:46:11,428 --> 00:46:14,365
I thought

677
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:18,028
we'd established some trust.

678
00:46:18,052 --> 00:46:19,237
But

679
00:46:20,868 --> 00:46:22,706
it seems like I'm the
only one who thinks so.

680
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:25,443
Do I look so untrustworthy to you?

681
00:46:29,510 --> 00:46:32,417
I don't trust or distrust you.

682
00:46:33,776 --> 00:46:35,853
I'm just trying to judge you fairly.

683
00:46:37,016 --> 00:46:38,037
I know

684
00:46:39,216 --> 00:46:40,526
I know well.

685
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,360
But

686
00:46:43,076 --> 00:46:47,131
can't you tell me,
'Don't worry. I trust you.'?

687
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:53,303
Don't worry.

688
00:46:59,518 --> 00:47:02,558
Everything will be fine if there's nothing
wrong with the employment process.

689
00:47:04,278 --> 00:47:06,324
Isn't that a given?

690
00:47:06,348 --> 00:47:08,753
I've got nothing but this to say.

691
00:47:23,959 --> 00:47:25,547
Don't try

692
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:28,106
to solve problems alone.

693
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:31,776
I want to be supportive.

694
00:47:54,888 --> 00:47:58,736
I'm very sorry to give
you all this trouble.

695
00:47:59,501 --> 00:48:01,016
But

696
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,268
I'm sad you didn't trust me.

697
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:07,187
I trust you

698
00:48:07,211 --> 00:48:10,581
but you don't trust me.

699
00:48:11,353 --> 00:48:12,621
Get in the taxi.

700
00:48:12,645 --> 00:48:14,585
I'll get in.

701
00:48:16,073 --> 00:48:19,190
You're cold-hearted. Goodbye.

702
00:48:21,204 --> 00:48:22,559
Hello.

703
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:36,440
<i>(Goo Han Soo)</i>

704
00:48:36,464 --> 00:48:41,365
<i>I like the word, "Human
is a social animal."</i>

705
00:48:41,389 --> 00:48:46,358
I think a reliable relationship is
necessary to construct a great building.

706
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:50,549
Constructing a building together for people

707
00:48:50,573 --> 00:48:53,203
is great and valuable.

708
00:48:53,227 --> 00:48:57,695
I've applied to the company
to do such valuable work.

709
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:19,584
Oh, my head.

710
00:49:22,375 --> 00:49:25,734
I'm very sorry to give
you all this trouble.

711
00:49:25,758 --> 00:49:28,268
I trust you

712
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:31,723
but you don't trust me.

713
00:49:31,747 --> 00:49:32,502
Get in the taxi.

714
00:49:32,526 --> 00:49:35,700
You're cold-hearted. Goodbye.

715
00:49:37,251 --> 00:49:39,636
I'm an idiot.

716
00:49:40,505 --> 00:49:41,906
Why did I do that?

717
00:49:51,937 --> 00:49:55,786
I think your results were omitted.
I'll find the documents. So don't worry.

718
00:49:57,318 --> 00:49:58,505
<i>(Assistant Manager Moon)</i>

719
00:50:08,783 --> 00:50:09,566
It's me.

720
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,881
Why are you calling me in a hurry?
What are you impatient for?

721
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:15,011
It's a late hour.

722
00:50:15,035 --> 00:50:16,608
I'm sorry.

723
00:50:16,632 --> 00:50:18,018
Isn't there something I can help?

724
00:50:18,042 --> 00:50:20,778
No way. You're ruled out.

725
00:50:21,668 --> 00:50:23,404
Ah, there's one thing you can help.

726
00:50:23,428 --> 00:50:25,825
Tell me anything.

727
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:28,828
Please tell me you're not involved.
I trust you.

728
00:50:28,852 --> 00:50:32,389
If you tell me you're not
I'll definitely find the documents.

729
00:50:33,279 --> 00:50:36,312
Sir, I'm really not involved.

730
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,796
I really passed the test.

731
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,065
Okay, I see.

732
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:44,450
Thank you.

733
00:50:44,474 --> 00:50:47,351
If you are thankful,
treat me to a fancy meal.

734
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:49,085
I'm busy. I'll hang up now.

735
00:50:49,109 --> 00:50:52,540
Yes. I'll treat you to a fancy one.

736
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:54,711
- Thank you.
- Okay.

737
00:51:14,498 --> 00:51:15,498
Sir.

738
00:51:16,278 --> 00:51:17,468
How did it go?

739
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:21,038
What should we do?
You're in trouble.

740
00:51:22,438 --> 00:51:23,683
Haven't you found it?

741
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:26,485
I've scoured the spacious
archive until 5 a.m.

742
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:29,346
But I couldn't find it.

743
00:51:30,494 --> 00:51:31,682
Then, it can't be helped.

744
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:34,427
Thank you for your hard work.

745
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:36,639
You're really in a pickle.
What should we do?

746
00:51:36,663 --> 00:51:39,223
The truth will be discovered.

747
00:51:39,247 --> 00:51:40,527
I'm fine.

748
00:51:40,551 --> 00:51:41,926
Thank you.

749
00:51:43,738 --> 00:51:45,029
I mean

750
00:51:45,911 --> 00:51:48,198
I pulled it off.

751
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:51,901
Sir!

752
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:53,987
You're so mischievous.

753
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:55,715
Thank you very much.

754
00:51:55,739 --> 00:51:58,297
- Don't forget to treat me to a meal.
- Of course.

755
00:51:58,321 --> 00:52:01,140
I'm sick of thinking about the archive.

756
00:52:01,164 --> 00:52:02,155
Good morning.

757
00:52:02,179 --> 00:52:03,256
What's up?

758
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,356
Good morning.

759
00:52:06,753 --> 00:52:07,850
Here it is.

760
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,693
It's the result
of the personnel and aptitude tests.

761
00:52:09,717 --> 00:52:10,997
Did you find it in the archive?

762
00:52:11,021 --> 00:52:14,034
I had a hard time finding it.

763
00:52:14,058 --> 00:52:15,808
What a relief.

764
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:18,508
- That's a relief.
- Thank you.

765
00:52:18,532 --> 00:52:22,375
It could be dramatic if it turned
out that you hacked the program.

766
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,387
I'll throw it in front of Mr. Shin.

767
00:52:25,411 --> 00:52:27,081
It's weird.

768
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:29,755
Why did the agency
say there isn't your result?

769
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,418
What do you mean?

770
00:52:31,442 --> 00:52:32,679
Well…

771
00:52:32,703 --> 00:52:35,431
The agency didn't find
Han Soo's log-in record.

772
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:39,475
But we found the
result. Isn't it all right?

773
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:41,018
You're right, but…

774
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,115
Good morning.

775
00:52:46,139 --> 00:52:47,395
Sir.

776
00:52:47,419 --> 00:52:49,159
Here is the proof.

777
00:52:55,747 --> 00:52:58,535
Okay. You can return to work.

778
00:53:00,187 --> 00:53:01,193
Yes, sir.

779
00:53:06,379 --> 00:53:08,879
Why do I still feel I'm under suspicion?

780
00:53:09,952 --> 00:53:12,183
Do you want Mr. Shin to apologize to you?

781
00:53:12,207 --> 00:53:15,098
No. But I hope he'll feel sorry for me.

782
00:53:15,122 --> 00:53:16,988
You want so many things.

783
00:53:17,012 --> 00:53:18,237
Right?

784
00:53:23,009 --> 00:53:24,678
That really sounds weird.

785
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,377
- We should go to the personnel department.
- Yes, sir.

786
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:41,039
I know that Ex-leader Yoon Dae Kyung
was in charge of it four years ago.

787
00:53:41,063 --> 00:53:45,058
Didn't you take over
his duties when he left?

788
00:53:45,082 --> 00:53:46,091
No, I didn't.

789
00:53:47,189 --> 00:53:50,076
Do you know that there was an error
in the personnel and aptitude test system?

790
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,900
That was just a minor error.

791
00:53:51,924 --> 00:53:55,138
It turned out that we sent a link late
to a few applicants last year.

792
00:53:55,162 --> 00:53:57,618
So they took the test a day later.

793
00:53:57,642 --> 00:54:01,064
We keep data by date
so we omitted a few applicants

794
00:54:01,088 --> 00:54:02,175
but found them all.

795
00:54:02,199 --> 00:54:04,068
Technically, the Audit Team has found them.

796
00:54:05,277 --> 00:54:07,130
I know, but…

797
00:54:07,154 --> 00:54:09,382
Isn't it okay because we found them all?

798
00:54:09,406 --> 00:54:11,050
There wasn't any unfair employment.

799
00:54:11,074 --> 00:54:13,732
Data management is within audit scope
because it's an important task.

800
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:15,629
Don't take it lightly.

801
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:21,394
The agency has been in charge
of the test for the past four years.

802
00:54:21,418 --> 00:54:25,632
And errors have occurred continuously.
But you haven't checked it out.

803
00:54:25,656 --> 00:54:29,093
I'm going to investigate whether the
selection of the agency was fair or not.

804
00:54:29,954 --> 00:54:33,963
As I mentioned, winning a contract
with them was done before I was assigned.

805
00:54:33,987 --> 00:54:37,290
Why are the documents from four years ago
not in the archive?

806
00:54:37,314 --> 00:54:39,179
I know nothing about it.

807
00:54:39,203 --> 00:54:41,458
Chief Jeon Mi Ryeo
an ex-management manager, also transferred.

808
00:54:41,482 --> 00:54:43,082
So it's hard to figure
out what happened now.

809
00:54:43,106 --> 00:54:46,106
Isn't there a problem with the department's
process when taking over duties?

810
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:47,620
That is not…

811
00:54:47,644 --> 00:54:51,760
Check out where the employment-related
documents from 2020 to 2023 are.

812
00:54:51,784 --> 00:54:54,784
And find every document
about placing an order

813
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:56,487
and winning a contract with the agency.

814
00:54:57,551 --> 00:54:59,623
Aren't you going too far?

815
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:01,958
You said the unfair employment happened
two years ago.

816
00:55:01,982 --> 00:55:06,272
Isn't asking for documents from four
years ago exceeding your authority?

817
00:55:06,296 --> 00:55:09,432
It's an investigation to solve the
errors in the personnel system.

818
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,069
Please cooperate with the investigation.

819
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:23,063
Isn't it too much
to examine four years of documents?

820
00:55:23,087 --> 00:55:25,781
We're lucky to check this system.

821
00:55:25,805 --> 00:55:28,027
If it were another one we would have
to examine ten years of documents.

822
00:55:28,051 --> 00:55:29,666
I'm destined to work a lot in life.

823
00:55:29,690 --> 00:55:31,108
The amount of one year of documents is big.

824
00:55:31,132 --> 00:55:33,690
Examining these four years of documents
will take forever.

825
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:39,803
Can I be of any help?

826
00:55:39,827 --> 00:55:41,358
There are about the employees
hired at the same time as you.

827
00:55:41,382 --> 00:55:42,913
You'd better not be involved in it.

828
00:55:42,937 --> 00:55:45,378
Then, I'll leave now.

829
00:55:45,402 --> 00:55:46,823
What? You can't go home.

830
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,481
Can't you see your
superiors are working now?

831
00:55:48,505 --> 00:55:50,407
Okay, you can go home. Goodbye.

832
00:55:51,892 --> 00:55:53,234
Goodbye.

833
00:55:53,258 --> 00:55:54,911
See you tomorrow.

834
00:55:56,392 --> 00:55:59,158
Excuse me. Why don't we let them do this?
It turns out they're innocent.

835
00:55:59,182 --> 00:56:03,132
What if somebody complains about it?
All our efforts could go down the drain.

836
00:56:03,156 --> 00:56:04,827
We'll entrust the task of finding a forgery
with a forgery-specialized company.

837
00:56:04,851 --> 00:56:09,944
We'll compare the scores on the cards
with the computerized scores.

838
00:56:09,968 --> 00:56:11,762
Keep up the good work.

839
00:56:13,523 --> 00:56:15,854
Where are the other documents?

840
00:56:15,878 --> 00:56:17,981
I guess they are in the archives
of Gyeonggi-do or Incheon.

841
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:19,406
We're trying to find where they are.

842
00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:20,513
Why are these scattered?

843
00:56:20,537 --> 00:56:23,125
The ex-leader and chief
of the personnel department

844
00:56:23,149 --> 00:56:25,753
didn't hand over their duties well
when they transferred.

845
00:56:25,777 --> 00:56:29,613
The Audit Team and
my mind are all in a stew.

846
00:56:31,995 --> 00:56:33,191
I can't believe he's sleeping.

847
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,852
Excuse me. Are you sleeping?

848
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:41,030
There is too much to
examine. I'm a bit tired.

849
00:56:41,054 --> 00:56:42,619
Take a rest for a while.

850
00:56:42,643 --> 00:56:44,372
You must be sleepy
because you were up all night.

851
00:56:44,396 --> 00:56:46,684
- Drink some coffee.
- Okay.

852
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,866
I'll be back after getting some fresh air.

853
00:56:50,528 --> 00:56:52,052
I also want to drink some coffee…

854
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,338
Where are you going?
Will you stay up all night?

855
00:56:56,101 --> 00:56:58,585
- Do you forget that I'm your superior?
- No, I don't.

856
00:56:58,609 --> 00:56:59,889
- Do you know that?
- Of course.

857
00:56:59,913 --> 00:57:01,487
- You act like you don't know.
- I know.

858
00:57:01,511 --> 00:57:02,712
So, keep up the good work.

859
00:57:05,745 --> 00:57:07,685
I'm sorry to go home earlier than them.

860
00:57:09,791 --> 00:57:11,955
There's nothing we can do to help them.

861
00:57:12,711 --> 00:57:13,712
I know.

862
00:57:14,478 --> 00:57:17,079
Do you think there was
an unfair employment?

863
00:57:17,103 --> 00:57:19,765
I think it just happened
due to insufficient management.

864
00:57:19,789 --> 00:57:23,212
I also hope there wasn't any unfair
employment but we need to investigate it.

865
00:57:23,236 --> 00:57:26,171
If we find the documents
we will have much work waiting for us.

866
00:57:27,286 --> 00:57:30,281
So take a deep rest when you can.

867
00:57:30,305 --> 00:57:31,557
Okay.

868
00:57:36,196 --> 00:57:38,215
I'll leave first. See you tomorrow.

869
00:57:39,663 --> 00:57:40,751
Goodbye.

870
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:57,601
I think your brother will recover
his consciousness soon.

871
00:57:59,857 --> 00:58:00,886
What?

872
00:58:06,592 --> 00:58:07,687
Are you serious?

873
00:58:07,711 --> 00:58:10,882
He opened his eyes for a bit of a moment.

874
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:13,683
- What a relief!
- Yes.

875
00:58:14,463 --> 00:58:16,654
You're right. I'm so relieved.

876
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:21,558
It's good news.

877
00:58:27,879 --> 00:58:29,432
I'm in trouble.

878
00:58:29,456 --> 00:58:32,708
They'll investigate unfair employment
from four years ago.

879
00:58:32,732 --> 00:58:35,205
Yes, that was when I took the test.

880
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:37,774
What should I do?

881
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:40,477
Damn it.

882
00:58:44,273 --> 00:58:45,538
Ancle?

883
00:58:45,562 --> 00:58:47,484
Hey, you're here.

884
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:50,420
Why are you wandering outside?

885
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:57,589
I only smoke three pieces of it.
Keep it secret from your mom.

886
00:58:57,613 --> 00:59:01,747
Well. You first should
get rid of the cigarette smell.

887
00:59:03,330 --> 00:59:07,337
If your mom says there's some smell
you insist that you have no idea.

888
00:59:08,276 --> 00:59:09,276
Let's go.

889
00:59:10,169 --> 00:59:11,417
What's the password?

890
00:59:11,441 --> 00:59:13,881
You don't need to press a password.
You can enter with a card.

891
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,284
Galbijjim is on its way.

892
00:59:26,790 --> 00:59:27,824
Hurry up and eat.

893
00:59:29,563 --> 00:59:30,627
It looks delicious.

894
00:59:31,963 --> 00:59:33,031
How is it?

895
00:59:33,943 --> 00:59:37,546
It's very good.
I really wanted to eat it.

896
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:38,511
Enjoy it.

897
00:59:38,535 --> 00:59:40,880
- Bon appetit.
- You, too.

898
00:59:40,904 --> 00:59:44,260
The green onion kimchi is fermented well.
I'll get it now.

899
00:59:44,284 --> 00:59:45,884
Green onion kimchi is the best.

900
00:59:48,791 --> 00:59:50,981
Don't you smell some cigarettes?

901
00:59:52,111 --> 00:59:53,414
Cigarettes?

902
00:59:53,438 --> 00:59:54,821
I don't think so.

903
00:59:54,845 --> 00:59:55,895
Do you…

904
00:59:55,919 --> 00:59:58,922
What are you talking about?
I quit smoking a long time ago. Right?

905
01:00:00,652 --> 01:00:02,715
I can only smell galbijjim.

906
01:00:02,739 --> 01:00:03,893
Really?

907
01:00:05,579 --> 01:00:07,497
- I'll get the kimchi.
- Okay.

908
01:00:11,884 --> 01:00:13,459
She has a sensitive nose.

909
01:00:15,064 --> 01:00:16,773
- Is there a cigarette smell?
- A lot.

910
01:00:22,227 --> 01:00:25,215
It's good, right?
It's the dish your mom can make the best.

911
01:00:34,466 --> 01:00:36,353
<i>(I'll tell you the truth about JU)</i>

912
01:00:38,426 --> 01:00:40,346
<i>(I happened to see them
I still have shaky hands)</i>

913
01:00:41,093 --> 01:00:43,493
<i>(The man is the Vice President.
(The woman is an employee of…)</i>

914
01:00:44,166 --> 01:00:45,954
<i>(They should find out
about their relationship)</i>

915
01:00:45,978 --> 01:00:47,566
<i>(before investigating
unfair employment)</i>

916
01:00:52,455 --> 01:00:54,316
<i>(Upload)</i>

917
01:00:54,340 --> 01:01:00,480
<i>(I'll tell you the truth
about JU Construction's unfair employment)</i>

918
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:08,793
<i>(I'll tell you the truth
about JU Construction's unfair employment)</i>

919
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:15,810
<i>(Vice President)</i>

920
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,943
<i>(The woman is an
employee of the Audit Team)</i>

921
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:33,547
<i>(The Auditors)</i>

922
01:01:54,295 --> 01:01:57,618
Isn't it a problem that the Vice President
is close to a female employee?

923
01:01:57,642 --> 01:01:59,218
Investigate it again right now.

924
01:01:59,242 --> 01:02:02,992
Did the Vice President pull the strings
to help you get hired?

925
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:04,257
Where is Yoon Seo Jin?

926
01:02:04,281 --> 01:02:06,292
If you don't cooperate
you're just aggravating the doubt.

927
01:02:06,316 --> 01:02:08,785
And that makes her have a much harder time.

928
01:02:08,809 --> 01:02:09,599
It's an external audit.

929
01:02:09,623 --> 01:02:11,272
It's the president's call.

930
01:02:11,296 --> 01:02:13,534
I'm curious about one thing.

931
01:02:13,558 --> 01:02:16,335
Are you a hunting dog or a wolf?

932
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:19,338
Seo Jin is your team member.
Will you just sit back and do nothing?

933
01:02:19,362 --> 01:02:20,630
Get off me.

934
01:02:21,436 --> 01:02:23,934
I'll keep investigating
the unfair employment.

935
01:02:23,958 --> 01:02:26,536
I'll find it. Definitely.
