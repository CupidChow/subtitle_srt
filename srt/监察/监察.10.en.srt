00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:03,956
Hey. What brings you here?

4
00:01:05,752 --> 00:01:07,801
Why did you do that?

5
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,001
What are you talking about?

6
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:10,262
Why did you…

7
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,266
post the picture?

8
00:01:14,458 --> 00:01:16,261
Hey…

9
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,548
What do you mean by that suddenly?

10
00:01:19,572 --> 00:01:21,274
You posted

11
00:01:22,278 --> 00:01:23,675
Seo Jin's pictures.

12
00:01:24,865 --> 00:01:29,115
I discovered the IP address that
left a comment on the anonymous bulletin.

14
00:01:32,213 --> 00:01:34,696
The IP address indicates this neighborhood.

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,065
It's near our company
and there are many studios.

16
00:01:37,089 --> 00:01:39,267
Many of the company's employees live here.

17
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:41,971
Several employees live in the
small apartment building where I live.

18
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:43,994
You've got the wrong person.

19
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:47,467
Then why did you come
to my house on that day?

20
00:01:48,251 --> 00:01:49,535
Seo Jin…

21
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:52,137

Mr. Assistant Manager

23
00:02:01,285 --> 00:02:02,648
why did you set her up?

24
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,288
That is because…

29
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:42,619
I think communication skills

30
00:02:42,643 --> 00:02:45,780
and the ability to gather information
are the most important.

31
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:47,798
Okay.

32
00:02:47,822 --> 00:02:49,140
Hey.

33
00:02:49,164 --> 00:02:50,993
What? Did you go to Daesung University?

34
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:54,773
- Yes, sir.
- We went to the same University.

35
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:56,913
It was a long time ago.

36
00:02:56,937 --> 00:02:58,603
You remind me of my old days.

37
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,011
That was a hopeless experience.

38
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,876
I had high grades and great qualifications.

39
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,519
My educational background was
why I failed to get hired

40
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,889
so I wanted to prove it.

If I had failed again,

45
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:37,736
I would've considered the
reason to be my insufficient ability.

46
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,895
But I passed.

47
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:52,916
This is Moon Sang Ho
who will work with us starting today.

48
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,326
I'll work hard.

49
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,597
I felt guilty about it.

50
00:04:00,287 --> 00:04:01,710
So I worked harder than anyone.

51
00:04:01,734 --> 00:04:04,590
This is what you've asked.

52
00:04:04,614 --> 00:04:05,630
And I realized that...

53
00:04:05,654 --> 00:04:06,681
Good job.

54
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,761

55
00:04:07,785 --> 00:04:09,121
- You did a good job.
- Thank you.

I just didn't have a chance to prove it.

57
00:04:11,632 --> 00:04:12,811
Unfair employment?

58
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:15,901
I was afraid when I saw the post.

59
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:17,955
Based on the post, he's expected to be…

60
00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:21,575
But, I was relieved by the fact that
the target was employees

61
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:23,390
hired in 2022.

62
00:04:23,414 --> 00:04:25,904
That's why I tried hard
to find Han Soo's test results.

63
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:27,064
I've found it.

64
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,917
I cared about Han Soo because I thought

65
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,804
we were similar in many ways.

66
00:04:31,828 --> 00:04:34,477
Isn't it too much
to examine four years of documents?

67
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:37,946
We must find the 2020's documents.

68
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,739
Yes, sir. I'll find it.

69
00:04:39,763 --> 00:04:42,492
When I was included in the audit scope

70
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,852
I couldn't stand the anxiety.

71
00:04:44,876 --> 00:04:48,099
Finding the fact that the diploma
was fabricated was a matter of time.

72
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:50,652
She may be complaining.

73
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:53,285
That was when I saw
Seo Jin and the Vice President.

74
00:04:54,409 --> 00:04:56,919
I'll go first. See you tomorrow.

75
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:58,257
Goodbye.

76
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:04,233
She and the Vice
President were like a family.

77
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:06,929
But I couldn't come up with another plan.

78
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:09,244
I'm sorry for Seo Jin

79
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:11,971
but I thought the post would turn
people's attention to her

80
00:05:12,721 --> 00:05:16,317
and change the audit object.

81
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:17,324
But…

82
00:05:17,348 --> 00:05:18,792
We'll keep investigating unfair employment.

83
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:22,323
I found something suspicious
in the post about Mrs. Yoon Seo Jin.

84
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:24,290
As you kept investigating.

85
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:26,010
Hey, Isn't it this?

86
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,921
My mind was possessed by the thought
of stealing the documents.

87
00:05:30,696 --> 00:05:32,591
The documents are gone.

88
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:39,884
You drive a car and take Mr. Shin
and Vice President to the company.

89
00:05:39,908 --> 00:05:40,941
I'll follow you.

90
00:06:24,203 --> 00:06:26,323
Hey. Thugs took…

91
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:28,480
the documents away.

92
00:06:30,371 --> 00:06:32,717
Hey, are you okay?

93
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:39,924
I'm sorry.

94
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:44,030
I'm very sorry.

95
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,535
I must've been out of my mind.

96
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:54,150
I'm very sorry.

97
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:55,850
Where's the document?

98
00:06:55,874 --> 00:06:57,142
It's at my home.

99
00:06:57,847 --> 00:06:59,644
I couldn't burn it.

100
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,282
I knew it would be an irreparable mistake
if I burned it.

101
00:07:07,087 --> 00:07:08,954
Sir, I'm sorry.

102
00:07:10,147 --> 00:07:11,790
I'm very sorry.

00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:13,825

00:07:18,421 --> 00:07:20,101
You've violated the personnel regulations.

106
00:07:20,827 --> 00:07:22,771
You'll get disciplinary
action and dismissal.

I don't even deserve
to ask for your forgiveness.

110

I'm very sorry.

111
00:07:35,881 --> 00:07:37,482
I'm very sorry.

00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:41,086
I'm sorry.

113
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:44,790
Go get the documents.

114
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,897
Let's go.

115
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:22,294
I've found it.

116
00:08:24,384 --> 00:08:27,766
Only Ms. Jeong's score was changed.

00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:28,052
There wasn't anything wrong
with her recruitment process.

127
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:29,737
Didn't you say there
was a financial dealing?

128
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:32,131
You said that the Vice President bought
an apartment for her.

129
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,632
I've also investigated it.

130
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:35,701
Tell me in detail.

131
00:09:38,455 --> 00:09:40,372
I used to live in poor
residential conditions.

132
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:45,184
The house was worn out

133
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,012
and flooded once.

134
00:09:48,741 --> 00:09:52,083
The Vice President saw it
and bought an apartment for us.

135
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:57,031
But I couldn't get it
so I wrote him an IOU.

136
00:09:57,055 --> 00:10:00,191
I'm still paying back
the principal and interest.

137
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:02,461
I've checked the IOU out.

138
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:06,618
So, isn't there anything wrong?

139
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:07,642
No, there wasn't.

140
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,788
The result is shocking.

141
00:10:14,812 --> 00:10:16,617
Right. I didn't expect it to be like this.

142
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:19,435
Assistant Manager Jeong Hye Young
and Moon Sang Ho were dismissed.

143
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,797
Yoon Seo Jin was doing nothing wrong.

144
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:23,014
I heard she got hired on her own.

145
00:10:23,961 --> 00:10:26,561
Are Assistant Manager Jeong's father
and Director Seo friends?

146
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,367
I heard that her father is a big player
in Jongnam City.

147
00:10:30,391 --> 00:10:31,833
He also has the power.

148
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:35,206
They must've known each other while
participating in a redevelopment business.

149
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,526
So, he hired thugs to steal the documents.

150
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,365
It's a bit scary.

151
00:10:41,252 --> 00:10:43,811
Don't you know who is really scary?

152
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,054
It's Moon Sang Ho.

153
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:48,117
How dare he set the Vice President up?

154
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:50,985
I didn't know he was like that.

155
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:55,123
Anyway, your team did a nice job.

156
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:59,209
They made up for their mistake
although it didn't help that much.

157
00:10:59,233 --> 00:11:02,065
I have no idea what's going on.

158
00:11:02,089 --> 00:11:03,346
Don't you get it?

159
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,825
Mr. Shin pulled the rug
from under the president.

160
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:18,925
You've got an eye for

Don't pretend you don't care.

163
00:11:34,619 --> 00:11:35,642

00:11:41,893 --> 00:11:44,903
I already cleared Seo Jin of false rumors.
You're late to the party.

167
00:11:44,927 --> 00:11:47,141
I have other good news.

168
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:50,881
We've won a contract for the construction
of the Cheongyang Sports Complex.

169
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:52,176
- Really?
- Yes.

170
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,596
I've got a call from Cheongyang City Hall.

171
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,985
So, I've written a press release like this.

172
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,587
Why don't you read this?

173
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,216
This is the headline.

174
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,926
It's like the Vice President is a hero
for winning the contract.

175
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:08,286
It's a new breakthrough for the company

176
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,466
which was damaged hard
by the J-BIMS leakage accident.

177
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,926

00:12:25,056 --> 00:12:26,099
Yes.

183
00:12:28,669 --> 00:12:30,199
What?

184
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,238
When was it?

185
00:12:32,369 --> 00:12:33,420
I see.

186
00:12:37,376 --> 00:12:39,139
Sir.

187
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:42,621
Did something happen?

188
00:13:07,939 --> 00:13:09,872
<i>(Moon Sang Ho)</i>

189
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,112
Are you out of your mind?

190
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,763
Do you want to cause harm to others
until the end?

191
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,953
I'm finished.

192
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,556
I'm really finished.

193
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,595
Then, I'm finished.

194
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,736
You're not finished.

195
00:14:38,573 --> 00:14:40,271
You can start again.

196
00:14:42,513 --> 00:14:46,211
Start from the beginning.

197
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:51,149
If you really expiate your wrong
you can start from the beginning.

198
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:56,688
I believe you can do it.

199
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,428
Sir.

200
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:07,265
I'm very sorry.

201
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:35,668
This is Shin Cha Il.

202
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,863
Sir, we have a problem.

203
00:15:49,874 --> 00:15:52,690
Did Ms. Jeong Hye
Young try to kill herself?

204
00:15:52,714 --> 00:15:53,564
Sir.

205
00:15:53,588 --> 00:15:55,923
We also heard it from
the personnel department.

206
00:15:55,947 --> 00:15:58,130
They found her fell on the floor
after taking pills.

207
00:15:58,154 --> 00:15:59,970
How is she?

208
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:01,653
She looked unconscious.

209
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,265
Where is she now?

210
00:16:04,289 --> 00:16:06,358
They said they'd go to
Nasun General Hospital.

211
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:13,378
<i>(Nasun General Hospital)</i>

212
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:17,766
You're here.

213
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,371
Has he recovered his consciousness?

214
00:16:28,211 --> 00:16:29,607
Hey.

215
00:16:29,631 --> 00:16:30,982
It's me.

216
00:16:32,418 --> 00:16:33,752
Can you recognize me?

217
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:38,934
Still, he hasn't recovered
his consciousness perfectly.

218
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,626
His condition will be stabilized soon.

219
00:16:42,331 --> 00:16:43,771
What a relief.

220
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,998
When he regains his consciousness

221
00:16:46,022 --> 00:16:48,934
we can kick that one out of the company.

222
00:16:49,828 --> 00:16:51,436
Who do you want to kick out?

223
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:56,086
What brings you here?

224
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,378
I should come. Aren't I a family member?

225
00:16:58,402 --> 00:17:00,464
You've never visited before.

226
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:02,018
Why did you come today?

227
00:17:02,042 --> 00:17:03,352
You wanted him to be dead.

228
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:06,398
Are you sad that
he's recovered his consciousness?

229
00:17:06,422 --> 00:17:09,263
It's not a problem that a younger brother
comes to see his older brother.

230
00:17:09,287 --> 00:17:11,031
You must've had happy days

231
00:17:11,055 --> 00:17:14,635
because you were like
a king at the company.

232
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,262
Hey.

233
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,463
I'm happy that he's returned to himself.

234
00:17:19,179 --> 00:17:20,642
You can see that I'm smiling.

235
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:26,004
Laugh as much as you want because
the days you can laugh are numbered.

236
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:29,841
When my husband returns to the company

237
00:17:30,681 --> 00:17:33,045
you'll be damned.

238
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:38,516
I knew that I wouldn't be welcomed.

239
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,863
But you always treat me as a stranger.

240
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,321
I see that he's okay. So, I'll go off.

241
00:17:46,147 --> 00:17:49,003
Take care of yourself.

242
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,361
I'll wait for you at the company.

243
00:17:58,502 --> 00:18:01,839
Isn't the Audit Team leader incompetent
enough not to kick him out?

244
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,449
When the knife becomes blunt
you should throw it.

245
00:18:06,049 --> 00:18:07,912
There are plenty of knives you can use.

246
00:18:09,035 --> 00:18:10,247
Wait a minute, please.

247
00:18:18,922 --> 00:18:19,933
Hey.

248
00:18:23,109 --> 00:18:25,138
I don't want to hear more nitpicking.

249
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:26,497
What's your purpose?

250
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,176
What do you mean?

251
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,768
If you were me, could you believe my word?

252
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:35,173
Right. We aren't close enough
to care for each other.

253
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:40,978
But I sometimes mistake us for a family.

254
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,792
I won't mistake our relationship again.

255
00:18:44,816 --> 00:18:46,117
You must be impatient.

256
00:18:47,529 --> 00:18:49,520
You must've thought you were ahead of me.

257
00:18:50,982 --> 00:18:52,490
But Brother regained consciousness.

258
00:18:54,496 --> 00:18:55,727
You're totally boggled

259
00:18:58,709 --> 00:19:00,565
because you're alone.

260
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,378
Are you happy that you
have your side again?

261
00:19:05,402 --> 00:19:10,107
You must be happy with the thought
of stamping on me with your brother again.

262
00:19:12,645 --> 00:19:14,481
Suit yourself.

263
00:19:14,505 --> 00:19:16,414
But you'd better brace yourself.

264
00:19:46,353 --> 00:19:47,378
Who are you?

265
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:50,323
We're JU's Audit Team.

266
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:53,285
We want to see
Assistant Manager Jeong Hye Young.

267
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:55,887
The Audit Team?

268
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,883
Is it you?

269
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:03,037
Are you the one
who made our daughter like that?

270
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,863
I'm Shin Cha Il, the Audit Team leader.

271
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:10,983
- Is she all right?
- All right?

272
00:20:11,007 --> 00:20:13,997
She tried to kill herself at the company.

273
00:20:14,021 --> 00:20:18,097
I heard you bullied and forced
her into making a false confession.

274
00:20:18,121 --> 00:20:19,697
It's a good place.

275
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:23,357
I'll kill you and hold
a funeral for you here.

276
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:25,757
What's wrong with you?
Please calm down.

277
00:20:25,781 --> 00:20:28,857
It's your daughter who committed a crime.

278
00:20:28,881 --> 00:20:30,731
A crime? What crime?

279
00:20:30,755 --> 00:20:32,833
You requested Director Seo
for unfair employment.

280
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,980
Then, our daughter deserved to die?

281
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:37,693
Tell me. Does she deserve to die?

282
00:20:37,717 --> 00:20:39,146
No. I mean…

283
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,191
We also want to figure out
the truth of the case.

284
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:42,521
Please don't act recklessly.

285
00:20:42,545 --> 00:20:44,668
Recklessly?

286
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:50,488
Isn't the audit
by this kind of murderer reckless?

287
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:54,421
I don't want to talk with them
so tell them to leave.

288
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:55,841
Did you hear her?

289
00:20:55,865 --> 00:20:58,282
I don't want to talk with you. So get lost!

290
00:20:59,532 --> 00:21:01,281
I see.

291
00:21:01,305 --> 00:21:03,154
I'll be back when she calms down.

292
00:21:14,901 --> 00:21:16,034
Is everything okay?

293
00:21:18,341 --> 00:21:19,904
Is there someone who dropped by?

294
00:21:22,574 --> 00:21:24,630
There's no need to worry about it.

295
00:21:24,654 --> 00:21:26,978
Something will happen soon.
So, please stand by.

296
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,280
I'll contact you again.

297
00:21:45,734 --> 00:21:47,599
Tell Mr. Shin to come to me.

298
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,443
Assistant Manager Jeong's family
complained that

299
00:21:54,467 --> 00:21:57,976
you had forcefully investigated her
while auditing.

300
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,221
I can't admit that.

301
00:22:01,245 --> 00:22:03,857
I'll talk to them about it.

302
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:06,851
They don't want to meet you in person.

303
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,392
That's not important now.

304
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:18,653
I barely persuaded them
not to report it to the press.

305
00:22:18,677 --> 00:22:19,677
So

306
00:22:20,537 --> 00:22:22,073
I'll start an audit.

307
00:22:22,097 --> 00:22:23,801
I'll start to investigate to
discover the truth.

308
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:27,905
No. It's an audit about you.

309
00:22:30,277 --> 00:22:33,811
They want me to discipline you.

310
00:22:34,883 --> 00:22:36,947
You'll be excluded from
your duties for a while.

311
00:22:40,508 --> 00:22:43,177
Don't you forget the special provision
of the contract?

312
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,956
It's an audit as a mere formality.

313
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:49,777
Isn't it you who forget that

314
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,762
there's a condition for that provision?

315
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:57,468
Who's going to take charge of the audit?

316
00:23:00,076 --> 00:23:01,773
You have already met her before.

317
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:11,129
I wanted to meet you again but I
didn't expect you to be an audit object.

318
00:23:11,153 --> 00:23:12,796
Let's start.

319
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,586
Yes. I'll start right away.

320
00:23:16,846 --> 00:23:20,196
Why did you order thugs to steal
the recruitment-related documents?

321
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,857
I can bring the person
who appeared on the recording

322
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:24,076
and make you and him confront each other.

323
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,998
It must be your dad.
Please show me your phone.

324
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,385
You pushed her to answer the question
without proof.

325
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,478
Do you admit it?

326
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:33,235
The situation pointed out that
she was the suspect.

327
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:34,905
And it turned out to be true.

328
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,414
What did you do from 11 to 12
on the 21st of March?

329
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:44,467
Why did you post
Ms. Yoon Seon Jin's pictures?

330
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:47,147
So, you took pictures secretly
and uploaded them, right?

331
00:23:47,171 --> 00:23:50,165
You pushed her to
confess what she didn't do.

332
00:23:50,189 --> 00:23:51,889
Do you admit it?

333
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,923
At that time…
The situation was like she was the suspect.

334
00:23:58,947 --> 00:24:00,231
Well.

335
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,616
The investigation
relying only on a situation

336
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:07,723
could be pushy and violent.

337
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:08,940
Don't you think so?

338
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,243
I knew he would be in trouble one day.

339
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:21,476
He was too pushy.

340
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,463
You're going too far.

341
00:24:23,487 --> 00:24:25,465
Are you on Ms. Jeong's side?

342
00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:30,650
I mean. Mr. Shin must've lashed out at her
too much to make her try to kill herself.

343
00:24:30,674 --> 00:24:34,290
She didn't admit her guilt.

344
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:37,901
I don't think Mr. Shin was pushy enough
to get audited.

345
00:24:39,147 --> 00:24:43,707
There's no one who did well this time.
You got it?

346
00:24:52,372 --> 00:24:56,659
Submit all audit materials that
Mr. Shin was in charge of.

347
00:24:56,683 --> 00:24:58,514
What? All the materials?

348
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:00,941
Please be hurry. I want to
check them at least in the evening.

349
00:25:00,965 --> 00:25:04,304
You'll be excluded from
your duties for a while.

350
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:05,931
I know.

351
00:25:05,955 --> 00:25:07,031
See you tomorrow.

352
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,804
Prepare the materials Ms. Seo requested.

353
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:16,725
And please prepare
the quarterly audit well.

354
00:25:16,749 --> 00:25:17,775
I'll go off first.

355
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Sir.

356
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:23,180
Sir.

357
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,204
Is it true?

358
00:25:36,228 --> 00:25:37,764
Yes.

359
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:40,364
My dad has already made
a secret investigation into him.

360
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:42,584
Someone was dead due to him.

361
00:25:42,608 --> 00:25:45,703
How could a person like him
be an audit team leader?

362
00:25:46,621 --> 00:25:48,539
I'm a victim, too.

363
00:25:58,404 --> 00:26:00,280
It's okay.

364
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:01,560
I'm about to wrap it up.

365
00:26:01,584 --> 00:26:03,660
Yes.

366
00:26:03,684 --> 00:26:06,200
Hello. I'm Gong Chae Yeon.

367
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:09,280
Ah, you found Ms.
Jeong first when she fell.

368
00:26:09,304 --> 00:26:10,560
Have you come here to see Ms. Jeong?

369
00:26:10,584 --> 00:26:14,060
Yes. I want to see if she's okay.

370
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:15,700
And to give her her items.

371
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,904
Are you done?

372
00:26:18,928 --> 00:26:20,346
I want to take a rest a bit.

373
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,439
I'm done. Take care of yourself.

374
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,485
I'm happy that Mr. Shin is in trouble.

375
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,895
He's been acting snobbish.

376
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:40,322
Sir.

377
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:43,775
Who will be happy
if the ex-president regains consciousness?

378
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,181
Is Mr. President's presidency on the line?

379
00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:47,822
Or is the Vice President's position
on the line?

380
00:26:47,846 --> 00:26:50,989
Both of them are doing
all the best they can.

381
00:26:51,013 --> 00:26:57,273
But the Vice President was a pain
in their family's neck.

382
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,000
Particularly

383
00:26:59,024 --> 00:27:04,386
the ex-president's wife is crazy
about kicking him out of the company.

384
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,394
What's the reason?

385
00:27:05,418 --> 00:27:08,659
She hates his family tree.

386
00:27:08,683 --> 00:27:10,872
Then, Mr. Vice President
could be kicked out.

387
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:13,226
Shouldn't we stand on Mr. President's side?

388
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,235
Use your brain.

389
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,259
Listen carefully.

390
00:27:16,283 --> 00:27:18,428
The ex-president can't come back
to the company soon

391
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:20,374
although he has regained consciousness.

392
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:22,263
The chance is low.

393
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:23,477
Then what should he do?

394
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:28,063
I think he will nominate someone
and support him for his own good.

395
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:29,623
Isn't it a bad situation
for Mr. Vice President?

396
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,686
Hey. Put yourself in
the ex-president's shoes.

397
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,891
One failed a 50 billion won project
and to win a contract.

398
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:43,159
But the other one won a contract
of 400 billion for construction

399
00:27:43,183 --> 00:27:45,464
and is about to win a
redevelopment contract.

400
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:47,738
Who will you nominate?

401
00:27:47,762 --> 00:27:50,294
Yeah, I understand now.

402
00:27:52,188 --> 00:27:53,497
So

403
00:27:55,075 --> 00:28:00,388
In times like this, we should be
far-sighted and show which side we're on.

404
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:03,011
It's a tip. As you know, I've
gone through many hardships.

405
00:28:03,035 --> 00:28:04,117
Keep it in mind.

406
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,531
Sir.

407
00:28:05,555 --> 00:28:08,231
You're so sure of yourself.

408
00:28:08,255 --> 00:28:09,165
Do you have secret information?

409
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:14,318
I don't have it, but
I'll check it out today.

410
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,022
I can see

411
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,759
who gets the leverage.

412
00:28:34,334 --> 00:28:35,428
Mr. President.

413
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:39,374
Director Lee isn't available today
because he plans

414
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:40,798
to meet up with the Vice President.

415
00:28:52,334 --> 00:28:56,536
Thank you for your hard work.

416
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:00,630
I'll reconstruct the JU Construction
that is in crisis.

417
00:29:00,654 --> 00:29:05,863
So, please have faith in me
and work hard for more time.

418
00:29:05,887 --> 00:29:08,343
Cheers to JU!

419
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:10,541
Cheers!

420
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,212
Please give a round of applause.

421
00:29:18,227 --> 00:29:20,343
I'll pour a drink for you.

422
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:22,330
- Thank you for your hard work.
- It's all thanks to you.

423
00:29:22,354 --> 00:29:25,557
- You did a good job.
- Thank you.

424
00:29:25,581 --> 00:29:27,491
- Go for it!
- Go for it!

425
00:29:29,338 --> 00:29:30,934
Sir.

426
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:34,540
If you win this redevelopment contract

427
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,140
the presidency is yours.

428
00:29:37,164 --> 00:29:38,167
Right.

429
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:42,307
Let's burn the bull's horn this time.
And pull it completely.

430
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:46,477
We should get it done before the
ex-president comes back to the company.

431
00:29:47,908 --> 00:29:49,691
Why are you bringing that up?

432
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:51,351
I'm sorry.

433
00:29:51,375 --> 00:29:53,451
- Just drink.
- Yes, sir.

434
00:30:30,289 --> 00:30:30,639
<i>(Meeting room)</i>

435
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:33,359
On March 5, 2024

436
00:30:33,383 --> 00:30:36,719
you tried to forcefully take
the laptop away from Mr. Bae,

437
00:30:36,743 --> 00:30:40,872
and he fell from the third floor. Right?

438
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:44,435
It happened because
he ran away with the laptop.

439
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:49,946
Did you go to a cocktail bar on March 14th
with Director Yoo, who was an audit object?

440
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:50,619
Yes, I did.

441
00:30:50,643 --> 00:30:53,581
Then, you went to her apartment
where she lived alone

442
00:30:53,605 --> 00:30:55,546
and faced a charge of harassment.

443
00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:58,892
That already turned
out to be a false charge.

444
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,519
I know.

445
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:02,079
On April 10th

446
00:31:02,103 --> 00:31:05,386
you admitted that you had gone too far
and apologized

447
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,993
to Mr. Pyeon and Director Yang, right?

448
00:31:12,574 --> 00:31:13,031
Yes.

449
00:31:13,055 --> 00:31:17,970
You investigated Chief Park
at 4 a.m. on May 9th.

450
00:31:17,994 --> 00:31:21,715
Was there an unavoidable reason
for that late investigation?

451
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:24,741
J-BIMS presentation was impending.

452
00:31:24,765 --> 00:31:27,645
The chance of information leakage was high
and I didn't have enough time.

453
00:31:27,892 --> 00:31:30,447
Why do you keep asking
about past incidents?

454
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,953
Don't you get it?

455
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,250
You're pushing yourself.

456
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:44,829
You're urging yourself too hard
with a sense of duty to capture suspects.

457
00:31:45,678 --> 00:31:47,440
So, you didn't realize

458
00:31:47,464 --> 00:31:52,007
your oppressive investigation
harassed the audit objects.

459
00:31:52,031 --> 00:31:53,346
Don't you think so?

460
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,241
Those who try to hide their crimes
are brazen and shrewd.

461
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:02,300
You also know that we need
to make a bold decision

462
00:32:02,324 --> 00:32:04,391
to fight with that kind
of person, don't you?

463
00:32:04,415 --> 00:32:05,553
Even so

464
00:32:05,577 --> 00:32:10,219
I think your way is too pushy
and drives people to a dead end.

465
00:32:10,243 --> 00:32:12,083
You and I have different
investigation styles.

466
00:32:14,017 --> 00:32:15,059
Well.

467
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,233
What about this one?

468
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,976
<i>(Kim Man Soo, Baeon Construction)</i>

469
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:36,549
Deputy Director Kim Man Soo
from Baeon Construction.

470
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:37,681
Do you remember him?

471
00:32:44,809 --> 00:32:48,692
<i>(Two years ago)</i>

472
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,880
Do you have a company?

473
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,165
Excuse me.

474
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:02,414
Who is he?

475
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:04,241
Who the hell is he?

476
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:09,613
What the heck!

477
00:33:16,214 --> 00:33:17,955
Mr. Shin…

478
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:24,910
Do you admit you've used
the company credit card for pleasure?

479
00:33:24,934 --> 00:33:26,673
No. It's just for…

480
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:28,679
I'll tell you for you.

481
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:31,807
Aren't the people you
entertained the executives from

482
00:33:31,831 --> 00:33:33,737
Moo San and Bong Sun companies?

483
00:33:35,648 --> 00:33:38,106
I'm suspicious that they gave you
a higher subcontracted work amount

484
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:40,945
than the actual amount
to get back the difference.

485
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:43,651
It's an act of illegal fundraising.

486
00:33:43,675 --> 00:33:45,875
It can be qualified as embezzlement
and breach of trust.

487
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:50,530
You have two options.

488
00:33:50,554 --> 00:33:54,570
First. Admit that you set up a secret fund
and be fired and charged.

489
00:33:54,594 --> 00:33:58,695
Second. Disclose who ordered this
and receive leniency.

490
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,398
Which one are you going to choose?

491
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:10,194
I'm sorry the house is a mess.

492
00:34:10,218 --> 00:34:12,152
Why don't you come inside for a minute?

493
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:14,381
No, it's okay.

494
00:34:14,405 --> 00:34:16,313
Where is Deputy Director Kim Man Soo?

495
00:34:17,278 --> 00:34:18,283
What?

496
00:34:19,631 --> 00:34:22,285
He went to work in the morning.
Isn't he at the office?

497
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:31,088
What do you think you're doing?

498
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,340
I know you're the Audit Team leader

499
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,961
but isn't it too much to drop by
my house without permission?

500
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:36,828
Do you know what my wife's condition is?

501
00:34:36,852 --> 00:34:38,302
Let's talk in person.

502
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,681
Your wife didn't know you were excluded
from your duties and took time off.

503
00:34:51,622 --> 00:34:53,334
I didn't tell her
because I didn't want to worry her.

504
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:54,727
Is it a problem?

505
00:34:54,751 --> 00:34:58,127
Why are you trying to take all the guilt?

506
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:00,827
I know you're covering up for Director
Bae Hyung Kyu and the Vice President.

507
00:35:00,851 --> 00:35:03,067
Please stop it.

508
00:35:03,091 --> 00:35:04,254
It is really not.

509
00:35:04,278 --> 00:35:06,107
Even though you keep silent
nothing will be solved.

510
00:35:06,131 --> 00:35:07,612
I will never give up.

511
00:35:07,636 --> 00:35:09,952
Everything will be discovered.

512
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:12,936
I said I did it alone.

513
00:35:18,302 --> 00:35:21,645
If you keep doing it, I'll be finished.

514
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:44,850
You pushed him, who had already confessed
what he did, to tell the truth.

515
00:35:44,874 --> 00:35:48,538
Was that why he committed suicide?

516
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:54,378
Is the case of Ms. Jeong the same
as that of Deputy Director Kim Man Soo?

517
00:35:58,544 --> 00:36:00,417
I'm so worried.

518
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,747
A similar incident can happen again

519
00:36:04,771 --> 00:36:09,426
if you keep auditing like this.

520
00:36:18,023 --> 00:36:19,169
Let's

521
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:22,239
call it a day.

522
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:50,868
I think what Mr. Shin said is right.

523
00:36:50,892 --> 00:36:52,108
What do you mean?

524
00:36:52,132 --> 00:36:54,038
He said we shouldn't trust anyone.

525
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:58,808
Mr. Bae, Assistant Manager Moon

526
00:37:00,132 --> 00:37:01,712
and even Mr. Shin betrayed my trust.

527
00:37:02,705 --> 00:37:07,618
I can't believe
he audited someone until the one died.

528
00:37:08,608 --> 00:37:10,921
Did he really do that?

529
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:14,959
You also heard the story
about Deputy Director Kim Man Soo.

530
00:37:17,497 --> 00:37:20,364
I didn't think he was that brutal.

531
00:37:25,789 --> 00:37:30,107
When you told me you believed in me

532
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,944
I was glad.

533
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:36,814
You were reliable.

534
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:43,653
I was encouraged a lot
when I had someone who trusted me.

535
00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:47,382
So, I want to trust him.

536
00:37:50,076 --> 00:37:53,763
I'm sure there was a reason we don't know.

537
00:37:55,869 --> 00:38:01,711
If you'll keep working with the Audit Team
you'd better not trust someone easily.

538
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:02,739
You're right.

539
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:08,471
I feel like you've influenced me.

540
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,713
Right.

541
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:40,109
Mr. Shin Cha Il.

542
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:42,129
Do you remember me?

543
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,114
I'm Deputy Director Kim Man Soo's wife.

544
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:46,136
I know.

545
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,584
Please tell me.

546
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,396
Why should my husband have to die?

547
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,459
No one told me the truth about it
including the company.

548
00:38:57,873 --> 00:39:00,630
You didn't tell me
what happened to him even at his funeral.

549
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,834
I need to know now.

550
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,073
I'm sorry.

551
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:18,549
I will never give up this time.

552
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:54,483
Isn't the audit
by this kind of murderer reckless?

553
00:39:54,507 --> 00:39:56,586
So you killed a person?

554
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,303
While auditing?

555
00:39:59,327 --> 00:40:00,688
I'm so worried.

556
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:03,736
A similar incident can happen again

557
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,398
if you keep auditing like this.

558
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:30,700
<i>(Dismiss Shin Cha Il
who did a murder audit)</i>

559
00:40:30,724 --> 00:40:32,788
<i>(Discover the truth of my
husband's miserable death)</i>

560
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:46,010
Isn't it a golden opportunity?

561
00:40:46,034 --> 00:40:50,016
We can fire him through this chance.

562
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,851
I'm sure it's your plan, right?

563
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:55,354
It's such an excellent strategy.

564
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:57,190
It's the best.

565
00:40:57,214 --> 00:40:58,215
Are you excited?

566
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,117
Well…

567
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:03,629
Aren't you excited?

568
00:41:03,653 --> 00:41:05,703
I know you have an acquaintance
at Baeon Construction.

569
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:06,796
Baeon Construction?

570
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:09,783
Ah, I can see your intention.

571
00:41:09,807 --> 00:41:12,509
You're going to plan to fire him, right?

572
00:41:12,533 --> 00:41:17,066
Yeah, I have an acquaintance.
I'll contact him right now.

573
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:32,480
<i>(Dismiss Shin Cha Il
who did a murder audit)</i>

574
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:34,568
<i>(Discover the truth of my
husband's miserable death)</i>

575
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:52,818
I'll come every day.

576
00:41:52,842 --> 00:41:54,891
Don't push yourself too hard.

577
00:41:54,915 --> 00:41:58,341
If you want me to stop it
please tell the truth.

578
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:19,242
Mr. Shin and I have agreed
to a special provision.

579
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:22,129
That's a provision that I can't dismiss him
within two years.

580
00:42:22,153 --> 00:42:23,077
Two years?

581
00:42:23,101 --> 00:42:26,703
He demanded two years for a decent audit.

582
00:42:27,593 --> 00:42:30,809
But, there's a condition to that provision.

583
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:33,276
If he causes harm to the company

584
00:42:34,353 --> 00:42:36,013
I can dismiss him.

585
00:42:39,386 --> 00:42:41,527
Is the picketing one such thing?

586
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:45,355
If it becomes the focus of the public
attention you can call it into question.

587
00:42:46,084 --> 00:42:47,400
Is it what you want?

588
00:42:47,424 --> 00:42:48,859
I don't have any intention.

589
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,763
I just wanted to figure
out what's going on.

590
00:42:55,637 --> 00:42:58,001
Thank you. You can go.

591
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:21,090
This is a will Ms. Jeong wrote.

592
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:27,273
She wrote that it was such a violent
and oppressive audit that she felt shame

593
00:43:27,297 --> 00:43:29,466
and couldn't stand the pressure.

594
00:43:30,897 --> 00:43:33,814
The bereaved of Mr. Kim Man Soo
visited the company

595
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:35,210
and there was a gossip about you.

596
00:43:35,234 --> 00:43:37,873
The issue has become complicated.

597
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,576
Is there something you want to say?

598
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,882
'I couldn't say anything
because I was daunted.

599
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:52,119
You'll know if you listen to the recording.
She wasn't daunted at all.

600
00:43:52,143 --> 00:43:54,813
Rather, she was confident and brazen.

601
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:57,554
The will contains her impure intention.

602
00:43:57,578 --> 00:43:59,814
She tried to kill herself.

603
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:02,866
Are you saying she lied
at the risk of her life?

604
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:07,671
Don't let anything cloud your judgment.

605
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:13,207
You should be careful the most
not to lose the insight.

606
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:17,947
Figure out the situation with an open mind.

607
00:44:18,745 --> 00:44:21,885
And do not jump to conclusions.

608
00:44:24,584 --> 00:44:26,740
I'll report the audit result tomorrow.

609
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,793
If you don't have anything to say
I'll wrap it up.

610
00:44:48,325 --> 00:44:49,855
What is this?

611
00:44:49,879 --> 00:44:53,249
Go and figure out what
happened to Mr. Shin.

612
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:57,187
Baeon Construction?

613
00:44:59,675 --> 00:45:02,424
Why are you suddenly giving it to me?

614
00:45:02,448 --> 00:45:06,284
Do you want me to find something
that can harm Mr. Shin?

615
00:45:06,308 --> 00:45:07,319
You want to die?

616
00:45:08,248 --> 00:45:10,917
I mean, it's weird.

617
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,512
Why are you suddenly
trying to help Mr. Shini?

618
00:45:13,536 --> 00:45:18,419
I do whatever to get back at the enemy.

619
00:45:18,443 --> 00:45:20,332
It's the same
when it comes to returning the favor.

620
00:45:20,356 --> 00:45:23,626
You go and find out what happened exactly.

621
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,691
This is all I can help.

622
00:45:24,715 --> 00:45:26,472
- You got it?
- Yes.

623
00:45:26,496 --> 00:45:29,453
By the way, may I tell Mr. Shin

624
00:45:30,183 --> 00:45:33,346
- that you're helping?
- Yes.

625
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,125
Tell him if you want to die.

626
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:38,461
Thank you.

627
00:45:43,769 --> 00:45:46,231
- Mr. Vice President?
- Yes.

628
00:45:46,255 --> 00:45:49,038
So, I'll go to see him.
Why don't we go together?

629
00:45:54,749 --> 00:45:56,989
- Did you hear that?
- What do you mean?

630
00:45:57,013 --> 00:45:59,358
The audit result of Mr. Shin
will come out tomorrow.

631
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:03,028
It seems like disciplinary action
will be taken against him.

632
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,959
There's a picketing in
front of the company.

633
00:46:04,983 --> 00:46:07,299
The president definitely wants to show
he's paying attention to this case.

634
00:46:07,323 --> 00:46:10,126
In times like this,
we'd better play it safe.

635
00:46:12,554 --> 00:46:13,796
Let's go to see him now.

636
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:16,208
We'll work outside of the office.

637
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,409
We'll be back.

638
00:46:17,433 --> 00:46:19,535
I told you to play it safe.
Where are you going?

639
00:46:26,502 --> 00:46:28,252
Hello.

640
00:46:28,276 --> 00:46:29,558
Hello.

641
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:31,414
Do you have a business with the Audit Team?

642
00:46:32,309 --> 00:46:33,616
No.

643
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,000
Hey. Let's go.

644
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:42,025
Okay.

645
00:46:48,959 --> 00:46:50,333
I'm not sure

646
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:53,579
whether it's okay to say it to you.

647
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:58,379
We want to know
what happened to Mr Shin exactly.

648
00:46:58,403 --> 00:47:03,586
You also don't want him
to get an unfair punishment.

649
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,282
Please help us.

650
00:47:12,983 --> 00:47:14,924
It's me. Where are you?

651
00:47:16,123 --> 00:47:18,795
Don't worry. I will never tell.

652
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,141
But

653
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:24,159
you should keep your word.

654
00:47:24,183 --> 00:47:26,476
You should save.

655
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,407
I see.

656
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:44,554
Did he say

657
00:47:45,273 --> 00:47:47,455
'You should save.'?

658
00:47:47,479 --> 00:47:48,493
Yes.

659
00:47:51,746 --> 00:47:54,835
Please stop it. It is really not.

660
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:56,677
Even though you keep silent
nothing will be solved.

661
00:47:56,701 --> 00:47:58,210
I will never give up.

662
00:47:58,234 --> 00:48:00,510
Everything will be discovered.

663
00:48:00,534 --> 00:48:03,439
I said I did it alone.

664
00:48:06,912 --> 00:48:10,022
If you keep doing it, I'll be finished.

665
00:48:10,046 --> 00:48:12,682
Your wife has
triple-negative breast cancer, right?

666
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:16,452
I heard you moved to a new house
because of the hospital fee.

667
00:48:17,319 --> 00:48:18,330
Excuse me.

668
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:19,900
Is a huge amount of
medical expense the reason

669
00:48:19,924 --> 00:48:22,668
you're covering up for
Director Bae and the Vice President?

670
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:25,074
Please stop it.

671
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:26,154
You're so mean.

672
00:48:26,178 --> 00:48:28,542
Did they guarantee you
the expense after the surgery?

673
00:48:28,566 --> 00:48:30,633
Is that why you keep silent like this?

674
00:48:31,804 --> 00:48:33,969
Do you really have
to investigate like this?

675
00:48:41,143 --> 00:48:43,413
You're just aggravating the situation.

676
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,716
I don't give up investigating it.

677
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,267
<i>(The late Kim Man Soo)</i>

678
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:04,560
I'm so very sorry for your loss.

679
00:50:06,301 --> 00:50:07,730
Is it true?

680
00:50:08,855 --> 00:50:11,608
Did my husband really
commit a breach of trust

681
00:50:12,668 --> 00:50:13,936
and embezzlement?

682
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:17,574
Is that why he died?

683
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:21,110
We need to investigate more.

684
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:23,046
No.

685
00:50:23,935 --> 00:50:25,415
That's not true.

686
00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:29,252
He liked to go to work.

687
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,689
He was strongly devoted to the company.

688
00:50:33,688 --> 00:50:35,431
This is unfair.

689
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:37,193
It must be a false charge.

690
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,377
We couldn't receive his statement

691
00:50:51,401 --> 00:50:55,322
and failed to leave a record
that it was due to a hospital fee.

692
00:50:55,346 --> 00:50:58,614
We also couldn't tell
the truth to his wife.

693
00:51:00,826 --> 00:51:03,218
Mr. Shin couldn't tell her that

694
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:09,225
her husband committed
a crime to save her life.

695
00:51:16,704 --> 00:51:19,936
- Thank you for your time.
- Thank you.

696
00:51:24,754 --> 00:51:29,010
We should let Ms. Seo know about it.
It wasn't an oppressive investigation.

697
00:51:29,034 --> 00:51:31,684
He did that for his wife's hospital fee.

698
00:51:31,708 --> 00:51:33,154
Yes. Let's go.

699
00:51:33,178 --> 00:51:34,198
Okay.

700
00:51:36,674 --> 00:51:37,820
Please wait.

701
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:42,390
Isn't it coincidental?

702
00:51:42,414 --> 00:51:43,369
What do you mean?

703
00:51:43,393 --> 00:51:46,061
I don't understand
why his wife suddenly came up.

704
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:54,750
I think Ms. Jeong already knew
about the case with Deputy Director Kim.

705
00:51:54,774 --> 00:51:59,041
Isn't the audit
by this kind of murderer reckless?

706
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:03,780
I need to check this out.

707
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:15,229
- Hello.
- Hello.

708
00:52:15,253 --> 00:52:17,726
I'm Goo Han Soo
a team member of JU's Audit Team.

709
00:52:18,527 --> 00:52:20,189
I want to ask you something.

710
00:52:20,213 --> 00:52:22,798
Who told you that

711
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:26,036
Mr. Shin is working at this company?

712
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,249
Why are you asking that?

713
00:52:28,273 --> 00:52:29,537
Please answer it.

714
00:52:29,561 --> 00:52:31,106
If you tell us

715
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,247
<i>(Discover the truth
of my husband's miserable death)</i>

716
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:37,934
I'll tell you the truth you wanted to know.

717
00:52:37,958 --> 00:52:40,381
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

718
00:52:40,405 --> 00:52:43,419
Please trust us
and tell us who told you about it.

719
00:52:47,145 --> 00:52:49,325
He said his name is CEO Jeong.

720
00:52:50,311 --> 00:52:53,162
He told me that his daughter
was also Mr. Shin's victim.

721
00:52:56,421 --> 00:53:00,669
By any chance, is the phone number
you got this one?

722
00:53:02,354 --> 00:53:03,606
Yes.

723
00:53:07,407 --> 00:53:10,212
If she intentionally spread the story
of Deputy Director Kim

724
00:53:11,961 --> 00:53:14,417
I doubt if she really
tried to kill herself.

725
00:53:16,534 --> 00:53:19,297
Are you saying that she
pretended to suicide?

726
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,458
Is she trustworthy?

727
00:53:26,644 --> 00:53:27,664
Wait a moment.

728
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:31,576
Look at this.

729
00:53:32,424 --> 00:53:35,115
This is a post she uploaded
in the morning she tried to kill herself.

730
00:53:35,139 --> 00:53:38,240
I want to quit work and go to Europe.

731
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:41,591
A person who is determined to die
wouldn't write a post like this.

732
00:53:43,057 --> 00:53:44,747
I think there's a way to check this out.

733
00:53:52,161 --> 00:53:55,077
<i>(I don't want to open my eyes this morning
I want to quit work and go to Europe)</i>

734
00:53:55,101 --> 00:53:57,183
Please tell us the truth.

735
00:53:57,207 --> 00:54:02,844
You came to the Audit Team a bit ago
because you had something to say, right?

736
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:06,124
Our team leader is in
trouble due to this case.

737
00:54:06,148 --> 00:54:07,871
Please help us.

738
00:54:07,895 --> 00:54:09,591
Please

739
00:54:09,615 --> 00:54:11,207
tell us the truth.

740
00:54:15,121 --> 00:54:16,346
Well…

741
00:54:18,241 --> 00:54:21,443
I'll take a few of these pills.
So call 911 right away, right?

742
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:22,923
Do you really have to do this?

743
00:54:22,947 --> 00:54:25,943
You can't imagine
how shameful I was due to him.

744
00:54:25,967 --> 00:54:28,517
I'm not just going to take it lying down.

745
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:29,696
Get your head on straight.

746
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,863
If you do it well
I'll give you the money you asked for.

747
00:54:32,887 --> 00:54:34,096
I see.

748
00:54:39,857 --> 00:54:40,970
Let's start.

749
00:54:46,524 --> 00:54:50,079
Someone fell down. Please help me.

750
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:55,861
Is what you said now true?

751
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:57,494
Yes.

752
00:54:57,518 --> 00:55:00,356
She had no intention to kill herself.

753
00:55:01,078 --> 00:55:03,127
I needed money urgently.

754
00:55:03,151 --> 00:55:05,127
So, I did what she asked on an impulse.

755
00:55:06,358 --> 00:55:08,764
But I regretted what I did.

756
00:55:29,103 --> 00:55:30,729
Have you secured her testimony?

757
00:55:30,753 --> 00:55:33,649
I'll take care of the case.

758
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:35,009
You did a good job.

759
00:55:35,033 --> 00:55:36,225
Thank you.

760
00:55:37,746 --> 00:55:39,228
I'm…

761
00:55:40,053 --> 00:55:41,163
jealous of Mr. Shin.

762
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:45,168
He has reliable team members who trust him.

763
00:55:56,795 --> 00:55:57,980
By the way

764
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:03,817
will you tell Deputy
Director's wife the truth?

765
00:56:03,841 --> 00:56:07,689
She'll be shocked by the truth.
But I think she should know it.

766
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:12,327
If we don't tell her
her anguish will be bigger.

767
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:29,078
I'm surprised.
You should learn manners.

768
00:56:30,761 --> 00:56:34,704
Did you pretend to kill yourself
to set Mr. Shin up?

769
00:56:34,728 --> 00:56:36,552
What a bullshit is this?

770
00:56:40,559 --> 00:56:42,925
What did you tell her?

771
00:56:44,726 --> 00:56:47,464
Tell me what you told her.

772
00:56:47,488 --> 00:56:50,542
Hey. Ms. Jeong Hye Young.

773
00:56:50,566 --> 00:56:55,704
You'll be accused of
slandering and libeling Mr. Shin.

774
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,607
You'd better appoint a great lawyer.

775
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,175
Hey. Come here.

776
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:04,889
Hey! Tell me what you told her.

777
00:57:04,913 --> 00:57:06,282
No.

778
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:10,602
Damn it.

779
00:57:10,626 --> 00:57:13,562
<i>(Report of audit)</i>

780
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:17,526
<i>(It turned out that Mr. Shin wasn't violent
and oppressive while auditing)</i>

781
00:57:23,911 --> 00:57:25,800
I see.

782
00:57:25,824 --> 00:57:27,135
You can go.

783
00:57:55,156 --> 00:57:57,778
Isn't the president upset?

784
00:57:57,802 --> 00:57:59,568
He didn't say much.

785
00:58:08,773 --> 00:58:10,425
Wait.

786
00:58:10,449 --> 00:58:13,858
I realize today that I'm a wolf.

787
00:58:13,882 --> 00:58:14,882
What?

788
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:18,945
I'm curious about one thing.

789
00:58:18,969 --> 00:58:21,924
Are you a hunting dog or a wolf?

790
00:58:22,682 --> 00:58:23,724
Aha.

791
00:58:24,849 --> 00:58:27,258
I knew you were a wolf from the beginning.

792
00:58:27,282 --> 00:58:30,733
Be careful that talking down
can be within the audit scope.

793
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:07,302
I heard the truth.

794
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:10,406
He did that for me.

795
00:59:11,717 --> 00:59:14,276
I've blamed the wrong person.

796
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:16,478
I'm sorry.

797
00:59:17,377 --> 00:59:18,626
No.

798
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,249
It's me who feels sorry for you.

799
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:24,186
Actually, I knew it.

800
00:59:25,483 --> 00:59:29,273
I knew that your husband
had come to a dead end.

801
00:59:29,297 --> 00:59:32,228
But, I pushed him more because I thought…

802
00:59:33,917 --> 00:59:35,197
I could get more information.

803
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:37,867
That was my fault.

804
00:59:38,610 --> 00:59:40,433
I'm sorry.

805
00:59:40,457 --> 00:59:44,006
You just did what you should do.

806
00:59:49,413 --> 00:59:53,022
By the way, what happened to them?

807
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:56,049
Those who took advantage of my husband.

808
00:59:56,073 --> 00:59:58,721
I found other evidence.
They were disciplined and dismissed.

809
00:59:59,946 --> 01:00:01,657
They're now in prison.

810
01:00:03,353 --> 01:00:04,426
I see.

811
01:00:06,313 --> 01:00:08,055
That's good news.

812
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:09,431
I'm relieved.

813
01:00:11,299 --> 01:00:14,035
Thank you for coming.

814
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,123
I'm sorry.

815
01:00:58,503 --> 01:00:59,915
Good morning.

816
01:01:00,663 --> 01:01:03,019
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

817
01:01:08,419 --> 01:01:10,209
Do you have something to say?

818
01:01:10,233 --> 01:01:11,782
No.

819
01:01:11,806 --> 01:01:13,429
I'm just happy to see you.

820
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:17,733
I heard you helped me. Thank you.
You did a good job.

821
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:21,203
What did you say just now?

822
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:24,082
I said I heard about you.

823
01:01:24,106 --> 01:01:25,794
I mean, the next sentence.

824
01:01:25,818 --> 01:01:26,842
You did a good job.

825
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,811
No. The sentence before it.

826
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:31,313
Thank…

827
01:01:33,786 --> 01:01:35,484
Be ready to work.

828
01:01:36,186 --> 01:01:38,146
Yes, sir.

Do you have any good news?

834
01:01:53,159 --> 01:01:56,141
I think something good will happen today.

835
01:01:56,165 --> 01:01:57,672
You're so lame.

836
01:02:18,286 --> 01:02:19,461
Honey.

837
01:02:20,879 --> 01:02:24,834
It's me. Can you recognize me?

What did you say?

839
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:33,501
Se Woong? All right.
I'll call him to come.

Excuse me!

841
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:47,573
I'm sure. He wanted to see you.

842
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,437
He must've regained his consciousness.

843
01:02:50,504 --> 01:02:53,747
He's fallen asleep now.

844
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:55,373
Please come early tomorrow morning.

845
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,034
I'll go to my house tonight
and come early tomorrow morning.

846
01:03:02,492 --> 01:03:03,738
Thank God.

Sir. Here you go.

We've solved one thing
and now a bunch of work is waiting for us.

849
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:20,009
It's too much. I see no end to it.

850
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:22,941
The regular audit is a piece of work
compared to other incidents.

851
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:26,887
You're right.
May this peace continue.

something serious will happen.

Don't say that.

Don't say a word that like.

01:04:12,657 --> 01:04:18,026
Have you heard that the ex-president
regained his consciousness?

863
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:18,700
I heard.

864
01:04:18,724 --> 01:04:22,923
Yes. I didn't expect him

865
01:04:22,947 --> 01:04:25,746
to regain his consciousness this fast.

866
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:27,756
What should we do?

867
01:04:34,449 --> 01:04:38,610
I didn't expect to see you here.
I even hate seeing you in my dreams.

868

What brings you here?

869
01:04:41,012 --> 01:04:45,595
Attempted manslaughter and dumping of
a body embezzlement, and breach of trust.

870
01:04:45,619 --> 01:04:48,181
And a special request for a job position.

871
01:04:48,205 --> 01:04:50,495
You'll be staying in prison for a long.

Are you here to rub salt into my wound?

874
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,326
I came to see you because you would know a
lot of embarrassing matters of the company.

875
01:04:58,350 --> 01:05:00,379
Are you planning
to stab somebody in the back again?

01:07:07,718 --> 01:07:11,261
Since when have you been
on friendly terms with him?

891
01:07:11,285 --> 01:07:14,567
The guy next to Mr. President
is Undersecretary Ahn, right?

892
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:19,759
Can the vice president be the real owner
of Archcle and secret funds?

893
01:07:19,783 --> 01:07:23,859
I won't let personal feelings come into
play because I'm an Audit Team member.

894
01:07:23,883 --> 01:07:27,599
Secrecy is necessary for this audit.

895
01:07:27,623 --> 01:07:32,974
I'll catch a bad guy who's been extorting
JU Construction for a long time.
