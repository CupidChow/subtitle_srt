[Episode 3]

3
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,720
[Pei's Mansion]

4
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,600
Lu Lingfeng,

5
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,070
something's not right.

6
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,560
When we were at Weicheng Station,

7
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,000
His Majesty wanted you
to stay in Chang'an.

8
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,000
That clearly meant he wanted
to give you an important position.

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,760
But now why are you
assigned to just protect

10
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,820
the Grand General?

11
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,440
How would I know?

12
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,310
Any clues about that raptor?

13
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,840
His Majesty has handed the case

14
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,240
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,400
I know even less about it.

16
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:26,120
The only clue we have now is

17
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,079
a feather Master Ji plucked

18
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:29,410
from the raptor's body.

19
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,470
This looks like it!

20
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,190
Look!

21
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,310
Let me see it.

22
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,360
Although I've never seen this bird before,

23
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,750
from your earlier descriptions,

24
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,840
I suspected it might be a Flame Crow.

25
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,880
This feather indeed matches

26
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,310
the historical records.

27
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,730
Look here.

28
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:13,960
[Flame Crow]

29
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,680
This bird is enormous in size.

30
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,240
Its neck resembles a vulture's,

31
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,590
but it's red.

32
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,650
On its black wings,

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,430
there are red flame-like patterns.

34
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:26,840
-That's right.
-That's right.

35
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,970
It matches your description exactly.

36
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,710
This Flame Crow

37
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,720
must be the king of the Crow's Cry Kingdom

38
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,400
mentioned in the Records of Anomalies.

39
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,990
What is this Crow's Cry Kingdom?

40
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,520
According to legend,

41
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,960
between the world
of the living and the dead,

42
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,310
there exists a Crow's Cry Kingdom.

43
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,560
In the center of this kingdom
stands a massive tree,

44
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,970
with a circumference of hundreds of li.

45
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,700
Millions of ferocious birds
perch on this tree.

46
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,079
The most formidable among them

47
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,750
is this Flame Crow.

48
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,240
A legendary ferocious bird
has appeared in our world?

49
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,080
Su Wuming,

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,960
that sounds a little

51
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,190
superstitious.

52
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,520
Though it appears in legends,

53
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,840
such birds do exist in our world.

54
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,110
They do exist?

55
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,080
Definitely not in the Tang Empire.

56
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,680
Where does it originate from?

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,040
This bird is native only to Amono,

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,829
west of the Western Region.

59
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,680
Isn't that the small country

60
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,480
that was destroyed
during Emperor Gaozong's reign?

61
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,140
Yes.

62
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,680
The Flame Crow was Amono's national bird.

63
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,560
Its sense of smell is extremely keen,

64
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,190
and it has a preference for sweet things.

65
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,600
However,

66
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:38,850
although this bird is fierce,

67
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,620
there are no records of it eating humans.

68
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,510
Hey!

69
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,880
I can't move,

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,360
so you're all ignoring me?

71
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,760
Let me in on what you're discussing!

72
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,480
My dear Miracle Doctor Fei,

73
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,280
this time,

74
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,720
you not only saved
the Grand General's life,

75
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,670
but also risked your life
to taste the golden peach,

76
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,600
sacrificing yourself to lure the raptor

77
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,070
and plucking one of its feathers.

78
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,480
You've given us the opportunity

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,070
to identify its origin.

80
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,050
You truly are vigorous despite your age,

81
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,390
continuously achieving new merits!

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,680
You flatter me.

83
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,240
Su Wuming.

84
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,560
It sounds like you're mocking me.

85
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm not mocking you.

86
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,680
It's all compliments.

87
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,720
Yingtao is friend-worthy.

88
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,120
Unlike Su Wuming,

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,720
who's full of schemes

90
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,250
and completely apathetic.

91
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,870
But I must say,

92
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,750
you made a round trip

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,750
to Gantang County in just a few days.

94
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,180
That's quite impressive.

95
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,190
Miss Yingtao,

96
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,960
it must've been tiring.

97
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,240
Indeed.

98
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,010
It's all thanks to Yingtao.

99
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,720
She immediately saw through

100
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,590
that gambling village elder's deception,

101
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,360
making this trip to Gantang

102
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,690
extremely successful.

103
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,720
Thank you, Yingtao.

104
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
The elder's deception

105
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,360
was just too obvious.

106
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,990
If I couldn't spot that,

107
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,120
my time in the martial world
can be considered wasted.

108
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,950
That...

109
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,830
Liu... Liu XVII?

110
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,390
Was his face really skinned off?

111
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:15,750
Yes.

112
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,950
These yin-yang merchants

113
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:18,210
are truly despicable.

114
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,410
What do yin-yang merchants do?

115
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,690
They trade in the dead.

116
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,250
They specifically deal in human hair,

117
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,000
human skin,

118
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,270
and even bones.

119
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,600
I say they should be treated
as grave robbers,

120
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,040
each deserving death by a thousand cuts.

121
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:30,480
Right,

122
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,150
death by a thousand cuts.

123
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,950
Liu XVII

124
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,920
would never have thought

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,120
that his evil face

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,200
would be sold to Chang'an

127
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,510
and used to attack His Majesty.

128
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:50,480
[Great virtue can carry the world]

129
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,390
Sheriff Lu.

130
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,060
Where are you heading?

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,260
The Weicheng Station.

132
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,870
Even if it was the Flame Crow,

133
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,000
it couldn't have flown straight

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,870
from Amona.

135
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,740
I suspect the person raising that raptor

136
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,680
has a hideout

137
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,200
near Weicheng Station.

138
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,310
Also,

139
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:09,870
[Great virtue can carry the world]

140
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,680
that masked person

141
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,120
who ambushed you on the way

142
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,180
used a phoenix-winged gold halberd,

143
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,230
which is quite rare.

144
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,120
It's mostly used by troops
stationed at the borders.

145
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,980
We must investigate thoroughly.

146
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,190
You can't go.

147
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,300
His Majesty ordered you
to protect Lu Tong,

148
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,940
so you should return
to the Grand General's Mansion.

149
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,190
This case is bizarre.

150
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,480
That raptor

151
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:36,510
has injured people before my eyes twice.

152
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,560
How can I stand by and do nothing?

153
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,800
[Great virtue can carry the world]

154
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,159
As your personal secretary,

155
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,000
I accompanied you westward.

156
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,560
Despite countless dangers,

157
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,680
I was fortunate to witness

158
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,750
the perseverance of you, Lu of Fanyang.

159
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,040
"Now that His Majesty has issued an edict

160
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,500
for us return to Chang'an,

161
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,600
I, Lu Lingfeng,

162
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,870
will fight with all my might

163
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
for the Tang Empire."

164
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,720
These bold words

165
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,510
still ring in my ears.

166
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,550
But now you've just returned

167
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,040
and you're already got yourself involved
in court politics.

168
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,230
Don't you know

169
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,670
this is a taboo?

170
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
Of course I know.

171
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,120
Then why did you

172
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,980
go inform Her Highness yourself?

173
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,100
As one's son,

174
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:28,770
caring about your mother's safety
is filial piety.

175
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,660
There's nothing wrong with that.

176
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,429
But that Attendant Yang

177
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,360
is cunning and vicious.

178
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,960
If you're not careful,

179
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,720
you'll fall into his trap.

180
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,140
That'd cause His Majesty to be suspicious.

181
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,330
Since things have come to this,

182
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,390
you should return to Lu Tong's side,

183
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:49,140
fulfill your duty as his guard,

184
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
and never leave his side.

185
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,660
What about the case, then?

186
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,570
Leave it to me.

187
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,720
Su Wuming,

188
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,960
you're just a civilian.

189
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,080
How could they possibly

190
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,000
entrust such an important case

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,720
to you?

192
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,780
What you just said is correct,

193
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,040
but it's all pointless talk.

194
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,620
Right now,

195
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,670
only by quickly uncovering the truth

196
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,790
and catching the culprit

197
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,030
can we resolve the misunderstanding

198
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,840
between His Majesty and Her Highness.

199
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,500
Only then will His Majesty...

200
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,030
trust me again.

201
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,030
As long as you get involved in this case,

202
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,790
His Majesty will not trust you!

203
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,690
It might even

204
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,940
bring you deadly consequences.

205
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:29,200
Return to the Grand General's Mansion
immediately.

206
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:29,870
Remember,

207
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,360
no matter how far this case goes,

208
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,200
you pay no heed.

209
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,240
I'm begging you.

210
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,840
[Yongzhou's Mansion]

211
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,960
This case has made no progress.

212
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,550
There's nothing to talk about it.

213
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,120
Indeed.

214
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,030
Chief Administrator Du,

215
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,720
I'd be really worried for you.

216
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,510
Why?

217
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,380
Just because of a bird,

218
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:04,630
could His Majesty really dismiss me

219
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,320
from my position
as Yongzhou's Chief Administrator?

220
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,720
It's not impossible.

221
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,180
What are you trying to say?

222
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,730
What I'm saying is,

223
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,720
the most important thing is,

224
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,160
Chief Administrator Du, you...

225
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,950
which side are you on?

226
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,840
[Patriotic and devote to public service]

227
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,970
I've said it before,

228
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,120
I, Du Ming,

229
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,590
am on the side of the Tang Empire.

230
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,630
Yes, yes.

231
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,720
We're on the Tang Empire's side.

232
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,750
But to be specific,

233
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,810
you're still considered
to be on the Retired Emperor's side.

234
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,960
After all, back then

235
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,670
you once served
in Prince Xiang's Mansion.

236
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,470
My dear Chief Administrator Du,

237
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,550
the situation is unpredictable now.

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,050
One of these days,

239
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,960
if His Majesty is in a bad mood,

240
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,020
he might just remove you from office.

241
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,600
If you have something to say,

242
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,800
just say it directly.

243
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,070
Though unworthy,

244
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,550
I am willing to help
Chief Administrator Du

245
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,840
assist Yongzhou Prefecture

246
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,960
to solve this mysterious case quickly.

247
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,360
That won't be necessary.

248
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,210
Cen Zhi is dead.

249
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:17,120
He died on his way to the palace.

250
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,480
And those who ate the golden peach,

251
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,960
as long as they stay
within the Princess's Mansion,

252
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,270
they will stay perfectly safe.

253
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,840
Furthermore,

254
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,150
the evil bird at Weicheng Station

255
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:25,080
didn't attack Lu Lingfeng at all.

256
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:26,760
Su Wuming.

257
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,540
Though I'm not Master Di's disciple,

258
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,360
I'm not a fool either.

259
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,490
Is there even a need
to investigate this case?

260
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,280
Should I investigate
the Princess's Mansion

261
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,390
or Lu Lingfeng?

262
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,320
You think His Majesty

263
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,780
doesn't know everything?

264
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,250
Stop causing more trouble.

265
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,660
Just go.

266
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,050
My son has been back
in the capital for days.

267
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:58,030
He performed great service protecting
the imperial convoy at Weicheng Station.

268
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,000
Yet he wasn't
awarded any official position.

269
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,870
Instead, he was assigned to guard

270
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,310
a blind man named Lu Tong.

271
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,030
Isn't this clearly

272
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,550
meant to humiliate me?

273
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,690
The fault here... lies with His Majesty?

274
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,910
It's not his fault,

275
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,790
is it mine?

276
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,390
Did Cen Zhi ever betray Your Highness?

277
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,440
Forgive my impertinence,

278
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,390
but the only person who ate
the golden peach you bestowed

279
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,430
and then left the Princess's Mansion

280
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,350
was Cen Zhi.

281
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
As the military officer of your household,

282
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,920
he was killed by the raptor,

283
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,390
yet Your Highness showed no concern.

284
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,250
What will everyone

285
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,860
at court think of this?

286
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,960
What they think

287
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,470
is none of my concern.

288
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,000
Cen Zhi lost an arm

289
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,590
saving my life.

290
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,240
His loyalty was commendable.

291
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,150
After his death,

292
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:05,150
I ordered to provide compensation
in silver and gold,

293
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,700
but couldn't find
any of his family members.

294
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,000
What a pity.

295
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,650
Let's not speak of this.

296
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,510
I can't let you come for nothing.

297
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,840
Let me offer you a peach.

298
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,210
A golden peach from the Kang Kingdom.

299
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,080
I'll pass on the peach.

300
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,120
Why?

301
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,340
Afraid you'll end up like Cen Zhi?

302
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,510
I, Su Wuming,

303
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,600
truly fear death.

304
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,130
More importantly, if I die,

305
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,170
there will be no one left

306
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,360
to clear Lu Lingfeng's name.

307
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,930
What do you mean?

308
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,120
The golden peach from the Kang Kingdom

309
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,480
was escorted here
by Lu Lingfeng personally.

310
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,120
That man-attacking raptor from the west

311
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,200
must be from the Western Region.

312
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,220
Lu Lingfeng noticed

313
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,550
that the raptor's attacks
were related to the golden peach.

314
00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,000
So he rushed to
the Princess's Mansion to report

315
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,480
and personally protect
Your Highness's safety.

316
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,240
Meanwhile,

317
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,150
you hosted grand golden peach banquets,

318
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:09,120
yet still remained unharmed for days.

319
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,410
How could His Majesty not be suspicious?

320
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,960
Having Lu Lingfeng
stay at the Grand General's Mansion

321
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,240
to protect Lu Tong

322
00:14:15,630 --> 00:14:16,840
is just an excuse.

323
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,630
Now

324
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,440
Lu Lingfeng's life hangs by a thread.

325
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,550
I'd like to see him dare touch my son.

326
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:24,670
Yes.

327
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,510
Your Highness has great influence.

328
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,700
His Majesty wouldn't dare act rashly.

329
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,610
But if we don't uncover the truth

330
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,520
and clear Lu Lingfeng's name,

331
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,000
he will eventually be framed

332
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
and die unjustly.

333
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:37,960
Shut up.

334
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,600
No wonder you're so earnest.

335
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,440
You're here to ask
for an official position, aren't you?

336
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,300
I'll grant you

337
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,510
the position of Chief Justice,

338
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,150
and you take office immediately.

339
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,010
Your Highness.

340
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,270
You shouldn't joke like this.

341
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,510
Do you think

342
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,110
I don't have such authority?

343
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,590
No, no.

344
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,360
Whoever Your Highness wants
as Chief Justice,

345
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,240
I believe

346
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,610
that person will

347
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,510
certainly secure that position.

348
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,060
But I am currently

349
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,240
just a commoner.

350
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,030
You're offering me a third-rank position

351
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,480
which is too high.

352
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,140
The bureaucratic procedures

353
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,700
would be troublesome.

354
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,840
This case is at a critical moment.

355
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,600
If we don't solve it quickly,

356
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:28,680
we'll miss the golden time.

357
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,720
It might remain unsolved forever.

358
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,840
Lu Lingfeng might never

359
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,460
be cleared of suspicion too.

360
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,480
Right now,

361
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Yongzhou Prefecture has made

362
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,360
no progress on this case—

363
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,790
The case was assigned to Du Ming?

364
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,360
Indeed.

365
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,840
That incompetent fool

366
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,900
knows nothing about investigation.

367
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,000
Exactly!

368
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,050
Starting today,

369
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,790
I appoint you

370
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,600
as the Criminal Investigation Scholar
of Yongzhou Prefecture.

371
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,670
Scholar?

372
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:55,440
It sounds novel?

373
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
That's the point.

374
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:00,390
In our Tang Empire,
we have Classics Scholars,

375
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,750
Medicine Scholars,

376
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,410
and various other scholars.

377
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,410
Adding a Criminal Investigation Scholar
won't hurt.

378
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,030
You'll report directly
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

379
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,390
Take office immediately

380
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:12,790
to investigate the raptor attack incident.

381
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,120
I will inform the Retired Emperor myself.

382
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,480
[Criminal Scholar of Yongzhou,
Su Wuming]

383
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,580
I thank Your Highness.

384
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,120
I have

385
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,240
a question to ask.

386
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:25,670
Ask.

387
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,870
That raptor truly wasn't raised by you?

388
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,870
Even if you didn't raise it,

389
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,080
it must have something

390
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,720
to do with the Princess's Mansion, right?

391
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,600
Otherwise,

392
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,480
why did Chancellor Cui stay
at the Princess's Mansion for days

393
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,840
after eating the golden peach?

394
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,440
Su Wuming!

395
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:50,830
Kneel down right now!

396
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,560
[Letter of appointment]

397
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,130
[Su Wuming of Yongzhou's Wugong County
is smart and intelligent.]

398
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,030
[He has sharp eyes and ears,
and is smart and capable.
From today onwards,]

399
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,900
[he shall be appointed
the Criminal Scholar of Yongzhou]

400
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,330
[Letter of appointment]

401
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,750
[He shall be appointed to investigate
the devil bird case.]

402
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,680
Su Wuming.

403
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,680
You claim to be above it all,

404
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,700
yet you accept this irregular appointment?

405
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,950
I don't appreciate what you're saying.

406
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,270
This scholar position of mine

407
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,640
isn't even a proper official post,

408
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,170
not at all.

409
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:19,200
How can you call it
an irregular appointment?

410
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,310
It's not an official post?

411
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,480
Of course it's not!

412
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,240
It's because the Princess is eager
to solve the case

413
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,960
and ordered me
to supervise Yongzhou Prefecture.

414
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,310
It's just a title.

415
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,750
If that's the case,

416
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:34,570
then Yongzhou Prefecture

417
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:36,440
won't provide you any salary?

418
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,240
Hey!

419
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,610
Wouldn't that be taking advantage of me?

420
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,280
You want to solve cases

421
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,680
and make a name in history.

422
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,720
Can't you endure this small inconvenience?

423
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,480
Besides, not giving you a salary

424
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,540
is my stance as Chief Administrator.

425
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,790
This stance is for

426
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,810
those higher-up to see.

427
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,640
Therefore,

428
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,240
I ask Scholar Su to understand
Yongzhou Prefecture's situation

429
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,480
and my predicament.

430
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,210
You're really something.

431
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,880
Guards!

432
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:06,410
Yes, sir.

433
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
Summon Official Wu.

434
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,410
Yes, sir.

435
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,680
I, Wu Wenbin,
the Judicial Official,

436
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,210
pay respects to Scholar Su.

437
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,940
Wu Wenbin.

438
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,460
Su Wuming is Master Di's disciple

439
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,610
who solved the Cantian Tower case

440
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,420
and the Chengfo Temple mystery.

441
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,430
Have you heard of him?

442
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,520
Of course I have.

443
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,640
Scholar Su is renowned.

444
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,640
It's my honor to investigate

445
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,500
this case under

446
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,650
your supervision.

447
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,640
But there are few clues in this case.

448
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,720
It's currently stalled.

449
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,920
Where should we begin?

450
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,270
I'll follow Scholar Su's lead

451
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:37,130
and provide my full cooperation.

452
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,000
Tell me then.

453
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,680
Are there
any missing persons cases recently?

454
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,480
Yongzhou is densely populated,

455
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,790
so such unfortunate incidents

456
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,880
do occur.

457
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,830
Then let me ask you,

458
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,490
are there any cases
where faces were peeled off?

459
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,020
Actually, yes.

460
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:58,710
I just reported one
to Chief Administrator Du yesterday.

461
00:18:58,830 --> 00:18:59,360
Quickly,

462
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,120
take me to examine the body.

463
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,210
Note this down:

464
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,940
the skin above the neck

465
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,140
and below the scalp was all peeled off.

466
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:16,140
The wound edges
are curled with blood seepage.

467
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,110
It appears to have been done
while the victim was unconscious,

468
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:22,000
or possibly even while conscious.

469
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,260
The wounds are clean,

470
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,890
suggesting the work
of an experienced perpetrator.

471
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
She was a dancer.

472
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,240
Such a frivolous and loose woman

473
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,100
murdered in her own residence

474
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
should be a crime of passion.

475
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,360
Did you find her lovers?

476
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,610
We found two of them.

477
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,240
But they had alibis.

478
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,240
So how could it be a crime of passion?

479
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,000
Yongzhou Prefecture is vast,

480
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,920
with many cases.

481
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,200
Given her status,

482
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,410
I indeed didn't take it seriously,

483
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,880
and my subordinates were negligent.

484
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,920
However, Dr. Su,

485
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,790
Her Highness sent you
to Yongzhou Prefecture,

486
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,050
not to investigate a mere dancer, right?

487
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,590
So what if she was a dancer?

488
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,440
Wasn't she still a citizen
of the Tang Empire?

489
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,900
You're just an attendant,

490
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,880
how dare you speak to me like this!

491
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:06,310
Hey!

492
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,320
Official Wu,

493
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,270
my attendant

494
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,590
speaks her mind freely

495
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,120
and means no offense.

496
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,920
But,

497
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,350
she is right.

498
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Take me to the victim's residence.

499
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,940
Bring Xijun along.

500
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,400
Su Wuming.

501
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,640
Although this area is within
Pingkang District,

502
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,960
it's quite secluded.

503
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,400
Any commotion inside the courtyard

504
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,730
wouldn't be easily noticed from outside.

505
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,310
Brother.

506
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,920
The drawing is finished.

507
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,510
I fear most
when terrible incidents like this

508
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,110
happen in the neighborhood.

509
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,240
I want to move away.

510
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,590
Did my sister draw her accurately?

511
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,110
Yes,

512
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
very accurate.

513
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:27,530
It's exactly like her.

514
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,110
She had a really seductive gaze.

515
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,480
I wouldn't even let my husband

516
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,540
look at her twice.

517
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,160
She looked exactly like that drawing.

518
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:38,880
What's this?

519
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,680
Thank you for your help, Sister.

520
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,480
Who's there?

521
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,510
Stop right there!

522
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,110
Jia!

523
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,060
You're with these three?

524
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,180
Official Wu,

525
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:28,030
there's a misunderstanding.

526
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,960
These three

527
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:31,030
are old acquaintances of mine.

528
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,640
They are the famous

529
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,400
Three Great Constables of Chang'an County.

530
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:34,910
Jia, Luo, and Liu.

Jia]

532
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:35,980
[The Three Chang'an Constables,
Luo]

533
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,570
[The Three Chang'an Constables,
Liu]

534
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,330
They're famous?

535
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,340
How come I've never heard of them?

536
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,810
Never heard of them?

537
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,290
That can't be right.

538
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,270
I understand now.

539
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:49,400
That's because you

540
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,200
have only recently arrived
in Yongzhou Prefecture,

541
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,270
so that's why...

542
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,200
These three

543
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,960
made great contributions

544
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,200
to the Red Tea Case in Chang'an,

545
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,510
the Cantian Tower Case,

546
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,570
and the Demon King Escape
at Chengfo Temple.

547
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,260
If they're officials,

548
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,750
why were they sneaking around like this?

549
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,560
Indeed.

550
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,720
What's going on

551
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:09,970
with you three?

552
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We heard you have returned to Chang'an,

553
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,110
so we came to visit you.

554
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,310
But this district
isn't under Chang'an's jurisdiction,

555
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,960
so we dressed in plain clothes.

556
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,410
You have offended many powerful people,

557
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,500
so we must be cautious.

558
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,070
Exactly.

559
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,240
Exactly.

560
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,470
Look.

561
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,540
It was truly a misunderstanding.

562
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,800
You three.

563
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:28,940

of Yongzhou Prefecture,

565
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,390
Wu Wenbin.

566
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,500
Say your greetings to your superior.

567
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,040
Greetings, Official Wu.

568
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:43,720
I'll leave you to catch up.

569
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,960
If you find any important leads,

570
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,000
I'll return to assist.

571
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,030
Very well.

572
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,250
Take care, Official Wu.

573
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,480
Minister Su, have you been well?

574
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,590
That startled me.

575
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,160
Yes!

576
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,510
But I'm no longer a minister.

577
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:02,070
From now on, you can call me

578
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,890
Scholar Su.

579
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:07,910
Scholar?

580
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,350
What rank is that?

581
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,720
Well...

582
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,500
I'm not allowed to say.

583
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,480
Basically, I'm supervising

584
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,680
major cases for Yongzhou Prefecture
on behalf of the imperial court.

585
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,970
My goodness!

586
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,060
That must be a very high position!

587
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,410
Congratulations on your promotion,
Scholar Su!

588
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,680
Thank you.

589
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,400
Thank you.

590
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,110
This woman is beautiful.

591
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,440
Even in Chang'an,

592
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,830
a face like hers

593
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,920
would be considered exceptional,

594
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,440
right?

595
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,370
Help me find her.

596
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,310
Rest assured, Scholar Su.

597
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:51,550
As constables of the Tang Empire,

598
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,750
to protect Chang'an,

599
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,400
we three will brave any danger...

600
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,280
Even at the cost of our lives!

601
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,160
Having brave men like Jia, Luo, and Liu

602
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:06,070
is Chang'an's fortune
and the people's blessing.

603
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,680
Please accept

604
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,160
our bow.

605
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,520
This... this...

606
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:47,720
Master Qu.

607
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,310
Why not let your wife join us

608
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,270
for a drink?

609
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,790
Yes.

610
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,050
Well...

611
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,920
To be honest,

612
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,240
we've been discussing business

613
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:56,920
for so long

614
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,660
without making any progress.

615
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,430
My wife is worried,

616
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:02,750
so she's not in the mood.

617
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,960
Business can be easily discussed.

618
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,860
Master Qu has sincerely invited us today,

619
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,350
so let's settle it now.

620
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:09,960
Me too!

621
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,110
Are you willing to settle?

622
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,480
Of course, of course.

623
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,690
There we go!

624
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,830
Well then.

625
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:16,770
I

626
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,620
toast to you three gentlemen.

627
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,400
-Come on.
-Come on.

628
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,620
The owner's surname is Qu.
He's a merchant.

629
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,750
He just bought this residence

630
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:06,160
and moved in the very next day.

631
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,680
He used to live in Dunyi District.

632
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,160
He found his wife ugly,

633
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,750
so he never allowed her to be seen.

634
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,010
But after moving here,

635
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,470
he hosts guests every day

636
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,920
with his wife entertaining
and serving drinks.

637
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,310
The neighbors who've met her

638
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,570
all praise her beauty.

639
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,510
Apparently she's good at singing
and dancing too.

640
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,480
They say she looks

641
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,540
just like the woman in that painting.

642
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,030
You've investigated so thoroughly.

643
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,070
It's been a year since we last met

644
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,730
and you three have become
even more impressive.

645
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,270
You flatter us.

646
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
It's not us

647
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,030
but our informants who are remarkable.

648
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:34,960
Your informants...

649
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,920
As constables,

650
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,440
without informants' help,

651
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,100
how could we catch criminals?

652
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,110
I understand now.

653
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,160
You found me today

654
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:46,080
because of information
from your informants.

655
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:47,790
Got it.

656
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,640
My dear.

657
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:03,280
My dear.

658
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,420
Tonight...

659
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,740
Tonight

660
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,680
was all thanks to you.

661
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,160
How suffocating.

662
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,830
I don't want this face anymore.

663
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,270
You mustn't, my dear!

664
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:17,960
I spent three gold coins

665
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,860
to buy this.

666
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,550
I helped you close deals today.

667
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:22,270
You've already earned
many gold coins from that.

668
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,160
It's so itchy.

669
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,440
I want to tear it off.

670
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,510
No, you mustn't!

671
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,680
I know it's hard for you.

672
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:29,960
But

673
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,310
I truly love this face.

674
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:33,960
If you keep wearing it,

675
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,290
I'll treat you well
for the rest of my life.

676
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:38,070
Do you love me

677
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,000
or just this face?

678
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,530
On this lovely night,

679
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,110
we should enjoy ourselves
as husband and wife

680
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:46,510
and not think about these useless matters.

681
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,640
My dear.

682
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,770
Please spare me, sir!

683
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,350
Go!

684
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,770
Let's talk this through!

685
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,070
Please spare me, sir! Mercy!

686
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,200
Mercy, sir!

687
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,440
I have silver and gold!

688
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,660
Take it all!

689
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,880
Just spare this worthless life!

690
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,440
You fool!

691
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:26,370
You think I'm a thief?

692
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,160
Open your damn eyes!

693
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,110
We are the Three Great Constables
of Chang'an!

694
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,200
For your crimes,
we're arresting you today!

695
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,640
We've caught you red-handed!

696
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,030
I...

697
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,030
Look!

698
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,510
This is Scholar Su.

699
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,350
He's a high official
governing all of Yongzhou Prefecture

700
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,240
with authority
to execute first and report later.

701
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
If you don't want to die,

702
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,920
confess everything honestly!

703
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,310
I'll confess! I'll confess!

704
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:51,080
Sir,

705
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,380
what crime have I committed?

706
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,970
The person inside has already confessed.

707
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,600
He changed

708
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,590
her face

709
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,640
for her.

710
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,480
The owner of that face

711
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,270
was a dancer from Pingkang District.

712
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:08,160
You killed someone and skinned their face.

713
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,200
That's so cruel.

714
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:11,000
What punishment do you deserve?

715
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,160
I'm wronged!

716
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,090
I'm wronged!

717
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:13,880
I bought this face

718
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,440
with three gold coins

719
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,550
from someone.

720
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,070
From whom did you buy it?

721
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,790
I don't know their name.

722
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:22,590
But you can describe their face?

723
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,680
Yes!

724
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,740
Yes!

725
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,230
Keep this quiet.

726
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,640
Take this man

727
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,920
to Yongzhou Prison.

728
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,590
Yes!

729
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,550
Hey!

730
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,030
Sir!

731
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,440
-Go!
-Go!

732
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,020
I don't know anything!

733
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,480
Go!

734
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm wronged!

735
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,200
Quickly get Xijun to draw a portrait.

736
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,550
Sir!

737
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,880
I am the best yin-yang merchang

738
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,350
in all of Chang'an

739
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:52,630
and throughout the Tang Empire.

740
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,000
How's that?

741
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,550
Take a look at what I've brought.

742
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,070
Poet.

743
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,960
Merchant.

744
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,750
General.

745
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,110
Choose one.

746
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,200
This one is still the best.

747
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:29,550
Young and handsome,

748
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,400
with a touch of darkness.

749
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:36,400
This is how I was meant to be.

750
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:39,070
But you can't use

751
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,100
this face anymore.

752
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,640
Your master

753
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,790
wants you to change it.

754
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,530
He is not my master!

755
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,720
I am no one's slave.

756
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,030
No one can control me.

757
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:56,240
I will be the master of my own fate.

758
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,510
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

759
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,750
I misspoke.

760
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,020
After all, he's the one with the money.

761
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,310
Considering all the money

762
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,310
he's paid you,

763
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,000
please change to another face.

764
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,510
No!

765
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,350
This face,

766
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,030
I like it very much.

767
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:16,030
Get out!

768
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,440
This person has many faces

769
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,240
and can transform
into a woman's face at will.

770
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,680
But he uses this mostly.

771
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,610
Everyone come look.

772
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,810
Have you seen this person?

773
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:46,590
No.

774
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,240
Never seen him.

775
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,320
Someone in this line of work

776
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,920
probably

777
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,100
lives in the Ghost Market.

778
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,590
Fei.

779
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,010
Miracle Doctor Fei!

780
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,950
Who needs treatment?

781
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:16,830
Look at your condition.

782
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,960
Who would seek treatment from you?

783
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,490
Come here

784
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,090
and take a look at this.

785
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
Do you know

786
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,110
this person?

787
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:29,360
The Ever-changing Master.

788
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,030
The Ever-changing Master?

789
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,790
When you mentioned

790
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,350
the yin-yang merchants,

791
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,990
I immediately thought of him.

792
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,850
In the Ghost Market,

793
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,050
he's the most famous in this business.

794
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,440
Back when I frequented

795
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,440
the Ghost Market,

796
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,610
this old fox was already well-known.

797
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,440
I'll never forget

798
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,030
this face!

799
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,100
Scholar Su.

800
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,920
When we arrive at the Ghost Market,

801
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,179
don't get frightened.

802
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,550
Thanks for the reminder.

803
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,360
This isn't my first visit.

804
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,880
Official Wu, this isn't

805
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,540
your first time either, is it?

806
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,150
Indeed.

807
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,440
As a Judicial Official in Chang'an,

808
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,239
I have to visit

809
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,590
this Ghost Market from time to time.

810
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:27,760
The Ever-changing Master's residence

811
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,360
is behind the Ghost Market's Yin Mountain

812
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,440
next to the Earth God Temple.

813
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,320
Our scouts report

814
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,550
he hasn't left the Ghost Market for days.

815
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,070
So

816
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,239
we should get something today.

817
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,449
Official Wu,

818
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,590
you've gathered
all this information overnight.

819
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:42,320
Truly impressive efficiency.

820
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,590
I'm impressed.

821
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,659
Scholar Su.

822
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,960
I don't quite understand.

823
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,280
Is this yin-yang merchant

824
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,400
connected to the attack on His Majesty

825
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,600
at Weicheng Station?

826
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,210
Whether there's a connection,

827
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,460
it is hard to say right now.

828
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,700
It's truly uncertain.

829
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,280
This is the place.

830
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,230
Wait for me here.

831
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,460
I'll bring him out.

832
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,670
Wait.

833
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,670
I think

834
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:35,360
we should try diplomacy before force.

835
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,230
The two of us will go in to investigate,

836
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:38,630
while you stay outside

837
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:39,980
as backup. How's that?

838
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,460
As you wish.

839
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,010
Let's go.

840
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,180
Is the master home?

841
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
I'm here on business,

842
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,800
so I'll just come in.

843
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,600
Cover your face.

844
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,750
Sir,

845
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,450
you must be the Ever-changing Master?

846
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:47,960
It's like this.

847
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,190
This is my niece.

848
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,680
She was once beautiful,

849
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:56,230
but unfortunately suffered burns

850
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:57,880
in a fire.

851
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,440
She can't even find a husband now.

852
00:36:59,440 --> 00:36:59,840
So

853
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,240
we've come seeking your help.

854
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,670
Do you know the price?

855
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:06,600
Yes.

856
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,070
Three gold coins.

857
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,280
I have them ready.

858
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,070
Then make your choice.

859
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:45,960
Choose one.

860
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:48,960
Niece,

861
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,960
do you see one you like?

862
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,630
No! No!

863
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,590
I heard these

864
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,760
are all peeled off

865
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,630
from dead people's faces.

866
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,240
Nonsense!

867
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,970
Those are just rumors.

868
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,030
Of course they're rumors.

869
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,320
How could something
peeled from a dead face

870
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,280
be as tender and fresh as mine?

871
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:13,760
The reason it costs three gold coins

872
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,760
is because it was skinned alive—

873
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,920
no easy task.

874
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,280
You beast!

875
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,280
Those girls were so young

876
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:25,190
when you...

877
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,480
Yingtao!

878
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,670
Don't be rash.

879
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,150
Ever-changing Master.

880
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:41,920
Let me ask you.

881
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,150
Have you sold this face mask before?

882
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,480
I've handled so many

883
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,230
I really can't remember.

884
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,590
Can't remember?

885
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:53,550
I'll smash you to death!

886
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,070
Yingtao!

887
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,510
I think

888
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,800
we should take him

889
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,710
back to the office for questioning first.

890
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,480
Official Wu is right.

891
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,760
Su Wuming!

892
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,400
Save me!

893
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,440
Save me!

894
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,400

Lu Lingfeng!

899
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:02,840
What happened?

900
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,590
My brother was taken

901
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:06,190
by that human-face raptor
at the ghost market!

902
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,550
I've already sent people

903
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,400
to search for Su Wuming
throughout the city.

904
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,110
Any news?

905
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,510
Nothing yet.

906
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,110
It's all my fault.

907
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:17,880
That bird had a human face

908
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,400
and could shoot crossbow arrows.

909
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,130
It was completely unexpected.

910
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,280
And that Ever-changing Master
who was already caught

911
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,440
also escaped during the chaos.

912
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,710
Self-blame is useless.

913
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,710
Send more people.

914
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,480
Don't overlook
the rural counties outside the city.

915
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,030
Search for Scholar Su with all your might.

916
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,510
Yes.

Any clues about my brother?

920
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,130
Since it happened at the ghost market,

921
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,030
we'll start our investigation there.

922

923
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,330
stay here and take care of Fei.

925
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,200
follow me to the ghost market.
