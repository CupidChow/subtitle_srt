[Episode 9]

3
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:40,170
And since you injured Liu,

4
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,620
I'm going to kill you!

5
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:42,280
Wait!

6
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
You can kill me,

7
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,560
but before you do it,

8
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,509
please,

9
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,400
help me find this golden tablet.

10
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,350
It concerns the very fate
of the Tang Empire.

11
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,590
What golden tablet?

12
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,870
This golden tablet...

13
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,290
There's a thief on the rafters!

14
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,830
Don't move!

15
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,840
He must be the one
who stole the golden tablet!

16
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,870
Catch him!

17
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,730
Using a hidden weapon against me?

18

[Sublime Virtue]

19
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,010
I'm just a treasure hunter.

20
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,370
The golden tablet is on me;

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
take it.

22
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,610

[to absolve all of her sins.]

28
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,150
My client said

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,220
he'd pay me 10 gold coins
for this golden tablet.

30
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,840
What's your client's name?

31
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,640
I don't know.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,400
He dressed like a hermit,

33
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,150
with white hair and beard,

34
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,000
but his face

35
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,320
looked quite young.

36
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,560
How did you know?

37
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,520
Wu Zhao of Zhou?

38
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,130
This thing you're looking for

39
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,400
is no ordinary item.

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,080
If you find it,

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,850
there will be
7 more coins waiting for you.

42
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,920
If you already have so much gold,

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
why spend it

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,340
to find other gold?

45
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,060
Even if the tablet is special,

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,030
it's still just made of gold.

47
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,400
You treasure hunters

48
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,730
have one rule to follow—

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,240
ask only what the task is,

50
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,560
not why.

51
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,880
Otherwise...

52
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,690
Otherwise, we'll die.

[Treasure Hunter]

54
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,970
Forgive my prying.

55
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,260
I'll take the job.

56
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:43,960
But...

57
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,560
are you sure the treasure is in Chang'an?

58
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,150
Yes.

59
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,150
How do I contact you when I find it?

60
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:50,470
You have one month.

61
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,380
At the end of the month,

62
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,640
meet me at the foot of Dayan Pagoda.

63
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,630
[Law Before Power]

64
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,520
Is this him?

65
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,240
It's him.

66
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,360
You must recall carefully

67
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
and provide us clues.

68
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,510
That way you could redeem yourself
through merit.

69
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,240
Tell me,

70
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,430
that day, when you were drinking
at the restaurant,

71
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,269
did anyone mention the Empress's affair?

72
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,480
Yes.

73
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,680
So I'm telling you,

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,590
what's recorded in the Chronicles of Shasi

75
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,000
is just the tip of the iceberg.

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,150
I was completely captivated.

77
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:29,360
[Law Before Power]

78
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,430
The hermit was so happy to hear that

79
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,110
and even raised a toast to them.

80
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,640
However,

81
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,270
he might not have been genuinely happy.

82
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:38,070
What do you mean?

83
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,130
In our line of work,

84
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,790
observation is crucial.

85
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,980
I caught a glimpse of...

86
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,040
[Discipline and Service]

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,840
Take him away.

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,090
Bring Mr. Tao in.

89
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,480
Move.

90
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Those who drank with him said

91
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
Kuai Wu could really hold his liquor,

92
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,520
so he couldn't have been drunk that night.

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,950
Looks like whether he was drunk or not

94
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,190
had nothing to do
with his alcohol tolerance.

95
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,190
The hermit must have drugged him.

96
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:27,800
Kneel!

97
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,150
Why are you treating an old man like that?

98
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,010
He injured Liu.

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,500
I'd kill him if I could!

100
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,940
Did you hear that, Tao?

101
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,480
If you don't confess truthfully,

102
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,810
you'll come to a bad end.

103
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:44,680
[Discipline and Service]

104
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,360
You turned your home into a temple,

105
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,630
and the purple-robed,
handsome bearded man you worship

106
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,540
looks much like Zhangsun Wuji.

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,940
You even call him Duke Zhao when praying.

108
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,470
Then there's no mistake.

109
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,430
The statues kneeling in front of him

110
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:59,040
must be Xu Jingzong, Li Yifu,

111
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,200
and Yuan Gongyu.

112
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,000
Do you really think staying silent

113
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
can hide who you are?

114
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,870
You claim

115
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,940
this golden tablet

116
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,870
concerns the fate of the Tang Empire.

117
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,160
Let me see

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
what this is.

119
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,340

131
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
If I remember correctly,

132
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,510
in the first year of Jiushi,

133
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,560
The Empress, still on the throne,

134
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:59,270
went to Sanyang Palace on Mount Shicong

135
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,750
and ordered Daoist Hu Chao
to climb Mount Song

136
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,600
and cast a golden tablet from Junji Peak

137
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,160
to dispel misfortune

138
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:09,950
and cleanse her sins.

139
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:11,830
This must be it.

140
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,120
Why is it in your house,

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,920
weighed down by a stone?

142
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,070

147
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,920

When I was young, I had a fiery temper

[Li Fengjie,
Old Courtier of the Eastern Capital]

152
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,510
and some skill in martial arts.

153
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,000
Later, I roamed the capital

154
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,850
and accused an official of wrongdoing.

155
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,390
That was about 50 years ago, wasn't it?

156
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,370
How do you know?

157
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
My mentor, Master Di,

158
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,030
mentioned your name

159
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,130
while telling me about court affairs.

160
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,680
I'm just a rogue.

161
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,120
I don't deserve to be mentioned

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,600
by Master Di.

163
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,680
When Emperor Gaozong was on the throne,

164
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,190
the Empress wanted to remove

165
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,850
Duke Zhao, Zhangsun Wuji.

166
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,390
Her confidant Xu Jingzong

167
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,770
saw an opportunity

168
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,190
and accused Duke Zhao

169
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,430
of forming a faction

170
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,080
with the official I accused,

171
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,280
plotting rebellion,

172
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,650
and even asked me to fabricate evidence.

173
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,610
Later, Duke Zhao was demoted

174
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,080
and forced to commit suicide,

175
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,480
and the Empress
officially took power after that.

176
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,840
When the dust settled

177
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,870
and I saw the truth,

178
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,870
I was full of regret.

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I was afraid,

180
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,120
afraid of being silenced by villains,

181
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,360
so I changed my name

182
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,910
and became a coal seller.

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,930
All these years,

184
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,080
I have regretted it

185
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
constantly.

186
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,390
I failed Duke Zhao

187
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and brought harm to the Tang Empire.

188
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,720
So...

189
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,270
you turned your house

190
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,630
into a temple

191
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,830
to worship Duke Zhao?

192
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,390
Yes.

193
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,600
Since then,

194
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,630
I would rather stay in temples

195
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,840
than live in that house.

196
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,860
I have no face

197
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,570
to share a home with Duke Zhao.

198
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,480
Where did you

199
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,600
get this golden tablet?

200
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,000
It should have been thrown off

201
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,240

202
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,790
13 years ago.

203
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,480
I got it 13 years ago.

204
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Wu Zhao persecuted loyal officials

205
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
and then subverted the Tang Empire.

206
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,480
She wanted to use this golden tablet to
dispel misfortune and cleanse her sins.

207
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,120
How could I let her succeed?

208
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,080
I searched under the cliff

209
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,870
for 49 days,

210
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,590
fought all kinds of dangerous animals,

211
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,690
and finally

212
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,430
found the golden tablet.

213
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,600
I weighed it down
with a stone from Mount Tai

214
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,860
and placed it before Duke Zhao's statue.

215
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,440
I wanted to make sure Wu Zhao

216
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,720
would have no chance to atone

217
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,910
and rise again.

218
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,510
I understand your hatred

219
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,390
of the Empress,

220
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,030
but why did you try to kill Wu Yang?

221
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,270
Kill Wu Yang?

222
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,870
I didn't.

223
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,550
You still won't admit it?

224
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,010
I heard it with my own ears.

225
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,670
Yes.

226
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,320
I originally planned to kill Wu Yang,

227
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,700
but I failed.

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,560
For that,

229
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,080
I even stood before Duke Zhao's statue

230
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,870
to beg forgiveness.

231
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:23,630
Why did you want to kill Wu Yang?

232
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,070
Rumors in Chang'an say

233
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,670
the Empress
will be reborn and take the throne again,

234
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,730
and some even claim

235
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,200
Wu Zhao has already reincarnated

236
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,870
and she's right in Shengye District.

237
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,550
I searched all over Shengye District

238
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,080
and discovered that Wu Yang

239
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,480
looks exactly like the Empress

240
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,540
when she was young.

241
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,320
I thought

242
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,870
I had to kill her

243
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,480
to prevent the reincarnated Wu Zhao

244
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,790
from causing chaos
in the Tang Empire again.

245
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:48,000
The concept of reincarnation
is merely a fantasy.

246
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,120
How could you believe it?

247
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,720
Besides,

248
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,030
the Empress passed away 8 years ago,

249
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,150
while Wu Yang is 17 this year.

250
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,980
Her age doesn't match.

251
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:57,850
I don't care about her age!

252
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:00,200
As long as she resembles the Empress,

253
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,270
I want her dead!

254
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,510
At 9 AM,

255
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,360
let's meet at the entrance
of the Chengfo Temple.

256
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:04,840
Okay.

257
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,810
See you tomorrow then.

258
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,000
I watched for days

259
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,000
but never found an opportunity.

260
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,150
Later I heard

261
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,270
that Wu Yang had disappeared.

262
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,910
Officer,

263
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,120
considering my advanced age,

264
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,030
please let me go.

265
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,960
You seriously wounded my constable,

266
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,910
which is already a crime.

267
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,240
Moreover, because of rumors,

268
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,960
you attempted to harm an innocent person,

269
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,290
which is unforgivable.

270
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,790
Take him away.

271
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,400
Tell Yongzhou Prison

272
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,120
to keep him under strict guard.

273
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:42,780
-Yes.
-Yes.

274
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,390
Wait.

275
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,890
This isn't fair.

276
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,960
I want to know

277
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,050
where I slipped up

278
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,660
so you could track me down.

279
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,820
Well, well, you old fellow.

280
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,670
You look about my age.

You are a coal seller,

282

neither a fairy nor a beauty,

283
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,600
so what are you doing with that

284
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
Fairy Beauty Powder?

285
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,510
How...

286
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,200
How did you know?

287
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,460
Let me tell you,

288
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,280
my nose was a gift from the immortals.

289
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,840
It's all my fault.

290
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,440
To investigate Wu Yang

291
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,870
without arousing suspicion,

292
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,840
I went into that shop

293
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,000
and bought a box of Fairy Beauty Powder.

294
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,060
Then I couldn't bear to throw it away.

Liu,

302
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,630
no need to be so polite.

303
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,670
With your status,

304
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,600
I don't deserve this.

305
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:50,600
You were injured capturing a criminal.
That is honorable.

306
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,790
You are a great hero.

307
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,960
By Master Fei's order, I prepared medicine

308
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,910
for a hero.

309
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
It's my honor.

be considered a hero?

Of course.

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,390
I've always felt

315
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,910
I don't look heroic enough.

316
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,150
If I had five strands of long beard,

317
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,870

318
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,480

319
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,000
a bit like Guan Yu?

320
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,360
Yes.

321
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,640
Stick on a beard
and you'll look even more like him.

322
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200

00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,790

to disguise himself as a hermit.

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,720
This looks like Wu Yang's comb.

381
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,720
Can I be friends with you two?

382
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,000
I don't have any friends.

383
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,690
-Of course.
-Of course.

384
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,000
Wu Yang.

385
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
The comb on your bun is so beautiful.

386
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,180
She was indeed wearing

387
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,640
this comb that day.

388
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:17,319
Official Lu,

389
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,790
we found Householder Chenkong's trail

390
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,990
in Shengye District.

391
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,030
I've already summoned

392
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,030
the Empress's spirit.

393
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,960
Now it's up to you.

394
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,040
Well?

395
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,550
Did you hear the Empress's voice?

396
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,440
No?

397
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:02,810
Are you capable or not?

398
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,240
I'm the best spirit medium

399
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,000
in the entire Chang'an!

400
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:13,240
But whether you can meet the spirit

401
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,810
depends on your sincerity.

402
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,290
Heaven and Earth can see my sincerity.

403
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,350
Very well!

404
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,930
Then I'll use another method—

405
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,880
to channel the Empress's spirit

406
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,970
into my body

407
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,590
so she can speak to you.

408
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,750
It's what people commonly call
spirit possession.

409
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,420
Can you really do that?

410
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,030
Of course.

411
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,510
But this technique

412
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,680
will consume more of my vital energy.

413
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You must give me two more gold coins.

414
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,740
As long as

415
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,570
you can help me

416
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,330
meet with the Empress in the spirit realm,

417
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,920
I'll give you three.

418
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:30,070
I am the Empress.

419
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,400
Who are you?

420
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,030
It's me.

421
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,270
It's me!

422
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:58,400
Mr. Shen.

423
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,270
I am Mr. Shen!

424
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,110
Mr. Shen?

425
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,000
Empress,

426
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,320
don't you remember me?

427
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,950
I served by your side for

428
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,740
more than 3 years.

429
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,400
How could I not remember you?

430
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,550
When I showed you the slightest coldness,

431
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,030
you burned down Ming Hall.

432
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,670
Why are you trying to kill me?

433
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,160
Don't you worship the Empress

434
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,440
above all?

435
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,080
You fool!

436
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,270
You don't even know

437
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,720
who burned the Ming Hall,

438
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,060
yet you dared to cheat me out of money.

439
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,480
Go serve as a night watch in hell.

440
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,670
There's blood on his hands.

441
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,770
I just killed a chicken.

442
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,830
A chicken.

443
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:38,390
Take him down.

444
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,230
In the end she lost her life

445
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,070
over money.

446
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,720
Chenkong did it.

447
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,920
No! Not my face!

448
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,030
Don't hit my face!

449
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,030
Official Lu,

450
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,770
aren't you going to stop this?

451
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,070
Stop it! Stop!

452
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:23,550
Let me.

453
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:26,830
Yingtao! Yingtao!

454
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,070
We need to interrogate him first.

455
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's interrogate him first.

456
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,510
Why did you kill Ling, the night watch

457
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,710
of Shengye District?

458
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,280
She deserved it.

459
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,720
Stupid as a pig.

460
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:41,440
Xue Huaiyi was the one
who burned Ming Hall.

461
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:41,460
My name is Shen Yu.

462
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,070
[Householder Chenkong]

463
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:44,700
I don't mind being cheated out of money,

464
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,680
[Shen Yu, Wu Zetian's Former Favorite]

465
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,790
but she used the Empress's name
to deceive me,

466
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,070
so I had to kill her.

467
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,680
So you are Shen Yu?

468
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,720
I've heard a lot about you.

469
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,200
I should never have lived in this world.

470
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,110
Back then,

471
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,680
among those

472
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,000
self-righteous scholars,

473
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,590
my name was a disgrace.

474
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,270
But I didn't care.

475
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:11,770
The 3 years beside the Empress

476
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,270
were the best

477
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,000
of my life.

478
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:16,550
It was you

479
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,750
who took Wu Yang

480
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,400
from the backyard of Yu Residence?

481
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,160
Now,

482
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,720
where is she?

483
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,270
Is she alive?

484
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,710
I don't know where she is.

485
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,590
This was found in your quarter.

486
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,270
We've already had Wu Yang's mother
identify it.

487
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,930
Are you still going to deny it?

488
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:41,720
Fake hermit!

489
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,020
Fake householder!

490
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,910
What have you done to Wu Yang?

491
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,610
I'll kill you!

492
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,830
I'll kill you!

493
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,170
How dare you!

494
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,850
Fake householder!

495
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,650
Fake hermit!

496
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,110
Give me back Wu Yang!

497
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,640
Chi Ying!

498
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,160
We all understand how you feel.

499
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,710
But we're in the middle of questioning him

500
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,640
and the truth hasn't been revealed yet.

501
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,720
You're yelling in court

502
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,160
and attempting to commit murder!

503
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,240
What kind of behavior is this?

504
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,790
I want him to return Wu Yang to me!

505
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,030
What have you done to Wu Yang?

506
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,830
Fake hermit!

507
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,310
-Fake householder!
-Calm down.

508
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,110
Give me back Wu Yang!

509
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:18,680
Go! Go!

510
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,440
Give me back Wu Yang!

511
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,270
Let me go! Give me back Wu Yang!

512
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,360
You still won't talk?

513
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,410
Where is Wu Yang?

514
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,160
I truly don't know where Wu Yang is.

515
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,360
Then how did this comb

516
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,750
end up in your hands?

517
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,640
Just put me in jail already.

518
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,310
Official Lu,

519
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,780
how about this?

520
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,750
Let's all go

521
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,480
and leave him with Madam Yingtao

522
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,410
and Chi Ying.

523
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,060
They

524
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,240
will tear your face apart.

525
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,830
No! No!

526
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:51,590
Don't!

527
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,900
Don't let them hit my face.

528
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,530
Otherwise, the Empress won't recognize me.

529
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,550
Then tell us the truth.

530
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,400
I truly don't know

531
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,330
where Wu Yang is.

532
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,140
The first time I saw Wu Yang

533
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,850
was at Chengfo Temple.

534
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
At that time,

535
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,680
I had already decided to become a monk.

536
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,920
Buddhist Guangxiao agreed

537
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,520
to shave my head the next day.

538
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,880
Amitabha.

539
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,650
[Great Buddha Hall]

540
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:55,760
Back then,

541
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,200
I was summoned into the palace

542
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,160
as an imperial physician by the Empress.

543
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:00,830
I couldn't see

544
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,090
the Empress every day.

545
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,110
So the Empress

546
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,680
rewarded me
with a portrait of her younger self.

547
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,830
I needed to look at it 1000 times a day.

548
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:09,840
Wu Yang looks just like her.

549
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:11,110
No,

550
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:12,790
not just like her.

551
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,420
She is the Empress herself.

552
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
Later, because the two Zhangs
gained favor,

553
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,400
I left the palace.

554
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,440
But my heart

555
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,480
never left the Empress.

556
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,440
The year the Empress passed away,

557
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,550
I came to Chang'an

558
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,310
and built her favorite reclining Buddha

559
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:31,110
at Chengfo Temple,

560
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,240
because I wanted

561
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,400
to always be by her side.

562
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,980
But unexpectedly,

563
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,750
the Buddha granted my wish

564
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,610
and reunited me with the Empress.

565
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,400
I immediately gave up my ordination.

566
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,400
I wanted to return

567
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,740
to the Empress's side.

568
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,350

Yes, she did.

fly at night and hide during the day.

725

They love the dark and fear the light,

726
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,000
so once daylight comes,

727
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,800

Lu Lingfeng lit his fire striker,

00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,560
they stopped.

742
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,590
Yes,

743
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,590
I wanted the Buddha's golden body

744

and Wu Yang's mortal body to merge,

745
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,920

the Empress's soul.

747
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,550
I also learned one thing.

748
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,110
The golden tablet that the Empress

749
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,840
had Taoist Hu Chao offer to the gods

750
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
atop Mount Song as atonement back then

751
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,630
was stolen.

752
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,230
It's now in Chang'an.

753
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,190
So I hired a treasure hunter.

754
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,000
I thought that

755
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,480
once I obtained the golden tablet,

756
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,630
I would hide it inside the Buddha as well.

757
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,280
Then,

758
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,050

-Chi Ying.

You should go home.

When they built this Buddha,

799
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,010
I donated 5,000 coins.

800
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,440
I can worship whenever I want.

801
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,770

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,670
Chi Ying was praying

816
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,180
and Mr. Tao was asleep.

817
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,150
Neither of them would leave.

818
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,070
So I had no choice
but to blow out the candles

819
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,330
and try to scare them off using the birds.

820
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,360

[Great Buddha Hall]

830
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,210
It wasn't until 3 AM

831
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,960
that I finally coaxed Chi Ying to leave

832
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,400
and drove Mr. Tao out of Chengfo Temple.

833
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:57,710
Wu Yang,

834
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,650
come on, look.

00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,670
This is the Buddha

How do you like it?

838
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,670
Do you remember who I am now?

839
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,110
Lunatic!

840
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,930
It seems the Empress's spirit within you

841
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,000
hasn't awakened yet.

842
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,110
It doesn't matter.

843
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,920

844
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,050

847
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,150
There,

848
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,320
I'll make you

849

850
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:21,150

Death itself isn't frightening;

855
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:39,640
what's frightening

856
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,050
is being alive and being bound.

857
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,740
In that moment,

858
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,030
I hesitated.

859
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:56,920
She was so calm,

860
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,710
as if her heart

861
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:03,480
could hold mountains and rivers

862
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,000
and contain floods and beasts.

863

She truly is the Empress!

864
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:13,840
Tell me,

865
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,030
how could I bear to kill her?

866
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,150
It's you?

867
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,070
In a daze,

868
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,190
I saw someone

but I had no strength at all.

872
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:48,630
Then,

873
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:51,070
I blacked out,

874
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:54,310
until this young lady

875
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,690

[Law Before Power]

877
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,280
I blame myself
for not recognizing you sooner,

878
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,880
which let you keep doing evil

879

and killing Auntie Ling.

He...

883
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:07,970
deserved to die even more!

884
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,480
He dared to publicly

885
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:10,680
slander the Empress!

886
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,430
I simply offered him a cup of wine

887
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,850
with a bit of poison in it.

888
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,550
I didn't drink much today,

889
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,390
but why am I...

890
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,840
so terribly drunk?

891
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,480
I did this with great satisfaction.

892
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,390
From now on,

893
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,210
I'll kill whoever dares

to slander the Empress

895
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,200

as an imperial physician.

what you're doing is murder.

900

You are simply a disgrace
