Yes.

This is a matter
between my student and me.

what I want to ask.

14
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,100
Yeah.

15
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,750
The death of a mere coroner
is insignificant,

16
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,280
yet it happened right when

17
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,120

00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,310

00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,970
That makes it highly unusual.

After I retired,

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,960
Only then did Chang'an have

the so-called Five Great Coroners.

24
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,120
They are:

00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,940
Dong Yue, who worked
for the Ministry of Justice;

26
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,520
Xiahou Shuang, who mostly serves

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,680

29
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,840
Zheng Hao, coroner of Chang'an County;

30
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:51,870
and finally,

31
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,130
the one I just expelled from my tutelage—

32
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,310
Zhong Shizai.

33
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:57,150
Now that Dong Yue is dead,

34
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,800
the other four all have motives
for the crime.

35
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,000
Of course.

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,980
When Dong Yue was shot and killed,

37
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,560
Shizai and I

38
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,780
were drinking together with Sheriff Su,

39
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,030
so he can be ruled out first.

Thank you for your guidance.

41

Also,

42
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,590
Shizai just told me

43
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,750
that three days ago,

44
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,360
he'd already heard the news.

45

The other three

46
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,120
are all colleagues in the government,

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,360
so they must have known as well.

48
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,870
Therefore, if anyone pretends not to know,

49
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,090
that person would also be suspicious.

50

is just an old coroner.

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,079
He's actually helping you with the case.

54
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:48,110
Maybe he means well.

55

Isn't his analysis

56
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,680
very solid?

57
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,860
But the ones with the motive to kill

58
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,460
aren't limited to coroners.

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,010
he still wants to join some contest

191
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,840
I haven't heard anything about it.

192
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:37,960
Well, now,

193
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,380
I've told you about it.

194
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,220
Will you participate?

195
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,440
Hard to say.

196
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,720
I don't want to lose face.

197
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,750
If I couldn't place in the top three,

198
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,080
people would laugh at me.

199
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,030
After all,
among the coroners in the capital,

200
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,150
there are many experts.

201
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,150
Although I'm one of
the Five Great Coroners,

202
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,280
I've always been modest and cautious.

203
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,030
I wouldn't dare say I'm fully confident.

204
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,790
Moreover,

205
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,360
I have no family to support,
no mouths to feed.

206
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,550
I don't need to worry about
my descendants getting official posts.

207
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,320
So,

208
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:07,350
I might as well not participate.

209
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,320
This afternoon at three,

210
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,790
where were you, Zheng?

211
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,960
Out hunting.

212
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,270
Those animals hanging outside—

213
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,130
you saw them just now, didn't you?

214
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,080
But those kills

215
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:21,600
don't look like they were shot
in the afternoon.

216
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,870
From the color of the wounds

217
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:27,350
and the smell of the blood,

218
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:30,190
they look more like
they were killed this morning.

219
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,840
Are you showing off

220
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,840
your coroner's knowledge to me?

221
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,750
Zheng Hao,

222
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,440
where's your bow?

223
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,600
What do you want?

224
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,480
Your family is known
for superb archery skills.

225
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,550
I'm sure your bow has been
passed down through generations

226
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,880
and is an excellent one.

227
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,770
I'd like to have a look at it.

228
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,840
What?

229
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,820
You're suspecting me now?

230
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,910
Who said anything about suspicion?

231
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,600
Official Lu just wants to appreciate

232
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,830
your bow, that's all.

233
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,320
Fine.

234
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,870
Wait here.

235
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,910
I'll go get it.

236
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,670
Watch out!

237
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:29,870
It really is you!

238
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,480
Zheng,

239
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,870
how about we go somewhere else for tea?

240
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,800
Zheng Hao,

241
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,360
why did you attack a court official?

242
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,270
Your groundless suspicions

243
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,200
are an insult.

244
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,840
For my ancestor's honor,

245
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,270
I had to shoot that Lu
from Fanyang dead!

246
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,270
So what?

247
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,840
It's a pity that your archery skills
aren't good enough.

248
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,390
You've disgraced your ancestor.

249
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,910
I can certainly
hit a target from 100 paces

250
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,240
and kill you with one arrow.

251
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
With a door in the way,

252
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,060
you got lucky, that's all.

253
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,840
And the second arrow?

254
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,340
I shoot far, not close.

255
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,700
For the second arrow, you were too close!

256
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:17,240
You can't aim well when targets are close?

257
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,670
That's the first time
I've ever heard that.

258
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,200
Come, bring me his quiver.

259
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,520
This quiver

260
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:32,320
has been used for years, hasn't it?

261
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,480
Are you blind,

262
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,080
or are you deliberately
looking down on me?

263
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,810
Can't you tell it's brand-new?

264
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,020
I bought it the day before yesterday!

265
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,360
Is that so?

266
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,790
Zheng Hao,

267
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,510
at the Dukang Restaurant,

268
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:52,120
Coroner Dong Yue was hit by an arrow

269
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,510
at 3 PM.

270
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,080
You shot it, didn't you?

271
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,030
Dong Yue is dead?

272
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,560
Nothing to do with me.

273
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,750
Did I say he died?

274
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
I heard from others that he died.

275
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,750
Measure his foot.

276
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:18,000
The length matches perfectly.

277
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,790
Zheng Hao,

278
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,650
directly across
from the Dukang Restaurant,

279
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,390
on the second floor of the wine storeroom,

280
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,720
we found the killer's footprints.

281
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:28,250
They match yours exactly.

282
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,550
What more do you have to say?

283
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,210
Plenty of people have feet this size.

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
These boots are completely ordinary.

285
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,690
You could find 10,000 pairs
just like them in Chang'an.

286
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,490
That doesn't count as evidence.

287
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,960
Just now, you said

288
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,840
this is a new quiver.

289
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,510
In the Tang Empire,

290
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,670
everything follows regulations.

291
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:49,080
A standard quiver

292
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,510
holds 30 arrows.

293
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,920
Your quiver is quite expensive,

294
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,540
and quivers like this

295
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,380
usually come with new arrows.

296
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,670
And your arrows

297
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,360
are indeed brand new.

298
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,630
You also claim you can hit a target
100 paces away

299
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,600
and never need a second shot when hunting.

300
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,260
Therefore,

301
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,910
one arrow for the hare,

302
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,470
one arrow for the fox.

303
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,370
According to hunting custom,

304
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,870
arrows that kill game
don't need to be retrieved.

305
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,440
They're left as offerings
to the mountain god.

306
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,470
After the two arrows you shot at me,

307
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,440
you should have 26 new arrows

308
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:19,960
left in your quiver.

309
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,120
But there are only 25 here.

310
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,960
Where's the missing one?

311
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,150
That…

312
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:28,870
Bring it up.

313
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Exactly the same.

314
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,750
The brand-new arrow that killed Dong Yue

315
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,360
came from your quiver!

316
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,030
When it comes to martial skills
and weapons,

317
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,560
you can't fool Official Lu.

318
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,030
I was hunting in the mountains.

319
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:58,790
At 3 PM…

320
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,120
At 3 PM, I hadn't even come back!

321
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,510
Do you have witnesses?

322
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,320
The beasts and birds in the mountains

323
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,060
can testify for me.

324
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,080
Sheriff Su,

325
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,150
no need to waste words on him.

326
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,250
Just beat him up.

327
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,320
But for someone like him,

328
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,390
beating him
in the county office is useless.

329
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,080
Drag him to the East Market
and beat him there!

330
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,480
Let everyone in Chang'an

331
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,620
watch him get beaten!

332
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,220
A gentleman can be killed,
but not humiliated!

333
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,720
You'd better not sully

334
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,980
the word "gentleman."

335
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,910
What are you all standing around for?

336
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,720
Take him to the East Market and beat him!

337
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,600
After that, drag him to the West Market
and keep beating him!

338
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,150
And then to the Ghost Market!

339
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,810
-Yes.
-Yes.

340
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:41,960
Move!

341
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:42,750
Wait!

342
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,330
Just kill me!

343
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:49,030
I'm the one who killed Dong Yue.

344
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,750
I confess!

345
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:57,910
Zheng Hao,

346
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,680
on the court,

347
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,480
you need to think carefully
before you speak.

348
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,100
Because everything you say

349
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,870
will be recorded

350
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,510
and used as evidence to convict you.

351
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,030
Great, great.

352
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:16,960
Officers,

353
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,150
greetings.

354
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,270
Dong Yue.

355
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,120
Didn't you see me?

356
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:32,910
I did.

357
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,700
You're just a coroner.

358
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,570
Why do you always

359
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,930
hang around officials?

360
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:39,930
We all come from gentry families.

361
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,080
I don't care who your ancestors were.

362
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,440
You…

363
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,370
You're nothing but a coroner now,

364
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,150
and one

365
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:47,080
whose skills are inferior to mine.

366
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,140
Just you wait,

367
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,390
Dong Yue!

368
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,360
This happened half a month ago.

369
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,390
I'd almost forgotten about it.

370
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,250
But yesterday,

371
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,440
there was a case in Chang'an County

372
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,360
where two corpses were found
at the same time.

373
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,420
Zhong Shizai and I each examined one.

374
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,950
When we were comparing our findings…

375
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,980
[To the Zheng of Xingyang]

376
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,380
Zhong Shizai.

377
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:19,200
Who sent me this letter?

378
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:19,960
A letter?

379
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,740
I didn't see anything.

380
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:25,320
The Zheng family of Xingyang
can't be humiliated like that.

381
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,440
To wash away this shame,

382
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,370
tomorrow at 3 PM,

383
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,720
at the Gaochang Tavern,

384
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,550
by the second-floor window
of the backyard warehouse,

385
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,150
nock an arrow and draw the bow

386
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,550
to shoot at Meiwu
in the Dukang Restaurant.

387
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,760
You can take your revenge then.

388
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,270
What does the letter say?

389
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,840
Nothing.

390
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:44,510
I was half-convinced.

391
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,000
I had just bought
a new bow and arrows.

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,240
I went hunting early in the morning.

393
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,510
I shot a hare first

394
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,070
and then a fox.

395
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,490
Yet I was still agitated and restless,

396
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,580
so I took the bow and arrows

397
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,880
and went up to the second floor
of that warehouse.

398
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,030
You killed Dong Yue—

399
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,440
it wasn't just for revenge, was it?

400
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,790
Can you swear

401
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:53,960
it had nothing to do with the upcoming

402
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,090
Coroners' Contest?

403
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,340
Of course it had something to do with it.

404
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,110
My ancestor backed the wrong man,

405
00:17:59,110 --> 00:17:59,830
and as a result,

406
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:01,270
Emperor Taizong demoted us
to the lowest social class.

407
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,440
By my generation,

408
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,640
I've already risen to be one of

409
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,830
the Five Great Coroners in Chang'an.

410
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,000
If I win this contest,

411
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,070
I might be able to shed this lowly status.

412
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,440
Getting rid of Dong Yue

413
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,270
would make my chances much greater.

414
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,070
After all, Dong's coroner skills

415
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,210
really were superb.

416
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,270
Among the five of us,

417
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,760
he was number one.

418
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:21,990
Where is that letter?

419
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:22,920
It's on me.

420
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:32,650
[To wash the shame of your family,
tomorrow at 3 PM,]

421
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,660
[come to Gaochang Tavern]

422
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,850
[and shoot at Meiwu
of the Dukang Restaurant.]

423
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:38,300
[To wash the shame of your family,
tomorrow at 3 PM,]

424
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:38,920
[come to Gaochang Tavern]

425
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,640
[and shoot at Meiwu
of the Dukang Restaurant.]

426
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,580
[Please come for a drink
two days from now, at 3 PM.]

427
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,440
[At Meiwu of the Dukang Restaurant,
from General Lyu.]

428
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,540
This beard must be a disguise,

429
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,150
but it's done quite well.

430
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,200
Because Gao Wuniang's

431
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,550
strongest impression of him

432
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:49,400
was the beard.

433
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,720
She couldn't clearly describe
his eyes or brows at all.

434
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,440
So I find it hard to picture

435
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,960
what he looks like

436
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:57,430
without that fake beard.

437
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,790
Xijun,

438
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,940
thank you a lot.

439
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,690
Enough talk about the case.

440
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,030
Su Wuming has returned
to official service.

441
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,400
It's his first day on duty,

442
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,160
and I made him look good.

443
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:10,950
Flawless, wasn't it?

444
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,090
This really is worth celebrating.

445
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,720
Let's get drunk tonight and go home late.

446
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,750
Fei,

447
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:19,510
tomorrow I still need to help Master

448
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,750
investigate cases in the districts.

449
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,950
I can't get too drunk.

450
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,960
But it really is worth celebrating.

451
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,620
Sheriff Su,

452
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,850
I should toast you.

453
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,160
Yes, Wuming.

454
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,270
I'm happy for you.

455
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,310
Su Wuming,

456
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,030
I'm happy for you too.

457
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:33,270
Also, although I'm

458
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,030
a secret agent of Yongzhou Prefecture,

459
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:36,840
from now on, I may have to

460
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,550
spend a lot of time over
in Wannian County.

461
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,510
After all, he

462
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
not only knows no martial arts

463
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,310
but also loves stirring up trouble.

464
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,510
I have to protect him.

465
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,510
Granted!

466
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:50,370
Congratulations.

467
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,400
I hope from now on,

468
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,110
you rise swiftly through the ranks.

469
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,070
Just as you said in the desert,

470
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,460
we as fellow disciples

471
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,950
will fight together for the prosperity

472
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,020
of the Tang Empire.

473
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:09,330
You guys are

474
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,790
either my family

475
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,160
or friends.

476
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,440
Let's drink together,

477
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,750
share joy, and weather storms together.

478
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,880
Walking hand in hand, we fear nothing.

479
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,270
Great!

480
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,350
Great!

481
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,850
Here.

482
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:29,720
Cheers!

483
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:34,790
Yingtao,

484
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,460
I'm afraid you can only have this one cup.

485
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,930
I've suddenly remembered
that in today's Chang'an,

486
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,220
there is someone who is the least safe

487
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:45,280
and needs your protection.

488
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,070
Who?

489
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,550
Is there anyone less safe than you,

490
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,440
Su Wuming?

491
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,830
"Though dwelling hidden in the shadows,"

492
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,680
"my heart has long been pledged
to the sovereign."

493
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,080
"Suddenly, she's gone."

494
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,060
"I feel sorrow as her light dims."

495
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,270
"So I leave the lowlands
for higher ground."

496
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,790
"My feet advance
while my spirit lingers,"

497
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,310
"leaving feelings behind
in imagination,"

498
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,910
"looking back with sorrow."

499
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,030
"Hoping the spirit's form might reappear,"

500
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,230
"I guide a light boat and row upstream,"

501
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,690
"floating along the long river,
forgetting to return."

502
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:11,000
[Zhong Shizai's son, Zhong Pi]

503
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,550
"My thoughts stretch endlessly,
increasing my longing."

504
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,280
"The night…"

505
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,840
"the night is restless and sleepless."

506
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,070
"Tears…"

507
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,590
"Tears…"

508
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,240
What's going on?

509
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,440
You've been reciting
"Ode to the Goddess of Luo"

510
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
for two days already.

511
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,300
Do you really need a third day?

512
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,360
I told you to study hard at home.

513
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,720
-You've been slacking off, right?
-Father!

514
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:32,760
Pi didn't slack off.

515
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,000
[Zhong Shizai's daughter, Zhong Jie]

516
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,350
He's been studying very hard.

517
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,210
It's just that…

518
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,200
Just what?

519
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:39,130
The rascal next door
messed with us again.

520
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,880
He said Pi shouldn't study
poetry and literature.

521
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,680
That he should follow you
and learn to be a coroner.

522
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,490
What exactly did he say?

523
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,550
He… he said…

524
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:50,310
Jie.

525
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:51,960
Zhong Pi,

526
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:53,480
you're a boy,

527
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,000
already 12 years old.

528
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,680
Do you still need

529
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,200
your sister
to say something like that for you?

530
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
That rascal said

531
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
you're a coroner,

532
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,030
so in the future, I can only be a coroner.

533
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,960
Coroners just examine dead people.

534
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,070
There's no need to be literate

535
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,870
or memorize Cao Zijian's poems.

536
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,400
Even if I memorize them,

537
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
people will only laugh at me.

538
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,910
I wanted to go beat him up,

539
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,730
but I was afraid I couldn't win,

540
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,030
and then he'd have the chance

541
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,760
to bully Jie.

542
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,060
So I ignored him

543
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,930
and just kept protecting Jie.

544
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:22,400
That's why I fell behind on my recitation.

545
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,470
Very clearly said.

546
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,950
To have a son like you,

547
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,880
I am completely satisfied.

548
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,720
Jie,

549
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,550
you come here too.

550
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,000
Let me

551
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:45,950
tell you some great news.

552
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,410
It won't be long

553
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,160
before I become an official
in the county office.

554
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,680
You'll no longer be a coroner?

555
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,010
I'll still be a coroner,

556
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:55,240
but an officially appointed coroner
in the county office,

557
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,700
no longer of lowly status.

558
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,160
You'll also have the chance

559
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,160
to take the imperial examinations.

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,170
As for Jie,

561
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,750
you've got great talent for painting.

562
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:05,310

563

In the future,

00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,270
you'll even marry into

569
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,750
a noble family.

571
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,160

Thank you, Father.

575
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:22,310
But

576
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,200
I don't want to marry a noble.

577
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,760
I just want to stay and care for you.

I'm already on the final volume.

588

I truly don't dare stop.

589
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,330
I fear I won't finish it,

590
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,750
and it will become

591
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,500
the greatest regret of my life.

592

Father,

593
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,830
today is your birthday.

594
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,020
Don't say such inauspicious things.

Father,

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,510
that old man Sheriff Su brought—

597
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,720
didn't they say he's a miracle doctor?

598
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,000
Why won't you let him

599
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
take a look at your sores?

600
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,160
Although I'm just a coroner,

601
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,270
I do know a bit of medicine.

602
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,400
What I've got is terminal.

603
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,120
There's no curing it.

604
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,790
Then why did you still say

605
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,830
you wanted to join the Coroners' Contest?

606
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,490
I actually took it seriously.

607
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:54,750
Truth be told,

608
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,750
I even felt happy for a moment.

609
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,750
That was for your own future, wasn't it?

610
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,200
No, I was happy for you, Father.

Yes.

Let me hear it.

621
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,110
When a head is severed by a sharp blade,

622
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,790
the cut on the skull is clean and smooth.

623
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,180
For more information,
check the flesh under the neck.

624
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,880
If the tendons are curled and contracted

625

it means the victim was alive
when decapitated.

If the head is cut off after death,

629
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,630

If the body is close to a wall,

632

the coroner needs to check

633
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:41,130
whether there is blood on the wall

634
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,240

In decapitation cases,

637
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,510
the coroner needs to measure

638
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,270
the distance
between the head and the shoulders

639
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,030
and record

640
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:50,160
the position of the head
relative to the body.

641
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:50,920
Furthermore,

642
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,910
fit the head back onto the neck

643
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,340
and measure the neck circumference.

644
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,290
And finally,

645
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,240
have the family identify the body

646
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,280
to confirm it is the same person.

647
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,920
If the murder weapon has a flat tip,

648
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,160
can you record it as stabbing?

No.

Only pointed weapons

651

can be recorded as stabbing.

652
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:10,880
Good.

the neck stiffens,

664
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,190
and then the shoulders and thighs

665
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,470
go into spasms

666
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,350
until the whole body convulses,

bending over and over.

669
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:47,010
The pain is among the worst
a person can suffer.

This is a truly vicious poison.

In murder cases,

672
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,550
you rarely see it.

Some coroners

674
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,640
never encounter it in their whole career.

675
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,870
But to be a truly good coroner,

676
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,070
you must know
how to recognize this poison.

00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,640
Thief,

750
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,680
how dare you break into my house?

751
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:07,960
Pi,

752
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,550
instead of studying,

753
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,160
what are you doing here?

754
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:13,030
Father, it's you.

755
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,510
Didn't you say

756
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,000
one should focus on studying first

757
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,450
and practice martial arts
if there's extra energy?

758
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:18,310
Mastering both civil and martial arts

759
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,640
makes one exceptional.

760
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,310
Did I say that?

761
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,510
You did.

762
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,170
Why did you climb over the wall?

763
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,700
That's part of martial training too.

764
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,110
By the way, a couple of days ago, you said

765
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:34,160
you wanted to ride horses, right?

766
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:34,640
Yes.

767
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,680
Jie wants to as well,

768
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:36,310
very much!

769
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:37,850
Then we'll ride today.

770
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,350
Pack up with your sister.

771
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:39,880
Let's go.

772
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,780
Coroner Zhong,

773
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,550
you're leaving the city so early.

774
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,480
Off to examine a corpse somewhere?

775
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,530
I'm teaching my children to ride horses.

776
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,320
Official Lu,

777
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,160
please step aside.

778
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,590
And if I don't?

779
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,790
Then I'll just have to ride

780
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,650
right over you.

781
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,400
Fine.

782
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,800
Come on then!

783
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,040
What right do you have to stop me?

784
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,270
If I had no reason,

785
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,610
I wouldn't be standing in your way!

786
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,750
Pi,

787
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,470
Jie,

788
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,340
did you have fun riding today?

789
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,790
-Yes.
-Yes.

790
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,720
Remember what I told you.

791
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,760
When you grow up,

792
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,680
you must become outstanding individuals.

793
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,200
Yes.

794
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Take your sister home.

795
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,150
Father!

796
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,030
Pi,

797
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,360
go home.

798
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,840
Official Lu,

799
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,920
you refrained from fighting

800
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,320
in front of my children.

801
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,550
Thank you.

802
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:27,170
You used Zheng Hao to murder Dong Yue—

803
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,110
killing two birds with one arrow

804
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:29,750
to ensure

805
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,070
you would win

806
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,070
the Coroners' Contest.

807
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,199
That scheme of yours

808
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,060
was far too vicious and underhanded.

809
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,550
It seems

810
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,320
you have no intention
of dismounting and surrendering.

811
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,469
I used the name of General Lyu.

812
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,550
A general may die in battle

813
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,670
but never dismounts to surrender.

814
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,070
Well, well, as a coroner,

815
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:51,150
you can also fight on horseback?

816
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,679
Try me, and you'll know.

817
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,360
Two years ago,

818
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:56,920
I heard the General
of the Right Imperial Guards

819
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,190
single-handedly crushed the Four Ghosts
in the Ghost Market

820
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,850
using a three-section spear.

821
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,230
I was deeply impressed,

822
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,280
so I modified

823
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,570
this snake spear

824
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,360
that had served me for years.

825
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,230
I was born a slave

826
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,510
and trained hard since childhood.

827
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,710
Only by becoming a coroner

828
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:27,170
did I rise from slave status
to lowly status.

829
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,920
But not a day passed that stopped

830
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,630
studying literature
or practicing martial arts.

831
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,220
If you defeat me today,

832
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,880
I'll acknowledge your skill.

833
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,800
But if I unhorse you

834
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,600
with a single thrust of my spear,

835
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,920
then some foreign nation

836
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,400
will gain

837
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,760
a great General Zhong to lead its armies.

838
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,790
General Zhong, huh?

839
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,970
To make a name for yourself,

840
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,030
you're going to betray the Tang Empire?

841
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,060
Enough talk. Bring it on!

842
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,320
They say that villain's martial skills
are formidable.

843
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,840
If you hadn't stepped in to help,

844
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,880
we in Wannian County

845
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
really wouldn't

846
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,630
have caught him.

847
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,060
Skip the flattery.

848
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,280
Xue Huan has already gone ahead

849
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,110
into the districts to handle cases.

850
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,670
I won't keep you company
during the interrogation.

851
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:38,270
Farewell.

852
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,610
Lu Lingfeng!

853
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:44,670
Lingfeng,

854
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,030
I owe you big.

855
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,550
Thank you very much.

856
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,020
I hope Wannian County,

857
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,320
under Sheriff Su's governance,

858
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,480
enjoys long-lasting peace.

859
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,710
May Wannian County
enjoy long-lasting peace.

860
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,230
I am innocent.

861
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,550
Sheriff Su,

862
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:11,920
when Master Di arrested people,

863
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,030
he always relied on solid evidence.

864
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,590
You think you're clever

865
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:20,620
and left no trace at all?

866
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,230
I do, so what?

867
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,600
Without concrete evidence,

868
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,510
I will never confess.

869
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,670
[To the Zheng of Xingyang]
[Invitation]

870
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,880
The writing on the letter

871
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,190
has traces of brown
mixed with the black ink.

872
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:35,760
That should be

873
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,220
pigment from painting.

874
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,800
This means the person
either paints regularly

875
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,130
or constantly has a painter at their side.

876
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:45,070
You named your son Pi

877
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,840
and your daughter Jie.

878
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,800
Those are the very characters
Emperor Wu of Wei

879
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,510
used for his own children.

880
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,000
So what?

881
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,670
Your daughter is named Zhong Jie.

882
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:59,100
You've trained her in painting

883
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,480
since she was little,

884
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,490
haven't you?

885
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,920
Zhong Jie,

886
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,510
you paint very well.

887
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,230
I'm just curious—

888
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,030
how do you keep the painting table

889
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,110
so perfectly neat?

890
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:23,590
It's because Father doesn't allow anyone

891
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,590
to use this table,

892
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:25,590
not even Pi,

893
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,520
and not even Father himself.

894
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:30,110
Then where does your father usually write?

895
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,670
When Father needs to write,

896
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,920
he just uses my pigment dishes

897
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:46,880
and makes do.

898
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,800
If you think it's necessary,

899
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,920
we can verify it.

900
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,450
The letter sent to Zheng Hao

901
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,280
and the invitations

902
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,540
to those five coroners

903
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:57,280
were written with the ink here.

904
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,930
And you, Zhong Shizai,

905
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,070
are extremely skilled with a brush,

906
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,190
yet you pretended

907
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,320
to be illiterate.

908
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,740
The handwriting on the letters—

909
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,920
[General Lyu]

910
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,620
you deliberately made it look clumsy,

911
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:09,150
right?

912
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,820
That's nothing more than your speculation.

913
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,670
Su Wuming,

914
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,760
you couldn't solve the case yourself,

915
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
so you sent a woman

916
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,710
to trick my daughter?

917
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:23,220
This lady is no ordinary person.

918
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,550
She's Miss Pei Xijun.

919
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,930
I wouldn't say she's the best painter

920
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:29,880
in all of Chang'an,

921
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,800
but she's definitely the finest

922
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,670
among female painters in Chang'an.

923
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,480
Really?

924
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:38,960
Miss Pei,

925
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,950
could my daughter be your student?

926
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,360
She's very talented.

927
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,300
You should confess first.

928
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Look at this.

929
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,920
I found it in your house.

930
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,480
See for yourself.

931
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,320
Put it on him.

932
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:06,670
Come.

933
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,510
Now look at this.

934
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:16,080
Who painted that?

935
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:17,800
Miss Pei

936
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,360
drew it
based on Gao Wuniang's description.

937
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,110
Does this count

938
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,440
as solid evidence now?

939
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,630
Miss Pei,

940
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,110
please take Jie as your student.

941
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:28,710
No.

942
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,000
Please take her

943
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,790
as your goddaughter.

944
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:35,800
Miss Pei,

945
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,510
Jie is clever and filial.

946
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,190
I truly cannot bear

947
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,010
to let her remain in the lowly status
her whole life.

948
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,230
Zhong Shizai,

949
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,800
Zhong Jie is very gifted,

950
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,800
and I like her too.

951
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:47,460
If the chance arises,

952
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,190
I'll definitely teach her painting.

953
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:50,390
But this is the court.

954
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,360
Get up now.

955
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,590
I…

956
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:53,590
Zhong Shizai,

957
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,110
you deeply love your children,

958
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,360
but that's no excuse for your crimes.

959
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,360
I didn't kill anyone directly.

960
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,840
I just invited someone to dinner.

961
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,840
How is that wrong?

962
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,550
Zheng Hao killed for revenge.

963
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,960
What has that got to do with me?

964
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,820
Just to make sure

965
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,630
you could place in the top three
of the Coroners' Contest,

966
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,400
you even tried to kill your own mentor

967
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,800
who taught you your skills!

968
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,640
Zhong Shizai,

969
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,550
what other crimes have you committed?

970
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,750
Confess truthfully!

971
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,550
I haven't!

972
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,730
Mr. Geng already anticipated

973
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,150
you'd say that.
