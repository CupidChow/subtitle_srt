[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 39]

3
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,310
Your Majesty must not.

4
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,710
Please withdraw your order, Your Majesty.

5
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,950
His Majesty has given this matter
careful consideration,

6
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,400
and it's also the Retired Emperor's wish.

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,310
Chief Minister Pei,

8
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,509
just accept the decree and carry it out.

9
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,340
Silence!

10
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,150
Diplomatic matters,
whether great or small,

11
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:59,080
concern the dignity of our empire.

12
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:00,750
How dare a eunuch like you

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,510
speak so recklessly here?

14
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:02,910
How...

15
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,540
How dare you insult me?

16
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
Your Majesty,

17
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,050
please defend your servant.

18
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,840
Pei,

19
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:13,360
I made this decision reluctantly.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,110
You needn't be so upset.

21
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,760
Quite the opposite.

22
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,240
This tournament

23
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,200
is hosted by our empire.

24
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Your Majesty graced the opening match

25
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,800
with your presence.

26
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,470
Now, with the finals approaching

27
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,960
and our empire's team competing,

28
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,860
Your Majesty should also attend.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,280
This is proper protocol.

30
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,900
Moreover,

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,310
your presence will surely boost

32
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,430
our polo team's morale.

33
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,780
Your Majesty must understand—

34
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,590
this match is worth more than
countless battles.

35
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,520
Our polo team must win.

36
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,380
If we lose,

37
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,280
where would that leave
our national prestige?

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,810
Chief Minister Pei,

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,610
it's just a game.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,240
There will always be winners and losers.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,800
You're being...

42
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,730
Shut your mouth!

43
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,160
What do you know?

44
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,560
Forgive my bluntness, Your Majesty,

45
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,590
but on the day of the finals,

46
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:03,010
if Your Majesty shrinks back in fear

47
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,010
and doesn't dare appear in person,

48
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,850
you will be ridiculed by Emperor Taizong

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,010
and mocked by all under heaven.

50
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,800
The Emperor of the Tang Empire

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,080
should fear nothing.

52
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,360
The Emperor's bearing

53
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,520
is the bearing of all the people of Tang.

54
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
If Your Majesty avoids appearing now,

55
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,650
it will surely damage
our empire's prestige.

56
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:24,079
The roads west of Anyuan Gate,

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,100
stretching over twenty thousand li,
will become perilous

58
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,840
for us in the future.

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,280
Chief Minister Pei, you've gone too far.

60
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,420
What about His Majesty's safety?

61
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,430
His Majesty's safety

62
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,020
is your Imperial Guard's responsibility!

63
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,470
You...

64
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,220
And yours as well,
Yongzhou Prefecture Office!

65
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,490
And you, Lu Lingfeng.

66
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,630
Since you failed to

67
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,500
capture the spies before the finals,

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,750
you ought to have resigned your position

69
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,750
as Judicial Official immediately!

70
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:54,920
Your Majesty,

71
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,579
this is Chang'an!

72
00:03:58,070 --> 00:03:58,800
Your Majesty is

73
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,680
of the lineage of Emperor Taizong.

74
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,310
Remember how Emperor Taizong,

75
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:03,610
in this very place,

76
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,560
single-handedly defeated
over 10,000 enemies on horseback?

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,250
And now,

78
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:08,000
just because of

79
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,380
some uncertain danger,

80
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,640
Your Majesty is to

81
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,650
hide in the palace

82
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,850
and refuse to be seen?

83
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,579
Lu Tong,

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,980
give me your sword!

85
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,040
What are you going to do?

86
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,750
Give it to me!

87
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,279
Pei Mian,

88
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,310
are you trying to threaten
His Majesty with a weapon?

89
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:23,770
Guards!

90
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,130
Seize him!

91
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,540
You think I would threaten His Majesty?

92
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,680
I, Pei Mian, am not that senile!

93
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,750
I would never do such a thing!

94
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,630
If Your Majesty insists on not appearing

95
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,260
at the polo finals in person,

96
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:50,440
I, Pei Mian, may not have a blade
to slit my throat now,

97
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,610
but today,

98
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,400
I can still bash my head
against a pillar here!

99
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,740
I'd like to go meet Emperor Taizong

100
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,550
and Emperor Gaozu

101
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,730
and accuse you of
cowardice and incompetence!

102
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,430
Pei.

103
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,600
Every word you've said—

104
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,270
I have taken it to heart.

105
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,540
I shall attend the tournament in person.

106
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,290
I won't bring shame to my ancestors!

107
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,530
Your Majesty...

108
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,900
Your Majesty... is wise indeed.

109
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,840
It's interesting, though.

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,130
Pei Mian must be about
70 years old now, right?

111
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,560
Yet at such an advanced age,
he still has such spirit.

112
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:37,800
I can't help but admire him.

113
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,490
It's a pity, though.

114
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:40,800
He has no intention

115
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,460
of siding with Your Highness.

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,290
The gifts we sent him
for the Dragon Boat Festival

117
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,880
were also returned.

118
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,300
It doesn't matter.

119
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,350
He hasn't joined
their side either, has he?

120
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,510
We can use this man in the future.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,659
We can use this man.

122
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,220
Then, will Your Highness

123
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,370
go to the finals?

124
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,000
Of course, I'll go.

125
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,850
I remember that when I watched

126
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,830
my first polo tournament,

127
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,600
I was still in my mother's arms.

128
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,650
[Crucial Nexus]

129
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,390
The National Polo Tournament

130
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,680
is the most important event

131
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,240
in Chang'an this year.

132
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,360
Envoys from all other nations will attend.

133
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,040
How could I not attend?

134
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,120
In my opinion,

135
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,040
Your Highness may attend,

136
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,010
or you may choose not to.

137
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,200
What do you mean?

138
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:36,909
To attend

139
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,040
would certainly display your dignity
as the Grand Princess.

140
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,190
But since the matter
of the Yenisei Kirghiz spies

141
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:43,070
remains unresolved,

142
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,470
the danger still exists.

143
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,820
Since there is danger,

144
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,500
why not

145
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,800
let the one on the throne bear it first?

146
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Should something unfortunate
truly befall him,

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,480
Your Highness could save the state
from collapse

148
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,360
and gloriously ascend the throne!

149
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,650
Wouldn't that be perfectly natural?

150
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,160
You make a good point.

151
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,190
Go inform the Court of State Ceremonials

152
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:11,650
that I won't be attending.

153
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,560
Understood.

154
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,460
Now, I truly hope

155
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,120
those Yenisei Kirghiz do have some plot.

156
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,130
It's been 14 years.

157
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,870
Finally, you've come.

158
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,090
It's you, isn't it?

159
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,410
Not your brother Natie,

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,780
but you yourself, right?

161
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,060
That day at the polo field,

162
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,910
though we were far apart,

163
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,980
I recognized you at first glance.

164
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,680
Natie is at the border

165
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,310
leading 100,000 cavalry.

166
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:21,510
He's just waiting for my message

167
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,550
from Chang'an.

168
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:24,040
It really is you,

169
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:25,270
Nasha.

170
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,180
It's been 14 years.

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,860
We finally meet again.

172
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,270
Greetings, Khan.

173
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,520
You've been lying dormant for 14 years.

174
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:52,910
You've suffered.

175
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,510
Not at all.

176
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,440
I just miss the winds
of the Yenisei Kirghiz lands.

177
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,000
I long to ride across the grasslands
with you again.

178
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,240
When I sent you here,

179
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:02,640
you were only 16.

180
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,200
[Nasha, Yenisei Kirghiz Khan]

181
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,870
Back then, I was just

182
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,440
an insignificant general.

183
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,600
If you hadn't been willing

184
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,060
to come to Chang'an for me,

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,070
perhaps the former Khan

186
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,200
would never have noticed me.

187
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,570
It's been 14 years.

188
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,100
Do you still remember your promise to me?

189
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,840
I remember.

190
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,080
I promised to marry you.

191
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,360
But the former Khan wanted

192
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,490
me to marry his most beloved daughter.

193
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,080
Only with that marriage

194
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:33,840
could I qualify

195
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,240
to become his successor,

196
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:36,840
the Khan of the Yenisei Kirghiz.

197
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,510
So...

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,510
you must resent me deeply.

199
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,270
No.

200
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,970
All these years...

201
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,150
you didn't find another man?

202
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,600
No.

203
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,730
What about now?

204
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:55,130
What do you expect from me?

205
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,910
I only wish to return to the grasslands

206
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,710
with you soon.

207
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:01,480
My status

208
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:02,030
is certainly not

209
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:03,490
as noble as your Khatun's.

210
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,840
So I only hope

211
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,670
to stay by your side,

212
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,200
even if I'm just tending your horses

213
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,530
or cleaning your boots.

214
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,550
What you say...

215
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,960
is what I wish for as well.

216
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,270
But my Khatun—

217
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,570
she's been spoiled since childhood.

218
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,510
To her, I'm like

219
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,000
a wild hare caught beneath
the talons of a hawk.

220
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,120
Her jealousy

221
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,610
is like a raging fire

222
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,320
that could engulf the entire grassland
at any moment.

223
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I'm the Khan of the Yenisei Kirghiz.

224
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,200
I cannot let

225
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,520
my tribe fall apart.

226
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,740
Therefore,

227
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,560
once this mission is done,

228
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,160
you shall end your life as

229
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,240
a heroic warrior of our people.

230
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,220
On behalf of our gods,

231
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,150
I now bestow upon you
this sacred medicine.

232
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,720
You'll feel no pain

233
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,510
and will be reborn soon.

234
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,070
I'll build

235
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,030
the finest cenotaph

236
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:13,490
for you on the grasslands.

237
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,470
Your descendants

238
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:18,080
will disfigure their faces
and cut off their ears in mourning,

239
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,800
worshipping you as a deity.

240
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,150
This is the highest honor

241
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,790
of our Yenisei Kirghiz...

242
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,500
and your glory as well.

243
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,630
Have you prepared

244
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,520
what I asked for

245
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,510
a year ago?

246
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,780
Ma'am, I'd like a premium room.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,600
Would you prefer east-facing
or west-facing?

248
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:43,150
I want a south-facing room.

249
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,150
You're in luck.

250
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:45,600
We have one left.

251
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,470
Everything is ready.

252
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,480
Then go.

253
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,520
If there's a next life...

254
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,610
when I'm 16 again,

255
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,440
could I marry you
when you're still a general,

256
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,010
so we can raise cattle,

257
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,270
herd sheep,

258
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,200
and have children together?

259
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,190
If you long for that kind of life,

260
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,300
marry a herdsman instead.

261
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,490
Had I lacked ambition
when I was a general,

262
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,830
I wouldn't have become Khan today.

263
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,600
Careful.

264
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,880
Pine oil?

265
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,720
Yes.

266
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,150
The back door of the Bafang Inn

267
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,710
connects to a secret underground room.

268
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,000
Those dozens of barrels of pine oil

269
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,790
were all moved out

270
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:56,920
of that secret room.

271
00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,680
So they're planning a fire attack.

272
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,710
But the key question is—

273
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,630
how will they use it?

274
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:53,580
[Peace and prosperity]

275
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,190
[Tang Team] [Yenisei Kirghiz Team]

276
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,640
Who is it?

277
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,849
Lady Chong?

278
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,000
You finally came...

279
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,590
What's wrong? Are you alright?

280
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,340
Hold me tight.

281
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:32,920
Okay.

282
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,850
Hold me tighter.

283
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,280
I'm so cold.

284
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,480
You're cold?

285
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,000
Let me get you... a blanket.

286
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
I don't want a blanket.

287
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,260
Hold me closer.

288
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,750
I'm so lonely.

289
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,410
I'm dying.

290
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:55,780
If I die in your arms...

291
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,090
would you think it's bad luck?

292
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,250
Don't say that.

293
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,240
That wouldn't be bad luck.

294
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,300
It'd be a blessing.

295
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,170
Just being with you,

296
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,690
every moment, every second,

297
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,570
is my blessing.

298
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,250
What a pity.

299
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,760
This is the deadliest poison

300
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:20,800
of the Yenisei Kirghiz.

301
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,390
They say...

302
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,340
it sends one straight to reincarnation.

303
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,550
Poison?

304
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,390
You took poison?

305
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,550
If you don't mind,

306
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,590
could you just hold me,

307
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,360
please?

308
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,480
No. I won't let you die.

309
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,870
I will never let you die.

310
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,490
Su Wuming.

311
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:58,610
[Loyalty]

312
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,030
Official Lu is analyzing a case right now

313
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,830
and cannot be disturbed.

314
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,130
I have something urgent to see him about.

315
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,130
Go inform him now!

316
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,590
General!

317
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:13,470
You...

318
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:14,440
General!

319
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,740
How long did you sleep?

320
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,020
At least eight hours.

321
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,920
You've been too tense lately.

322
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,310
It's perfectly normal
that you fell asleep.

323
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,250
Don't just stand there.

324
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,730
Sit down and tell me slowly.

325
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:27,830
No, that's not right.

326
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,400
Back when I served in the Imperial Guard,

327
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,730
I trained by day and patrolled by night.

328
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,240
I often stayed awake
for three days straight!

329
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,000
But just this once,

330
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,550
when Chief Minister Pei

331
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:35,000
entrusted me with such an important task,

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,830
how could I possibly

333
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,760
have fallen asleep so carelessly?

334
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,430
And also,

335
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,410
when I woke up...

336
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,790
Although the change is extremely subtle,

337
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:25,830
I can still feel

338
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,660
that one of the polo balls
has become a bit heavier.

339
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,270
It's heavier now?

340
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,110
Come on. Let's go take a look.

341
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,280
General,

342
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,920
this is just my feeling.

343
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,480
I'm not completely certain.

344
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,980
Therefore, we absolutely cannot

345
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:42,580
let Chief Minister Pei know.

346
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,330
Given Chief Minister Pei's temper,

347
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,480
it's normal that you're afraid of him.

348
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,240
No.

349
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,510
I'd face death without a flicker of fear.

350
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,310
But the final match is tomorrow,

351
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,950
and those two polo balls—

352
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,400
whether it's the beast hide used

353
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,640
or the gold thread for stitching—

354
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,640
are all treasures.

355
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,640
That beast hide is especially rare.

356
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,350
If, because of my suspicion,

357
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,920
we take apart the polo balls
for inspection

358
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,880
and thereby delay tomorrow's finals,

359
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,030
wouldn't that make our empire

360
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:06,980
lose face in front of

361
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,310
all the foreign envoys?

362
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,750
And Chief Minister Pei

363
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,590
values our national dignity

364
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:14,270
more than his own life.

365
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,350
I understand.

366
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,920
Who went

367
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,290
to that room last night?

368
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,140
At 10 PM,

369
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,850
Chief Minister Pei came to check on me.

370
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,510
After that, Chief Administrator Xiong
also came.

371
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,110
Did they both come on their own?

372
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:26,510
Yes,

373
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,110
and they both gave me some instructions

374
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,040
before leaving.

375
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,830
What do you think?

376
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:32,810
Good, very good!

377
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,790
Chief Minister Pei,
Chief Administrator Xiong.

[Court of State Ceremonials]

379
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,010
Well, well, Li Zhuang.

380
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,480
You said you'd only be gone
for a quarter of an hour,

381
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,540
but you were gone for two whole hours.

382
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,070
Did you go somewhere

383
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:42,960
to catch up on sleep?

384
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:43,310
I...

385
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:47,000
Greetings, Chief Minister Pei,
Chief Administrator Xiong.

386
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,960
[Court of State Ceremonials]

387
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,090
Chief Minister Pei.

388
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,270
It seems he

389
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,480
went to fetch Lu Lingfeng.

390
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,120
That's reasonable.

391
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,530
After all, the balls

392
00:21:57,590 --> 00:21:59,440
were designed by Xijun.

393
00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:02,280
Lu Lingfeng, come on.

394
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,480
Take your time appreciating them.

395
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,730
Xiong Qiannian.

396
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:10,480
I was harsh with you

397
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,450
the other day

398
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,080
only because I was afraid

399
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,030
that, at this crucial time
before the finals,

400
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,310
you might hold us back.

401
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,070
But seeing how diligent you've been

402
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,450
these past few days,

403
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,850
I'll let bygones be bygones.

404
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,770
Chief Minister Pei.

405
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,840
I'm your junior.

406
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,180
Your criticism is guidance for me.

407
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,590
Before the finals,

408
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,590
our Yongzhou Prefecture Office

409
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,000
still has many matters

410
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,110
to report to you in detail.

411
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,920
Very well.

412
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,020
Please take a look.

413
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,720
This way.

414
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,350
Li Zhuang.

415
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,880
Chief Minister Pei, please rest assured.

416
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,510
Until tomorrow's competition,

417
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,770
I won't let the polo balls
out of my sight.

418
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:54,920
Lu Lingfeng.

419
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,120
You may watch,

420
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,970
but don't waste too much time.

421
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,270
Since you don't have the ability

422
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,510
to catch the spies,

423
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,750
at least put more effort into

424
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,170
protecting His Majesty.

425
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:05,960
Come on.

426
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:06,440
Yes.

427
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:01,400
[Peace and prosperity]

428
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,150
On this occasion
of the National Polo Tournament

429
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,890
final match,

430
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,430
His Majesty of our empire

431
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,930
has specially ordered the creation
of the Imperial Polo Balls!

432
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,720
We invite all foreign delegations

433
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,110
and people from all walks of life
in Chang'an

434
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,130
to view them!

435
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,360
His Majesty of the Tang Empire

436
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,440
has specially ordered the creation
of Imperial Polo Balls

437
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,270
and invites all foreign delegations

438
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,580
and Chang'an citizens present
to view them!

439
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,510
-Excellent!
-Yeah!

440
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,640
The Imperial Polo Balls!

441
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,920
We certainly came at the right time.

442
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,510
Indeed.

443
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:49,310
[Peace and prosperity]

444
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:51,880
The Grand Princess has arrived!

445
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,000
My aunt is here.

446
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:58,820
Wonderful.

447

[Peace and prosperity]

448
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,850
Her Highness said she wasn't coming.

449
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:09,880
Quickly,

450
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,200
prepare a seat for the Grand Princess.

451
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,030
-Yeah!
-Your Highness the Grand Princess!

452
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,510
-Your Highness!
-Yeah!

453
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,610
Your Highness the Grand Princess!

454
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,810
Today by the Qu River,
the weather is perfect.

455
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:31,160
[Peace and prosperity]

456
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,840
Aunt, I'm really happy that you're here

457
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,300
to watch the match with me.

458
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,440
In the Polo Tournament four years ago,

459
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,530
Your Majesty, then Prince of Linzi,

460
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:40,440
led our polo team

461
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,080
to a glorious championship.

462
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,590
Your Majesty's brilliance that day

463
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,760
is still vivid in my memory.

464
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,260
Aunt, please.

465
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,070
Chang'an

466
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:57,200
hasn't been this lively in a long time.

467
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:57,950
Indeed.

468
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,270
We, aunt and nephew,

469
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,610
haven't attended

470
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,640
such a thrilling event together
in a long time either.

471
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,830
I, Natie, along with
the Yenisei Kirghiz Team,

472
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:14,400
pay our respects to Your Majesty

473
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,530
and Your Highness the Grand Princess!

474
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,070
We, the Great Tang Polo Team,
pay our respects to Your Majesty

475
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,200
and Your Highness the Grand Princess!

476
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,310
[Peace and prosperity]

477
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,660
The Polo Tournament is held
every four years.

478
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,440
This time, with so many masters assembled,

479
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,500
it's truly a grand event of Chang'an—

480
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:35,940
of the entire realm!

481
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,000
Polo not only

482
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:38,560
strengthens the body

483
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,270
but also

484
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,670
fosters friendship among nations!

485
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:42,030
[Peace and prosperity]

486
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,400
As the ruler of the Tang Empire,

487
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,640
now that I'm here
at the championship field,

488
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,510
how could I not mount a horse
and wield a mallet

489
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,730
to display my might?

490
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,270
Today, I intend to lead the Tang Team

491
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,750
in the final match
against the Yenisei Kirghiz Team!

492
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,640
Aunt, what do you think?

493
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:55,380
Your Majesty,

494
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:55,880
[Peace and prosperity]

495
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,740
you must not.

496
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,440
I've already explained

497
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,960
my reasons to Your Majesty before.

498
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,590
Why shouldn't His Majesty do so?

499
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,380
I think it's appropriate.

500
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,070
-But...
-Your Majesty has just taken the throne.

501
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,650
If you take the field,

502
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:15,890
foreign nations will witness
your majestic power.

503
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,620
If you win,

504
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,350
all under heaven will submit to you.

505
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,110
But that doesn't conform to
proper protocol.

506
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,960
The Yenisei Kirghiz Khan

507
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,270
isn't on the field.

508
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,880
The Emperor's dignity

509
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,880
lies in bilateral equality

510
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,510
and, moreover, in fighting for the nation!

511
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,960
Never mind whether their Khan

512
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,160
is on the field or not.

513
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,030
Our Emperor's

514
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,250
polo match against the Yenisei Kirghiz

515
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,920
is a display of our national power,

516
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,220
meant for all under heaven to see!

517
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,930
Chancellor Cui.

518
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,440
Chief Minister Pei,

519
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:55,160
since His Majesty has shown such passion

520
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,820
and Her Highness supports it,

521
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:58,920
you should not stand in the way.

522
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:02,880
Alright.

523
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:05,890
In that case,

524
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,590
I shall change into my polo attire

525
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,650
and take the field.

526
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,750
[Peace and prosperity]

527
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,550
Your Majesty,

528
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,440
you must beware of conspiracies.

529
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,350
Don't forget the intelligence

530
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,070
we received about the Yenisei Kirghiz.

531
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,270
You fear that the Yenisei Kirghiz

532
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,010
might harm me on the field?

533
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,520
Then, what do you think

534
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:26,470
the polo mallet in my hand is for?

535
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,310
[Peace and prosperity]

536
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,110
Your Majesty,

537
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,800
I, Lu Tong, am willing to
join you on the field.

538
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,480
Grand General, 20 years ago,

539
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,310
you were also outstanding
on the polo field.

540
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,750
But now, you've advanced in age

541
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,950
and have lost one eye,

542
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,170
so let's forget it.

543
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,390
I've already chosen someone
to play alongside me.

544
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,090
It's the one who helped

545
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,750
our Tang Team win the championship

546
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,350
four years ago, Lu Lingfeng!

547
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,360
Your Majesty,

548
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,210
I, Lu Lingfeng, am ready.

549
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,400
Pei!

550
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

551
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,400
I'll personally enter the match.

552
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,110
Please fulfill your duty
as the tournament host!

553
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

554
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,470
The Great Tang Polo Team,

555
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,750
led by His Majesty himself,

556
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,760
will battle against
the Yenisei Kirghiz Team!

557
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
The Great Tang Polo Team,

558
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,340
led by His Majesty himself,

559
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,510
will battle against
the Yenisei Kirghiz Team!

560
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,080
That so-called Natie...

561
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,350
is actually Nasha,
the Yenisei Kirghiz Khan himself?

562
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:38,750
Indeed.

563
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,920
That aligns with the intelligence

564
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,800
I received.

565
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,710
Grand General, look at this.

566
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,240
Nasha, the Yenisei Kirghiz Khan,

567
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,350
has infiltrated Chang'an

568
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,400
with some scheme in mind.

569
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,920
Now that it's confirmed,

570
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,160
I shall personally lead
the team in the match!

571
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,000
First, I'll defeat them on the polo field

572

as a warning

573
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:02,410
to the Yenisei Kirghiz army
thousands of miles away.

574
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,500
Unfortunately...

575
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:10,650
Pei Mian will certainly try his best
to stop me.

576
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:12,650
I'm afraid

577
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,990
that when the time comes,

578
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,680
we might make a scene

579
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,270
in front of all the foreign envoys.

580
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:19,960
If Her Highness the Princess
attends in person

581
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,640
to support Your Majesty's participation,

582
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,570
Chief Minister Pei won't be able to
stop you, will he?

583
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,310

the Court of State Ceremonials

584
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,560
that she won't be coming.

585
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,880
No, Her Highness has changed her mind.

586
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,160
Her Highness said

587
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,440
that in times of crisis,

According to protocol, it should be
His Majesty who serves the ball.

596
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,720
But now...

597
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,830
I shall serve the ball.

598
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,720
Stick to the original plan.

599
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,350

What a beautiful polo ball.

604
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,680
But whether it can bring lasting peace
and prosperity

605
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:45,110
depends on those who hold it.

606
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,720
Your Highness threw the ball

607
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,590
with both heroism and grace.

608
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,240

609
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,830
do we really have to do this?

610

any plot against the Emperor

612

is a threat to our Tang Empire.

613

I'll set aside my dispute
with him for now.

614

while chatting and laughing.

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,070
I have the Seven-Colored Beast Hides?

634
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,030
Well,

635
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:48,040
I checked the records
at the Court of the Imperial Treasury.

636
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,800
In the first year of Yongchun,

637
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,250
the Byzantine Empire also presented

638
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,190
two pieces of Seven-Colored Beast Hide
as tribute.

639
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,330
At that time, Empress Wu Zetian

640
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,230
bestowed them upon Your Highness.

641
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,590
I imagine your mansion

642
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,520

643
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,140
so you might not

644
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,180
have used those two hides.

I do have two pieces
of Seven-Colored Beast Hide,

648
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,170
but they're spoken for.

649
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,230
I won't lend them.

650
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,230
Not to borrow them, but to take them.

651
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,240
Because once they're made into
a polo ball,

652
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,160
they can't be returned intact.

653
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,940
So it's not really borrowing.

Although it's still speculation,

655
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:34,840

can you make

an identical polo ball?

If you use craftsmen
from the Tribute Office,

how will you keep it secret from Pei Mian?

So the mechanism won't be a problem.

693

But the hides require embroidery work.

how is the investigation
of the Yenisei Kirghiz spies going?

00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,070
Though we haven't captured them yet,

we've basically identified the targets.

703
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,480
Then why not arrest them immediately

704

to eliminate future trouble?

705
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,830
If we do that,

706
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:29,350
I fear it might affect

707
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,840

708
00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:34,840

If we alert them prematurely,

711
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,960
not only will we fail to catch them all,

712
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,760
