[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35,539 --> 00:01:38,009
[Episode 14]

3
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,950
To be honest,

4
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:41,039
I've loved

5
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:43,280
folk storytelling since I was a child.

6
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,610
Sir,

7
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,160
what story will you tell us today?

8
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,200
I want to go to the capital,

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,840
but I got lost here.

10
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,890
Could you give me directions?

11
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,400
Well...

12
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,490
Didn't you say

13
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,680
you'd let me in to rest for a bit?

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:05,930
I said...

15
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,430
we'd rest together.

16
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,470
You're so naughty.

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,750
Sounds like...

18
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,670
neither the scholar nor the lady

19
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,100
were human.

20
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,430
Indeed.

21
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,800
What a pity for that lady.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,730
Can't you tell something else?

23
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,520
Your story is too scary.

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,180
Scary as it may be,

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,200
everyone loves to hear it.

26
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,430
Don't believe me?

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,620
Ask everyone here.

28
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,840
General,

29
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,870
this story is too frightening.

30
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,940
Don't you agree?

31
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,740
-Let's stop listening.
-Sir.

32
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,120
Don't be afraid.

33
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:57,520
As long as you have this Bai Ze Scroll,

34
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,010
whether you're traveling

35
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,750
or staying home,

36
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:04,710
it'll ward off evil

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,340
and keep you safe.

38
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,840
Only 90 cash each.

39
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,630
[Bai Ze Scroll]

40
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,710
Fair price.

41
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,390
So you two as a couple,

42
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,210
one tells ghost stories

43
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,630
and the other uses them to sell scrolls.

44
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:21,010
You're no hermits.

45
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,560
You're merchants!

46
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,470
The temple keeper
is generous and kind-hearted.

47
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,940
Travelers can rest here

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,210
for free,

49
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,370
food and shelter included.

50
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,620
But as time goes by,

51
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,750
how can we afford it?

52
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,120
I can only

53
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,290
do some sewing to get by.

54
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,450
Why don't you...

55
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,380
buy a cloth doll?

56
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,810
Only 100 cash.

57
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,120
How much?

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,400
100 cash?

59
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:47,910
Come on.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,310
Look at them.

61
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,670
The dolls you made

62
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,430
all look strange,

63
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,610
like burial figurines.

64
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,940
And 100 cash?

65
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:57,870
Who would buy them? Come on.

66
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:00,560
Yes.

67
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,970
Since no one would buy them...

68
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,180
I can only sell them to ghosts.

69
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,310
But this Bai Ze Scroll is different.

70
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,190
It's specifically for humans
to ward off ghosts.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,430
Isn't that still just selling things?

72
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,040
Just nonsense.

73
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,320
Nowadays in Chang'an,

74
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,440
a bushel of rice
sells for only a dozen cash,

75
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,040
and you're charging 90 cash for a scroll.

76
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,040
Aren't you being too greedy?

77
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,190
That's right.

78
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,390
They say all merchants are cunning.

79
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:33,830
See?

80
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,159
Just as expected.

81
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,300
You sly merchants.

82
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,420
What do you know?

83
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,750
This Bai Ze Scroll

84
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,360
is an original from the Western Zhou.

85
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,620
The drawings of ghosts

86
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,560
and the methods

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,880
to subdue them

88
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,440
are extremely accurate.

89
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,500
You're saying this is an original
from the Western Zhou?

90
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,900
May I take a look?

91
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,940
90 cash.

92
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,120
I just want to take a look.

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,830
If it really is from the Western Zhou,

94
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,720
I'll buy it.

95
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,420
Don't get it dirty.

96
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,230
He actually believes it?

97
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:41,970
What happened

98
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:43,770
to that scholar

99
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:44,680
and that lady in the end?

100
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,190
-Yeah.
-Go on.

101
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,650
I won't stay to listen.

102
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,980
I'm really too tired.

103
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,800
I won't listen anymore.

104
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,730
Well, Wei,

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,060
please go rest in the west wing first.

106
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,190
I just checked.

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,950
The west wing is one big room

108
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,840
for 4 people.

109
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,980
It's not spacious,

110
00:05:59,090 --> 00:05:59,880
but it'll do.

111
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,800
Ding, guys,

112
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,220
please bear with it.

113
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,640
What about the east wing?

114
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,940
The east wing is divided into 2 rooms.

115
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,650
One is for Commander Li,

116
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,700
and the other

117
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,670
will be shared by Su Wuming and me.

118
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,920
Temple keeper,

119
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,320
we have a guide with us.

120
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,730
Can you find him a place to rest

121
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,530
in this main hall?

122
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,880
Certainly.

123
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,410
Lu, you're the leader.

124
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,400
We'll follow your arrangements.

125
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:29,150
General,

126
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,580
I'll go rest first.

127
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,710
You guys keep drinking.

128
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,120
-Stay a little longer.
-He's at the exciting part of the story.

129
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,920
I'm going. I'm going.

130
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,090
Do you dare to go to sleep alone?

131
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:36,820
I'm leaving.

132
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,320
Commander Li,
want to stay and keep listening?

133
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,290
I have no interest

134
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:42,620
in these ghost stories.

135
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,510
Su Wuming.

136
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,120
What about you?

137
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,120
I'm not tired.

138
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,280
I'll stay a bit longer to read it.

139
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,520
She told me
this is an original from the Western Zhou.

140
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:00,120
I haven't verified it yet.

141
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,380
I mainly want to hear

142
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,440
the temple keeper finish the story.

143
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,090
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

144
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,530
Hurry.

145
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,730
Keep going.

146
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,390
Keep going.

147
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:10,920
Alright!

148
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,560
As I was saying, the lodging girl

149
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,050
was about to bite the scholar when,

150
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,700
suddenly, looking up,

151
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,290
she noticed that
on the wall in the candlelight,

152
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,580
there was no shadow of the scholar.

153
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,240
She was terrified.

154
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:30,940
On this romantic night,

155
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,010
why do you want to leave?

156
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,900
You don't have a shadow either?

157
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,320
You're not human?

158
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,050
Of course I'm not human.

159
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,900
You just realized that now?

160
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,800
Too late.

161
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,220
The two evil demons in the room

162
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,730
are actually hiding together?

163
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,610
Come out and meet your end!

164
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,050
Just as the two demons

165
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,530
were at a loss,

166
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:05,520
a deafening roar

167
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,730
rang out,

168
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,620
and an exorcist burst in

169
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,230
wielding a demon-subduing staff!

170
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:13,240
Wait.

171
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,630
Roar?

172
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,650
Is that exorcist also a...

173
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,620
Do you really think this exorcist

174
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,810
is really an exorcist?

175
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,800
Don't keep us guessing.

176
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,110
What kind of creature made that roar?

177
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,200
A tiger? A lion?

178
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,800
Yes!

179
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,220
Well...

180
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,540
What kind of roar was that?

181
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,870
It was neither a tiger's roar
nor a lion's.

182
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,510
General,

183
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:57,060
did you also hear that roar?

184
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,130
Yes.

185
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,970
But it's hard to tell
what kind of beast it was.

186
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,070
Could it be Bai Ze?

187
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,980
Wei, you really believe there's a Bai Ze?

188
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:11,230
Of course I do.

189
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,080
Otherwise,

190
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,040
why would His Majesty order us

191
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,900
to search for it in the mountains?

192
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,440
General.

193
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,980
Judging by the sound, it shouldn't be far.

194
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,410
I wish to join you in the search.

195
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:26,890
If we find Bai Ze,

196
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,370
when the rewards are given...

197
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,680
General,

198
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,900
could you include me?

199
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,930
Official Wei,

200
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,880
it rained heavily earlier,

201
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,250
and the mountain path is muddy.

202
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,630
Please go back and rest first.

203
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:43,560
We can search for Bai Ze

204
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,290
first thing tomorrow morning.

205
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,600
Don't panic.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,330
It's not unusual
to encounter wild beasts in the mountains.

207
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,130
If the scholar and the lady

208
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,360
in my folk storytelling appear,

209
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,680
that would be truly unusual.

210
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,130
That's true.

211
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,220
Who is the temple keeper?

212
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,740
My wife and I

213
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,160
would like to stay for the night.

214
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:38,800
Wait.

215
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,170
Are you

216
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,960
humans?

217
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,410
Of course we are.

218
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,600
I'm a scholar.

219
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,360
My surname is Shi,

220
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,200
and this is my wife.

221
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
I have a name.

222
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,720
My wife

223
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,110
is called Jiao.

224
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,020
Why are you here in the mountains?

225
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,900
Why are you here in the mountains?

226
00:11:00,970 --> 00:11:02,130
You didn't also take the wrong path

227
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,060
like us, did you?

228
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:04,410
We were

229
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,480
on our way to Chang'an.

230
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,540
To take a shortcut,

231
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:08,010
we accidentally entered the mountain.

232
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,080
Then came the heavy rain.

233
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,290
We're in quite a mess.

234
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,890
[Scholar Shi] [Jiao]

235
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:11,800
We even heard the roar

236
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,130
of a wild beast earlier—

237
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,970
it nearly scared us to death.

238
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:15,810
Luckily,

239
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,350
we found this temple.

240
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,380
So you're here to stay the night?

241
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,260
Do you recognize this statue?

242
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,600
Isn't that Deity Bai Ze?

243
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,860
We worship his statue at our home too.

244
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,960
It's the best
for warding off evil spirits.

245
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,710
Honey,

246
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,600
let's go pay our respects.

247
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,760
Of course, Honey.

248
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,440
More visitors?

249
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:56,880
They're quite devout.

250
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,640
Hurry up.

251
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,250
If you're not buying,

252
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,590
don't waste my time.

253
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,750
I'll sell it to that couple for 90 cash.

254
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,790
Commander Li,
why haven't you gone to sleep?

255
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,440
Did you hear

256
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,640
the beast's roar too?

257
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,650
I want to avenge Huo Jing.

258
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:27,770
Official Lu,
are you sharing the east wing with me

259
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:28,900
to protect me,

260
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,770
or to keep watch on me

261
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,130
so I won't go out

262
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,860
to kill that scoundrel Huo You?

263
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,080
It is said that Huo You
pushed Huo Jing off the cliff,

264
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,540
but no one actually saw it.

265
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,410
Besides,

266
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,500
we entered the mountain
on imperial orders.

267
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,060
Until we return to the capital to report,

268
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,000
please be patient,

269
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,100
I am the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

270
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:00,130
and the incident happened
within my jurisdiction.

271
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,350
Once we return to the capital to report,

272
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,440
I'll see this case

273
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,610
through to the end.

274
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,690
If it was truly Huo You who did it,

275
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,380
I will show no mercy.

276
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,140
Do you think I would believe you?

277
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,960
You're all Imperial Guards,

278
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,790
birds of a feather.

279
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,240
The two sides fought fiercely.

280
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,830
In the end, the two demons joined forces,

281
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,450
threw the exorcist

282
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,510
onto a stone slab,

283
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,110
and stomped hard on his spine

284
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,670
until it broke.

285
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,350
Then the two demons
looked at each other, smiled,

286
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,740
and walked away

287
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,400
hand in hand.

288
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:57,250
Wait.

289
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,630
Didn't you just say

290
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,840
this exorcist

291
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:02,970
was no ordinary exorcist?

292
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,720
How did he die so quickly?

293
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,440
Exactly.

294
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:09,750
I thought he would be more formidable.

295
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,690
Why did they break his spine?

296
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,200
Yes.

297
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,620
This method

298
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,950
was indeed strange.

299
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,050
Well...

300
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:24,990
Could these two demons

301
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,160
be the legendary weight-bearing ghosts?

302
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,280
You even know about weight-bearing ghosts?

303
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,280
I know a little.

304
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,040
Legend has it,

305
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,650
if a weight-bearing ghost

306
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,410
wants to return to the human world,

307
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,640
it must find a replacement

308
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,000
and kill them.

309
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,200
If the person being killed

310
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,030
dies sitting up,

311
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,210
3000 years later,

312
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,690
they can find

313
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,170
a new successor.

314
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,300
But those two demons

315
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,600
broke the exorcist's spine,

316
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,710
so he must have died lying down.

317
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,290
Anyone who dies lying down

318
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,290
can never

319
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,380
choose a successor

320
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,750
to replace themselves.

321
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,350
That means they can never reincarnate.

322
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,730
Only in this way

323
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,670
can a weight-bearing ghost

324
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,210
remain in the human world forever.

325
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,820
You got it right.

326
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,990
Those two

327
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,620
are weight-bearing ghosts.

328
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,720
You're quite knowledgeable.

329
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,680
I wouldn't say I'm knowledgeable.

330
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,350
I've just read a few books.

331
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,000
But I can't tell a story

332
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,820
as entertainingly as you do.

333
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,800
Elder, you've been cultivating here
in Mount Zhongnan

334
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,400
for many years, haven't you?

335
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,360
Indeed.

336
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,170
Earlier you said

337
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,130
that if we waited here,

338
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,970
we could see the Bai Ze.

339
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,600
That wasn't a joke, was it?

340
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,850
Long ago,
the Yellow Emperor brought 100 Bai Zes

341
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,510
from the shores of the Eastern Sea
to the capital

342
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,790
and then sent them in all directions.

343
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,600
During the Western Zhou Dynasty,

344
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,260
Emperor Mu, who loved to travel,

345
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,510
once had four Bai Zes pull a chariot
through Mount Zhongnan.

346
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,890
In truth, he used the journey as an excuse

347
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
to cleanse the mountain of demons.

348
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,240
After his victory,

349
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,690
he left the four Bai Zes in the mountain

350
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,750
to permanently suppress

351
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,650
the demons of Guanzhong.

352
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:18,970
Are you saying

353
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,050
there really are Bai Zes in this mountain?

354
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,600
So-called divine beasts

355
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,850
are really just ordinary creatures

356
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,320
that existed in ancient times

357
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,060
and later became extinct,

358
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:29,730
like

359
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:30,650
phoenix,

360
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,560
Qilin,

361
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:32,990
and Bai Ze.

362
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:34,970
There's no need to make a fuss

363
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,940
when they occasionally appear.

364
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,600
Temple keeper,

365
00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:41,590
aren't you afraid we'll stay here

366
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:42,640
and not leave?

367
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,850
If we don't see Bai Ze,

368
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,710
how will you explain yourself?

369
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,210
If you don't see Bai Ze,

370
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:51,990
you can

371
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:54,030
smash my temple!

372
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,010
Quite a temper.

373
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,660
I'm tired.

374
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,329
I'm going back to sleep.

375
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,470
What about you two?

376
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,000
Let's go.

377
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,460
I'll stay a bit longer to drink.

378
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,280
Huo You.

379
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,520
Where did you touch that woman

380
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,780
who fell off the cliff—

381
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:25,599
her face or her butt?

382
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:26,609
Wait.

383
00:17:27,329 --> 00:17:28,770
General, I...

384
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,550
The Princess's Mansion sent two women.

385
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,680
We thought they were quite something,

386
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,750
but surprisingly,

387
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,350
one was dealt with so easily.

388
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,070
You'll be credited

389
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,020
with the greatest merit.

390
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,770
Thank you, General.

391
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,760
You scoundrel, stop!

392
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,440
Commander Li!

393
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,400
This is none of your business.

394
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,400
If you interfere,

395
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:59,890
don't blame me
when my blade shows no mercy!

396
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:02,060
We're all acting
under His Majesty's orders.

397
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,130
With me here,

398
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,730
internal fighting will not be tolerated.

399
00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:05,590
His Majesty...

400
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,380
only sent you.

401
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,070
He has no control over me!

402
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,400
Ding,

403
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,820
what are you doing?

404
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,580
This young lady has quite a temper.

405
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,940
If she doesn't vent her anger,

406
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,200
won't she end up burning herself with it?

407
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:28,930
Huo You!

408
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,120
Let's have a friendly match

409
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,840
and see what

410
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,840
the Commander of the Princess's Guards
is capable of.

411
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,390
Being so gentle with the ladies?

412
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,270
General Ding.

413
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:14,500
You agreed to a friendly match,

414
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:15,970
so why use deadly force?

415
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,420
Let me avenge Huo Jing!

416
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,520
See?

417
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,110
She's the one using deadly force!

418
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:25,490
Commander Li,

419
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,390
a wise person knows when to stop.

420
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,130
You want her to be wise?

421
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,290
Does she deserve it?

422
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,080
Come on!

423
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,580
Since the Tanglong era,

424
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,970
my blade

425
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,970
hasn't tasted blood for a long time.

426
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,730
Enough!

427
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,410
I am the leader appointed by His Majesty.

428
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,520
General Ding,
please return to your room and rest.

429
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:01,600
Fine.

430
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:03,640
Let's go.

431
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,610
You, as a woman,

432
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,890
instead of getting married,

433
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,930
insist on being a commander.

434
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,260
There has never been
a female regimental commander before you,

435
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,120
and there will never be one after!

436
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,270
Otherwise,

437
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,210
what are we generals for?

438
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:38,670
It's all the General's fault!

439
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:40,600
Otherwise I would have killed her!

440
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,360
With Lu Lingfeng protecting her,

441
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,890
it won't be easy to kill her.

442
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,100
I purposely provoked her earlier.

443
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,410
Next time she strikes,

444
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,890
we will swarm her

445
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,240
and cut her down.

446
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,880
We must not let her return to Chang'an.

447
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,680
That's right.

448
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:57,040
Anyone who obstructs our search
for the auspicious beasts

449
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,740
must die,

450
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,750
including the General.

451
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,210
General Ding,

452
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,160
His Majesty is a wise ruler

453
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,680
and he will lead the Tang Empire
to a glorious age.

454
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,450
But now that
he has just ascended the throne,

455
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,530
both the court and common people

456
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:15,800
are full of gossip.

457
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,770
The appearance of an auspicious beast

458
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:19,980
is the perfect strategy
to silence thousands of mouths.

459
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,240
We cannot be careless.

460
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,210
But His Majesty has entrusted this matter

461
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,830
to Yongzhou Prefecture Office,

462
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,170
with Lu Lingfeng as the leader.

463
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,100
That's because
His Majesty wants to test him.

464
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,240
His Majesty values talent,

465
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,430
but the more talented the disloyal are,

466
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,130
the less we can tolerate them.

467
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,460
After all,

468
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,140
what His Majesty urgently needs now

469
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,540
are trusted commanders,

470
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,610
not potential threats.

471
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,900
As for Su Wuming,

472
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,350
he's one of the Princess's faction.

473
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,090
Doesn't he always

474
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:50,480
claim to be Master Di's disciple

475
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,810
and act so smug about it?

476
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:54,470
Then for Master Di's sake,

477
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:55,890
let Mount Zhongnan

478
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,790
be his final resting place.

479
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,740
His Majesty's previous reward

480
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,100
was meant for the heroes of Tanglong era,

481
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,830
for brothers

482
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,510
of the Imperial Guard like us.

483
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,520
Lu Lingfeng

484
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,590
was once among us.

485
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:08,800
At that time,

486
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,780
who could've thought that his mother

487
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,310
was actually the Princess?

488
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,540
At the very moment
his true lineage was revealed,

489
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,230
he stood on

490
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:18,110
the opposite side of His Majesty.

491
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,790
A pity indeed.

492
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,000
Where is Wei Qi?

493
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
He couldn't be so eager for merit

494
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,310
that he went alone

495
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,640
to find Bai Ze, could he?

496
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,810
How ridiculous.

497
00:22:34,650 --> 00:22:35,550
He actually believes

498
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,810
the legendary auspicious beasts exist.

499
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,460
Great Deity Bai Ze,

500
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:45,840
where are you?

501
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,360
I know you're a divine beast

502
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,440
who can speak in human language.

503
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,710
I'm here to find you.

504
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,160
I mean no harm.

505
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,070
Just now, I specifically paid respect

506
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,480
to your statue at your shrine.

507
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,500
I am very sincere.

508
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,630
Would you please show yourself?

509
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,090
If I am ever granted rank and title,

510
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,740
I promise

511
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,240
I'll build you a golden statue.

512
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,420
Is that you, Great Deity Bai Ze?

513
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,680
Darling,

514
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,360
let's rest early after we finish eating.

515
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,310
Scholar,

516
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:37,200
traveling at night

517
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,530
with such a pretty lady,

518
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:40,460
aren't you afraid of encountering demons?

519
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,920
Who says we're not afraid?

520
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,100
I'm terrified, actually.

521
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,140
Then buy a Bai Ze Scroll.

522
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,330
It's the most effective
in warding off evil spirits.

523
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,300
Only 90 cash.

524
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,000
90 cash?

525
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,850
So expensive?

526
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,510
Expensive?

527
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,200
Aren't you afraid of
being possessed by evil spirits?

528
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,400
If you care about me,

529
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:00,960
buy me one.

530
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,790
Darling, I...

531
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,060
Alright, alright.

532
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,520
Wait a moment.

533
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,050
Give me the book now.

534
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:16,800
I've already found a buyer.

535
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,400
I haven't finished reading it yet.

536
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,460
You penniless guy,

537
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,050
don't get my book dirty.

538
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,460
You know what?

539
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:26,310
This really looks like
an original from the Western Zhou.

540
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:27,850
There are many stories

541
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,250
I've never seen before.

542
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,780
Looks like?

543
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,600
It is!

544
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,720
They offered 90 cash for it.

545
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,580
Give it to me.

546
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,450
So you only have this one scroll?

547
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,240
Just this one.

548
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,560
Then can I read a bit longer?

549
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,880
Only if you buy it.

550
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,320
Alright!

551
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:46,590
90.

552
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,070
90 cash counted.

553
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,590
Where's the Bai Ze Scroll?

554
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,200
Bring it to my wife.

555
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:54,370
Sorry, young scholar.

556
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,650
This old scholar bought it first.

557
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,510
Honey,

558
00:24:58,750 --> 00:24:59,600
he bought it.

559
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,200
Look.

560
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,570
This isn't my fault.

561
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,160
Honey,

562
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,270
-There's nothing I can do.
-All because you were dawdling.

563
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:07,530
Don't be mad, alright?

564
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,080
Two's company, and three's a crowd.

565
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,660
May I join you two

566
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,400
for a drink?

567
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,030
Sir,

568
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,640
I...

569
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:17,830
I was just thinking
this water's too bland.

570
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:19,100
Is that good wine

571
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:20,440
in your flask?

572
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,960
Yes, it is.

573
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,590
Sir,

574
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,580
have a seat.

575
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:26,370
Absolutely good wine.

576
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:28,070
I promise one sip

577
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,810
will make you want 10 more.

578
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,350
I wonder how many sips

579
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,530
that "10" really means.

580
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,310
As many

581
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,550
as you say.

582
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,960
Anyway,

583
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,920
it's up to you.

584
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,160
Sir,

585
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,200
here.

586
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:46,830
You'd better not drink.

587
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:47,720
If you pass out later,

588
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,680
who could carry you?

589
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,140
Why won't you let me drink?

590
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,030
It's such good wine.

591
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:51,890
I must drink it.

592
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:53,270
Come, sir.

593
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,590
A toast to you.

594
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,160
Counted.

595
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,070
90 cash.

596
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:07,550
Here.

597
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,400
Sir,

598
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:10,820
it's good wine.

599
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Really good wine.

600
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:12,920
Here.

601
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:13,440
Here.

602
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,610
Thank you, sir.

603
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,090
It's fate that

604
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,070
in this remote temple
on a desolate mountain,

605
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,670
we get to drink such fine wine

606
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,450
and meet such a good person.

607
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,000
Here.

608
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:27,310
Let me fill your cup.

609
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:28,420
Well,

610
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
thank you.

611
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,480
Miss,

612
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,550
please.

613
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,940
-Please.
-Please.

614
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,320
Good wine.

615
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,150
Good wine.

616
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,310
Don't close the door.

617
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,350
You're right.

618
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,200
On the way here,
Huo Jing fell off a cliff.

619
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,810
Now,

620
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,560
this wild temple is mysterious

621
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,360
and the visitors are strange.

622
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,640
If I hadn't spent 90 cash

623
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,060
on this Bai Ze Scroll,

624
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,880
I wouldn't dare to sleep.

625
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,130
She fell asleep?

626
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,730
I don't know.

627
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,920
After a fierce battle earlier,

628
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,440
she hasn't left her room since.

629
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,680
A fierce battle?

630
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,720
With whom?

631
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:35,990
The Imperial Guards?

632
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:38,380
But I didn't hear a thing

633
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,290
in the main hall.

634
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,910
But I heard that monster's cry

635
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,020
very clearly.

636
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:51,510
Why is it so quiet in her room?

637
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,750
Commander Li
didn't escape through a window

638
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,720
to fight that Huo You,

639
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,620
did she?

640
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,760
I checked that room.

641
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,980
There's no window.

642
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,490
The only entrance

643
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,440
is this door.

644
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,340
No wonder
you arranged the lodging this way.

645
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,170
How thoughtful.

646
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,590
With your protection,

647
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,690
Commander Li is definitely safe.

648
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,270
However...

649
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:14,750
Chen He's purse

650
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,510
[Bai Ze Scroll]

651
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:17,680
might not be so safe.

652
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,610
What do you mean?

653
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,510
I told you not to drink so much,
but you did anyway.

654
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:27,030
He hasn't bathed for half a month.

655
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,350
He smells awful.

656
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:33,790
Let's continue drinking.

657
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:39,590
I just took a bath
before entering the mountain.

658
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:40,310
Smell it.

659
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,480
You're...

660
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,660
too bold.

661
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,280
It's not my fault
your man can't hold his liquor.

662
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,440
What if he's just pretending?

663
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,030
How could that be?

664
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,880
Does he enjoy watching you

665
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:53,640
getting teased by another man?

666
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:55,880
Who knows?

667
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,810
A man's heart

668
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,760
is like the fog in the mountains—

669
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,190
who can see through it?

670
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,480
That's because
you're not looking carefully enough.

671
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,270
Later,

672
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,560
I'll let you take a good look.

673
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,790
You're really...

674
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,470
outrageously bold.

675
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,710
Your voice isn't exactly quiet either.

676
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,930
Aren't you afraid of waking him up?

677
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,000
A demon!

678
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:27,270
Where?

679
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,500
Right there just now.

680
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,730
It had horns

681
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,640
and fangs.

682
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:36,920
I think

683
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,030
you're talking about
the statue of Deity Bai Ze.

684
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,760
If there's a demon in this room,

685
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:41,920
it's you—

686
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:44,030
the little temptress
daring to seduce someone

687
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,100
under a god's nose.

688
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,680
Maybe

689
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,450
I really was seeing things.

690
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,430
You weren't seeing things—

691
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,680
you were...

692
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,130
lovestruck.

693
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,240
My apologies.

694
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,210
Wait for me.

695
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,220
You're even more eager than I am.

696
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,960
I'm just afraid

697
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,310
you'll rush into my arms

698
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:43,640
and tear my clothes.

699
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,780
That's exactly what I like about you.

700
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:03,170
Where are you two going?

701
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,300
Traveling at night?

702
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,240
The road's slippery after the rain.

703
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,890
Aren't you afraid of running into ghosts?

704
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,890
Where we're going

705
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,570
is none of your business!

706
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,790
You're quite skilled

707
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,720
at pretending to be drunk—

708
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,470
waiting till your wife's
carried off by another man

709
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,690
before waking up.

710
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,350
What did you say?

711
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,730
You shameless woman!

712
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:30,440
You let another man carry you?

713
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,700
I-I was drunk.

714
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,070
I didn't know a thing.

715
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,110
Honey,

716
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,790
some other man was taking advantage of me.

717
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,250
You have to stand up for me.

718
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,060
Speak! Which man carried you?

719
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:41,680
Tell me!

720
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,660
I was drunk.

721
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,360
I don't remember anything.

722
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:00,600
What's going on?

723
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,830
Search him

724
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:02,880
and see if he has

725
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,210
Official Chen's purse.

726
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,080
General.

727
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,610
Where is Chen He?

728
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,850
You pair of thieves!

729
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:26,590
Tell me!

730
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,920
Where did you take Official Chen?

731
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,440
Huo You.

732
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,510
Speak up!

733
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,650
Isn't he sleeping in bed?

734
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,090
That's exactly what I like about you.

735
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,160
He's down?

736
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:54,690
I've never once failed

737
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,870
when using a knockout drug.

738
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:58,780
He's an official.

739
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,090
He must have money.

740
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:09,730
Let's go.

741
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,070
What's

742
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,160
all this noise?

743
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,200
What's...

744
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,480
all this noise?

745
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,570
[Bai Ze Temple]

746
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,370
I guess

747
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,990
Chen He

748
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,290
must have acted foolishly while drunk

749
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,590
and fell into those thieves' trap.

750
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,420
Too embarrassed to face us,

751
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,480
he just left first.

752
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:07,830
That's possible.

753
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,760
Good morning, General Ding.

754
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,360
Good morning, Official Huo.

755
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,380
Where is Official Wei?

756
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,310
Mind your own business!

757
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:21,030
What?

758
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,960
Don't tell me Wei Qi also...

759
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,400
You...

760
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:27,250
Ding,

761
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,760
where is Wei Qi?

762
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,679
He disappeared last night.

763
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,239
He must have been eager to earn merit

764
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,100
and went to find Bai Ze overnight.

765
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,230
So, Ding,

766
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,420
what's the plan for today?

767
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,670
You're the leader.

768
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,650
We'll follow your orders.

769
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,320
Didn't Hermit Baize

770
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,260
say yesterday

771
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,100
that as long as we waited here,

772
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,630
Bai Ze would appear?

773
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:52,150
The temple keeper's old, half-blind,

774
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,280
and talks nonsense.

775
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:54,710
You actually believe him?

776
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:57,190
Of course not.

777
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,040
Good morning, Commander Li.

778
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,130
Did you sleep well?

779
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:06,630
Yes.

780
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,000
Well then,

781
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,990
let's set out to find Bai Ze.

782
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,660
Wait a moment.

783
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,090
Something's not right.

784
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:15,760
Well...

785
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,590
Where's our guide, Ling Ji?

786
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,760
Why isn't he up yet?

787
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,280
You mean...

788
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,000
that hunter?

789
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,440
The storehouse next to the kitchen.

790
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,500
That house is tall.

791
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,060
He said he liked it,

792
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,590
so he slept there.

793
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:47,110
Ling Ji.

794
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,100
How can you
still be sleeping at this hour?

795
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,360
Ling Ji!

796
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,230
Well?

797
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,920
He hanged himself.

798
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,840
Do you even know how to examine a corpse?

799
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,500
He was our guide for this trip.

800
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,670
If we really find the divine beast Bai Ze,

801
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,500
he will be set for life

802
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,670
with riches and pleasure.

803
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,130
Why would he hang himself?

804
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,250
Scholar Su is Master Di's disciple

805
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,770
and an expert in autopsies.

806
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:05,100
His autopsy results are beyond question.

807
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,400
Huo You.

808
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,210
Lu Lingfeng,

809
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,210
do me a favor.

810
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,280
Commander Li,

811
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,610
what are you doing?

812
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,950
Lift Ling Ji's body onto my back.

813
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,760
I want to bury him.

814
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,780
Do you know him?

815
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:36,760
Do I

816
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,680
have to know him to bury him?

817
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,110
Should we just leave his body
to rot in the wild?

818
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,970
Think about it—

819
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,650
if Ling Ji hadn't taken this job
as our guide,

820
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,230
how could he have met
such a tragic incident?

821
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:49,710
Wait.

822
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:52,630
Incident?

823
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,110
Commander Li,

824
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,930
my examination concluded it was

825
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,090
suicide by hanging.

826
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,390
I'm not deaf.

827
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:04,380
He may have ended his life himself,

828
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,920
but if he hadn't joined
this absurd expedition,

829
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,510
I believe

830
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:09,970
he wouldn't have died.

831
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,840
Lu Lingfeng.

832
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,510
Help me.

833
00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:00,740
[Tomb of Ling Ji]

834
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,260
[Tomb of Ling Ji]

835
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,920
It's General Ding!

836
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,290
Isn't...

837
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,880
Isn't this Wei Qi, Official Wei?

838
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,630
Do I need you to tell me that?

839
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,360
You think I wouldn't recognize

840
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,060
my brother?

841
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,590
Silence, all of you!
