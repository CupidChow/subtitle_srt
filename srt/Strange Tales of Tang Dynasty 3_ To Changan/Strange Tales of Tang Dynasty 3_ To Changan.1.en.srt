they won't reach Chang'an today,

141

Yes.

154
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,520
It was a grave error on my part

155

to have let him live to see this day.

156

Only you and I are
in attendance upon His Majesty.

With so many golden peaches,

167
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,390
do you mean to burden His Majesty?

168
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,170
So you mean to say

00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,730
my son has returned safely

00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,360
from this journey to the west

172
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,750
Yes, exactly.

173
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,720
There were moments of alarm,
but no real danger.

174
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,120
Sheriff Lu emerged completely unscathed,

175
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,600

deceive me, Su Wuming!

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,550
with little comfort or decent food—

187
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:38,240
and everyone knows the famous delicacies

188
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,440
at Weicheng Station—

189
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,480
he must have been tempted by the thought
of a good meal.

190
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,340
Still playing word games with me!

191
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,550
Is that person at Weicheng Station?

192
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,400
Which person?

193
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,510
Who else

194
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,310
could possibly make Lu Lingfeng
halt his journey?

195
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,320
Hold on.

196
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,550
Your Majesty.

197
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,700
This is precisely what I was looking for.

198
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,670
[Golden Peaches of the Kang Kingdom]

199
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,990
[Map of the Western Region]

200
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,150
What is this?

201
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,560
During the reign of the Empress Wu Zetian,

202
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
kingdoms and tribes in the Western Regions

203
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,540
formed alliances,

204
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,390
blocking the Silk Road from time to time

205
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,840
and severing trade between east and west.

206
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,030
Yet the Tang Empire,
embroiled in internal strife,

207
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,870
lacked the resources
for military campaigns.

208
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,000
During my time at the Eastern Palace,

209
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,100
I lamented and strategized
over this matter day and night.

210
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,660
[Elite Cavalry]

211
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,910
Together with the Grand General,

212
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:55,030
[Gongyue City]

213
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,870
we devised a plan:
to dispatch elite agents

214
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,990
to covertly operate
within the Kang Kingdom,

215
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,200
[Kucha Town]

216
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,870
where they would gather intelligence
on the various kingdoms

217
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,910
of the Western Regions,
relay information to Chang'an,

218
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,770
and ultimately

219
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,720
produce this Map of the Western Regions.

220
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,000
It documents the royal courts
of various states,

221
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,600
crucial for safeguarding our borders
and keeping the Silk Road open.

222
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
However, due to constant warfare
in the Western Regions

223
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
and hostility from some factions
toward the Tang Empire,

224
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,320
several attempts

225
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
to deliver the map ended in failure.

226
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,030
Only when we confirmed

227
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,240
the Kang Kingdom

228
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,840
would resume paying tribute

229
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:20,750
did we formulate the plan

230
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,480
to conceal it
within the growing golden peaches.

231
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,910
I see. So that's how it is.

232
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,870
So, what you brought back

233
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,470
transcends golden peaches.

234
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:30,600
This map

235
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,630
will greatly assist the Tang Empire's

236
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,270
future governance
of the Western Regions

237
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,510
and beyond.

238
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,750
Your Majesty, from the heart of Chang'an,

239
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,440
has laid plans that span the four seas.

240
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,670
Your vision encompasses all under heaven,

241
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,270
and Your foresight is profound.

242
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,200
I am deeply awed,

243
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,390
Your Majesty.

244
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,740
Now,

245
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,230
would you prefer to remain by my side,

246
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:52,620
or are you in a rush
to return to Yunding County

247
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,880
as its county sheriff?

248
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,270
His Majesty defied considerable opposition

249
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,720
to entrust you with the golden peaches.

250
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
Can't you see why you were

251
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,500
recalled to Chang'an?

252
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,330
Now that we speak face to face,

253
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,720
certain matters must be addressed.

254
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,740
As for the rumors about your background,

255
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,150
they matter to me,

256
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:22,760
and yet, they do not.

257
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,980
What about you?

258
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,100
Take your time to decide.

259
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,230
After so long apart,

260
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,010
we should drink heartily.

261
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:51,750
Laifu,

262
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,020
prepare some wine.

263
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,500
At once, Your Majesty.

264
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:56,850
Lu Lingfeng will

[Yang Hua, Palace Attendant-in-Ordinary]

266
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,770
arrive in the capital within days.

267
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,370
Attendant Yang,

268
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:03,960
I thought

269
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,320
he had been dealt with.

270
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,720
Shall I handle this?

271
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,270
[Laifu, Palace Attendant]

272
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:11,000
I, Laifu,
will ensure he never reaches Chang'an.

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,790
During this journey to the west,

274
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,150
my favorite place

275
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,720
was Dunhuang in Shazhou Prefecture.

276
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,550
Dunhuang

277
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,880
is the crossroads of the world,

278
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,780
the vital hub of the Silk Road—

279
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:24,960
a bustling metropolis
with breathtaking landscapes.

280
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,480
Your Highness, as a devout Buddhist,

281
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,720
why not spend some time
in Shazhou Prefecture?

282
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,390
I believe

283
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,720
the Mogao Caves of Dunhuang

284
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,670
would captivate you endlessly.

285
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,750
Su Wuming,

286
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,420
you are so calculating!

287
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,360
Over the past two years,

288
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:45,550
many have poisoned
the Retired Emperor's ear

289
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,610
against me—

290
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:47,720
some suggesting

291
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,270
I be sent to Puzhou Prefecture,

292
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,670
others to Luoyang.

293
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,910
Now

294
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,670
you advise me to go to Shazhou Prefecture.

295
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:58,130
Aren't you afraid
I might have you beheaded?

296
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,330
I

297
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,720
carry the surname of Li.

298
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,120
I am more fit

299
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,120
to be this dynasty's empress

300
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,920
than Empress Wu Zetian ever was.

301
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,630
Do you think

302
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,030
this is merely my obsession?

303
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,510
I do this for the empire!

304
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,240
Su Wuming,

305
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,240
do you recall what I said

306
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,080
when I bid you farewell here

307
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,440
years ago?

308
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,750
If you truly wish what is best
for the Tang Empire,

309
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,980
then aid me in my cause.

310
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,410
I will give the people

311
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,120
a prosperous golden age.

312
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,320
Today, let there be
no sovereign and subject—

313
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,520
here are only Sanlang
and his two kindred spirits.

314
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,320
Come,

315
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,300
cheers.

316
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,770
Lu Lingfeng,

317
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,570
since we are kindred spirits,

318
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,760
we should speak without reservation.

319
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,000
Then I must ask—

320
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,920
have you ever considered taking my life,
Sanlang?

321
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,050
Lu Lingfeng,

322
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,510
what are you saying?

323
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,210
Continue.

324
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:31,920
On our journey west,

325
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,420
in Shiyang County,

326
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,550
the assassins I encountered

327
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,750
were no wanderers of the martial world.

328
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,580
I did dispatch agents—

329
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,700
to eliminate Su Wuming.

330
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,600
What does that have to do with you?

331
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,150
There were two groups of assassins.

332
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,150
I had anticipated

333
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,270
that those targeting Su Wuming
were sent by the Grand General.

334
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,240
But the other group

335
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,500
used poisoned arrows—

336
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,050
that couldn't possibly be
the Grand General's work.

337
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:57,710
Later,

338
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,600
at a place called Mojia Inn,

339
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,550
I nearly fell at the hands

340
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,720
of bounty hunters.

341
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,720
On their bodies,

342
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,410
we found documents
ordering my assassination.

343
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,800
This stationery

344
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,830
isn't what ordinary people use.

345
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:12,080
The paper

346
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,690
is exclusively reserved
for the Eastern Palace.

347
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:20,960
Laifu.

348
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

349
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,750
Go wash some golden peaches.

350
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,010
At once, Your Majesty.

351
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,390
Lu Lingfeng's suspicions

352
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,510
are not unfounded.

353
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:30,790
I believe

354
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,330
it must have been Bai Shan—

355
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,510
he always sought to eliminate

356
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,840
perceived threats to me
within his lifetime.

357
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,390
You've

358
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:40,200
gained my trust,

359
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,210
yet sudden rumors
about your origins emerged,

360
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,870
making you appear as a threat.

361
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,730
Lu Lingfeng,

362
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,630
I recall you shared

363
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:47,720
a good rapport with Bai Shan.

364
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,320
This matter isn't personal.

365
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,480
Bai Shan's loyalty is commendable,

366
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,120
and you,

367
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,840
born of a family
of renown across the land,

368
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,370
ought to show magnanimity.

369
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,320
If you could toast
to the late Minister Bai now,

370
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,380
I would think even more highly of you.

371
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:08,510
But he isn't here.

372
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,310
He passed away

373
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,270
two months ago.

374
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:19,829
Bai Shan,

375
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,040
I know your heart was loyal,

376
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,819
but resorting to poisoned arrows

377
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,200
and hiring bounty hunters

378
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,660
against Lu Lingfeng was truly unwarranted.

379
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,720
I

380
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,770
offer you this cup as censure.

381
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,560
After all, this is Chang'an—

382
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,590
even before entering the city,

383
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,520
we're treated to such delicacies!

384
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,110
I...

385
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:18,310
I-I want to compose a poem!

386
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,480
I...

387
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,910
I... I just can't find the words!

388
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:28,110
Mr. Fei,

389
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,550
in the Tang Empire,
poets are everywhere.

390
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,440
Who knows—

391
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,920
perhaps someday someone
in this Weicheng Station

392
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,650
will write verses
that endure through the ages.

393
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,210
Exactly!

394
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,150
Among the 110 wards of Chang'an,

395
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,400
if each ward produced timeless poetry,

396
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,920
future generations would forever remember

397
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,440
this magnificent Chang'an.

398
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,200
Miss Xijun, Miss Yingtao,

399
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,000
well said!

400
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Though I, Xue Huan, cannot compose poetry,

401
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,330
your words stir my soul.

402
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,460
Let me toast to you!

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,700
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

404
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,310
These golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom

405
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:00,370
are the sweetest fruits in the world.

406
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,440
In my youth,

407
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,880
I tasted half of one
at the Princess's Mansion—

408
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,270
that extraordinary flavor

409
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,730
remains vivid to this day.

410
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,590
But these are tributes.

411
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,720
I'm simply not entitled...

412
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,650
As the escort,

413
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,200
you have every right.

414
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,150
Enjoy it, now.

415
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:24,590
Your Majesty,

416
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,960
if we speak of merit,

417
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:26,960
along this trip,

418
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,200
then besides myself

419
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,880
the five others—
Su Wuming, Pei Xijun, Fei Yingjun,

420
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,070
Chu Yingtao, and Xue Huan—

421
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:35,130
all contributed significantly
to the escort mission.

422
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,040
Understood.

423
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,070
These three golden peaches shall be yours

424
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,270
to share with those
who journeyed west with you.

425
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,400
How does that sound?

426
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,890
In that case,

427
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,750
thank you, Your Majesty.

428
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,410
Grand General,

429
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,610
let us eat first.

430
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,640
Many thanks, Your Majesty.

431
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,720
Still the same unforgettable taste.

432
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,120
Truly the king of fruits.

433
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,480
I am

434
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,940
fortunate indeed.

435
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:30,890
Grand General!

436
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,240
Hurry!

437
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,710
Fetch the bow and arrows!

438
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,400
Bring the blade!

439
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,650
Grand General!

440
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:47,670
Grand General, are you alright?

441
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:48,920
I'm fine.

442
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,860
I'm made of tougher stuff.

443
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,390
It's such a massive

444
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,640
and ferocious bird, attacking people!

445
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,370
Lu Lingfeng,

446
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,410
do you know what species it is?

447
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,450
I do not know, Your Majesty.

448
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:03,830
It's back!

449
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,110
It's back!

450
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,680
Not the same one—

451
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,010
this one's even larger.

452
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,720
Protect His Majesty!

453
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,380
-Yes.
-Yes.

454
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,550
-Grand General!
-Grand General!

455
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:49,350
Never mind me—

456
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,590
shoot it down!

457
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,880
Something's wrong—

458
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,080
there's trouble in the rear courtyard!

459
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,690
Xue Huan, my spear!

460
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,110
Your Majesty, please retreat inside first.

461
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,070
Everyone else,
guard the doors and windows!

462
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,230
[Auspicious Clouds and Blazing Sun]

463
00:23:59,030 --> 00:23:59,590
Master.

464
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,270
-Are you alright?
-Xue Huan.

465
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,130
What happened?

466
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:55,920
I'm fine.

467
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,240
Lu Lingfeng,

468
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,350
are you all right?

469
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,070
Liu XVII...

470
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,090
What did you say?

471
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,110
Wait—

472
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,720
it could also be Liu XVIII

473
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,510
or Liu XIX.

474
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,030
The Liu brothers?

475
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:14,830
Why are you suddenly

476
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,490
mentioning Gantang Station?

477
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,370
Fei Yingjun,

478
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,090
I hear you're Medicine King's disciple.

479
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:39,400
If you can save the Grand General's eye,

480
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,720
I'll grant you
any official position you desire.

481
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,780
If you prefer gold,

482
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,800
you shall have it in abundance.

483
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,240
Official rank

484
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,830
is a thing I desire;

485
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,070
gold ingots

486
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,840
are also a thing I desire.

487
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,530
But even with both,

488
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,750
I cannot save that eye.

489
00:25:59,110 --> 00:25:59,970
Don't touch it!

490
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,060
Grand General,

491
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,440
hold on a little longer.

492
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,400
Laifu.

493
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,110
When will the imperial physicians arrive?

495
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,830
They've been summoned urgently
on horseback.

496
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:09,790
It won't help.

497
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,090
Even if my revered teacher
were still alive,

498
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,720
he couldn't save that eye.

499
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,440
Your Majesty,

500
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,280
if you permit me to treat him now,

501
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:21,400
I can ensure Lu Tong's survival.

502
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,490
But if we delay any longer,

503
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,480
I'm afraid his life will...

504
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,210
Lu Lingfeng.

505
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

506
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,740
Should I trust him?

507
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:38,280
He truly is a divine physician—

508
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
proven recently in Yunding County,

509
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,100
-as previously in Luoyang—
-I don't need stories. Can I trust him?

510
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,120
I have absolute faith

511
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,040
in Fei Yingjun's

512
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,040
medical skills.

513
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,810
I implore Physician Fei

514
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,790
to save my Grand General's life at once.

515
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,720
You

516
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
have my entreaty.

517
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,410
Your Majesty bowing to me?

518
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,790
This is beyond my station.

519
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:11,050
I, Fei Yingjun,
will exert my utmost effort, Your Majesty.

520
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:16,420
Lu Lingfeng,

521
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,900
[Auspicious Clouds and Blazing Sun]

522
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,250
how is Lu Tong's condition?

523
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,110
His life is not in danger,

524
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:24,750
but one eye

525
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,740
is likely lost.

526
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,470
The second raptor was a man in disguise—

527
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,460
with the face of one of the Liu brothers

528
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,640
from Gantang Station.

529
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,440
That's right.

530
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,240
This is unbelievable.

531
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,170
By all accounts,

532
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,310
Liu XVII committed grave crimes

533
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:42,510
and should have been executed long ago.

534
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,960
Moreover,

535
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,550
neither Liu XVII nor Liu XVIII

536
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:47,480
possessed martial skills.

537
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,510
Though Liu XIX was vicious

538
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,040
with serpent-like traits,

539
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,200
he couldn't possibly
have flown from the sky

540
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,460
to attack the Emperor.

541
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,400
So I must ask—

542
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,070
having been absent
from the court for so long,

543
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,790
were you perhaps so overwhelmed

544
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,920
that you saw things?

545
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:01,680
Nonsense!

546
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,160
In the heat of battle, during crisis—

547
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,290
could your vision have been impaired?

548
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,350
You're the one with clouded vision!

549
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,200
Having drunk several cups,

550
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,920
your bleary eyes might
have misperceived things.

551
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,480
You...

552
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,690
Time is critical—

553
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,380
I have no leisure

554
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,510
for baseless arguments here.

555
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,910
If you keep pestering me,
don't blame me...

556
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:33,750
Since you are so certain about it,

557
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:36,400
let me go to Gantang County
for investigation.

558
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,310
Fine! I hallucinated, saw incorrectly,

559
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,110
drank too much, and made a mistake—

560
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:42,510
I should go personally
to verify the truth.

561
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,500
How dare I trouble you, Su Wuming?

562
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,440
How did you know

563
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,510
I intended to go to Gantang County?

564
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,680
The Emperor remains at Weicheng Station,

565
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,750
the Grand General is severely wounded—

566
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,490
if you leave,

567
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,920
what if the raptor returns?

568
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,000
I've already instructed
the Imperial Guards.

569
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,440
If the Imperial Guards

570
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,010
could defeat that raptor,

571
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,590
how could Lu Tong

572
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,880
lose an eye?

573
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,920
As a mere commoner,

574
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,640
I am useless here—

575
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,740
I might as well run your errand
to Gantang County.

576
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,730
You stay to protect the Emperor

577
00:29:12,750 --> 00:29:15,460
and investigate the raptor—

578
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,250
that's the optimal strategy.

579
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,670
Lingfeng,

580
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,560
the situation is critical.

581
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,000
Guard Weicheng Station tonight—

582
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:33,930
admit no one.

583
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,600
Remember,

584
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,590
no one.

585
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,210
Halt! No further approach!

586
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,370
I am Li Feng,
the General of Loyalty and Valor.

587
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:54,550
[Li Feng, General of Loyalty and Valor]

588
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,240
Hearing of disturbances at the station,
I came to protect His Majesty.

589
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,200
Open the gates.

590
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,260
General Li,

591
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,000
His Majesty has retired for the night.

592
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,910
I must ask you

593
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,750
to deploy defenses
outside Weicheng Station.

594
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:14,610
And who are you?

595
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,720
I am Lu Lingfeng,
the County Sheriff of Yunding County.

596
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,200
You, a mere county sheriff—

597
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,480
and from Yunding County at that—

598
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,550
what authority do you have

599
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:23,200
to deny General Li's protection
of the Emperor?

600
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:23,860
Insolence!

601
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:24,920
Yes, Sir.

602
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,480
Sheriff Lu,

603
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,890
I must admit I share his curiosity.

604
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:29,720
[Imperial Guard]

605
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,480
The Imperial Guards' gold token
is right here.

606
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,790
I'm acting under imperial decree.

607
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,760
Understood.

608
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Relay my command:

609
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,480
pitch camps every thirty zhang

610
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,750
and fortify the positions.

611
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:43,110
-Yes, Sir!
-Yes, Sir!

612
00:30:50,930 --> 00:31:00,720
[Weicheng Station]

613
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,570
From Weicheng Station?

614
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,090
State your name.

615
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,920
Wuming.

616
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,320
Without a name? Bastard!

617
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:34,050
P-P-Please don't kill me.

618
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,030
I said my real name is Wuming,
not "without a name".

619
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,290
There's no way a nobody

620
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,510
could have stayed
at Weicheng Station tonight.

621
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,940
Has that noble guest

622
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,530
in the rear courtyard died?

623
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:44,950
And who are you delivering a message to?

624
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,020
Speak truthfully,

625
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:46,770
or

626
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,690
I'll take your wretched life.

627
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:49,720
Still silent?

628
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:07,690
Mount up!

629
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,010
Move out!

630
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,440
If we go, we go together!

631
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,770
Move back in the saddle.

632
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,440
You failed?

633
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,510
They saw my face.

634
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,500
And you dare return?

635
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,600
They couldn't catch me.

636
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,280
Aren't you afraid you'll implicate me?

637
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,110
[Owner of the Paper Effigy Shop]

638
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:04,790
You took the gold and silver—

639
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,310
that was the risk you bought into.

640
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,200
You know something?

641
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:13,110
That unsettling, ambiguous face of yours

642
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,690
is truly repulsive.

643
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,890
My face?

644
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,140
I happen to like it very much.

645
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,390
I am Du Ming,
Yongzhou's Chief Administrator.

646
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,350
[Du Ming, Yongzhou's Chief Administrator]
[Wu Wenbin, Judicial Official]

647
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,750
I am Wu Wenbin, the Judicial Official.

648
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,810
-Greetings, Your Majesty.
-Greetings, Your Majesty.

649
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:51,400
Has

650
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Yongzhou Prefecture documented
any prior attacks by these raptors?

651
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,920
None, Your Majesty.

652
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,440
That Your Majesty
was subjected to this horror

653
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,830
within my jurisdiction
of Yongzhou Prefecture

654
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:00,830
is my grave fault.

655
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,070
I await your punishment, Your Majesty.

656
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:06,000
Since Chang'an has no attack record
by such raptors,

657
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,070
they must have come
from beyond our borders,

658
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,670
hiding in nearby mountains.

659
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,800
I entrust this investigation

660
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,230
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

661
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,000
The raptors must be captured

662
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,510
before they harm civilians.

663
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:18,190
Yes, Your Majesty.

664
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,840
Once I have seen Your Majesty
safely back to the capital,

665
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,110
I will launch the investigation at once.

666
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,590
Your escort will not be required.

667
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,250
General Li.

668
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

669
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:25,670
Lu Tong is gravely wounded—

670
00:34:25,670 --> 00:34:27,480
he cannot ride
and must travel by carriage.

671
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,760
The carriage stands ready.

672
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,280
And the golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom?

673
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,739
Dedicated transport vehicles
stand ready too, Your Majesty.

674
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,030
Chief Administrator Du,

675
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,730
I engaged both raptors,

676
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,000
one after the other, in combat.

677
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,480
If your investigation requires assistance—

678
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,139
Sheriff Lu,

679
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:47,239
has His Majesty indicated
any promotion for you?

680
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,370
That's not a prerequisite.

681
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,510
But the raptor case

682
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,370
holds numerous bizarre elements

683
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,880
connected to my past investigations

684
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,190
during my assignment to the south.

685
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,050
Yet His Majesty

686
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,280
has assigned the case
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

687
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,230
Even if you were reinstated

688
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,030
as the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court,

689
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,840
you would still have no jurisdiction
in this matter, I'm afraid.

690
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,480
That said—

691
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,920
having fought alongside you
at Chengfo Temple last year

692
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,380
to eliminate corruption,

693
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,440
I hold you

694
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,760
in the highest personal esteem.

695
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,550
Therefore, I may consult you

696
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,360
on the raptor case as needed.

697
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,170
You can count on it.

698
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,580
Chief Administrator—

699
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,280
General Li,
you excel in both civil and military arts,

700
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,590
as a seasoned general
of countless campaigns.

701
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,050
What intrigues me is this—

702
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,920
given your lineage
and military achievements,

703
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,670
you ought to

704
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,840
hold a far higher rank
than your current position.

705
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,640
Your Majesty,

706
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:46,680
it is solely because

707
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:50,870
I fell out of favor
with the Grand Princess some years ago.

708
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
When you poured the wine yesterday,

709
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,130
why were you trembling?

710
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,920
Was it out of fear of that raptor?

711
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,120
Y-Yes, Your Majesty,

712
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,480
that creature was utterly terrifying.

713
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,490
But you were trembling

714
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,710
before the creature even appeared.

715
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,510
Laifu,

716
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,800
who exactly sent the bounty hunters

717
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,400
to assassinate Lu Lingfeng?

718
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,000
Attendant Yang,

719
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,650
why are you kneeling here?

720
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,510
Your Majesty, during this excursion
on which you brought Laifu,

721
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:35,560
you were subjected to grave danger.

722
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,760
As his superior,

723
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,400
I failed to ensure
Your Majesty's protection.

724
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,860
This humble servant
is also deeply at fault.

725
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,240
Who could have anticipated

726
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,680
an attack from the skies?

727
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,440
Rise.

728
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,310
Your Majesty,

729
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,880
the second attacker was

730
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,710
a bird-man?

731
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,290
One with a human face, indeed.

732
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,880
But

733
00:36:58,190 --> 00:36:59,520
a man disguised as a bird

734
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,710
flying through the air
is not beyond belief.

735
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,310
Back then,

736
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,110
the Empress Wu Zetian gathered

737
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,150
anomalous talents like Shasi—

738
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:05,880
men capable

739
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,800
of anything:

740
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:08,920
mechanical otters that caught fish,

741
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,320
wooden maidens that served wine,

742
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,400
even one who built a flying machine

743
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,420
to cross

744
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:16,030
the Luoshui River
from beyond the Tianjin Bridge.

745
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,020
So this must be

746
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,510
the Princess's doing.

747
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:22,320
Those anomalous talents you mentioned

748
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,230
may have long
since pledged allegiance to her.

749
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:24,830
Moreover,

750
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,650
the bird-man

751
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:27,280
specifically targeted
Your Majesty and Lu Tong

752
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,880
while avoiding Lu Lingfeng entirely.

753
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,840
Isn't this conclusive proof
of the Princess's involvement?

754
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,280
His Majesty narrowly escaped catastrophe,

755
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,800
Lu Tong lost an eye,

756
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,000
yet Lu Lingfeng distinguished himself

757
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,800
by protecting the Emperor.

758
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,710
So

759
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:41,030
Lu Tong is now a one-eyed Grand General?

760
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,310
His injury is severe.

761
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,440
It's uncertain if he'll ever be fit

762
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,400
to wield his blade again.

763
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:50,360
We must quickly identify a candidate
for the position

764
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,160
of the Grand General
of the Right Imperial Guards.

765
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:57,050
[Paper Effigy Shop]

766
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,550
Official Wu,

767
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,630
the deceased

768
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,670
was the owner of this Paper Effigy Shop.

769
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,190
Killed by a sharp weapon
through the chest—

770
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,320
a single fatal strike.

771
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,630
This is the murder weapon.

772
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:08,510
He was an out-of-towner,

773
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:10,020
rented this shop,

774
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,010
and had no family locally.

775
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,770
Any leads on the killer?

776
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,760
The prime suspect

777
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,070
is a recently hired assistant,

778
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:18,600
but he's already vanished.

779
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,230
Do we have the assistant's name

780
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:20,840
or origin?

781
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,370
Nothing at all.

782
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,800
But the property owner has seen him.

783
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,860
Where is the owner?

784
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,090
This is my newly hired assistant.

785
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,330
This is the landlord. Pay your respects.

786
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,190
Shall we commission a portrait

787
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:48,190
and issue a city-wide manhunt?

788
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:50,150
We await your decision, Official Wu.

789
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:50,950
Unnecessary.

790
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,710
We can't yet confirm

791
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,370
this assistant is the killer.

792
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,970
Creating a portrait

793
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,010
would only alert our prey.

794
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,380
Understood.

795
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,070
Why did you kill
the owner of the Paper Effigy Shop?

796
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,420
He tried to kill me first.

797
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,800
It was on your orders, wasn't it?

798
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,970
And if it was?

799
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,880
If you kill me now,

800
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,360
who will see your grand design

801
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,110
through to the end?

802
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,110
You wanted

803
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:34,190
a presentable identity in Chang'an,

804
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,000
so I pleaded with the shop owner.

805
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,140
He feared you'd implicate him

806
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,690
and turned against you.

807
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,360
Did you think

808
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:43,280
you could do as you please

809
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,000
and kill freely in Chang'an?

810
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:45,880
I was wrong.

811
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,940
Only about the killing?

812
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,110
I shouldn't have doubted you.

813
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,510
If I wanted someone dead,

814
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,360
I could do it myself effortlessly.

815
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,930
Why would I need a proxy?

816
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:56,240
Understood.

817
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,280
Do you remember our agreement?

818
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:06,150
Our great undertaking is not yet complete.

819
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:08,260
We must be united in purpose and effort.
