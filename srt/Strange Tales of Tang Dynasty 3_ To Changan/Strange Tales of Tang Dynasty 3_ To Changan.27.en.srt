[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

2
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 27]

3
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,229
The city is divided into two counties:

4
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,120
the eastern one called Wannian,
and the western one called Chang'an,

5
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,039
with Zhuque Avenue as the dividing line.

6
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,900
This design is truly ingenious.

7
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,270
As for the Wannian County Sheriff Du Yu—

8
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:50,920
he doesn't know me well,

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,120
but I've heard much about him.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,310
Like Wei Tao,

11
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,920
he comes from a prominent family
in the capital.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,040
They both entered officialdom
through family privilege,

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,680
and each possesses notable talent.

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
They're considered

15
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,140
two rising stars with unlimited potential.

16
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,960
As nobles

17
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,470
born and raised in Chang'an,

18
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,190
not only had their families
worn court caps for generations,

19
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,590
but they're also the closet to
the Emperor.

20
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,960
There's a local saying in Chang'an:

21
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,960
"south of the city live the Weis
and the Dus—only 5 feet from Heaven."

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,630
That I know.

23
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,640
We've already witnessed

24
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,100
Wei Tao's methods of handling cases.

25
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,079
But I wonder how this even younger

26
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,190
Du Yu's methods compare.

27
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,590
You want to go to
the Wannian County Office

28
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,850
to see how he conducts trials, don't you?

29
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,470
But from what Du Yu said just now,

30
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,840
he was already hinting

31
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,230
that we overstepped our authority.

32
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,850
If we go now,

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,030
won't it cause trouble for you,
Official Lu?

34
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,030
Don't try to use reverse psychology on me.

35
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,000
Do I look like someone
who's afraid of trouble?

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,630
Besides,

37
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,280
the Du family of the capital
should be magnanimous.

38
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,800
If we two go to observe,

39
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,590
Du Yu certainly won't mind.

40
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,960
Sheriff Du.

41
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,520
Could you please allow us

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,960
to take these things off our heads?

43
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,760
That won't do.

44
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,450
These are crucial for the investigation.

45
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,210
You, go over there

46
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,800
and draw out the positions

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,030
where each of you was standing
beneath the flame cloth

48
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,560
at the time of the incident.

49
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,470
Go now.

50
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,630
Yes.

51
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,960
Do you know Ma Kui?

52
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,100
I do,

53
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,490
[Integrity and Harmony]

54
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
but not very well.

55
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,640
What do you mean by not very well?

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,460
We just exchange greetings when me meet
at most.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,400
So during today's deity procession,

58
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,590
did Ma Kui show any unusual behavior?

59
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,750
Not really.

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,269
He seemed quite happy.

61
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,920
Even though this big sickle of mine

62
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,200
is made of wood,

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,040
it's still sharp enough

64
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,160
to kill someone.

65
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,840
I specially had someone

66
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,750
make it from the finest wood.

67
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,730
Check it out.

68
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,240
How could he not be happy?

69
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:34,950
He wasn't originally

70
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,680
part of the Seven-Saint Blade lineup
this month.

71
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,600
He bought a spot at the last minute.

72
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
He bought a spot? From whom?

73
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,490
Was it He Bi?

74
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:41,800
[The People Are the Foundation]

75
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,000
I only heard it from others.
I've said too much.

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,070
No, no. This kind of talk is helpful.

77
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,480
Let me ask you:

78
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,390
did Ma Kui

79
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,120
bribe the Zoroastrian Priest He Bi

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,270
to get this position?

81
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:51,720
Speak!

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,070
Actually, that wasn't the case.

83
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:53,680
He Bi

84
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,600
is one of the biggest merchants
in Chang'an.

85
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,190
He wouldn't even consider
someone like Ma Kui.

86
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,510
Besides, the previous 7 people

87
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,800
had already been decided,

88
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,240
and they were all personally selected
by He Bi.

89
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,600
Who would be willing to
give up their position

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,530
to someone else?

91
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,430
Then where did Ma Kui

92
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,440
spend his money?

93
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,880
I heard he went directly to
the High Priest.

94
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,030
You mean Shi Qiansui?

95
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,510
Yes.

96
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,920
Ma Kui paid who-knows-how-much money

97
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:17,080
to get the High Priest
to speak on his behalf,

98

[Integrity and Harmony]

99
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,070
and that's how he secured the position.

100
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,170
Anything else?

101
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:23,950
No.

103
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,240
I need to sign?

104
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,040
I was just repeating what I heard.

105
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,500
I'm not even sure about it.

106
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,159
You see that scribe?

He's not a fool.

108
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,920
When you say "I heard,"

109
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,180
he'll record it as hearsay. Understand?

110
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Go now.

111
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,070

What's wrong with you?

114
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:49,190
Why do you look so worried?

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,730
What concerns me is,

116
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,300
now that Ma Kui is dead,

117
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,159
what will happen to his business?

118
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,220
In the East Market,

119
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,680
his pepper business

120
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
is the biggest right now.

Am I worrying for nothing?

122
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,350
What business are you in?

123
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm a jeweler.

124
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,830
You don't sell pepper?

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,510
No, no, no.

You guys and Ma Kui...

131
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,790
We were as close as brothers.

132
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,270

in the pepper business,

as close as brothers.

Did he not steal business from you two?

the whole story.

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,840
he did not resist

376
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,000
or try to dodge,

377
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,480
indicating that

378
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,170
his throat had already been cut
by someone else beforehand.

379
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,390
I was the first to see

380
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,520
the body.

381
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,540
At that time, that fake sickle

382
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,970
was embedded in the victim's neck.

383
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:54,390
This 1-inch-7-fen wound

384
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,790
was caused by it.

385
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,630
But that fake sickle was made of wood,

386
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,910
and it shouldn't have been
able to kill anyone, unless...

387
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:02,720
Unless what?

388
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,680
Unless

389
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,589
someone struck the back of the blade
with force,

390
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,720
using precise and concentrated strength
to drive the fake sickle

391
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,510
into his neck,

392
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,440
causing his death.

393
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,099
So that's how it happened.

394
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,000
It must have been the coroner's oversight

395
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,200
that misled your judgment, Sheriff Du.

396
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:36,790
Well...

397
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,310
I am ashamed.

398
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,580
It seems the real killer is someone else.

399
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,280
That's right.

400
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,030
I was also there at the time,

401
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,790
but I was just watching the commotion.

402
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,030
I failed to notice

403
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,240
any suspicious person.

404
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,720
This killer must have some skills.

405
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,030
Otherwise,

406
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,570
it would have been difficult
to kill with a wooden blade.

407
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,030
But how should we proceed with
the investigation now?

408
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:05,510
I'm at a loss.

409
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:09,680
I hope you can offer some guidance,
Official Lu.

410
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,920
We should start by
investigating Ma Kui's enemies.

411
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,070
Setting aside those from the past,

412
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,310
the person he replaced,

413
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,270
that former member of
the Seven-Saint Blades,

414
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,800
must have harbored resentment
toward Ma Kui.

415
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,150
That's right.

416
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,380
Why didn't I think of that?

417
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,030
[He Residence]

418
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:24,640
Open up!

419
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,750
Who is it at this late hour?

420
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:31,550
County office investigating a case.
Open the door quickly.

421
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,110
I'm Du Yu, Wannian County Sheriff.

422
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,400
Is He Bi at home?

423
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,750
The Zoroastrian Priest has gone to bed.

424
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:37,440
Wake him up.

425
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:38,750
Officer.

426
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,320
Your speculation makes sense.

427
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,480
The person who was replaced

428
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,960
would certainly feel resentful,

429
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,640
or maybe even harbor hatred.

430
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,740
But would it be so bad as to
lead to murder?

431
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Besides, I was the one
who finalized the list.

432
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,440
[He Bi, Zoroastrian Priest of
High Priest's Office]

433
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,770
Anyone who was replaced

434
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,590
would certainly have been
someone I could persuade.

435
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:56,990
Why beat around the bush?

436
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,550
Just tell me who it is.

437
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,760
He was already upset enough,

438
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,680
and now you want to bother him
even further.

439
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,680
Cut the nonsense.

440
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:07,160
Say it. Who is it?

441
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,830
Official Lu.

442
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,150
Do I really have to say it?

443
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,680
This murder case

444
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,880
is closely related to
the deity summoning ceremony.

445
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:24,230
Zoroastrian Priest He,
please assist the county office

446
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,220
in investigating the case
and tracking down the killer.

447
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,790
Fine.

448
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,920
The person who was replaced

449
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,650
is my younger brother, He Qian.

450
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,350
He lives in

451
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:33,280
Yanzuo District near Mingde Gate.

452
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,290
Master is in the study.

453
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,480
Wait.

454
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,410
Did He Qian not sleep or is he up early?

455
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,880
How is it that he's in the study
at 4 a.m.?

456
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,480
Master suffers from insomnia.

457
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,960
When he was still staying

458
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,830
at Zoroastrian Priest He's place,

459
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,030
he already suffered from this
quite a lot.

460
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,790
It's gotten even worse in recent months.

461
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:08,000
He can only sleep sitting up.

462
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
That's why Master

463
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,310
likes to review accounts at night.

464
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,550
While doing so, he could fall asleep.

465
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,590
Otherwise, if Master
stayed awake all night,

466
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,050
we'd be the ones to suffer.

467
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,590
Wake him up.

468
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,160
I dare not.

469
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,240
He Qian!

470
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,510
Wake up!

471
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,880
This is the county office,
investigating a case.

472
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,640
Master, please don't be startled.

473
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,040
There are visitors here.

474
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,070
Lu Lingfeng!

475
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,840
He likely died around 3 a.m.

476
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,270
An hour ago...

477
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,760
Who's been here?

478
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,440
No one.

479
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,270
Master entered the study
sometime between 9 and 11 p.m.

480
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,400
I thought he had gone to sleep already.

to Yang Mingyuan from Changle District]

Sheriff Wei.

485
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,210
Sheriff Wei.

486
00:22:59,240 --> 00:22:59,960
Has the coroner arrived?

487
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,420
Not yet.

488
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,200
Why isn't he here yet?

489
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,160
The body was discovered by Official Lu

490
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,250
and Su Wuming,

491
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:05,520
so we didn't rush to find a coroner.

492
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:08,680
Lu.

493
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:09,920
Mr. Su.

494
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,060
Sheriff Du.

495
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,170
Sheriff Wei.

496
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,720
The Yanzuo District

497
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,750
is within my Chang'an County jurisdiction.

498
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,350
I know.

499
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,880
Then why are you here?

500
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,240
Are you trying to teach me, Wei Tao,

501
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
how to conduct case investigation?

502
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Our Du family has plenty of
talented people.

503
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,070
Even if we take on disciples, there's
no need to look outside the family.

504
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,960
Although Yanzuo District is
in Chang'an County,

505
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,220
the deceased, He Qian,

506
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,200
is connected to a murder case

507
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,460
in our Wannian County.

508
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,960
That's why I came with Official Lu.

509
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,760
We had an agreement.

510
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,110
When it comes to case investigation,

511
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,030
I don't go to the east side,

512
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,240
and you don't come to the west side.

513
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,880
Today,

514
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:51,450
it's you who broke the agreement first.

515
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,030
I just wanted to look for some clues,

516
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,880
but unexpectedly stumbled upon a corpse.

517
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,760
What bad luck.

518
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,720
What's also to blame is that
Chang'an County

519
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,100
is actually so unstable

520
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,680
under Sheriff Wei's governance,

521
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,880
with frequent murders.

522
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,940
I can't even avoid them if I wanted to.

523
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,270

is here for case investigation.

524
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,930
All unrelated persons,
step back immediately!

525
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,960
Actually, Sheriff Du was
telling the truth.

526
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,440
We were indeed

527
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,880
investigating a case in Wannian County,

528
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,940
and the investigation led us here...

529
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,850
Since he's here,

530
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:39,920
as for this case,

531
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,440
I, as Chang'an County Sheriff,
shouldn't interfere.

532
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,000
You Yongzhou Prefecture
should handle it directly.

533
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,010
Wait, Wei.

534
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,830
Since this case just broke out,

535
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:50,760
Chang'an County should still
investigate it first.

542
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,270
please point them out.

They're also both very dedicated to
their investigations.

555
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:41,960
At this point, it's inappropriate
for our Yongzhou Prefecture

556
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,290
to intervene directly.

557

00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,020
Come on, eat up.

559
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,600
When you put it that way,

560
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,730
it does make some sense.

561
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:54,040
Lu Lingfeng,

562
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,010
the sketch is ready.

563
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,390
Thank you for your hard work.

564
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,350
This person was wearing a mask,

565
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,400
and Qingcong only caught a glimpse of him,

566
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,060
so I could only try my best
to recreate his image.

567
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,440
Those eyes

568
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:13,600
look quite similar to Wei Tao's.

569
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:14,880
Su Wuming.

570
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,590
That's not something to joke about.

571
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,440
You said it yourself it was a joke.

572
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,030
I guess

573
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,160
those 20 strokes from Sheriff Wei

574
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,680
made Qingcong remember him very clearly.

575
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,750
Did I draw it wrong?

576
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,030
Is it of no help to you?

577
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:34,110
No.

578
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,300
Qingcong is naturally timid

579
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,160
and was just putting on a brave face
when collecting debts.

580
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,880
As for those he merely brushed past,

581
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,740
he probably didn't pay
that much attention to them,

582
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:46,200
while Sheriff Wei

583
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,510
actually scared him quite badly.

584
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,480
No wonder

585
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,090
he was so vague when describing it,

586
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,160
which is why I spent so long drawing,

587
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,960
and it turns out to be useless in the end.

588
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,240
What seems useless

589
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,240
might turn out to be very useful.

590
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,550
Take me, Fei, for example.

591
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,640
One day, when Lu Lingfeng
conquers the battlefield

592
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,270
and becomes a high official,
he'll definitely take me with him.

593
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,400
Because I may seem useless,

594
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,340
but I'm actually quite valuable.

595
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,960
Who would dare say you're useless?

596
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,730
Right, I was just about to
ask you for help.

597
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,270
This is something I found

598
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,590
at the murder scene in Yanzuo District.

599
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,750
I noticed Sheriff Du didn't care about it,

600
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,810
so I took it with me.

601
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,030
Look here.

602
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,210
This is no ordinary water drop.

603
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,790
Water couldn't have possibly left

604
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:36,270
such a distinct mark.

605
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,790
I smelled it,

606
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,480
and there's a special fragrance

607
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,960
that seems familiar.

608
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,330
I can't recall what it is at the moment.

609
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,640
You have the sharpest nose.
Help me smell it.

610
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,500
Let me smell it.

611
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,440
There really is a fragrance,

612
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,310
and it's quite unusual.

613
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,030
Your choice to come to me

614
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,400
was definitely right.

615
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,720
Let me think.

616
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:09,210
-What is this...
-Let me smell it.

617
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,110
Here.

618
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,140
It really is fragrant.

619
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,200
It's urine!

620
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,830
What?

621
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,110
It's really urine.
If you don't believe me, taste it.

622
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,310
I... Taste... You...

623
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,640
Master Fei.

624
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
This isn't ordinary urine.

625
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,680
It's from a Fengli beast.

626
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,650
Give it to me.

627
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,590
Mr. Fei!

628
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,830
To solve the case,

629
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,550
tasting a bit of urine is nothing.

630
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,480
I've confirmed it. It's definitely
Fengli beast's urine,

631
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,550
no doubt about it.

632
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:53,240
Academically known as Fengli fluid.

633
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,940
The Fengli beast?

634
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,790
Could it be the one mentioned

635
00:28:57,790 --> 00:28:58,920
in those books our mentor Master Di

636
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,680
left us?

637
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,590
Exactly.

638
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,590
The reason I recognized that smell

639
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:07,350
is because years ago,
I accompanied Master Di

640
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,240
to visit an old friend of his.

641
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,830
That elderly person
suffered from rheumatism.

642
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,720
When it flared up,
the pain was unbearable.

643
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,960
Only by taking this Fengli fluid

644
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,890
could he get temporary relief.

645
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,480
So

646
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,720
after all this talk,

647
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:24,250
isn't it still just urine?

648
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,210
How does this help solve the case?

649
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,790
The Fengli fluid is not easy to find,
you know?

650
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,430
It used to be something worth a fortune.

651
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,350
Why do you say "used to be"?

652
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,750
Because the Fengli fluid

653
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,350
can treat rheumatism.

654
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:41,160
Later, this humble physician

655
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,190
developed a formula

656
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,440
specifically for treating rheumatism,

657
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,720
so it lost its value.

658
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:49,790
Of course, my formula

659
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,340
isn't a cure-all, either.

660
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,750
I've heard there's a type of

661
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:56,000
particularly stubborn headache

662
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:58,630
that my formula can't treat.

663
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,550
Only Fengli fluid can cure it.

664
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:02,790
Therefore,

665
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:07,030
if the deceased didn't have this illness,

666
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:10,720
then it must have belonged to the killer,

667
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,340
which makes it a clue, doesn't it?

668
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,860
Then... Should we look for clues
at pharmacies?

669
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,530
Pharmacies don't sell it.

670
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:23,510
I think I know where to start looking.

671
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,040
Official Lu,

672
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,750
what do you think of this lead?

673
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,680
You call this a lead?

674
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:31,070
How is this not a lead?

675
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,830
It's not really one.

676
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,570
Then what's your opinion?

677
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,240
Three murders

678
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,750
within a single day.

679
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:40,550
The identities of the victims—

680
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:42,080
what do they have in common?

681
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,550
They were all merchants.

682
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,010
It might be a coincidence,

683
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,830
but it's likely not.

684
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,070
That statement of yours

685
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,840
hits the nail on the head.

686
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,030
Shi Qiansui, the Sogdian merchant,

687
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,550
is the leader of An Society,
an organization for merchants

688
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,880
from both the East Market
and the West Market,

689
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,210
and he's also the biggest spice merchant.

690
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,480
The Sogdian merchants

691
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,840
generally follow Zoroastrianism,

692
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,920
so the court
established the High Priest's Office

693
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,960
to oversee them.

694
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,790
This Shi Qiansui is

695
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:12,290
the High Priest of
the High Priest's Office.

696
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:16,000
Ma Kui's qualification as part of
the Seven-Saint Blade lineup

697
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,350
was only granted through

698
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,480
Shi Qiansui's endorsement.

699
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,680
Therefore, meeting this Shi Qiansui

700
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,210
should be our priority.

701
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,960
I've already sent Xue Huan to inquire.

702
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,350
At this moment, he's inspecting

703
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,160
the Xian temple in Buzheng District.

704
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,820
Hurry up and eat. When you're done,
come with me.

705
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,550
Yingtao.

706
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,030
I've heard the Zoroastrian temple
in Buzheng District

707
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,200
is the largest in all of Chang'an.

708
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,590
Let's go see it together.

709
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:40,240
No way! If you all go,

710
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,110
it'll be me, Fei,

711
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:42,310
watching the shop alone again.

712
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,640
Are we still running this business or not?

713
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,110
There's a type of roast chicken
in Buzheng District

714
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:49,440
cooked in a special way.

715
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,590
They stuff the cavity

716
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,920
with various fruits

717
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,270
and coat it with honey before roasting.

718
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,960
If I bring one back

719
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,110
for you, Master Fei,

720
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,500
would you let us all go?

721
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,720
They have roast chicken like this?

722
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,440
How come I've never heard of it?

723
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,680
W-Will you really bring one back for me?

724
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,590
Mr. Fei, when has Xijun

725
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,990
ever broken her promise?

726
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,240
It's just that

727
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,390
Sushan Shop would fall apart

728
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,710
without you, Mr. Fei.

729
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,920
You all, go ahead.

730
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,270
Young people should go out and have fun.

731
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:20,350
I, Boss Fei, am here
to take care of the shop.

732
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,410
Don't worry at all.

733
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,400
[High Priest Shi Qiansui]

734
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,030
It's true that Ma Kui earned
the Seven-Saint Blade title this month

735
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,680
because of my endorsement.

736
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,480
But I didn't take any money from him.

737
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,400
We're not here to investigate that.

738
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,330
But I need to make this clear to you.

739
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:31,800
As the leader of An Society,

740
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,480
I care for every merchant

741
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
in Chang'an.

742
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:37,070
That's also why His Majesty granted me

743
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:39,070
the fifth-rank official position.

744
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:42,880
The standard for becoming
a Seven-Saint Blade

745
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,010
is being an influential Zoroastrian.

746
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,160
Some thought Ma Kui wasn't devout,

747
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,510
believing he joined the Seven-Saint Blades

748
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:51,000
just to receive divine blessings

749
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,590
and continue making fortunes.

750
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:53,440
But I believed

751
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,200
he had been
the most influential Zoroastrian

752
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,140
in the business world recently.

753
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,160
In just a few years, he became

754
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,720
the biggest pepper merchant
in the East Market.

755
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,250
That was quite remarkable.

756
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,790
So I believed he deserved a chance.

757
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,590
As for enemies,

758
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,639
he probably had some.

759
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,400
But

760
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,840
I don't think

761
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,800
they would be merchants.

762
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,400
Why are you so certain, High Priest?

763
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:24,070
I don't know. Just intuition.

764
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,199
Alright then.

765
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,400
High Priest, if you

766
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,630
remember anything else,

767
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,760
contact me anytime.

768
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,320
You're from the Lu family of Fanyang,

769
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,780
nobility among nobility.

770
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,850
You'll protect merchants, right?

771
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:40,110
As the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

772
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,960
it's my duty

773
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,159
to protect everyone.

774
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,000
Of course,

775
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,489
including merchants.

776
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,030
Xijun.

777
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,190
Lu.

778
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,130
Sheriff Wei.

779
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,280
Mr. Su.

780
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,030
As discussed previously,

781
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,800
we've been investigating the Zoroastrians,

782
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,730
but we haven't found anything yet.

783
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,090
Thank you for your hard work, Sheriff Wei.

784
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:14,730
Official Lu,

785
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,320
please, you must catch the murderer

786
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,980
and avenge my brother He Qian!

787
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,440
Zoroastrian Priest He, there's no need
to be so agitated.

788
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,190
Sheriff Wei

789
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:23,230
is working diligently on this case.

790
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,400
Him?

791
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:25,950
What's wrong?

792
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,970
Don't you know Sheriff Wei?

793
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,670
Of course I do.

794
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,140
Actually, we're even relatives.

795
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,360
Zoroastrian Priest He, you and Sheriff Wei
are relatives?

796
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,710
I wonder how you're related?

797
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:40,240
It's not worth mentioning.

798
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,320
Official Lu.

799
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:51,510
Today, my family has a joyous occasion,

800
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,110
so I'm hosting a banquet to celebrate.

801
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:55,360
We haven't been well acquainted before,

802
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,920
but after investigating the case
together yesterday,

803
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,190
your demeanor of the Lu family of Fanyang

804
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,650
has earned my admiration.

805
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,630
I'd like to extend
a last-minute invitation to you.

806
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,760
Would you honor us with your presence?

807
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:07,400
Although we're investigating
a murder case,

808
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,360
the family banquet was arranged long ago.

809
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,280
Moreover, friends have come
from the Eastern Capital

810
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
specifically for this banquet.

811
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,960
So I cannot reschedule it.

812
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:15,950
I understand.

813
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:19,000
May I ask what joyous occasion
your family is celebrating?

814
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,670
Last month, when the Jinguang Society
was carrying out major construction,

815
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,530
they unexpectedly unearthed
our Wei family's merit-record pillar.

816
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,190
So your ancestral merit-record pillar
has come to light again?

817
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,280
That is indeed a great cause
for celebration.

818
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,740
I shall certainly attend.

819
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,500
Excellent.

820
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,000
I wonder...

821
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,290
Mr. Su,

822
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:41,250
I apologize.

823
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,760
Regarding viewing the merit-record pillar,

824
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,820
I didn't invite you

825
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,440
because

826
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,400
all those attending today
are from prominent noble families.

827
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,280
Although the Su family of Wugong...

828
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,340
No need to explain.

829
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,360
I know my place.

830
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:55,660
Besides, I have other matters
to attend to tonight.

831
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,220
Xijun, come here.

832
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,440
Come on.

833
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,840
But Miss Pei here

834
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,030
should be able to go with him, right?

835
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:10,040
Could you be from
the Pei family of Hedong?

836
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,150
I'm from the eastern branch
of the Pei family of Hedong.

837
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:15,030
So the former Minister of Personnel,
Pei Jian?

838
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,030
That's my father.

839
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,600
My apologies for the oversight.

840
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,550
The Pei family of Hedong
is a distinguished line of officials.

841
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:23,000
According to the family records,
it has 5 branches:

842
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,920
the central branch, the western branch,
the Xima branch,

843
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,120
the Nanlai Wu branch,

844
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,880
and then there's the eastern branch,

845
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,340
to which Miss Pei belongs.

846
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,710
If you could accompany Lu,

847
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,960
it would be my great honor.

848
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:37,360
Thank you for your invitation,
Sheriff Wei.

849
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:38,190
Well then,

850
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,400
I shall respectfully accept.

851
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,320
Excellent.

852
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,000
Lu,

853
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,880
Mr. Su.

854
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:49,960
Come with me.

855
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,960
The Wei family's merit-record pillar
resurfacing

856
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,080
is truly a joyous occasion.

857
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,030
Su Wuming.

858
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,330
I know you're fond of antiquities.

859
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,150
It's just...

860
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:08,510
It's fine.

861
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,960
Your elite noble family gathering

862
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,290
is not for Yingtao and me

863
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,670
to presume to join.

864
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,560
That's right.

865
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,440
Su Wuming,

866
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,360
you should take me to do
something worthwhile instead.

867
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,230
Now I can go investigate

868
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,120
that lead which you didn't consider
a lead, right?

869
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,020
As you wish.

870
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:38,280
[Moxiang Bookstore]

871
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,550
Su Wuming, you said
we were looking for clues,

872
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,440
but you've buried yourself
in this bookshop,

873
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,000
leaving me alone

874
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:43,840
to wait here.

875
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:44,840
I'm so bored.

876
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:46,490
I went to the bookshop

877
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,350
precisely to look for clues.

878
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,620
If you don't believe me, look.

879
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,710
In the wilderness of Lingnan,
there's a beast

880
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,840
called Fengli.

881
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:00,070
It resembles a monkey,

882
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,070
with long eyebrows and a bashful nature.

883
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,840
When it sees people, it behaves shyly
like a young woman.

884
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:08,300
Its urine is said to be able to
treat rheumatism and headaches.

885
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,670
So its urine really can cure diseases?

886
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,530
I thought Mr. Fei was making it up.

887
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,960
Keep reading.

888
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,430
When the Fengli appears,
it carries a cane,

889
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,880
called the Fengli cane.

890
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,230
This beast is very cunning

891
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,760
and moves in a secretive manner.

892
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,320
It only shows itself
when it sees no one around.

893
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,580
Beneath a tree,
it holds the Fengli cane,

894
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,190
points at a bird's nest,

895
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,520
and the nest falls
as the cane points at it.

896
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:33,810
My goodness.

897
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,480
The Fengli beast itself
is already quite strange, isn't it?

898
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,010
But this Fengli cane
is even more mysterious,

899
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:42,800
which makes it hard to obtain.

900
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,700
Legend has it

901
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,440
that even if you catch the Fengli beast,

902
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,110
it won't easily

903
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,360
reveal the whereabouts of its cane.

904
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:52,440
It won't bring out the Fengli cane

905
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,650
unless you give it a good beating first.

906
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,050
T-That's so fascinating.

907
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,030
Once you obtain the Fengli cane,

908
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,230
it's incredible.

909
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,440
Any raptor, fierce beast, or villain,

910
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,800
you point the cane at them,

911
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,170
and they die instantly.

912
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,880
Any treasure you desire,

913
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,710
pearls or agates,

914
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,630
you point the cane at them,

915
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
and they fall right into your hands.

916
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,560
I-Is this real

917
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,920
or just a myth?

918
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,670
Whether it's real or not,

919
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,130
first we need to

920
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,480
find a place that sells Fengli canes.

921
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,320
Buy one, and we'll find out.

922
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,920
Then I'll buy one and point it at you.

923
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,760
Why point it at me?

924
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:37,320
Do you want me to die instantly

925
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,760
or fall into your hands?

926
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,110
You...

927
00:40:41,630 --> 00:40:42,670
Playing dumb.

928
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,410
I'm telling you,

929
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,400
I'm not exactly a good person,

930
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:49,090
but that is something truly good.

931
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:52,190
[Sugar Painting]

932
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,360
Look.

933
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,530
Does it look like me?

934
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,340
Go ahead and eat it.
I'm not afraid of pain.

935
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,840
Mother, when I grow up,

936
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,440
I'll buy you sugar figures too.

937
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:05,070
Good boy.

938
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:05,920
Little boy.

939
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:08,590
I haven't eaten this one yet.

940
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:09,590
How about

941
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:12,890
I give it to you?

942
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,690
Please don't, young lady.

943
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,800
When seeing something he likes,

944
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:20,550
he didn't think of himself,

945
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,190
but first thought of
buying it for his mother.

946
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:24,880
A child like this is bound to grow into

947
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,400
an extraordinary person.

948
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:27,640
You flatter us, Sir.

949
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:29,800
I, Yan Zhenqing, thank you

950
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,070
for your kind words.

951
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:31,370
My family is not of high status.

952
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:32,320
[Yan Zhenqing]

953
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,760
I should study diligently,

954
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,440
not seeking to be exceptional,

955
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,900
but only to serve the people
and the country.

956
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,630
At such a young age,

957
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,190
you actually have such ambition.

958
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,160
I, Su Wuming, admire you.

959
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,370
I admire you too.

960
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,000
I want to give this little sugar figure

961
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,330
to you out of my own will.

962
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,400
Please take it.

963
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,400
Well then,

964
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,800
take it.

965
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:56,920
Thank you.

966
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:57,360
Here.

967
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,490
Mother, you eat first.

968
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:00,360
Good boy.

969
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:01,630
Thank you.

970
00:42:01,750 --> 00:42:02,680
You're welcome.

971
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,240
Let's go.

972
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,590
Such a good child.

973
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:10,030
Even in the grand households

974
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,800
of the Five Surnames and Seven Clans,

975
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,070
you might not find one like that.

976
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,030
So why can the Cui, Lu,
Li, and Zheng families

977
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:17,830
all enter officialdom
through family privilege?

978
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,230
How should I explain this to you?

979
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:25,590
This is something
His Majesty should consider.
