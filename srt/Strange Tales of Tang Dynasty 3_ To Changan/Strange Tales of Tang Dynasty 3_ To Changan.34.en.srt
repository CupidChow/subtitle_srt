00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,240
Zhong Shizai,

4
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,150
what other crimes have you committed?

5
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,350
Confess truthfully!

6
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:46,360
I haven't!

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,660
Mr. Geng already anticipated

8
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,039
you would say that.

9
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:55,180
When I first saw him back then,

10
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,060
he was covered in blood,

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,220
with multiple wounds on his body.

12
00:01:59,509 --> 00:02:02,710
It was clear that these injuries

13
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,940
resulted from violent fights with others.

14
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,400
[Speak and Seek Truth]

15
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,460
My wife passed away many years ago...

16
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,740
and left me with no children.

17
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,310
Zhong Shizai was the first disciple

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,590
I ever took in.

19
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,750
I treated him

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,630
like my own son,

21
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,550
caring for him and teaching him.

22
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:23,180
But eventually, I discovered

23
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,560
he wasn't suited to be a coroner.

24
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,570
It's because he killed people
when he was young.

25
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,040
In our line of work,

26
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,950
we constantly deal with corpses

27
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,120
and murder weapons.

28
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,160
What we see and perceive

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,120
can also stir up

30
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:45,190
the desire to kill within us.

31
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,110
Now you understand

32
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,170
why Mr. Geng had to

33
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,280
expel you from his tutelage, right?

34
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,960
Zhong Shizai's skills as a coroner

35
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:57,550
may rank

[Speak and Seek Truth]

37
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,220
among the top in Chang'an,

38
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,000
but he's far from securing

39
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,290
a top-three position.

40
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,440
He is extremely shrewd

41
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,450
and excels at using others' strengths
against them.

42

[Speak and Seek Truth]

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,280
He's even better at
employing deceitful schemes.

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:11,990
Therefore,

45
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,380
when I discovered that Dong Yue's death

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,960
wasn't as simple as it appeared,

47
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,150
I began to suspect him.

48
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,350
He thought

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
that by eliminating
Coroners Dong and Zheng with one scheme,

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,220
he could ensure

51
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,090
his place among the top three.

52
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,310
I lied and said

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,060
that I'd participate in
the Coroners' Contest myself,

54
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,790
and I wrote this in advance...

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,570
waiting for him to come.

56
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,970
"If I'm murdered,

57
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,110
the killer is Zhong Shizai."

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,240
You anticipated everything beforehand.

59
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,520
I taught him myself.

60
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm deeply ashamed.

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,570
I was once a servant,

62
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,710
but was fortunate enough

63
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,500
to study and practice martial arts
alongside my young master.

64
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,370
The young master was dull-witted,

65
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:25,180
or rather, he was a fool.

66
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,510
Whether it was reading and writing

67
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,120
or horsemanship and combat skills,

68
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,320
he was inferior to me!

69
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,680
The master became angry because of this

70
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,830
and often beat and scolded me
to vent his frustration.

71
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,260
I could only endure it

72
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,770
in order to continue my studies.

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,040
But my endurance

74
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:41,390
did not earn me kind treatment.

75
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,720
The master became increasingly cruel

76
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,310
and nearly beat me to death several times!

77
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,620
I couldn't bear it anymore,

78
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,630
so I killed all three members
of that family

79
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:50,030
and disguised it as a night raid
by bandits!

80
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,390
I wounded myself as well

81
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,180
to deceive the constables

82
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,159
and escape.

83
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,750
That is how I've survived until today.

84
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,900
My mentor was right.

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,690
I've long been weary of

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,080
being a coroner.

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,660
Because every time I see a corpse,

88
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,170
a murder weapon,

89
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,570
or a murder scene,

90
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,160
I'm reminded of

91
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,120
who I once was.

92
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,560
Sheriff Su!

93
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,780
Sheriff Su!

94
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,720
There's been a beheading case.

95
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,030
The victim is a young woman—

96
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,430
head and body separated!

97
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,159
Is an autopsy necessary?

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,900
Coroner Zhong Shizai is here!

99
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,380
Shame...

100
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,890
I won't have a chance

101
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,200
to perform an autopsy again.

102
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,120
Fortunately, we didn't ask Xijun to come.

103
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,820
Sheriff Su,

104
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:32,280
there are no more coroners available.

105
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,340
Go invite Mr. Geng.

106
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,500
Tell him I sent you.

107
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,430
Yes, sir.

108
00:06:42,909 --> 00:06:44,390
Sheriff Su has just taken office.

109
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:46,120
Please do him this favor.

110
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,680
It's not that I don't want to help,

111
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,240
but as you can see, I'm old and sick.

112
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,720
I really can't leave home anymore.

113
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:54,880
Well...

114
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,530
Suchan,

115
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,980
go with Captain Xu.

116
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,600
Tell them you'll examine the body
on my behalf,

117
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,310
and ask Sheriff Su if he would permit it.

118
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,680
What?

119
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,070
Haven't you always wanted

120
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,770
to become a coroner yourself?

121
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,270
But I'm a woman.

122
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,910
Can I really be a coroner?

123
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,360
A woman examining a female corpse

124
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,360
is more convenient than a man doing so.

125
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,950
Besides,

126
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,860
Su Wuming is Master Di's disciple,

127
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,070
so he won't be bound
by outdated conventions.

128
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,500
Perhaps this is your chance.

129
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,360
Take my autopsy kit

130
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:29,480
and go.

131
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,070
Go.

132
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,870
I...

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,430
I've never examined a corpse before.

134
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,360
There's a first time for everyone.

135
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,680
Please proceed.

136
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,600
Sheriff Su, you're really allowing me
to examine the body?

137
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,310
Since Mr. Geng sent you here,

138
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,090
you must have learned his skills well.

139
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,800
Also,

Therefore, I deduce

155
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,360
it was likely

cut off by a sharp weapon

00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,730
in Shiyang County.

191
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,590
So, you're not alone.

192
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,400
You've seen the body now.

193
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,450
Can you confirm the identity?

194
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,600
It's my daughter!

195
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,600
She was fine yesterday.

196
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,670
It's all your fault.

197
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,720
When our daughter picked up
that cursed money,

198
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,270
you should have thrown it away!

199
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,240
But you!

200
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,390
You thought it was a blessing!

201
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,240
Found some money?

202
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,030
Mother, look.

203
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,630
-Who lost it?
-Well...

204
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,510
Who...

205
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,390
Who dropped this pouch?

206
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,260
Not mine.

207
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,410
That's not mine.

208
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,560
Quick, count them.

209
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:42,310
[One]

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,760
[One]

211
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,460
Have you seen a money pouch?

212
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:52,490
About this big

213
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,490
and red in color.

214
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,050
Haven't seen it.

215
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:54,850
Never seen it.

216
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,440
We haven't been to

217
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,390
the crossroads today.

218
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,630
Right, haven't been there lately.

219
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,440
Sheriff Su,

220
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,200
we've asked around all the nearby streets.

221
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,790
Nothing like this
has ever happened before.

222
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,360
I've heard of people losing money,

223
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,660
but I've never heard of anyone
admitting they found it.

224
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,390
If such good fortune really happened,

225
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,920
no one would speak of it openly.

226
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:10,870
-Yeah.
-Right.

227
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,030
Have any of you seen this pouch before?

228
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,790
Everyone, come and take a look!

229
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,270
Have you seen this red pouch?

230
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:20,200
-No.
-No.

231
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,150
Haven't seen it.

232
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,270
Senior Yin!

233
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:51,860
You were scared, right?

234
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,550
It's made of wood.

235
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,480
When I have free time,

236
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,340
I practice my makeup skills on it.

237
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,180
Look at this place.

238
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,470
It hardly looks like a home anymore.

239
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,970
You can admit it now.

240
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,030
You stopped being a coroner

241
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,430
and moved out of the house

242
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,290
because you were jealous

243
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,240
that Father treated Senior Shizai
better than you.

244
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,630
Back then, both the Ministry of Justice

245
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,200
and the Court of Judicial Review
asked Father for a coroner.

246
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,510
Father recommended Senior Shizai,

247
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,340
not you.

248
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,290
Are you still angry at Father for that?

249
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,420
It's all in the past.

250
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,600
Come have a bowl of soup.

251
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,790
The Three-Fruit Bone Broth

252
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,050
that I made myself.

253
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,600
Isn't that the famous broth
from the West Market?

254
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,960
The one that nobles drink?

255
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,600
You can actually make it at home?

256
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,840
What's so difficult about that?

257
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,150
You just need to boil juice from Terminalia chebula,

258
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:31,750
Phyllanthus emblica,

259
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,390
and Terminalia bellirica,

260
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,320
and then cook it with pork bones.

261
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,150
Then I must try it.

262
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,320
Here.

263
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,670
It's really good.

264
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,670
I have some good news

265
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:52,360
to tell you.

266
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,120
Early this morning, I heard

267
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,670
that Senior Shizai was arrested
by the county office.

268
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,070
I feel terrible about it.

269
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,360
What good news could there possibly be?

270
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,030
Indeed.

271
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,000
Compared to
what happened to Senior Shizai,

272
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,390
whether I become a coroner or not

273
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,250
doesn't seem important anymore.

274
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:09,230
You're going to be a coroner?

275
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,810
Sheriff Su permitted it.

276
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:11,750
I examined

277
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,410
a decapitated female corpse.

278
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,310
I don't know

279
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,570
whether I should be happy for you or...

280
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,370
Why wouldn't you be happy for me?

281
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,360
The work of a coroner is steeped in death.

282
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,560
You're a young woman.

283
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:29,440
It's not suitable.

284
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,410
But I've been waiting for this day

285
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,590
for so long.

286
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,270
Senior Yin, you don't know.

287
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,400
Since you moved out,

288
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,480
Father has been teaching me

289
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,280
the autopsy formulas every day.

290
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,870
You've been studying autopsy
for three years now?

291
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,440
Yeah.

292
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,550
Although I've studied for three years,

293
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:44,480
Father often scolds me for being stupid.

294
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,720
Because in his heart,

295
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,050
the most talented one is you, Senior Yin.

296
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,060
I can see

297
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,550
how deeply saddened Father is

298
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,840
over Senior Shizai.

299
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,700
So I came today

300
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,000
to ask you

301
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,550
to return to the coroner's trade.

302
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,360
Isn't there going to be

303
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,390
a Coroners' Contest?

304
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,750
You're the best, Senior Yin.

305
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,440
You'll definitely win first place.

306
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,970
That way,

307
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,600
you can serve in the county office,

308
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
and Father will surely be proud of you.

309
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,420
I'll become

310
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,080
the best mortician

311
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,340
in all of Chang'an too.

312
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,960
I'll visit our mentor often.

313
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,770
May he live a long and healthy life.

314
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:23,320
Well, I must go now.

315
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,320
Before you came,

316
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,840
someone just asked for my services

317
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,750
to apply makeup to a deceased person.

318
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,790
They said it was a violent death.

319
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,920
The head was cut off.

320
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,360
I wonder

321
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,530
if it's the same body you examined.

322
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,180
Suchan,

323
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,930
thank you for the soup.

324
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,170
It's delicious.

326
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,780
You're the mortician, right?

327
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,790
The passing ceremony,

328
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,880
soul-calling ceremony,

00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,150
have all been completed.

332
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,240
Once you apply her makeup,

333
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,720
she can be placed in the coffin.

334
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,320
No rush.

335
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:01,480
"Through solemn rites,
we mourn the nation's sorrows;

through funeral rites, we mourn death."

337
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,390
Nothing in funeral rituals
should be omitted.

338
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,910
Before applying the final makeup,

339
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,000
our morticians have certain rituals
to perform.

340
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,720
The tradition of burial camphorwood dolls
began with Yu Qing,

341

burial garments with Zuo Botao,

342
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,840
and funeral songs
with the rope-pullers' chants.

343
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,500
The ritual of mortuary makeup

344
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,260

out the back door

354
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,080
is where the crime occurred.

355
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,960
Given that the deceased's chamber

356
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:37,690
is next to her parents',

357
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,410
that they

358
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,430
heard no sounds,

and that there are no signs

360
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,790
of struggle or scratches
on the deceased's body,

361
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,790
we can conclude

362
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,800
she was not forced out by any intruder;

363
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,120
rather, she

364
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,690
left voluntarily.

365
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,560
What exactly did she see?

366
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,270
They say the courtyard
where the deceased was found

367
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,200
has been abandoned for many years.

368
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,440
It's rumored to be haunted.

Neighbors never go there.

How can I ever thank you enough?

383

It's simply my duty as a mortician.

for funeral services?

Charging you 50 coins

398
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:58,640
is just to cover the cost of rouge,

of persuading you to go back
to being a coroner.

564
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:27,480
then his palms

565
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,110
would certainly show wounds.

566
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,750
Moreover, given how dull this sword is,

567
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,480
suicide is simply impossible.

568
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,200
Suchan,

569
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,310
have you noticed

570
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,210
that the bloodstains on the floor

571
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,920
are quite strange?

572
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,300
I noticed that too.

573
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,960
I was about to examine them carefully.

574
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,240
Father,

575
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,860
were there any mistakes in the autopsy

576
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,890
I just reported?

577
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:01,590
No.

578
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,000
If only you could

579
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,190
come with me.

580
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,080
You could guide me in person.

581
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,590
A pouch

582
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,440
with a total of 49 coins?

583
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,270
Yes.

584
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:20,160
The beheaded woman from earlier

585
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,330
also found a pouch of coins like this.

586
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,580
Don't touch it.

587
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,110
I'll do it myself.

588
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,990
There's strychnine in this bag.

589
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,200
Strychnine?

590
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,160
Father,

591
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,350
why are you keeping

592
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,010
something so poisonous here?

593
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,510
Though highly poisonous,

594
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,880
when used in proper doses,

595
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,540
it's simply a medicinal herb.

596
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,160
It can reduce swelling, relieve pain,

597
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
improve circulation, and purify blood.

598
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,630
More importantly,

599
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:51,030
it alleviates suffering from sores.

600
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,320
So,

601
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,280
Father, you've been using it
to treat your sores.

602
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,440
Just to

603
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,170
ease the pain a little.

[Fair and Impartial]

Sheriff Su,

606
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:13,950
Geng Wushang is here.

607
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,720
Sheriff Su, you've given my daughter
the opportunity

608
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,270
to perform autopsies twice in succession,

609
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,870
making her a proper coroner.

610
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,720
I, Geng Wushang, have come specially
to thank you.

611
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,270
Mr. Geng,

612
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,510
you personally trained

613
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,070
such an excellent coroner.

614
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,410
It should be I who thanks you

615
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,790
on behalf of the county office.

616
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,810
You're too kind. You're too kind.

618
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,640
Mr. Geng, please enjoy.

Sheriff Su.

620
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,070
So,

621
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,590
Mr. Geng, you want to see

622
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
those two life-borrowing pouches?

623
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,240
Of course,

624
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,550
I have no such authority.

625
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,250
But as a coroner

626
00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:00,400
who has worked alongside constables
for decades,

627
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,560
I naturally care about the case

628
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,950
and am somewhat curious.

629
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,140
So...

630
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,180
This is exactly what I want.

631
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,550
I was hoping you would take a look.

632
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,940
Yingtao, bring them here.

633
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:25,650
Father.

[Integrity and Harmony]

635
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,000
Seven times seven, 49.

636
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:34,110
It's a number of extreme yin energy.

637
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,110
Perfect for suppressing
the souls of the dead.

638
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:38,400
Killing to borrow life

639
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,200
is not unprecedented.

640
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:41,960
Twenty years ago in Chang'an,

641
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,800
there was a similar case.

642
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,470
A merchant, instigated by a sorcerer,

643
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,830
killed four people in a row

644
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,440
to extend his father's life.

645
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,480
He put the characters "one,"
"three," "six,"

646
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,000
and "nine"
in those life-borrowing pouches.

647
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,510
I remember Yao

648
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
was less than 10 years old then

649
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,790
and had just become my disciple.

650
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,850
When he helped me with the autopsies,

651
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,350
he was so frightened
that he couldn't stop crying.

652
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:06,640
The county sheriff at that time,
Du Shenyan,

653
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,270
based on the autopsy findings
from the county office,

654
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,130
quickly found the murder weapon,

655
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,600
identified the suspect,

656
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,090
and caught the killer.

657
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:16,760
In the end, both the killer
and the sorcerer

658
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
were sentenced to waist-cutting execution
by the court.

659
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:22,450
This life-borrowing sorcery

660
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,640
is nothing but a trick

661
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,970
for the wealthy and powerful to buy lives.

662
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,270
Now that we've found characters
"one" and "three,"

663
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,830
characters "six" and "nine"
will surely appear.

664
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:30,830
Doesn't that mean

665
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,730
two more people will be killed?

666
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,350

676
00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:22,440
I'm old now.

677
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,640
I've been a coroner all my life.

678
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:27,790
Yet in the end,

679
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,200
I'm about to break

680
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,070
the rules of our profession.

681
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,880
Master, what do you mean?

682
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,440
The coroner's art is passed down orally

683
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,350
and never written in books.

684
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,350
Do you know why?

685
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,920
I've heard you explain this before.

686
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,550
Because since ancient times,

687
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,240
damaging corpses has been a grave taboo.

688
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,270
Once written down,

689
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,310
people might follow the book

690
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,710
and practice on corpses.

691
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,000
This could lead to corpse desecration.

692
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:52,660
Therefore,

693
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,070
coroners never document their methods—

694
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,680
this has been a tradition
for thousands of years.

695
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,080
For the past three years,

696
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,260

699
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,860
is this right or wrong?

700
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,270
I believe it's right.

701
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,380
If we don't document

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,240
autopsy techniques in writing,

703
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,300

with 100,000 words.

712

of the final volume.

How could I offer advice to you, Mentor?

720
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,720
You're being too modest.

00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,690
You came to me

722
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,410
when you were just a child.

723
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,100
Though you couldn't read,

724
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,040
you were extremely intelligent

725
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,640
and had great potential.

726
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,790

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,580
recorded in the books,

729
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,720
I completed them

730
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,790
with your assistance.

731
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,510
The Open-Pit Bone Steaming Method

732
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:20,120
even originated from your suggestion.

733
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,550
Not at all.

734
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,440
That method was created by you, Mentor.

735
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,700
My random suggestions

736
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,140
didn't count for much.

737
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,130
My only true original creation

738
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,490
is the Nine Poisons Verification Method.

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,310
Nine Poisons Verification?

740
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:35,160
That is the method
I developed after you left,

00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,110
drawing on the teachings of the ancients

742
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:39,070
and my own experience

743
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,580
in examining corpses.

744
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,300

745
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:48,070
I've already left the coroner profession,

746
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:50,000
so I no longer have the right to read

"The Autopsy Chronicles"
that you're writing.

748
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Not necessarily.

749
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,750
What if I invite you

750
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,660
to be a co-author of this book?

751
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:00,960
Master, what did you say?

752
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,680
I invited you to dinner today

753
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:05,320
because I wanted to tell you

754
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,270
that I want to list
"The Autopsy Chronicles"

755
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,670
as co-authored by us, master and disciple.

756
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,310
How could that be appropriate?

757
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,400
That is your life's work.

758
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,920
How could I claim part of the credit?

759
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,830
Senior Yin, please don't refuse.

760
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
Father has had this intention
for a long time.

761
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,160
Back then, when the Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review

762
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,400
asked Father for coroner recommendations,

763
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,130
he recommended Senior Shizai.

764
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:26,480
It wasn't because he
thought little of you,

765
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,550
but because he treasured your talent.

766
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,400
He wanted you

767
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,030
to stay by his side for a few more years

768
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:32,830
and help him complete this book.

769
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,310
I see.

770
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,550
I've wronged you, Mentor.

771
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,600
Father.

772
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,070
I was going to persuade you
to go back to being a coroner,

773
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,440
but recently I've heard
you're doing very well

774
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,460
as a mortician.

775
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,270
When I walk down the street,

776
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,960
people come to thank me—

777
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:57,790
because you, my beloved disciple,

778
00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:00,240
beautified the appearance
of their deceased relatives.

779
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,840
I've gradually come to
understand something:

780
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,330
giving the deceased
a beautiful appearance and dignity

781
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,300
and revealing the truth
behind their sudden death

782
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,880
are equally important.

783
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,770
Therefore, I've decided

784
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,560
to respect your choice.

785
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:17,030
Whether you go back
to being a coroner or not

786
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,190
doesn't matter,

787
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,280
and it has nothing to do

788
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,420
with being my co-author

789
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,580
on the book.

790
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,100
Mentor, I...

791
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,030
Get up first.

792
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,710
You don't need to rush to decide anything.

793
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,570
After all, the Coroners' Contest

794
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:39,679
will not close registration
for another three days.

795
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,960
But there's something
that needs to be handled right now.

796
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,280
I have already written

797
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,290
the notice expelling Zhong Shizai
from my tutelage.

798
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,760
The reason I'm doing this

799
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,690
is to prevent

800
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,880
the soon-to-be-published

801
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,139
coroners' manual from being disgraced.

802
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,840
Do you understand?

803
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:56,469
I understand.

804
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,110
Zhong Shizai is impatient
in his pursuit of success

805
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,970
and two-faced.

806
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,240
You should have expelled him long ago.

807
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,070
But according to the rules
of our profession,

808
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:05,880
this notice

809
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,320
must be signed by both of you,
my disciples.

810
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:10,880
Yao, you couldn't read or write
as a child,

811
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,380
but I've heard

812
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,110
that you've learned now.

813
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,190
Yes.

814
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,760
In the three years
since leaving the coroner profession,

815
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,550
besides working as a mortician,

816
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,640
I've been studying

817
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,330
and practicing calligraphy.

818
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,760
You're so diligent, Yao.

819
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,710
I just hope that one day,

820
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
when I inherit your legacy, Mentor,

821
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,450
people won't say I'm illiterate.

822
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:35,110
Good.

823
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Come with me then.

824
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,220
[Notice of Expulsion for Zhong Shizai]

825
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,190
[Witness: Suchan]

826
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:45,800
Look.

827
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:46,590
[Mentor: Geng Wushang]

828
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,960
I have already signed,

829
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,950
and Suchan has signed too.

830
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,010
Now we just need you.

831
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,430
[Witnesses: Suchan; Yin Yao]

832
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,160
Write down the date.

833
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,400
June 23rd.

834
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:35,710
Mentor,

835
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:37,840
are you alright?

836
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,710
I'm fine.

837
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:47,370
I know.

838
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,490
Senior Shizai has followed you
for many years, after all.

839
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,150
But Master, you needn't be sad.

840
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:53,440
It's not that you're heartless.

841
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,630
It's Zhong Shizai himself—

842
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,290
he brought this upon himself.

843
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,630
I've already decided

844
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,690
what to write for this final chapter.

845
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,290
I'll write about

846
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,530
why a coroner must not kill.

847
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,190
Master,

848
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,030
forgive my frankness,

849
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,610
but isn't that rather obvious?

850
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,540
No one may kill.

851
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,060
Please reconsider.

852
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,810
There must be a better topic

853
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,840
to conclude "The Autopsy Chronicles."

854
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,440
But my health...

855
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,340
Don't worry.

856
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,800
You still have many years ahead of you.

857
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:24,960
How would you know?

858
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,160
Although I've moved out,

859
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:31,760
don't I visit you

860
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:32,840
every three days?

861
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,770
Actually, every three days,

862
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:37,510
I also go to the temple

863
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,840
to pray for your longevity.

864
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,880
I was granted
a divine revelation long ago,

865
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,480
foretelling that you still have
many years to live.

866
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,140
Senior Yin, you're so filial.

867
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,880
I, Suchan, don't measure up.

868
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,010
Su Wuming!

869
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,480
There's been another murder!

870
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,310
A beggar

871
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,710
also picked up a life-borrowing pouch!

872
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,180
Summon Coroner Suchan.

873
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,500
Coroner Suchan has come to
examine the body!

874
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,420
All unrelated personnel,

875
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,110
step back!

Father!

879
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,550
Father!

880
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:42,670
Su Wuming!

881
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,580
Didn't you say you wanted to eat sushan?

882
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,360
I brought some for you!

883
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,900
Quick, come with me
to Coroner Geng's house.
