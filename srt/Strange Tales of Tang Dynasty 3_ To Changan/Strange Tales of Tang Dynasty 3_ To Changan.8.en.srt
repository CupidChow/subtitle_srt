5
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,850
I was originally from Leshou, Yingzhou.

6
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,400
Ever since I was a child,
I've traveled everywhere

7
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
with my father's lion dance troupe.

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,430

[Powdering the Fair, Defining the Brow]

10
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,810
and he was my father's
most valued disciple.

11
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,560
We were childhood sweethearts
who grew up together.

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,090
Back in the Divine Capital,

13
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,150
no one could rival us—
the husband-and-wife team—

14
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,750
when we performed together.

15
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,710
We even defeated

16
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,050
the lion dance troupe personally assembled
by the Chancellor,

17
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,680
securing first place at that year's

19
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,870
But who could've guessed?
The Chancellor we defeated

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,680
was Empress Wu Zetian's own nephew—

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,750
a man so petty,

22
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:30,150
he framed us

23
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:33,360
for using the lion dance
as a cover for assassination.

24
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,120
To protect us, my father

25
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,200
took the blame for everything…

26
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,030
and died unjustly in prison.

27
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,710
At that time,

28
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,870
I truly wanted
to follow my father in death—

29
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,470
but I was

30
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,470
with child for the first time

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,660
in my thirty-seven years of life.

32
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,520
Wu Yang's father told me
to go to Chang'an first.

33
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,470
He said

34
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,750
he would stay behind
to settle Father's affairs,

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,750
and then come to Chang'an to find me.

36
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,660
But not long after I arrived in Chang'an,

37
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,360
news broke

38
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,410
of a major incident
in the Divine Capital:

39
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,470
a lion dancer

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,360
attempted to assassinate the Chancellor
in broad daylight

41
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,360
and was cut down.

42
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,770
In that moment,

43
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,630
I knew—

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:24,910
Wu Yang

45
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,329
would never see her father again.

46
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,280
He knew it was a hopeless fight,

47
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,829
yet he charged ahead
without looking back.

48
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,870
He sent me away on purpose…

49
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,120
so he could avenge my father himself.

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,910
How can you be sure

51
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,630
the assassin was your husband?

52
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,430
It was because
I received his last letter.

53
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,120
He told me

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,670
to lift my head

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,640
and keep moving forward.

56
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,590
He said… if I could

find a father for our unborn child,

58
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,910
then the child could take his surname.

59

did he think I, Chi Ying, was?

If not for Wu Yang,

63
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,430
I would never

64
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,240
have clung to life like this.

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,430
So that night…

00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,730
went to Baifeng House
to drown your sorrows.

68
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:23,630
I did go.

Even if I had no desire to remarry,

70
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,620
was I not entitled to some diversion?

he's stayed put.

191
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,000
[Meixiu Skincare Shop]

192
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,870
The wind's picking up—
looks like rain's coming.

193
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,670
Let's be quick about it

194
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:13,000
and close up for the day.

195
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,130
Alright.

196
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,630
Elder,

197
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,200
are you all right?

198
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,330
Do I look that old to you?

199
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,940
My apologies, I didn't mean to...

200
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,790
Seeing you

201
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,150
reminded me of someone
I once knew—

202
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,950
so much so that I lost my footing.

203
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,090
You look just like that person.

204
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,150
Who?

205
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,150
An old love of mine.

206
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,910
Who are you,

207
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,090
and what do you want?

208
00:09:57,910 --> 00:09:58,370
Wu Yang.

209
00:09:59,480 --> 00:09:59,960
Mother.

210
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,920
If a wandering hermit

211
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,030
said something like that to Wu Yang,

212
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,750
it can't mean anything good.

213
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,440
Did Wu Yang tell you

214
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,840
what the hermit said?

215
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,840
Wu Yang is an obedient girl.

216
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,550
She tells me everything.

217
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:16,630
Xijun,

218
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,320
based on Chi Ying's description,

219
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,870
sketch a portrait
of that wandering hermit.

220
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,320
On it.

221
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,270
Officer,

222
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,440
please don't blame Chi Ying.

223
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,000
Any mother

224
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:28,720
would be frantic

225
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,420
having lost her daughter.

226
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,170
Understood.

227
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,800
You may go.

228
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes.

229
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:34,160
Xue Huan,

230
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,280
see them out.

231
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,150
Something's happened!

232
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,350
Come inside quickly!

233
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,900
It's him! Exactly.

234
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,150
The more you draw,
the more it looks like him.

235
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,010
That's the man!

236
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,300
What happened?

237
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,870
-Look at the portrait!
-Look!

238
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,150
It's incredibly lifelike!

239
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,030
Incredible!

240
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,130
You have a portrait of him?

241
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,680
It's the same person.

242
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,960
Only...

243
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,610
I can't quite tell his age.

244
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,170
Auntie Chi Ying,

245
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,150
this man—though his hair
and beard are white—

246
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:15,010
has a youthful and handsome face.

247
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,810
By all accounts, he's a fine-looking man,

248
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,630
wouldn't you say?

249
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,760
A fine-looking man?

250
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,270
What fine-looking man?

251
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,000
A fiend!

252
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,790
The fiend from that great mural

253
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,050
in the Chengfo Temple!

254
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,080
The mural?

255
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,030
Madam, are you referring

256
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,670
to the "Subjugation of Devils" mural
in the Great Buddha Hall?

257
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,910
That's the one! That mural

258
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:34,150
is filled with nothing
but demons and monsters!

259
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,870
Chi Ying,

260
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,510
I won't allow you to speak like that!

261
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,630
The "Subjugation of Devils"

262
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,150
is the life's work of Qin Xiaobai,

263
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,200
the Greatest Painter of the Tang Empire!

264
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,270
Why would he pour his heart and soul

265
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:44,530
into painting such demons and monsters?

266
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,440
If that mural

267
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,440
hadn't been

268
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,720
trapped under cobwebs,

269
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,480
who knows what chaos

270
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,030
would have befallen Chang'an by now!

271
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:50,840
And besides,

272
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
of all places, why did he

273
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,670
have to paint it

274
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,400
right next to the Great Buddha?

275
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,310
That's right—

276
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,870
I often took Wu Yang there
to pay respects to the Buddha.

277
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,270
Could it be
that while we were worshipping,

278
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,270
some demon from the mural noticed her,

279
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,320
broke free from the wall,

280
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,480
and kidnapped my daughter?

281
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,150
Silence!

282
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,670
One more word of this nonsense,

283
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:08,130
and I'll have you removed!

284
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,890
This is my establishment.

285
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
Then I'm leaving!

286
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,180
Well? Aren't you going after her?

287
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:19,720
Xijun.

288
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:26,280
I know. I shouldn't have
lost my temper like that.

289
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,320
About the story behind Qin Xiaobai's mural

290
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,550
"Subjugation of Devils",

291
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,120
nobody knows it better than you do.

292
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,720
Of course you'd be upset

293
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,270
to hear his life's work dismissed

294
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,730
as some demonic painting.

295
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,280
I thought you came out here

296
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,870
to lecture me.

297
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:40,780
How could I?

298
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:42,830
Your sketches

299
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:44,960
have been crucial to the investigation—

300
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,090
if anything, I should be thanking you.

301
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,790
I'm sorry.

302
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,000
I truly couldn't hold back earlier.

303
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,600
You've been drawing for two days straight—
you must be exhausted.

304
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,000
Go back and get some rest.

305
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,550
No.

306
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,960
I'm going to Chengfo Temple.

307
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,750
I want to see
the "Subjugation of Devils" for myself

308
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,280
and clear away the cobwebs.

309
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,480
A masterpiece like that
shouldn't be left in the dust.

310
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,200
Very well.

311
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,080
If official duties weren't pressing,

312
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,030
I'd go with you.

313
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,650
That's alright.

314
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,790
Thank you, Lu Lingfeng.

315
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:34,390
You're the sanitation worker
from Shengye District?

316
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,360
That's right, Officer.

317
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,630
May I ask your name?

318
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,600
Officer,

319
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,820
someone of my low standing

320
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,720
doesn't really deserve a proper name.

321
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,580
But since I'm a bit slow by nature,

322
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,130
folks around the district
just call me Woody—

323
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,570
like a block of wood.

324
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,000
Woody...

325
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,510
It has a friendly ring to it.

326
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,150
Woody,

327
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,510
since you

328
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,720
clean the district,

329
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,150
do you know Wu Yang,

330
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,440
the daughter of the owner

331
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,740
of this skincare shop?

332
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,820
Yes, I've often

333
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
seen her around here.

334
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,750
You know she's disappeared?

335
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:15,430
So I've heard.

336
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,240
Do you know who he is?

337
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,650
Yes, I do.

338
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,270
The Yongzhou Judicial Official—

339
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:23,600
Lu Lingfeng of Fanyang.

340
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,750
He holds circuit trials around the city

341
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,960
and enters the districts
to investigate cases.

342
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,220
I was present that day.

343
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:27,790
Woody,

344
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,840
you were watching me
from the corner of your eye earlier.

345
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,080
Do you have information
about Wu Yang's disappearance?

346
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,140
Not about that, no.

347
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:36,480
But...

348
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,480
But what?

349
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,270
Well...

350
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,300
about the man who drowned in the well—

351
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,750
I do know something,

352
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,600
though I'm not sure

353
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,800
if it counts as a clue.

354
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,600
Tell me.

355
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,910
Well, it's my duty

356
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,460
as a sanitation worker

357
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,080
to have all the refuse sorted and ready

358
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,510
to be carted out of Chang'an

359
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,240
by 3 AM

360
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,600
every night.

361
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,110
But the night before last...

362
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,910
Get lost!

363
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,970
Out of my way!

364
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,670
You're a roadblock,

365
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,630
aren't you?

366
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:15,150
You filthy sanitation worker!

367
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,410
Clean this mess up now!

368
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,720
Had you seen Kuai Wu before this?

369
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,790
Yes.

370
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:23,270
He used to drink often at the restaurant.

371
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,840
Sometimes, when he stumbled home drunk

372
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,320
past where I sorted the trash,

373
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,080
he'd pick a fight

374
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,940
and curse at me.

375
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,200
But that night,

376
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,120
he seemed far more wasted—

377
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,530
looked like he could collapse any second.

378
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,200
Shameless pig!

379
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,870
Disgusting!

380
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:41,080
You shameless pig!

381
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,790
How dare you grope me!

382
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,680
It serves you right, drowning in a well!

383
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,000
She said that?

384
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,030
Yes.

385
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,550
I'd brushed it off

386
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,510
at the time,

387
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,320
but the next day,

388
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,320
I heard he was dead.

389
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,440
You're the night watch
from Shengye District.

390
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,100
Why are you dressed like this?

391
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,650
As a woman working the night shift,

392
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,780
these clothes

393
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,490
help ward off evil spirits.

394
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,110
But it's broad daylight now.

395
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,750
Won't you scare people

396
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,210
walking around like that?

397
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,390
I have a second trade—

398
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,920
I'm a spirit medium.

399
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,530
If you wish to contact the departed

400
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,030
and speak with lost loved ones,

401
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:28,960
I can help.

402
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:30,670
My rates are quite fair.

403
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,840
Excellent.

404
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,270
Our revered mentor passed away years ago.

405
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:36,960
We were both

406
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,720
his disciples—

407
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,720
can you let us

408
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,440
see our mentor again?

409
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:42,200
Yes,

410
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,150
of course!

411
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,390
Just tell me the honored name
and hometown

412
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:46,520
of your late mentor.

413
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,390
Our mentor was Di Renjie.

414
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,150
Di...

415
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:54,960
Di...

416
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,390
Master Di?

417
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,960
I'm afraid my arts

418
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,690
are powerless to contact
a spirit of his caliber.

419
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,270
So this "spirit medium" act

420
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,550
is just a scheme
to swindle people, isn't it?

421
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:05,920
Go!

422
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,960
Wash that paint off your face

423
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,760
and come back to speak properly.

424
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,160
Yes,

425
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:14,680
I did say those words—

426
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,589
but it was just a curse, nothing more.

427
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,190
He was so much bigger than me;

428
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,960
how could I

429
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,619
have pushed him into the well?

430
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,510
That Woody—

431
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,920
I only took twenty coins from him,

432
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,780
and now he's falsely accusing me.

433
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,200
Woody spends all day cleaning garbage—

434
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,550
how much could he possibly earn?

435
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,350
And you even swindled his money?

436
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,960
He wanted to contact his father

437
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,400
to ask about some major life decision.

438
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,000
I was only trying to help him.

439
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,590
That night,

440
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,200
besides Kuai Wu,

441
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,750
did you see anyone else suspicious?

442
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:50,830
No.

443
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,250
Let me give you some advice:

444
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,030
stop this spirit medium scam

445
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,680
to cheat people out of their money.

446
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,550
If I quit being a spirit medium,

447
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,480
how else will I ever save up enough?

448
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,260
What trouble have you caused now?

449
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,720
What a disgrace!

450
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,510
And now you've been summoned!

451
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,790
Hurry up, make enough money,

452
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,050
and get out of my house!

453
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,930
Now, get out!

454
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,550
Her name was originally Ling.

455
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,880
After her husband died,

456
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,510
her mother-in-law turned vicious—

457
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,370
always beating and berating her.

458
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,550
The district head gave her

459
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,510
the night watch job

460
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,590
out of pity.

461
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:59,310
About half a year ago,
she started working as a spirit medium,

462
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:01,030
calling herself "Auntie Ling."

463
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,440
But everyone knows

464
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,510
she's just doing it for the money—

465
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,200
her mother-in-law has set a price:

466
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,930
once she saves up 10,000 coins,

467
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,240
she’s free to leave.

468
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,240
Once we solve this case,

469
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,790
I'm going

470
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,030
to have a serious talk

471
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,630
with Ling's mother-in-law.

472
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,370
I'll go with you.

473
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,720
You two are surprisingly decent,

474
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,920
aren't you?

475
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,280
[Chengfo Temple]

476
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:47,650
[Great Buddha Hall]

477
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,270
I simply wish to use common pigments
to execute the dotting technique

478
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,400
with more brilliance than
if I had used "Wandering Light."

479
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,070
Only then

480
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,030
would I be worthy

481
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,890
of the title
"Greatest Painter of the Tang Empire."

482
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,880
Demons

483
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,720
cannot enter the Buddha's gaze.

484
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:29,200
In the eyes of the Buddha,
there are no demons—

485
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,440
how could there be any in his heart?

486
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,980
What's wrong with you?

487
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,720
It's nothing.

488
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,750
You're bleeding—

489
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,240
so much blood.

490
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,110
I know a miracle doctor.

491
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:02,070
Let me bring him to treat you.

492
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,470
That won't be necessary.

493
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,240
The bleeding happened last night;

494
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,640
it's long since stopped.

495
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,210
It's just this splitting headache—

496
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,270
so severe

497
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,920
I've been lying here

498
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:13,720
all night in a daze.

499
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,880
If I may, sir...

500
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,510
you look somewhat familiar.

501
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:26,640
May I ask who you are?

502
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,170
I am Householder Chenkong,

503
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,070
the keeper of this hall.

504
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:30,640
Then...

505
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,550
who injured you?

506
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,540
Last night,

507
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,590
two ruffians broke in.

508
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:38,480
They were probably aiming
to steal these ritual objects.

509
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,510
I fought them,

510
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:40,790
and as a result...

511
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,310
You must report this
to the authorities at once.

512
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,590
The current Yongzhou Judicial Official

513
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,450
is Lu Lingfeng—

514
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,200
No need.

515
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,310
Those villains

516
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,400
dared to commit violence
before the Buddha—

517
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,000
retribution will find them.

518
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,000
Now, young lady,

519
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,590
how did you get in?

520
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,090
Through the main gate.

521
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,480
Why have you come?

522
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,890
To clean the mural—

523
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:04,200
to clear away the dust.

524
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,130
Absolutely not.

525
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,640
Why not?

526
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,830
The "Subjugation of Devils"
is a treasure of Chengfo Temple.

527
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,720
It should be kept clean.

528
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,830
As for the reason,

529
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
you need not know.

530
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:13,790
In fact,

531
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,830
you should not

532
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
even be inside this hall.

533
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,480
Please leave.

534
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,130
You kept your word, Miss Xijun,

535
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,790
and have truly come to offer incense.

536
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,250
Please,

537
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,010
come to the quarter for tea.

538
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:42,640
Later,

539
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,160
I shall personally accompany you

540
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,110
to the Guanyin Hall for your prayers.

541
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,510
Buddhist, as you know,

542
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,590
when Master Qin Xiaobai painted
the "Subjugation of Devils,"

543
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,240
I visited this hall many times.

544
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,680
Now that I've returned to Chang'an,

545
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,400
I wish to admire the mural once more

546
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,480
and clear its dust.

547
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,310
But Householder Chenkong, the keeper,

548
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,480
not only refused to let me clean it—

549
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,750
he drove me out.

550
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,920
Ah, Miss Xijun, there is something
you do not understand.

551
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,240
That mural truly must not be cleaned.

552
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,680
Moreover,

553
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,110
one should not

554
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,370
casually enter that hall anymore at all.

555
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:28,400
Xijun,

556
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,680
I know my "Master Fei" cooking

557
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,510
is nothing special,

558
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,350
but you should at least try a bite—

559
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,160
do it for me?

560
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,680
I can't eat.

561
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,200
My heart is too heavy,

562
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,750
thinking of the "Subjugation of Devils"
covered in dust.

563
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,080
A woman's weeping
in the Great Buddha Hall?

564
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:47,920
Chi Ying mentioned she took Wu Yang there—

565
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,680
could it be Wu Yang crying?

566
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:51,800
Impossible.

567
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:54,390
Buddhist Guangxiao said...

568
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,720
"It began two months ago—

569
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,590
one night, someone heard a woman sobbing

570
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,000
from that hall,

571
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,510
and it has continued every night since.

572
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,720
Since then, our Chengfo Temple

573
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,640
has grown quiet, its visitors sparse,

574
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,500
its incense offerings dwindled.

575
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,480
Even I am

576
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,510
at a loss."

577
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:17,640
What puzzles me

578
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,000
is why they refuse to let anyone

579
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,930
clean the mural.

580
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,350
As for the weeping—

581
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,950
if it started two months ago,

582
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,790
it can't be related to Wu Yang.

583
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,270
No wonder

584
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,070
the abbot greeted us

585
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,880
so warmly that day—

586
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,280
the temple must be desperate for visitors.

587
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,590
It is strange

588
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,550
that they forbid cleaning the mural.

589
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,200
Still,

590
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:41,640
Guangxiao the abbot

591
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,590
struck me as a good man.

592
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,590
You can't judge character

593
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,480
by appearance.

594
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,960
Nightly weeping,

595
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,640
so eerie—

596
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:52,070
why hasn't this been reported
to the authorities?

597
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:54,070
Chengfo Temple is surely involved.

598
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,000
Well now, Xue Huan,

599
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,260
quite the bold theory you have there!

600
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,510
I believe

601
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,100
Captain Xue

602
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,130
makes a valid point.

603
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,360
Alright, alright—we'll follow your lead.

604
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,480
Xijun,

605
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,350
if you can't eat,

606
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,230
let me accompany you for a walk instead.

607
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,880
What are you all staring at?

608
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,310
Fei,

609
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:36,030
this dish is quite intriguing.

610
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,270
Though prepared in the style of Chang'an,

611
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,720
I can taste both

612
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:40,440
the delicacy of Nanzhou Prefecture

613
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,640
and the bold richness of Yunding County
in its flavors.

614
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,240
Is that so?

615
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,830
Here, let's have a drink, a drink!

616
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,030
A toast to you, to you!

617
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,010
It really is deserted.

618
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,640
It seems no one

619
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,390
guards this hall after dusk.

620
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,030
Xijun,

621
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,240
you can clean the mural without worry—

622
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,700
no one should disturb you.

623
00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:09,900
[Great Buddha Hall]

624
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,200
How did it come to this?

625
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:30,240
Who's crying there?

626
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,520
Don't be afraid,

627
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,610
it must be the wind.

628
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,950
Let me light a candle.

629
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,360
I wonder where Master Qin

630
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,920
is now.

631
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,520
I know you've always regretted

632
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,040
not being able
to formally study under him.

633
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,480
Today,

634
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,610
in clearing the dust

635
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,000
from Master Qin's mural,

636
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,920
carefully appreciating his brushwork,

637
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,180
and contemplating the beauty of his art,

638
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
I have found my own way

639
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,170
to pay homage to the master.

640
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,650
Who's there?

641
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,680
It's me.

642
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:44,550
It's me.

643
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:46,440
Please don't hit me.

644
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,200
Don't hit me.

645
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,280
I'm begging you.

646
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,920
I beg you, don't hit me!

647
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,280
Why are you here?

648
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,590
I know

649
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:58,830
we're not usually allowed
in the Great Buddha Hall.

650
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,880
But I truly can't sleep

651
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,750
unless I'm near the Buddha's feet.

652
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,160
I slipped in

653
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,880
when Householder Chenkong

654
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,810
wasn't looking.

655
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,160
Who are you?

656
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,830
What was that?

657
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,640
I am Lu Lingfeng,

658
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,790
Yongzhou Judicial Official.

659
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,270
Oh, I see

660
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,980
you're an officer.

661
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,800
Answer me.

662
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,400
It's said that a woman's weeping

663
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,930
is often heard in this hall.

664
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,160
Have you heard it?

665
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm hard of hearing—

666
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,480
I can't hear it.

667
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,110
Then have you been pretending
to be a weeping woman

668
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,710
to scare off other visitors?

669
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,160
With this old voice of mine,

670
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,360
how could I possibly imitate a woman's?

671
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,480
Officer,

672
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,720
I sold my charcoal well today

673
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,830
for a fair price—

674
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,130
please, take these few coins
as a token of my respect.

675
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,280
What is this for?

676
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,720
I beg you, Officer,

677
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,510
please don't tell Buddhist Guangxiao

678
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,830
or Householder Chenkong.

679
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,590
If they find out

680
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,550
I've been sleeping here,

681
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,150
they won't

682
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,110
let me

683
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,770
into Chengfo Temple anymore.

684
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,240
What is your surname, elder?

685
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:04,510
I...

686
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,440
my surname is Tao.

687
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:07,680
Mr. Tao,

688
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:08,960
keep your money.

689
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,880
We won't tell them.

690
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,880
But... don't you have a home?

691
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,350
Selling charcoal

692
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,550
does earn a little,

693
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,070
but not enough

694
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,530
to buy a house in Chang'an.

695
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,440
I sleep wherever I can.

696
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,400
Mr. Tao,

697
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,110
tomorrow you can go to the Pei's Mansion

698
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,680
near the southern gate
of Chongren District—

699
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,540
that's my home.

700
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,480
We have a few empty rooms;

701
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,640
we can spare one

702
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,350
for you to stay in for a while.

703
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,310
Thank you, young lady.

704
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,030
Thank you.

705
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,590
I'll leave you

706
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,110
to your business.

707
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,480
Thank you.

708
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,270
Thank you, thank you.

709
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,000
Thank you so much.

710
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,640
Finally, it's done.

711
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,840
Thank you for your help,
Judicial Official Lu.

712
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,590
A masterpiece like this mural

713
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:27,520
deserves to shine in all its glory.

714
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,470
[Great Buddha Hall]

715
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,750
What demon dares

716
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,100
to light candles in this hall?

717
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,370
It's Guangxiao.

718
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,640
What do we do?

719
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,360
I've caused trouble.

720
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,120
Cleaning the mural at night was my idea.

721
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,370
This has nothing to do with you.

722
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,090
There are shadows!

723
00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:00,160
They're not ghosts—

724
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,090
they're people!

725
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,100
They're human!

726
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,510
If they're human, there's nothing to fear.

727
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:07,850
Let's go! Let's go!

728
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:14,550

Miss Pei,

731
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,920
I already told you,

732
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:21,430
this hall should not be entered lightly.

733
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:22,960
Why have you come back?

734
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,610

735
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,550

738
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,590
A grave sin!

739
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:39,550

O Buddha!

743
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,850

744
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:53,830
that we must trap these demons

745
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,270
beneath dust and cobwebs.

746

We followed
your divine instruction faithfully,

00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
and now it has been

748
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,510
utterly destroyed!

749
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,400
This is not our fault!

Lu Lingfeng,

751
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:09,550
soon demons and monsters will pour forth!

752

Blood and chaos

753
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,640
will drench Chang'an!

754
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,030
And you two

755
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,920
are to blame!

756
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,880
-Yes, you are to blame!
-Yes, you are to blame!

757
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,070
-It's your fault!
-Your fault!

758
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,530
What demons and monsters?

759
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,510
I am the newly appointed
Yongzhou Judicial Official.

760
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,370
While I'm here,

761
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
let's see

762
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:28,370
who dares to bring chaos to Chang'an!

763
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:29,480
Lu Lingfeng,

764
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:32,030
do you think your rank

765
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:33,640
allows you to act so recklessly?

766
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,200
Exactly!

767
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,270
I will report you!

768
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:38,110
I will bring this
before the Emperor himself!

769
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,270
Yes, report him!

770
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,310
Buddhist Guangxiao,

771
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:43,170
what exactly do you intend
to accuse Lu Lingfeng of?

772
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,720
Su Wuming?

773
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,510
You'd report him
for helping Chengfo Temple clean,

774
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,880
for clearing the dust

775
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,660
from this magnificent mural?

776
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:00,960
I will report him
for unleashing demons and monsters!

777
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,200
I don't believe there's a statute

778
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,930
for that in the Tang legal code.

779
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,000
Su Wuming,

780
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,160
you don't know the full story.

781
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,310
I've heard a little.

782
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,270
Two months ago,

783
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,510
in the deep of night,

784
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,750
a woman's weeping was heard in this hall.

785
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,510
Yes, yes.

786
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,610
Afterwards,

787
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,830
the Buddha appeared in a dream

788
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,790
to Householder Chenkong—
the hall's keeper—

789
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,270
instructing us to seal this mural

790
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,960
with dust and cobwebs

791
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
to prevent demons

792
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,550
from terrorizing Chang'an.

793
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:34,400
And since then, temple attendance
has dwindled,

794
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:35,510
and you even

795
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,680
closed the Great Buddha Hall.

796
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,590
What else could we do?

797
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:41,790
After that, did the weeping

798
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,920
stop?

799
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,160
No.

800
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,510
It grew even louder—

801
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,680
sometimes, several women

802
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,680
crying together.

803
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:50,240
True!

804
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,030
I heard it yesterday too—

805
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,230
utterly terrifying!

806
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:54,270
Yes.

807
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:55,720
-Exactly.
-Absolutely spine-chilling!

808
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,680
Captain Xue,

809
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,200
what was it

810
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,920
you said at home earlier?

811
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,030
I, Xue Huan, the captain
of the Yongzhou Prefecture,

812
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,690
am now conducting an inquiry!

813
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,200
Okay.

814
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,660
Such a bizarre matter—

815
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,320
why was it never reported
to the authorities?

816
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,510
What is Chengfo Temple

817
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,239
so maliciously trying to hide?

818
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,280
T-This…

819
00:34:17,070 --> 00:34:17,800
Captain Xue,

820
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,630
Buddhist Guangxiao
is a monk of great virtue and prestige.

821
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,880
This manner of questioning

822
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,480
is somewhat inappropriate.

823
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,840
The Yongzhou Judicial Official

824
00:34:31,030 --> 00:34:32,630
holds circuit trials around the city

825
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,280
and enters the districts
to investigate cases.

826
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,190
Learning of this

827
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,739
during an investigation,

828
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,400
he came at night to inspect—

829
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,710
all part of standard procedure.

830
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:47,360
How could this anger the Abbot enough

831
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,040
to threaten an accusation
before the Emperor?

832
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:50,730
This…

833
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,800
Buddhist,

834
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,880
do you truly believe

835
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,030
cobwebs

836
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:58,230
can hold back demons?

837
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,150
Then tell me,

838
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,760
why did the woman's weeping not stop?

839
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,320
Well...

840
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,550
By your logic,

841
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,360
now that the mural is restored,

842
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,110
the demons

843
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,880
should emerge at any moment?

844
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:15,710
W-Well...

845
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:16,840
This...

846
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:17,440
Well then.

847
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,630
Let everyone return to rest.

848
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,280
The six of us

849
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,200
will stay the night in this hall

850
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,000
and wait for them to appear.

851
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,480
No, you mustn't!

852
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,150
You mustn't!

853
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,210
In the past, the so-called Demon Lord

854
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,960
and his horde

855
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,320
were vanquished here.

856
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,670
If any dare return,

857
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:36,630
let Judicial Official Lu

858
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:38,030
deal with them again.

859
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:38,960
I had a hand

860
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,630
in that myself, you know.

861
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,040
That fierce beast, Qiongqi—

862
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,960
I subdued it!

863
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,920
Yes, indeed.

864
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,150
And I

865
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,870
slew the female demon—

866
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:51,710
just an old woman

867
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:53,110
in disguise, as it turned out.

868
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,230
Buddhist Guangxiao,

869
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:56,800
if I recall, you were
in this very hall that day.

870
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,510
Did you not see it with your own eyes?

871
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,370
Yes, it's true.

872
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,390
Buddhist Guangxiao,

873
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,000
even if you wish to accuse me,

874
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,150
must it be tonight?

875
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,880
If you rush to the palace now,

876
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,000
would you even be granted an audience?

877
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,440
I…

878
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,280
would not.

879
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:14,310
Everyone,

880
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,800
Lu Lingfeng and Su Wuming

881
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,880
are both disciples of Master Di.

882
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,230
Let us temporarily

883
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,810
place our trust in them.

884
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:22,940
For now,

885
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,510
return to your quarters,

886
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,760
bar your doors and windows,

887
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,280
and recite the Diamond Sutra
for protection.

888
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,190
-Yes.
-Yes.

889
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,150
Amitabha.

890
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,110
-Amitabha.
-Amitabha.

891
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,190
It is strange—

892
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,960
when Xijun and I first entered the hall,

893
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,890
we truly did hear

894
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,440
a woman's weeping.

895
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,110
Yes,

896
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,320
faintly—

897
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,760
just those two sounds,

898
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,800
then nothing.

899
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,230
It seems even demons and ghosts

900
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,090
fear my mentor.

901
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,710
Xue Huan,

902
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,560
you are now a captain
serving the Tang Empire.

903
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,960
Remember my words

904
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,590
well:

905
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,800
this world holds neither gods

906
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,710
nor ghosts—

907
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,150
only people who pretend to be them.

908
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,240
Understood.

909
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,240
What's wrong?

910
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,840
Nothing, nothing.

911
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,360
Then why the alarm?

912
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,320
You startled me.

913
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,000
Exactly.

914
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,360
What I mean is,

915
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,480
though this hall looks fresh
and clean now,

916
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,840
it could still use some repairs.

917
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,230
Look,

918
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,260
there's a hole over there.

919
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,230
Where?

920
00:38:04,710 --> 00:38:06,170
Right there, right there.

921
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,000
If it rains,

922
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,460
it'll surely leak.

923
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,510
Everyone,

924
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,360
my injury is newly healed—

925
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,550
sitting all night is too much for me.

926
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,280
I… I see a mat over there;

927
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,510
I'll go lie down for a while.

928
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,440
Go on, then.

929
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,760
Now what's wrong?

930
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,400
Don't move!

931
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,690
Stay where you are!

932
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,000
Did you use

933
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,530
Fairy Beauty Powder today?

934
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,110
No.

935
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,150
Xijun, did you use it?

936
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,400
Yes.

937
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,280
Quite a bit, in fact.

938
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,190
And did you come
into contact with that mat?

939
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,670
No.

940
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:28,920
Fei,

941
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,360
are you saying this mat

942
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,480
carries the scent
of Fairy Beauty Powder?

943
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,030
Yes,

944
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,540
and it's quite strong.

945
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:37,630
The old man sleeping here earlier

946
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,830
was a charcoal seller

947
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:39,760
named Mr. Tao.

948
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,080
He's hard of hearing.

949
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,960
He claims he can only sleep

950
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,360
at the feet of the Buddha.

951
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:47,070
Mr. Tao...

952
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,070
[Sesame Bake]

953
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:51,150
Give me a few of the big ones.

954
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,000
A few of the big ones, you say?

955
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,670
I'll take this one, and this one too.

956
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:54,320
This one—the big chunks burn longer.

957
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,480
My charcoal burns well, doesn't it?

958
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,400
Indeed, it's great.

959
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,550
Then how about another piece?

960
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,150
Sure, sure.

961
00:39:58,150 --> 00:39:59,880
That's enough, that's plenty.

962
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,590
Duke Zhao,

963
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,710
how have you been these days?

964
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,670
I've come to see you.

965
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,780
The woman named Wu Yang

966
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,440
I mentioned the other day—

967
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:03,800
My golden tablet...

968
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,940
Where is my golden tablet?

969
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,660
Who stole my golden tablet?

970
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,710
You old fool—

971
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:22,510
so you are connected
to Wu Yang's disappearance.

972
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,170
Who are you?

973
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,100
The one arresting you.

974
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,510
You?

975
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,840
Such arrogance, lady.

976
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,510
Don't be afraid, Yingtao!

977
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:43,440
Scholar Su sent us

978
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,900
to assist you discreetly.

979
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,670
Watch his weapon!

980
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,810
An armor-piercing awl.

981
00:42:04,070 --> 00:42:05,920
I've heard this weapon is formidable—

982
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,180
first time seeing one.

983
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:08,480
It's mine now.

984
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,190
You dare take my weapon!

985
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:10,880
Yes,

986
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:11,880
I took it!

987
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,860
And since you injured Liu,

988
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,360
I'll take your life too!

989
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:16,070
Wait!

990
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,800
You can have my life.

991
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,360
But before you kill me,

992
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,280
I beg you—

993
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
help me recover that golden tablet.

994
00:42:24,630 --> 00:42:28,230
It concerns the very fate
of the Tang Empire.
