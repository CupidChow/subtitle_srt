Why are you still carrying a sword?

5
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,479
It's how I make my living.

6
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,940
I must keep it with me.

You jest, Sir.

10
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,430
I've loved playing the pipa
since childhood.

11
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,170
But as I grew older,

12
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,690
I couldn't survive on pipa alone.

13
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,639
So I found a master
to teach me sword dance.

14
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,050
Today I brought both my sword

15
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,630
and my pipa.

16
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,230
You may choose which you prefer,

17
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,470
or I can play the pipa first,
then dance with my sword.

I've failed to pass the imperial exams.

190
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,120
So I had to settle for
working at the Sushan Shop

191
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,630
as a servant to make a living.

192
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,760
Your skills as an assassin are decent,

193
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,840
but not good enough
to beat a shop servant.

194
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,910
Bad luck for you.

195
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,550
And who are you?

196
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,320
Another servant from the Sushan Shop.

197
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,910
Making a living in Chang'an isn't easy.

198
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,150
Afraid of being bullied,

199
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,630
I learned a few moves.

200
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,360
I even thought about becoming an assassin.

201
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,840
But my skills are too poor.

202
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:37,320
You can't even beat me,

203
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,790
so you'd better find another profession.

204
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,440
Mr. Ruan.

205
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,560
She's all yours.

206
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,250
Where is the leader?

207
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,660
Come out and speak!

208
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm here.

209
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,150
I wouldn't dare to lie.

210
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,080
This woman is indeed not

211
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,610
part of our Xuanhuo Troupe.

212
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:57,150
On our way here,

213
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,030
we happened to find her
about to hang herself.

214
00:15:59,030 --> 00:15:59,720
So...

215
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,990
Our leader is kind-hearted.

216
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,240
Seeing that she can play the pipa

217
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,600
and dance with swords, he...

218
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,250
He took her in.

219
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:14,990
Yes, yes.

220
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Hanging yourself while carrying a sword?

221
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,720
Do you particularly enjoy being strangled?

222
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:23,270
I'm afraid the suicide attempt
was just a trap.

223
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,470
She must have known beforehand

224
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,730
that the Xuanhuo Troupe
was coming to Ruan's Restaurant

225
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,240
and deliberately waited for you there.

226
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,720
Mr. Ruan,

227
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,000
who hired this troupe?

228
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,840
The manager surnamed Hou.

229
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,360
He wanted to harm me!

230
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,720
Catch him!

231
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:52,960
Stop!

232
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,320
Come here!

233
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,390
Let me go!

234
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,380
Release me!

235
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,150
Come here!

236
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,080
Kneel!

237
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:04,880
Trying to run?

238
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,750
So you admit it?

239
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,480
Yes, it was me.

240
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,349
I hired an assassin

241
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,940
to kill you all because you're unfilial!

242
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,750
So what?

243
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,210
You run a restaurant,

244
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,920
yet spend all day reading, memorizing,
and writing poetry.

245
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,210
Just to socialize with poets,

246
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,510
you're willing to spend a fortune.

247
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,030
You're about to squander

248
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,349
all of your father's assets!

249
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:25,829
I can't stand it!

250
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,510
Before your father died, he told me,

251
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,490
"If he is worthy of support,

252
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,350
then support him.

253
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,830
If he's not,

254
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,480
you..."

255
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,110
"You

256
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:43,440
may take his place."

257
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,270
What he just said

258
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,640
sounds so familiar.

259
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,380
I think a poet wrote it before.

260
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:56,960
You're truly obsessed with poetry.

261
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
Those words

262
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,020
aren't from any poem.

263
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:00,920
No?

264
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,790
It's from the Late Eastern Han
and the Three Kingdoms,

265
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,790
when Liu Xuande entrusted his son

266
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,200
to Zhuge Kongming at Baidi City.

267
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,280
Right, right.

268
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,110
Right, right.

269
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,750
I remember now.

270
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,240
Hou.

271
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,230
Your loyalty to my father

272
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,510
is commendable.

273
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,400
I thank you for that.

274
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,590
Well...

275
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:55,020
I love poetry.

276
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,830
Neglecting the family business

277
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,070
is indeed unfilial.

278
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,000
But you actually hired an assassin

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,200
to harm me.

280
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,550
You've gone too far!

281
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,510
Way too far!

282
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,790
Lock him in the woodshed.

283
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,220
Starve him for 3...

284
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:09,690
Two days.

285
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,040
Let him reflect on his actions.

286
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,270
Move.

287
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:17,640
Everyone,

288
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,330
I apologize for this embarrassment.

289
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:21,750
What about her?

290
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,030
The Tang Empire is indeed tolerant
of assassins,

291
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:26,510
but those caught in the act

292
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,010
must still be punished.

293
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,590
If we don't report her to the authorities,

294
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:30,110
we

295
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,720
could be accused of harboring a criminal.

296
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,580
Then tie her up.

297
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,130
Bring some rope.

298
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,100
Get the rope

299
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,960
and tie her up.

300
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,310
Wait.

301
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,270
I will take her punishment.

302
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,580
Her name isn't Nu Jiao.

303
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,550
She is

304
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,720
Jiaonu.

305
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,030
We met in Luoyang.

306
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,920
I was living in the Divine Capital,
preparing for exams,

307
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,160
but kept failing.

308
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,960
I became depressed

309
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,200
and spent my days in brothels.

310
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,110
Both of us were lost souls,

311
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,380
finding comfort in each other

312
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,680
and accompanying each other

313
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,210
through the most difficult time
in our lives.

314
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:39,160
Later, Jiaonu became the top courtesan,

315
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,990
entertaining officials and nobles daily.

316
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,550
Once, when I went to see Jiaonu,

317
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:49,160
I saw her

318
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,590
being embraced by a general.

319
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:56,030
Indignant, I stepped forward to rebuke him

320
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:57,430
and was beaten severely.

321
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,440
In my anger,

322
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,310
I took out my frustration on Jiaonu

323
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,600
and swore never to see her again,

324
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,550
even cursing that she would go blind!

325
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,790
How cruel I was.

326
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,790
Looking back now,

327
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,960
it was truly wrong of me.

328
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,830
As a songstress, by entertaining guests,

329
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,000
she could earn her freedom sooner,

330
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,350
so we could be together forever.

331
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,510
Afterward...

332
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,440
Afterward,

333
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
I gained instant recognition

334
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:43,990
because of my long poem
"Cold Food Ballad."

335
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,160
I was no longer obsessed
with the imperial exams

336
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,960
but returned to Nanzhou Prefecture

337
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,110
to focus on poetry,

338
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:51,200
keeping company with other 3 poets

339
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,240
and finding freedom
among mountains and waters.

340
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:01,550
But in my heart,

341
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,480
I've always felt guilty toward you.

342
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:08,960
Today,

343
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,160
let me take the blame for her!

344
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,110
For me,

345
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,440
this is a chance,

346
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,720
an opportunity to make amends.

347
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,240
Nu Jiao.

348
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:31,310
No,

349
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,960
Jiaonu.

350
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,590
Don't you want to say something?

351
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,400
Taking the blame isn't something

352
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,480
that poet Leng Ji can do

353
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:43,190
just because he wants to.

354
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,780
Since breaking ties with Leng Ji,

355
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,100
I've been disheartened.

356
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,090
As a top courtesan,

357
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,980
3 years of fame was already long enough.

358
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:56,260
After that, no one cared anymore.

359
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,390
I went from Luoyang to Chang'an

360
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,860
and was famous for another 2 years.

361
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,730
Later on,

362
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,730
I didn't go to the House of Sorrow
in the Ghost Market,

363
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,420
nor did I marry a merchant.

364
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,630
Instead, I traveled the world.

365
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,090
At Mount Song,

366
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,490
I met a starving old man.

367
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,900
I gave him a sesame cake,

368
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,220
and he became

369
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,350
the mentor who taught me martial arts.

370
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,250
Later, I took the name Nu Jiao

371
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,850
and became an assassin.

372
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,290
Remembering Leng Ji's curse

373
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:25,290
upon me back then,

374
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,550
I pretended to be blind
to hide my identity.

375
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,110
But I've never killed anyone.

376
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:35,530
Never killed anyone?

377
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:36,660
Are you possibly

378
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,030
also an assassin who just takes deposits?

379
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:39,570
No.

380
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,090
I don't think so either.

381
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,680
Your skills aren't that poor.

382
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,130
Perhaps you couldn't bring yourself
to do it?

383
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,380
You had your chance today.

384
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:56,980
I made a vow

385
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,940
to only kill the wicked and evil.

386
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,710
Today I saw Ruan Daxiong

387
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,090
treating the 3 poets like honored guests.

388
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,090
Clearly, he is certainly not

389
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:05,350
a truly wicked person.

390
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,870
Congratulations, Mr. Leng!

391
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:12,010
What Miss Jiaonu just said

392
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,260
is that she judges whether someone

393
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:15,090
is good or evil

394
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,980
based on their association with poets.

395
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,940
It's clear

396
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,080
that she has never forgotten you.

397
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,860
I agree. I agree.

398
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,860
So you're saying

399
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:27,250
these 3 poets

400
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,220
saved my life?

401
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,290
I am deeply grateful.

402
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,090
As to whether Jiaonu has killed before,

403
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,750
her words alone are not proof.

404
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,140
Even though she hasn't,

405
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,770
she can't escape punishment.

406
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,730
Although the Tang Empire
doesn't ban assassins,

407
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,860
once there's an assassination attempt,

408
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,250
it's still treated as premeditated murder.

409
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,460
And premeditated murder,

410
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,590
successful or not, is a serious crime.

411
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,180
The county office
will surely impose a heavy sentence.

412
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,380
No! I've already made up my mind:

413
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,130
If I could reunite with Jiaonu
in this life,

414
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,700
I would marry her immediately.

415
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,860
This is wonderful news!

416
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,220
In that case,

417
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,620
Ruan's Restaurant
will host the wedding banquet!

418
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,460
No need.

419
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,010
Yes, yes.

420
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,900
We'll marry under the moonlight right now.

421
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,020
What's wrong?

422
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,450
Jiaonu,

423
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,840
you don't want to marry me?

424
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,090
You won't forgive me?

425
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:43,380
Am I going to lose you again?

426
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,290
So be it.

427
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,110
You were caught at the crime scene.

428
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,420
Even though you escape execution,

429
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:01,900
you'll likely be exiled 3,000 li away.

430
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,860
You'll never return.

431
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,620
I might as well

432
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,290
go ahead of you.

433
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,880
I'll wait for our wedding
in the underworld.

434
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,980
You...

435
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,730
If we die by the same sword,

436
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,790
we'll recognize each other
in the next life.

437
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,380
Fine.

438
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,300
Mr. Leng, you can't do this.

439
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,090
This won't do. This won't do.

440
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:48,860
This place

441
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,460
is my family's ancestral business.

442
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,050
If you two die here,

443
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,420
who would dare come to eat here anymore?

444
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,370
What madness are you talking about?

445
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,700
If you can die together,
why not live together?

446
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,460
Nonsense!

447
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,560
Yeah, Mr. Leng.

448
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,980
Since you love each other,

449
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,380
get married tonight.

450
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,700
Tomorrow morning,

451
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,050
you must go to the authorities.

452
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:07,460
I'm willing to be your guarantor.

453
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,420
If there are accusations
of harboring criminals,

454
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,380
I will take full responsibility.

455
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:13,890
Everyone,

456
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:18,770
are you willing to help make
this beautiful story happen?

457
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,350
I'm just a servant at the Sushan Shop.

458
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,730
What do you think about this, Boss?

459
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:32,770
Mr. Su?

460
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,570
Mr. Youbo's words just now—

461
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,090
"If you can die together,
why not live together?"—

462
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,050
moved me deeply.

463
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,530
If we're to host a banquet,

464
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,330
we do have 3

465
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:51,990
different flavors of sushan.

466
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,750
The banquet is ready.

467
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,220
To welcome the poets,

468
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,880
I've been preparing for days.

469
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,700
You see?

470
00:27:58,730 --> 00:27:59,940
I've always said Mr. Su

471
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:00,940
is well-educated

472
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,090
and reasonable.

473
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,290
When we drink together later,

474
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,250
we should offer

475
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:06,520
Mr. Su several toasts.

476
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,450
Indeed, indeed.

477
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,920
Let's drink together.

478
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,670
To share a table with you three poets

479
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,380
is my great honor.

480
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,770
You've all said so much,

481
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,420
but we should first ask

482
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,480
Jiaonu's opinion.

483
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:24,010
Jiaonu.

484
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,010
Shall we get married?

485
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,430
I've been waiting for this day

486
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:33,940
for so long.

487
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,010
After tonight, my Ruan's Restaurant

488
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,950
will surely go down in history.

489
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,730
At the very least,

490
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,250
it will be recorded

491
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,710
in the books of legends.

492
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,620
The troupe!

493
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,490
Start playing the music right away!

494
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,010
Alright!

495
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,670
We'll get ready right away.

496
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,140
Yes.

497
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:03,630
[Happiness]

498
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:19,190
[Happiness]

499
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:30,460
[Happiness]

500
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,780
The poem goes,

501
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,820
"While songs ring
through the New Year's wine,

502
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,010
Flowers dance
the Tang Empire's spring fine."

503
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,770
Today at Ruan's Restaurant,

504
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:44,810
distinguished guests fill the seats,
and friends gather like clouds.

505
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:46,220
Though it's an unexpected day,

506
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
the timing couldn't be better.

507
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,760
When hearts are filled with love,

508
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:53,480
every moment becomes auspicious.

509
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,220
Leng Shuye from Nanzhou Prefecture

510
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:00,140
and Fu Jiaonu from the northern lands

511
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:04,420
have endured mountains and waters apart,

512
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:08,570
and their love blooms
into tonight's joyous wedding.

513
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,010
Come on, play the music!

514
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,030
Ever heard of the story
of the fake musician?

515
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
I noticed it long ago.

516
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,700
His Majesty loves music.

517
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,660
Before he entered the Eastern Palace,

518
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,220
I often accompanied him
in studies, martial arts practice,

519
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,080
and musical instrument playing.

520
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,510
The ceremony is complete!

521
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,500
Escort them to the bridal chamber!

522
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:18,180
Great!

523
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,100
Wonderful! Wonderful!

524
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,250
[Ruan's Restaurant]

525
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,620
I didn't expect to drink wedding wine.

526
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,410
The food at Ruan's Restaurant
is excellent.

527
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,490
Indeed, very good.

528
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,490
Eat.

529
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,600
All you do is eat.

530
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,610
I might just kick both of you.

531
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,930
Leader, they outnumber us.

532
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,470
Since we're so nervous,

533
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:48,970
let's just leave.

534
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,330
Take that thing

535
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,990
and get the silver from the exchange shop.

536
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,530
Silver?

537
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,830
There's some here too.

538
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,220
Where did it come from?

539
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,660
That owner surnamed Ruan

540
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,120
is extremely wealthy.

541
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,620
And he's poetry-obsessed.

542
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,370
Master, your instructions?

543
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:11,210
Find a good songstress later

544
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,050
and give her this poem.

545
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,810
When the dancing begins,

546
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,860
have her sing it.

547
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,840
This silver ingot will be yours.

548
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,290
That simple?

549
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:22,290
The poem must be correct.

550
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,390
Not a single word can be wrong.

551
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,860
What's the matter?

552
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,980
Memorize this word for word.

553
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,490
You'll sing it later.

554
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,180
There'll be something in it for you.

555
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,140
Yes.

556
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:42,050
But there are masters among them.

557
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,620
Especially that Lu guy.

558
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,150
He doesn't look like a servant at all.

559
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,770
He's quite familiar with criminal law.

560
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,040
He might even be

561
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,620
a constable.

562
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,550
What are you afraid of?

563
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,220
Aren't they going to drink?

564
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:02,660
Just now, I...

565
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,220
Lu, you promised

566
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,490
to toast us poets with 3 large bowls each.

567
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:25,140
Yet you switched the wine to water.

568
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,330
But it finally provoked
the assassin to act.

569
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,590
What a brilliant plan.

570
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,220
Indeed.

571
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,250
I'm also full of admiration.

572
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,660
We owe thanks to Mr. Su.

573
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:39,410
But we should make up
for those drinks, right?

574
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,890
Yes, we need to make up for the drinks.

575
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,010
Come on, Mr. Su.

576
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:45,570
You two are right.

577
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,620
Mr. Leng and his wife
have entered their bridal chamber.

578
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,330
If we don't drink and celebrate now,

579
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:51,330
when will we?

580
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:54,010
No rush.

581
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,900
The sushan is ready.

582
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:57,760
Eat first. After you finish,

583
00:33:57,810 --> 00:33:59,810
I guarantee you can drink even more.

584
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:01,380
The sushan is delicious!

585
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,700
Thank you for your hard work, ladies.

586
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,620
Let's all have a bowl together later.

587
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,420
This is wedding wine, after all.

588
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:08,030
Thank you, great poet.

589
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,460
This wine smells so good.

590
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,570
I've been smelling it,

591
00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:12,570
and I've been craving it for so long.

592
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,130
Daxiong, let me pour you some.

593
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,190
-Okay. Thank you, Mr. Wang.
-Come on.

594
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,090
Everyone, this sushan goes well with wine.

595
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,380
The more you drink, the better it gets.

596
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,130
Let's eat the sushan first,

597
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,170
and then drink to our heart's content!

598
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,010
Good, good.

599
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:48,540
How is it?

600
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,300
Coming.

601
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,210
Drink up.

602
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,750
They've had at least 3 large bowls.

603
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:57,380
They're all passed out like logs now.

604
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,420
Excellent.

605
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,650
Doesn't matter whether they're constables
or not.

606
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,380
They're all as good as dead now.

607
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,050
Liulang, Qilang,

608
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,420
you two guard the first floor.

609
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:08,620
If anyone comes down,

610
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,980
kill them on sight.

611
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:12,740
Understood.

612
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,720
If you hear fighting upstairs,

613
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:16,210
it means the drug didn't completely

614
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,340
knock them out.

615
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,570
You two should come up immediately
to help.

616
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:20,300
Understood.

617
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:20,940
Again.

618
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:01,530
I guess those few

619
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,870
must have gone back to their rooms.

620
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,780
That's fine.

621
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,470
Let's kill
these two skilled fighters first.

622
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,950
W-What are you going to do?

623
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:23,930
You snuck upstairs with knives,

624
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,320
and now you're asking what I'm doing?

625
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,050
You're quite interesting.

626
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,090
We've fallen into a trap.

627
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,820
You've finally realized it.

628
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,820
But it's too late.

629
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
Kill!

630
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,690
Quickly, take the cabinet and run!

631
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:39,220
-Go.
-Go.

632
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:42,830
-Go.
-Go.

633
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:08,460
Why aren't Liulang and Qilang here yet?

634
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,940
Everyone, stand back!

635
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,540
Cover your mouths and noses!

636
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,660
Don't pursue a desperate enemy.

637
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,050
Catch him. Catch him!

638
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:20,820
After him! After him!

639
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,090
Mr. Gao.

640
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,180
Mr. Wang.

641
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:24,340
Mr. Ruan.

642
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,070
What are you doing here?

643
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,570
Didn't I tell you to hide?

644
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,940
And you too, Mr. Leng.

645
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,210
It's your wedding night.

646
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:31,340
Why did you come out?

647
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,820
I'll catch the thieves first,

648
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,340
then return to my bride.

649
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,090
Indeed.

650
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,010
As respected poets of the Tang Empire,

651
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,670
how could we simply hide away?

652
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:41,350
Exactly right.

653
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,530
That's right. We Tang poets

654
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,570
are all skilled in both literature
and martial arts.

655
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,650
We're not to be trifled with.

656
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:46,490
Well said.

657
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,610
Come here.

658
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,860
I never expected you to be

659
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:52,690
the renowned disciple of Master Di,

660
00:38:52,690 --> 00:38:53,420
Official Lu.

661
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,430
I pay you respect.

662
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,570
I pay you respect as well.

663
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,300
Official Lu.

664
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,420
I didn't reveal my true identity before

665
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,950
in order to catch the thief.

666
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:04,380
Please forgive my discourtesy.

667
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,570
I will interrogate the criminal.

668
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:09,570
Mr. Leng,
please return to your wedding chamber.

669
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:11,300
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

670
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:12,210
Mr. Leng.

671
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,090
There's no need for formality
in this matter.

672
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:15,860
Mr. Wang.

673
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,080
However, Mr. Leng,

674
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,110
Yingtao must guard your chamber door.

675
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:21,980
After all,

676
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:24,420
Jiaonu was captured
at the assassination scene.

677
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,340
I am the Yongzhou Judicial Official.

678
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,140
I can't keep an eye on her,

679
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,780
nor will I allow her to escape.

680
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,380
You allowed us
to complete our wedding ceremony.

681
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,040
Official Lu, you've shown mercy
beyond the law.

682
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:35,130
I thank you on behalf of my wife.

683
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,510
-Go.
-Go.

684
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,470
-Go.
-Go.

685
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:51,940
Kneel.

686
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,300
[Wine and Verses]

687
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,900
Sir!

688
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,180
Sir.

689
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,610
Those 2 big men from the Xuanhuo Troupe

690
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,410
ran away with the large cabinet.

691
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,780
Those 2 jerks!

692
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,530
[Wine and Verses]

693
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,220
Stop cursing.

694
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,680
Sai Mengchang,

695
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,280
what is your real name?

696
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:09,980
[Gou Mengchang,
Leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe]

697
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,340
My surname is Gou. Gou Mengchang.

698
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,380
[Gou Mengchang, Jianghu Grand Thief]

699
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,380
The name "Mengchang" isn't made up.

700
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,380
I'm a Judicial Official,
and I'm questioning you.

701
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,820
You must answer truthfully.

702
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:19,530
Otherwise,

703
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,830
you'll be severely punished
at the county office.

704
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,870
I-I confess.

705
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:24,690
[Wine and Verses]

706
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:25,650
Gou Mengchang,

707
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,820
you're not actually

708
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,230
the leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe, are you?

709
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,340
I'm not.

710
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,690
But those dancestresses and songstresses

711
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,350
belong to the Xuanhuo Troupe.

712
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,380
Lang Yehu has long been

713
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:39,780
in this business since earlier.

714
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,460
He said,

715
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,690
by using a performance troupe as cover,

716
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,900
it makes it easier
to enter wealthy households

717
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,650
to rob them.

718
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,010
I just fell for his nonsense.

719
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,420
Seeing you and that woman
were tough to deal with,

720
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,420
we were actually planning to leave.

721
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,260
But...

722
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,420
He...

723
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:57,610
He's too rich.

724
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,980
Singing one poem for him

725
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,580
would earn us a silver ingot.

726
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:03,570
Running into such a cash cow—

727
00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:05,610
how could we not fleece him?

728
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,260
What a coincidence.

729
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,210
Ruan Daxiong.

730
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,900
In that case,

731
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,260
I must definitely include you

732
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,420
in my poetry.

733
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:16,740
[Wine and Verses]

734
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,510
So you're really not
the leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe.

735
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,980
Where is the real leader then?

736
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,040
Did you kill him?

737
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:23,060
No, no.

738
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:24,780
He's in that large cabinet.

739
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,130
The one those 2 jerks

740
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,550
carried away.

741
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:28,690
All the loot we've scored lately

742
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:30,530
is in there too.

743
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,200
-My dear...
-Official Lu,

744
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,230
I suggest we hurry after them.

745
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,610
Whether they're desperate bandits or not

746
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:36,490
isn't important.

747
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,460
The thing is, there's a human life

748
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
inside that cabinet.
