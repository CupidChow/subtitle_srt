Master!

7
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,060
Why so panicked?

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,400
What is it?

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,510
Master,

10
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,870
I was just serving outside the door...

11
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,710
Changqing,

12
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,000
you didn't hear anything.

13
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,130
But I really did hear it, Master.

[Changqing, a disciple of Chengfo Temple]

15
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,000
It's that...

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,030
It's your unsettled heart

17
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,370
that leads to the noises you hear.

You may leave now.

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:25,150
Even if it means defying my master,

27
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,770
I must speak my mind.

28
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,150
Ever since two months ago,

29
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,240
when people heard a woman crying
in the Great Buddha Hall,

30
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,079
the Chengfo Temple has completely changed.

31
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,079
Everyone in Chang'an is

32
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,480
saying that our temple is

33
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,000
haunted,

34
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
causing worshippers to dwindle.

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,740
Some timid monks

36
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,530
even left the temple directly.

37
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,910
What on earth are you trying to say?

38
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,680
Master,

39
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,190
how about we

40
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,870
go find an exorcist?

41
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:49,960
Shut up!

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,840
You want the prestigious Chengfo Temple

43
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,240
to recruit an exorcist?

44
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,940
Isn't that the same as admitting

45
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,870
that there are ghosts in our temple?

46
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:59,360
You're out of your mind!

47
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,620
Get out of my sight.

48
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,160

These are clearly female ghosts wailing.

59

Are you trying to get us all killed?

60

He asked for leave at noon
to run some errands.

Beneath this Great Buddha,

108
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,430
there used to be a secret passage
to the Ghost Market.

109
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,360
Could the crying

110
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,160
be coming from there?

111
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,120
Impossible.

After Feng Han's rebellion,

Even if there had been
crying in the Ghost Market,

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,240
it wouldn't have reached here.

118

Look,

119
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,390
the demons and monsters on this wall are

120
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,190
thoroughly covered by cobwebs.

121
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,830
The power of Buddha is infinite.

122
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,270
From now on, if you hear

123
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,120
any sounds,

for you to enjoy.

Xijun,

144
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,710
what are these four joys?

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,190
Please tell us.

146
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,600
The first joy is

147
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,190
Master Ji's recovery, of course.

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,480
That's thanks to you guys
taking good care of me.

149
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:07,000
The second joy is

150
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,830
that you, Lu Lingfeng, have been

151
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,160
promoted to Yongzhou Judicial Official.

152
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,310
The third joy is

153
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,070
that, according to His Majesty's decree,

154
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:20,040
my sworn brother's been confirmed
as the Criminal Investigation Scholar.

155

The fourth joy is

the greatest of all.

157
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,190
It is

158
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:27,430
that Xue Huan has become a captain.

159
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,040
I believe

160
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,250
he must be the Tang Empire's

161
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,600

These first three joys,

164
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,320

165
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,040
nothing at all.

of the Judicial Review Court.

No matter how high-ranking an official is
in the Tang Empire,

Why do you keep stopping me?

185
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:27,970
Xijun has put in so much effort

186
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,170
to prepare such exquisite dishes.

187
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,070
Wouldn't it be a waste

188

to eat them right away?

189
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,000
Just looking with your eyes

190
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,530
without eating
won't satisfy your appetite!

191
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:39,350
In my opinion,

192
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,030
we should build on the original dish names

193
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,150
and give each dish a new name,

194
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,650
which must be poetic and artistic

195
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,960
to match this beautiful occasion.

196
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,960
Lu Lingfeng,

197
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,840
when did you also become

198
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,150
so sentimental?

199
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,120
I actually like

200
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,280
Lu Lingfeng's idea.

201
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,960
Now we've returned to Chang'an.

202
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,160
Life should be filled with more poetry.

203
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,720
Let me go first.

204
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,470
This honey-sesame fried pastry

205
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:14,440
[Dish: Victory Over Foreigners]

206
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,040
is originally named
Victory Over Foreigners.

207
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,480
Now, I'll name it

208
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,480
Fallen Flowers Scattered Like Stars.

209
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:25,530
Brilliant!

210
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,000
These pastries look like flowers.

211
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,970
The sesame seeds on it resemble
clusters of stars.

are just like the stars in the sky.

[Dish:
Fallen Flowers Scattered Like Stars]

216
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,500
Brilliant!

217
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:42,650
Xue Huan.

218
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,390
As for this shrimp,

219
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,080
let me think.

220
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,630
Though this shrimp is grilled,

221
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,230
it is transparent throughout.

222
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,120
[Dish: Bright Grilled Shrimp]

223
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
It's originally called
Bright Grilled Shrimp.

224
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,900
I've got it!

225
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,320
I'll call it

[Dish: Cold Beacon Fire on Radiant Armor]

231
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,850
The beacon fire being cold on the armor

232
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,840
captures both the poetic sentiment
of the frontier

233
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,750
and the imagery in one's mind.

234
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:18,910
Great!

235
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,790
I can see

236
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,510
a hint of artistic talent

237
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,320
between your brows now.

238
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,460
There are two more dishes.

239
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,360
Let me try.

240
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,810
This dish in front of me

241
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,600
shall be called Auspicious Dragon
and Phoenix in Crystal Delight.

242
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,720
Well done!

243
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,120

[Dish: Crystal Dragon and Phoenix Cake]

246
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,750
You put dragon and phoenix in front

247
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,810
and crystal after.

248
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:47,680
It immediately creates

and Phoenix in Crystal Delight]

00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,050
a vivid picture in one's mind.

251
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,390
For the last dish,

252
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,110
I'll do it.

253
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,530
This scallion and vinegar chicken

254
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,270
is my lifelong favorite.

255
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,670
I'll give it a new name.

256

00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,940
what do you say?

265
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,910
I-I think it's quite good.

266
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,360
So, all this time,

267
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,910
you two pairs

268
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,720
have been teaming up to tease me,

Lu Lingfeng,

278
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,710
what I'm most concerned about now

279
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,870
is my so-called position

280
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,180
as Criminal Investigation Scholar.

281
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:02,790
It's not a
regular court official position.

282
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,390
Du Ming is refusing
to pay my monthly salary again.

283
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:08,120
Food is expensive in Chang'an.

284
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,320
What am I to do?

285
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,600
You have

286
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,550
that special fund

287
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:23,200
allocated for secret agents.

288
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,120
It must be substantial, right?

289
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,790
Though my scholar rank isn't high,

290
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,960
it was

291
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:32,320
appointed by the Princess.

292
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,000
His Majesty also approved it.

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
At the very least,

294
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,960
I should be treated
as a seventh-rank official, right?

295
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,320
That job of yours

296
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,240
as Yongzhou Prefecture's
Chief of Secret Agents...

297
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,500
I've done the work too.

298
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,850
You should give me
two monthly salaries, shouldn't you?

Dream on.

300
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,530
One salary is fine too,

301
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,790
but the amount can't be too small.

302
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:57,700
Tell me,

303
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,350

309

Can you add a little more?

310

00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,320
Which member of this family

313
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,100
actually needs your support?

314
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:20,630

316

As for Fei,

321
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,520
I'll take care of him

322
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,080
for life.

325
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,030
What do you need money for?

326
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,550
But I have Yingtao!

327
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,240

She's perfect as a secret agent.

I'm planning to hire her.

332
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,930
That's good.

That's good.

334
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,730
Then I'll help negotiate her salary.

Her monthly salary

336
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,870
can be less than mine

337
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,510
but not by too much.

338
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,800
Two thousand coins.

339
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,330
What's wrong?

340
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,960
Yingtao is worth this price.

The missions she'll be doing

342
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,080
are all very dangerous.

344
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,800

345
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,880
Thank you, Official Lu.

From now on, I, Yingtao,

will no longer be idle in Chang'an.

348
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,060
I'll have work to do

and a monthly salary.

350
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,060
W-Well,

351
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,200
she shouldn't earn more than me!

352
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,490
That's not fair.

353
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,230

Look at that.

368
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,200
I was also thinking

369
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,390
about going to the cosmetics shop,

370
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:04,000
but I was afraid you'd think I'm shallow.

00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,830
lip rouge, nail polish,

572
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:35,720
and huadian decorations of all shapes.

573
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,240
We've heard about

574
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,680
the Fairy Beauty Powder.

575
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,280
We came specifically for it.

576
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,140
The last batch is sold out.

577
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,570
New stock will be available in three days.

578
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:46,680
I've heard that the Fairy Beauty Powder

579
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,590
can remove spots and blemishes,

580
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,920
and enhance skin radiance.

581
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,000
Is it really that miraculous?

582
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,720
Yes, it is.

583
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,830
Could you

584
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,920
teach me how to make the Beauty Powder?

585
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,720
I'd like to try it myself at home.

586
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:06,810
You two, get out!

587
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:07,860
Please!

588
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,200
Chi Ying,

589
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:14,310
about what I mentioned last time,

590
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,710
have you made a decision?

591
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,520
Zhang Kuang!

592
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:16,820
I've already told you

593
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,680
[Owner of Zhang's Fish Shop, Zhang Kuang]

594
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,830
I won't sell my recipe.

595
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,160
What are you trying to do,

596
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,890
bringing these men here today?

597
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,160
This is Chang'an.

598
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
Don't tell me you're planning to rob me.

599
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,470
I know this is Chang'an,

600
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,290
where laws are respected.

601
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,880
That's why I had to come in person.

602
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,880
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Yes, yes, yes.

603
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,210
Recently, I bought a box

604
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,200
of the Fairy Beauty Powder from your shop.

605
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,920
I went home

606
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,450
and gave it to my wife to use.

607
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
We thought it would make her beautiful,

608
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,480
but after applying it,

609
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,140
her face broke out in pimples!

610
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:47,940
Tell me.

611
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,680
How will you compensate me?

612
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,480
You're lying.

613
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,590
Bring your wife to my shop,

614
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,850
so I can see for myself.

615
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,310
How cruel of you!

616
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:57,530
How can a woman

617
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,290
with a face full of pimples

618
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,030
casually go out in public?

619
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,300
How about this?

620
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,160
You two,

621
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,110
quickly write down

622
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,440
the recipe for the Fairy Powder

623
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,920
and I'll find someone to fix this myself.

624
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,880
In your dreams!

625
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,330
In my dreams.

626
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,030
Then I'll pay.

627
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,410
I'll give you...

628
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,350
50,000 coins.

629
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,570
I'll buy everything in your shop,

630
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,510
including,

631
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,440
of course, the recipe
for the Fairy Powder.

632
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,520
But my condition is

633
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,680
for you and your daughter
to take the money and leave.

634
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,810
Get out of Chang'an.

635
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,160
Fifty thousand coins?

636
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,860
Master, you're too merciful.

637
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,750
Yeah. You even refuse to earn the money.

638
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,030
As the shopkeeper,
why are you still hesitating?

639
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:35,760
Zhang Kuang!

640
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,070
As long as I, Chi Ying, am alive,

641
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,160
you won't succeed.

642
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,330
Aren't you just trying to
force her to sell the goods?

643
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,060
And who are you?

644
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,100
I'm someone who doesn't like you.

645
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,550
This is interesting.

646
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,310
Hit her.

647
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,380
-Yes!
-Yes!

648
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:02,940
[Meixiu Skincare Shop]

649
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,310
Master!

650
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:14,270
Chi Ying.

651
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,030
So you've hired someone
to guard your shop?

652
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,870
That's right.

653
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,330
I'm the one she hired to guard the shop.

654
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,020
-Master!
-Master!

655
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,200
It hurts!

656
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,200
This is not okay!

657
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,200
It's going to break!

658
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:31,920
Be gentle!

659
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:32,450
It's going to break!

660
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,550
In the capital of the Tang Empire
under the Five Mausoleums,

661
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,750
everyone is supposed to be kind
with great integrity.

662
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,440
How come there are people like you?

663
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,070
You're trying to blackmail them
because their business is good.

664
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:40,950
What kind of logic is that?

665
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,880
Aren't I just want the Fairy Powder

666
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,360
to be sold to more women?

667
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,770
I have good intentions.

668
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:47,510
You're talking nonsense!

669
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,420
You're just trying to blackmail us!

670
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,750
If you don't want your arms to be broken,

671
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,950
just get lost at once!

672
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,590
Get lost now!

673
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,310
I'm leaving!

674
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,240
I'm leaving now!

675
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,310
Master.

676
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,570
Loser!

677
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:01,870
Yes, yes, yes.

678
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,190
As a woman who can brawl,

679
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,130
do you dare to tell me your name?

680
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,440
Where do you live?

681
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,320
It's better not to tell you.

682
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,480
I'm doing this for your own good.

683
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,890
Otherwise,

684
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,960
you'll meet someone

685
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,490
whose temper is even worse.

686
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,050
Then your arms and legs might get broken,

687
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,440
and it'll be great pain.

688
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,110
Fine.

689
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:24,270
I'll be able to find you guys
sooner or later.

690
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:24,960
Just wait.

691
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,320
Let's go.

692
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:33,040
Let's go!

693
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,390
Let's go!

694
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,240
Get out of my way!

695
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:38,730
Step aside!

696
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,810
-Thank you.
-What are you looking at?

697
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,160
Let's go!

698
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Thank you both for your help.

699
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,220
Let's talk inside.

700
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:46,700
No need.

701
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,000
We're here to buy

702
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
the Fairy Beauty Powder.

703
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,720
Since you've mentioned it's out of stock,

704
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,450
then we'll come again in 3 days.

705
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,550
Take care, Ma'am.

706
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,110
If those thugs come again
to cause trouble,

707
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,310
you can go to the Yongzhou Prefecture

708
00:25:57,310 --> 00:25:58,920
to find Lu Lingfeng,
the Judicial Official.

709
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,310
He will definitely help you.

710
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:00,840
Let's go.

711
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,010
Ladies, my saviors!

712
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,920
Wu Yang.

713
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,260
The Beauty Powder!

714
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,400
The Fairy Beauty Powder

715
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,880
is indeed out of stock at the counter.

716
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,590
But I still have some for my personal use.

717
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,170
If you two don't mind...

718
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,270
Ladies,

719
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,440
these are gifts for you.

720
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,240
You don't need to pay.

721
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:17,830
Wu Yang.

722
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,100
You should have
let me say the last sentence.

723
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,720
Yes.

724
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,640
They're gifts for you two.
You don't need to pay.

725
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,570
This is not okay.

726
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:29,490
Let me pay.

727
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,110
I've heard it costs 100 monedas per box.

728
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:33,310
Here are 200 monedas.

729
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,590
Bye.

730
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,510
Thanks. Thanks.

731
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,720
It smells so good!

732
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,920
Please wait, ladies!

733
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,650
I really can't accept this money.

734
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,630
What's your name?

735
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,550
Wu Yang.

736
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,870
W-u, Wu.

737
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,860
Y-a-n-g, Yang.

738
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,740
What a beautiful name.

739
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,960
But you must

740
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,220
accept this money.

741
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:01,830
Yeah.

742
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,660
Otherwise,

743
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,480
how could we

744
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,340
buy stuff at your store next time?

745
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,170
Let's go.

746
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:10,880
Wait!

747
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,280
What's wrong?

748
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,000
Can I be friends with you two?

749
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,400
I don't have any friends.

750
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,730
-Of course.
-Of course.

751
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,480
Wu Yang.

752
00:27:27,750 --> 00:27:29,750
The comb on your bun is so beautiful.

753
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,240
Wu Yang.

754
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,990
May I ask you a question?

755
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,200
Where's your father?

756
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,440
I've never met my father.

757

Is your mother

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:46,450
usually very strict with you?

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,920
shall we go to the Qu River to have fun?

00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,720
Sure.

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,940
Go find her husband

942
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,000
and teach him a lesson severely.

943
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,440
Got it.

944
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,060
He's even intervening in this?

945
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,840
Lead the way.

946
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,840
In the vast world,

947
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
among all cities,

948
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,050
Chang'an is the most impressive.

949
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,460
It has a population of over a million.

950
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,070
There are 110 districts.

951
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,680
As the Judicial Official, my son

952
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,070
will be quite busy.

953
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,350
-Bad news!
-Bad news!

954
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,550
-Someone died!
-Someone died!

955
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,550
Someone died!

956
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,840
-Someone died!
-Someone died!

957
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,800
Someone fell into a well

958
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,730
and was drowned.

959
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,770
Where is it?

960
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,550
J-Just over there.

961
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,360
Lead the way!

962
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,400
Officer,

963
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,280
it's that well.

964
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,440
Those who are irrelevant
should step aside!

965
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,100
Step aside!

966
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,890
Step aside!

967
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:13,840
Step aside!

968
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:14,760
Let the officer take a look.

969
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,230
Jia!

970
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:16,040
Xue Huan!

971
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,190
Onlookers, stay 3 zhang away!

972
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:19,880
Step back!

973
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:29,480
Hurry!

974
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:31,760
The coroner is here.

975
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,890
The coroner is here.

976
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:35,320
The coroner is here.

977
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,410
Examine the corpse at once.

978
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:38,800
Yes.

979
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,530
How is it?

980
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:45,630
There are scrape marks

981
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,840
from bricks and stones on the face.

982
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:50,710
In the hair and under the fingernails,

983
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:51,480
there's mud and sand.

984
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,810
It indicates that he was drowned to death.

985
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,830
In terms of the states
of his hands and eyes,

986
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:59,110
if he had jumped into the well by himself,

987
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,920
his eyes would be closed
with clenched fists.

988
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,320
If he had accidentally
fallen into the well,

989
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,250
his eyes would be slightly open
with curled fingers.

990
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:10,190
But if he had been pushed into the well
by someone else,

991
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,000
his eyes would be slightly open
with curled fingers, too.

992
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,320
Unfortunately, there are so many
pedestrians coming and going here.

993
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,960
The scene has been badly ruined.

994
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,220
It can't be determined

995
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,480
whether the victim fell into it by himself

996
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,540
or was pushed into it by someone else.

997
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:23,930
What about the time of death?

998
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,760
It was after 11 PM.

999
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,400
The main streets
were under curfew late at night,

1000
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,360
but inside the district,

1001
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,820
people could move freely.

1002
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,520
He was still outside at 11 PM.

1003
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,480
I think he had spent time
at a restaurant for pleasure.

1004
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,240
Captain Xue!

1005
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:40,820
Mentor.

1006
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,190
From now on, in official occasions,

1007
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,390
don't call me Mentor.

1008
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,280
Yes.

1009
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,110
Official Lu, what can I do for you?

1010
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,710
Go investigate the restaurants
and music clubs

1011
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,110
inside the Shengye District.

1012
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:50,880
I've investigated them.

1013
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,140
Only one of them stayed open at midnight.

1014
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,690
Captain Xue, you got prepared in advance?

1015
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,840
After I took up the post of captain,

1016
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,000
this is my first day doing this job.

1017
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,360
How would I dare to be careless?

1018
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,840
I've asked someone
to tell the restaurant's owner,

1019
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,370
servants

1020
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:02,360
and pipa players

1021
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,670
to come here and identify the corpse.

1022
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:05,400
And I've ordered some men
to search the streets

1023
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,060
and check for missing people.

1024
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:10,670
Very good.

1025
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,400
Official Lu!

1026
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,510
I've brought the restaurant's owner here!

1027
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,230
I've brought Kuai Wu's wife here!

1028
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,800
This child is so pitiful.

1029
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,710
Honey!

1030
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,510
-Honey!
-Father!

1031
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,070
Father!

1032
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,190
How did you fall into the well?

1033
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,000
Father!

1034
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,800
Honey!

1035
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,900
[Chengfo Temple]

1036
00:38:35,130 --> 00:38:38,650
[Chengfo Temple]

1037
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,900
Why isn't Wu Yang here yet?

1038
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,440
We agreed to meet at 9 AM.

1039
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,030
It's almost 10 AM now,

1040
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,630
but there's still no sign of her.

1041
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:52,710
Amitabha.

1042
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:58,190
This must be Miss Xijun!

1043
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,450
Greetings, Buddhist Guangxiao.

1044
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,190
If I'm not mistaken,

1045
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,320
this must be...

1046
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,520
Madam Shiliu!

1047
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,710
Buddhist Guangxiao.

1048
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,090
You're still mistaken.

1049
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,290
I'm not Shiliu.

1050
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,210
I'm Yingtao.

1051
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,410
Madam Yingtao!

1052
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,320
It's been almost a year since we last met.

1053
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,150
Are you two
visiting the Chengfo Temple today

1054
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,280
to offer incense?

1055
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,710
How wonderful.

1056
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,150
Come on. Please come inside now.

1057
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,840
I'll accompany you personally.

1058
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,760
I'm sorry.

1059
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,000
We'll come again another day
to offer incense.

1060
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Today, we're going to
visit the Qu River with a friend.

1061
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,190
It turns out you're waiting for someone.

1062
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:38,760
Please make yourselves comfortable.

1063
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,890
Take your time to wait for your friend.

1064
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:45,850
[Chengfo Temple]

1065
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,070
Let's wait another 15 minutes.

1066
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:49,880
If she still doesn't come,

1067
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,670
I won't

1068
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,360
be friends with her anymore.

1069
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
Maybe her mother is strict with her

1070
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,800
and doesn't let her come out.

1071
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:58,880
Just be a little more patient.
