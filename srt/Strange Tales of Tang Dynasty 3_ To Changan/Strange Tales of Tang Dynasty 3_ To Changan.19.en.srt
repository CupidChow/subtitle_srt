00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,390
this is what you asked me.

193
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,630
Excuse me, sir,

194
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,700
is the dead woman inside Hongyao?

195
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,030
Yes.

196
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,790
And I immediately said

197
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:18,320
that I didn't know anything about

198
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,390
the madam of the Meng family.

199
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:22,200
I never said the woman in this portrait

200
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,140
was Hongyao, Meng's wife.

201
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,120
Official Lu,

202
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,290
he's not being honest.

203
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,050
That's easy.

204
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,240
Leave him to me.

205
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,670
No need to trouble you, ma'am.

206
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:40,800
I'll tell the truth.

207
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll tell the truth.

208
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:42,830
[With Mind and Heart Fully Devoted]

209
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,480
Yes.

210
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,240
I do know Hongyao,

211
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,120
but I didn't kill that woman.

212
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,840
Although I hired someone

213
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,910
to investigate her new lover,

214
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,530
I had no ill intentions.

215
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,360
Besides,

216
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,250
how could I bear to have her killed?

217
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,040
Who did you hire to investigate Hongyao?

218
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,620
Cat.

219
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:01,150
An expert in spying on

220
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,270
and tracking the secrets
of wealthy households.

221
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,080
Cat?

222
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,910
Do you know his real name?

223
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,590
Of course not.

224
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,320
When hiring people like him,

225
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,510
I understand the rules.

226
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,390
You can't ask for their real names.

227
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,150
Rules?

228
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,950
Who made all these rules?

229
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,440
Some rules can get people killed.

230
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,240
All right.

231
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,790
While Xijun is here,

232
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,720
have her sketch both Cat

233
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,440
and

234
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,390
the one who hired Hu Shentong.

235
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,080
You are the Chief of Secret Agents.

236
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,910
How do you think

237
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,170
we should investigate these two people?

238
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,550
These two people...

239
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,830
Wait a moment.

240
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,860
Wuming, Lu Lingfeng,

241
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,270
what Qian Zheng and Hu Shentong described

242
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,800
may seem vastly different,

243
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:09,050
but it's actually quite similar.

244
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,520
That can't be right.

245
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,670
These two people look

246
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,440
completely different,

247
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,960
with different bearings too.

248
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,080
And I think they're

249
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,750
more than 10 years apart in age.

250
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,300
Under different states of mind,

251
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,030
the same person

252
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,550
can present themselves differently.

253
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,790
But the most essential part of a portrait

254
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,320
is to capture the structure
around the eyes and brows.

255
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,120
Although I can't be completely certain,

256
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,910
I have a hunch

257
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,240
that Qian Zheng and Hu Shentong

258
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,790
saw the same person.

259
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,150
I suspect

260
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,230
the full beard is a disguise.

261
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,240
Xijun,

262
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,150
can you remove the disguise?

263
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,030
That's exactly what I was thinking.

264
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,120
I'll try to draw another one.

265
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,600
[Impartial] [Remonstrance]

266
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,260
Excellent.

267
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:42,600
Then, we'll trouble you, Xijun.

268
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,860
How long will you need?

269
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,300
Half an hour will do.

270
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,650
But I need to be

271
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,100
alone to draw quietly.

272
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,600
[Remonstrance]

273
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,870
Wuming, Lu Lingfeng.

274
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,340
Xijun,

275
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,040
you've met Secretary Meng?

276
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,000
A secretary?

277
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,120
Which secretary are you talking about?

278
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,640
The Sushan Shop is doing very well now.

279
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,540
Xijun has been extremely busy,

280
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,240
so of course, she hasn't met Meng Buyi.

281
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
Meng Buyi?

282
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,680
That's quite an interesting name.

283
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,690
Official Lu!

284
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,750
Official Lu, Mr. Su, Miss Xijun.

285
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,500
I'm useless.

286
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,890
I lost Meng Buyi

287
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,890
in the Ghost Market.

288
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,880
Did Miss Xijun draw this?

289
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,000
It's very accurate.

290
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,390
Why don't we use this portrait

291
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:53,320
to apprehend him?

292
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:53,870
-No!
-No!

293
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:57,320
[Remonstrance]

294
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,910
Have everyone look at this portrait

295
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,640
and secretly arrest Meng Buyi.

296
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,750
Meng Buyi,

297
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,390
you haven't come to my herb garden
for tea in a long time.

298
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:09,590
What's kept you away?

299
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,650
Zhang San, the man who sold lamb soup,

300
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,110
was found dead in my house.

301
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,460
Do you think...

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,460
he had some connection

303
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,790
with Hongyao?

304
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:23,440
Well... Hongyao wouldn't be

305
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,370
having an affair with Zhang San...

306
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,120
He... He was just a scoundrel.

307
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,390
If Hongyao were looking for a lover,

308
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,720
shouldn't she at least be more selective?

309
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,060
It's not right for you
to suspect Hongyao like this.

310
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,640
You're right.

311
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,950
I shouldn't have said that
in front of you.

312
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,960
After all, you two were once

313
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,510
a perfect match,

314
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,000
destined for each other.

315
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,240
Listen to how jealous you sound.

316
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,960
Back then, why didn't you...

317
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,360
You...

318
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,750
Why what?

319
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,240
When you received your appointment
back then,

320
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,370
you left overnight.

321
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:02,200
Why didn't you take Hongyao with you?

322
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:02,550
I...

323
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,920
was young back then,

324
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,150
worried that being distracted by romance

325
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,750
would affect my official career.

326
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,210
Now I do have some regrets.

327
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
She must have been

328
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,040
very heartbroken back then.

329
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,220
You regret it?

330
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,320
No wonder after you took office
in the capital,

331
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,150
Hongyao seemed like

332
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,390
a completely different person.

333
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,320
You two didn't

334
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,440
get back together behind my back, right?

335
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,040
Meng Buyi.

336
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,530
I don't think you came here for tea.

337
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:31,390
You suspect me, so you came here

338
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,590
to try to trick me into talking,
didn't you?

339
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,550
Not really.

340
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,980
It's just that Hongyao
suddenly disappeared.

341
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,280
I just wanted to know

342
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
if you're hiding her somewhere.

343
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:43,790
How could I possibly hide

344
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,920
another man's wife?

345
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,990
Besides, you and I are classmates.

346
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:47,840
What kind of person

347
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,640
do you take me, Yan Junxian, for?

348
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Alright, alright.

349
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,080
It's good that you're not.

350
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,540
It's good that you're not.

351
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,600
It's my fault.

352
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,750
You're not just at fault—

353
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,080
you're sick in the head!

354
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:58,960
Yes, yes.

355
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,610
I'm sick.

356
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,480
I...

357
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,440
I just have trouble sleeping.

358
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,720
After taking your herbs,

359
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,780
I feel much better.

360
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,750
Meng Buyi, oh, Meng Buyi.

361
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,390
No wonder Hongyao felt aggrieved

362
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,850
about having to marry you.

363
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,410
What... What did she say?

364
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,120
She blames you for deceiving her.

365
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,970
Your position as a secretary

366
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,550
isn't a real official post at all.

367
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:20,210
Why didn't you explain this clearly
to Hongyao?

368
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,840
Then how did she find out?

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,550
Secrets can't stay hidden forever.

370
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:26,630
You're just stubborn.

371
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:27,550
After passing the imperial examination

372
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,630
and waiting for the Ministry
of Personnel's selection test,

373
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,840
who doesn't give gifts
to the chief examiner?

374
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,240
You just had to act morally superior.

375
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,720
As a result, the chief examiner said

376
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,840
that your "speech" component
in the four evaluation criteria

377
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,030
didn't meet the requirements
for clear articulation,

378
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:41,360
so they gave you
a mere secretary position.

379
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:41,960
Yes.

380
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,970
But there's still a chance.

381
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,240
After His Majesty ascended the throne,

382
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,520
he reorganized the Ministry of Personnel.

383
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,850
You're being too naive.

384
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,720
Your options now are either

385
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,780
to attach yourself

386
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,390
to a high-ranking official—

387
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:57,030
ideally directly to the Princess,

388
00:15:57,030 --> 00:15:58,290
who can recommend you—

389
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:58,870
or

390
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,030
to take the corresponding examination.

391
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,720
But this time,

392
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,870
you must give gifts to the chief examiner

393
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:06,070
to be promoted to an official position.

394
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:06,850
Otherwise,

395
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
you can remain a lowly clerk forever,

396
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,550
and never expect Hongyao

397
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,410
to respect you.

398
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Hongyao really isn't here with you?

399
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,440
She's not!

400
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,950
Keep running!

401
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:39,980
W-Why should I run?

402
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:42,080
In the Ghost Market,

403
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,970
didn't you run pretty fast?

404
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,630
That's because they were trying
to kill me.

405
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,910
But after I saved you,

406
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,460
you ran even faster.

407
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,720
You're not a criminal.

408
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,550
Y-You're from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

409
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:55,150
Seize him.

410
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,060
Why are you treating me like this?

411
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,250
Official Lu.

412
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Meng Buyi is here.

413
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,600
He's the one who hired me!

414
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,580
Well, well!

415
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Tell me,

416
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,430
why did you hire this

417
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,200
whatever-his-name-is

418
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,260
to assassinate me?

419
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,090
Because I want you dead!

420
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,920
You seduced my wife, Hongyao.

421
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,510
-Shouldn't I kill you?
-Wait, wait!

422
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,030
How did you know

423
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,230
about me and Hongyao?

424
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,920
Qian Zheng,

425
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:45,440
didn't you hire a household spy

426
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,880
to investigate Hongyao?

427
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:47,750
Yeah.

428
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,790
Someone called Cat, right?

429
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,510
Yeah.

430
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Take a closer look

431
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:57,970
at his face.

432
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,670
Step back!

433
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,240
Come here!

434
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,600
You are Cat?

435
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,440
It's me.

436
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,790
Do you have proof?

437
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,640
Tell me,

438
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,110
w-w-where...

439
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,590
does she live?

440
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:20,770
It was you!

441
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,790
You disguised yourself

442
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,070
as that household spy!

443
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,960
What rotten luck for me—

444
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,270
I actually hired you to...
to snoop on Hongyao!

445
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,790
Now you know you're unlucky?

446
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:29,710
What about when you seduced my wife,

447
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,570
Hongyao?

448
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:33,480
You deserve your misfortune!
You deserve to die!

449
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,550
What about your wife?

450
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,640
Now I'm also a victim of Hongyao's...

451
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,550
Hongyao's infidelity.

452
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,070
I'm a victim too.

453
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,270
Shut your mouth!

454
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,310
You slap me!

455
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,790
You don't reflect on yourself,

456
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:46,790
yet you slap me?

457
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,940
You married Hongyao,

458
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,350
but have you ever cared about her?

459
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,160
You've never even taken her

460
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,560
around Chang'an.

461
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,180
Meng Buyi, that man,

462
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,510
doesn't even give Hongyao money to spend!

463
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,420
She is so beautiful.

464
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,110
Shouldn't she have

465
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,790
the finest jewelry and clothes

466
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,380
to match her beauty?

467
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,030
Yet you slap me!

468
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,040
Hu Shentong,

469
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:06,440
don't you claim to be

470
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,920
the top assassin of the Ghost Market?

471
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,000
You took my deposit.

472
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,200
Why is he still alive?

473
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,170
Let me be more specific.

474
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,640
I, Hu Shentong,

475
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,490
am Chang'an Ghost Market's

476
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,770
top assassin at bargain prices!

477
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,990
Nothing good comes cheap!

478
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,070
You hired me,

479
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,200
and that's just your bad luck!

480
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,160
Bad luck indeed!

481
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,640
Enough. Take them both away.

482
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,880
Wait!

483
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,440
-He just slapped me, and that's it?
-Move!

484
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:30,830
Move!

485
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,720
Why am I so unlucky?

486
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,550
Meng Buyi, oh, Meng Buyi.

487
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,480
You're a secretary
in the Ministry of Revenue,

488
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,310
responsible for handling
household registrations, land allocation,

489
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,880
and taxation matters.

490
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,790
You also need to assist
your senior officials

491
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,950
in making relevant decisions.

492
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,060
Though not a formal official,

493
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,750
you must be quite busy.

494
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,310
I admire that you can still find time

495
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,640
to write strange tales.

496
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,960
And you even work as a household spy.

497
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,920
Can you manage all that?

498
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,270
Busy indeed,

499
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,640
but I manage.

500
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,750
Just need to sleep less.

501
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,820
Meng Buyi.

502
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,720
You, as a clerk of
the Ministry of Revenue,

503
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,000
hired an assassin to kill someone—

504
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,330
do you admit your guilt?

505
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,240
Official Lu,

506
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,320
though I hired an assassin,

507
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,920
the murder was unsuccessful.

508
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,590
Surely, I deserve a lighter sentence.

509
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:29,990
Besides, my wife is still

510
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,650
nowhere to be found, dead or alive.

511
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,980
And you brought me here.

512
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,270
Why... Why are you interrogating me?

513
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:36,680
Secretary Meng,

514
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,250
just now in court,

515
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,790
you brawled with a witness.

516
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,650
I could have you beaten with rods
right now for that.

517
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,870
Meng Buyi,

518
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,070
since you might

519
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,830
hire an assassin to kill Qian Zheng,

520
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,550
you could also have hired other assassins

521
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,480
to kill Hongyao.

522
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,590
You might have

523
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,000
even killed

524
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,730
your own wife

525
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,270
and hidden her body,

526
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:55,800
claiming she disappeared!

527
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,030
Is that true or not?

528
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,230
Confess truthfully!

529
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,540
Lu Lingfeng, Su Wuming,

530
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:07,160
you two once

531
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,400
solved the mysterious Cantian Tower case,

532
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,510
which was a remarkable achievement,

533
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,160
and captured the Demon Lord
at Chengfo Temple,

534
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,960
making you renowned throughout Chang'an.

535
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,470
Is this... all you can do?

536
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,350
Letting a mere boy

537
00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:19,350
ramble on without evidence

538
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,480
in this court?

539
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,100
This is ridiculous.

540
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,120
You...

541
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,080
Captain Xue,

542
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,150
you're speaking out of turn.

543
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,670
Secretary Meng, may I ask

544
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,450
what you were doing last night?

545
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,690
On night duty at the ministry office.

546
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,790
But a house-squatter

547
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:38,830
saw you return home,

548
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,440
climbing over the wall.

549
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,840
I did no such thing.

550
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:47,240
Shall we summon the witness
to confront you here and now?

551
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,770
Bring them in.

552
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,360
Is your witness

553
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,480
this white-haired

554
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:00,870
little thief?

555
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,730
Was the hair on my bed

556
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:03,820
also his?

557
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,400
And what's this "house-squatter" nonsense?

558
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,720
I think he's just a thief!

559
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,380
You actually believe a thief?

560
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,970
I'm not a thief.

561
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,240
I really saw you jump over the wall.

562
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,500
I was that close to you.

563
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,340
You left through the door.

564
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,550
You were carrying a stack of papers.

565
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:19,160
Shut up!

566
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:23,200
I was on night duty

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:22,960
If I had known,

755
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,420
I wouldn't have needed
this treasure at all.

756
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,390
Enough.

757
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,480
There are so many customers outside.

758
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,450
Go back to work.

759
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,320
Su Wuming,

760
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,400
you're just using me
and then tossing me aside.

761
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,950
Being a boss is too restrictive.

762
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,720
How about

763
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,810
you manage the business for one day

764
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,570
while I enjoy a good drink?

765
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,160
Just... Just one day.

766
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:45,780
No.

767
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,730
You have time to read your book,
yet you won't help me!

768
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,660
I have a feeling

769
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,980
that the clues to
solve this mysterious case

770
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,470
are hidden in the Strange Tales.

771
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,590
Alright, go back to work.

772
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:01,590
Don't disturb me.

773
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,070
Unmatched in all of Chang'an...

774
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,880
Alright, alright.

775
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
You're unmatched, unmatched.

776
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:08,880
Listen,

777
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,800
if you find anyone else
who boasts like him,

778
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:13,620
bring them to me.

779
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,440
Even without the Sobering Orb,

780
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,480
I've never gotten drunk
anywhere in the Tang Empire.

781
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,680
Have you forgotten what happened
in Yunding County?

782
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,580
You got drunk,

783
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,720
were kidnapped,

784
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,270
soaked in a pool of wine,

785
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,440
and nearly drowned?

786
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,440
That was because I was tricked
by those villains.

787
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,700
That doesn't count. That doesn't count.

788
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:31,590
Boss,

789
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:34,210
another serving
of red bean sushan, please!

790
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:45,360
Why is he so full of himself?

791
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,830
Who does he think he is?

792
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,590
Who knows?

793
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:57,400
Mr. Yan

794
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,380
sure treats that servant well.

795
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,640
He gives him the same food
and drink as himself

796
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,110
and never makes him work.

797
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,870
Treats him like a lord.

798
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,370
All day, he just sits in the sun,

799
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,030
chewing mint leaves.

800
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,130
I even saw Mr. Yan

801
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,680
washing mint leaves for Ming Shi himself.

802
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,740
If I had his master,

803
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,510
I'd be happy to be a servant too.

804
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,440
Who wouldn't?

805
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:26,740
Hongyao?

806
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:29,680
Hongyao!

807
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,770
Hongyao!

808
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:50,920
Master,

809
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:52,540
did you

810
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,810
take Hongyao away?

811
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,680
You really can't let go of that woman.

812
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,480
Have you forgotten—seven years ago,

813
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,720
it was I who stopped you from
being with her

814
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,330
all the time

815
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,240
and forced you to study hard,

816
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,830
and that's how you passed
the imperial examination?

817
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:07,870
Otherwise,

818
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,400
you'd still be in the mountains
of Lingnan,

819
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,070
worth nothing.

820
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,820
Even if I had married Hongyao,

821
00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:17,630
it wouldn't have affected my...

822
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,820
your political career.

823
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,590
Shut up.

824
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,990
Forget about that woman.

825
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,210
Now you need to

826
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,090
focus on growing gastrodia for me.

827
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,350
It's the Emperor's

828
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:31,240
favorite tonic these days.

829
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,000
And you...

830
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,470
you're already lucky enough.

831
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,480
As an eighth-rank official,

832
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,110
you're allowed to wear the crimson robe

833
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,350
and are treated as a fifth-rank official,

834
00:31:39,350 --> 00:31:40,640
even above your superior,
the Chief Imperial Physician

835
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,070
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

836
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,920
All of this is

837
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,070
the result of my careful planning.

838
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,190
Instead of being grateful...

839
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,070
you come to question me?

840
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,480
Master,

841
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,930
I'm begging you.

842
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,750
Hongyao won't hinder my career.

843
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,280
I will do my utmost to become

844
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,070
the Chief Minister
of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices.

845
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,200
That won't suffice.

846
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,270
I want you to climb

847
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,550
step by step—

848
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,270
until you reach the Chancellor position
for me.

849
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,480
By then,

850
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:13,070
I—

851
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:15,270
a mere herbal merchant with no right

852
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,800
to take the imperial exams—

853
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,070
will become

854
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:22,000
the shadow ruler of Chang'an.

855
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,100
Okay, okay.

856
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:32,040
You can be the shadow ruler,

857
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:33,860
but tell me where Hongyao is.

858
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,480
It must be that Meng Buyi came,

859
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,640
and you feared being exposed,

860
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,030
so you made her
move elsewhere, didn't you?

861
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,690
This is none of your business.

862
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:41,270
Forget about Hongyao

863
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,410
and focus on your official duties.

864
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,010
Don't let my painstaking efforts
go to waste.

865
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,660
Ming Shi, you've gone too far!

866
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,790
I, Yan Junxian, have my limits too!

867
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,510
[Ming Shi, House Servant]

868
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:54,780
[Ming Shi, Herbal Merchant]

869
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:58,830
You dare to lose your temper with me?

870
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,810
And you call yourself "Yan Junxian"?

871
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
Have you forgotten

872
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,070
your real name?

873
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,030
Moorhen!

874
00:33:10,830 --> 00:33:11,890
What are you doing?

875
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,590
Mr. Yan,

876
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,830
this man dared to disrespect you.

877
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,880
We'll teach him a lesson for you.

878
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,210
Beat him! Beat him hard!

879
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,050
Enough. Stop beating him.

880
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,680
Don't think that being a house servant

881
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,830
gives you the right to disrespect Mr. Yan.

882
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,720
As a servant, if you forget
your place again,

883
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,580
we'll teach you a lesson anytime!

884
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:36,680
You may go now.

885
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,580
Go back to work.

886
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:38,830
Mr. Yan.

887
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:40,890
-Go!
-Let's go.

888
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:48,070
Master.

889
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,640
I couldn't stop them just now.

890
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,900
-Otherwise, they would've...
-Shut up.

891
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:55,000
Please calm down, Master.

892
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:55,680
Lately,

893
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,590
I keep thinking about our days in Lingnan.

894
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,920
Before you told me to study

895
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,160
[Yan Junxian, Deputy Chief
Imperial Physician]

896
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,300
and prepare for the imperial examinations,

897
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,200
[And Herb Garden Supervisor]

898
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,710
although I was just your servant,

899
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,880
[Original Name: Moorhen;
Ming Shi's House Servant]

900
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,750
back then,

901
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,840
life was truly carefree...

902
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,030
You think I enjoy dealing with

903
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,690
those arrogant northerners?

904
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:12,070
I can't even get fresh lychees here.

905
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,370
Why don't we go back?

906
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,969
Like Zhang Han of the Western Jin,

907
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,710
who longed for home delicacies

908
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:20,239
when the autumn winds rose.

909
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:21,880
Well, look at you,

910
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:24,550
even knowing a literary reference.

911
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,110
Next, you'll say

912
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,480
you want me to let you marry Hongyao,

913
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,360
then have children

914
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,090
and enjoy family bliss, right?

915
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,070
Dream on!

916
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,760
Mr. Yan!

917
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,710
Officials from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office have come.

918
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:39,570
The Yongzhou Prefecture Office?

919
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:41,600
Why did they come to my herb garden?

920
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,710
Secretary Meng, aren't you  supposed to be
on night duty?

921
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,550
It's still so early.

922
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:45,880
Why are you here already?

923
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,080
I had nowhere else to go, so I came early.

924
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,219
Where's the senior clerk?

925
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,000
In the afternoon,

926
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,070
officials from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office came.

927
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,550
Officials from
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office came?

928
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,320
For what?

929
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:00,590
They invited the senior clerk for drinks.

930
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,960
They were actually quite polite.

931
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,670
I even overheard them

932
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,960
saying something like,

933
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,620
"Sushan goes well with wine."

934
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:18,830
The one above.

935
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,940
Finally, we bought it.

936
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,860
I'll try it when I get back.

937
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,530
Okay, okay.

938
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,390
Lu, please sit.

939
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,280
Have some tea.

940
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,310
No need for tea.

941
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:38,920
I'm here

942
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,650
to show you a painting.

943
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,140
A painting?

944
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,480
Who painted this portrait of me?

945
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,320
I did.

946
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,010
But miss, we've never met before.

947
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,670
I haven't seen you in person,

948
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:54,870
but someone else has.

949
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,500
I painted this based on

950
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,920
that person's description.

951
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,320
Who?

952
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,220
As for that person's name,

953
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,170
I'm not at liberty to reveal it.

954
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,390
However, Official Lu certainly knows.

955
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,760
This matter involves a murder case.

956
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,960
I must ask you to cooperate

957
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,360
and answer my questions truthfully,

958
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,820
without any concealment.

959
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:18,760
If you feel uncomfortable here

960
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,960
or have any concerns,

961
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,800
you can come with me to
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

962
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,000
But before that,

963
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,070
I'll need your men to cooperate with mine

964
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,000
to thoroughly search the herb garden

965
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,230
and your residence.

966
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,420
-Greetings, Deputy Chief Physician Yan!
-Greetings, Deputy Chief Physician Yan!

967
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:41,630
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

968
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,430
-Stop.
-Stop.

969
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,580
Step aside.

970
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,840
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

971
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,170
Who's beating the drum?

972
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,940
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

973
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,840
Official Lu.

974
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,280
What's your suggestion?

975
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,360
You're asking me?

976
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,760
You're a skilled artist,

977
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,510
and you've been observing

978
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:26,070
both Yan Junxian and Meng Buyi.

979
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,710
You must have noticed quite a bit

980
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,920
from their expressions.

981
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,230
So,

982
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,960
I'm asking for your advice.

983
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,360
It's just my intuition.

984
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,320
I think they both seem guilty
of something.

985
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,760
Since they're old acquaintances

986
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,230
and involved with the same woman...

987
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,430
why not try questioning them together?

988
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,590
We're thinking alike.

989
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,690
You don't really need my advice.

990
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,630
You saw I was exhausted at the shop

991
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,550
and found an excuse

992
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,010
to give me a day off, right?

993
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,370
That's not true.

994
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,710
Without your artistic skills,

995
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:57,510
how could I have tracked down

996
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:58,440
Yan Junxian?

997
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,090
Xijun, you are

998
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:07,280
crucial to me—

999
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:11,160
not just in assisting me
with solving mysterious cases.

1000
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,560
I admit it.

1001
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,800
Last night...

1002
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,340
I went home.

1003
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,480
But we have

1004
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,230
already sent people
to the Ministry of Revenue.

1005
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,830
The senior clerk can testify

1006
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,710
that you were on night duty all night

1007
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,800
and never left.

1008
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,800
He kept pestering me last night,

1009
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,150
telling me some story about snake spirits.

1010
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,470
It was complete nonsense

1011
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:33,400
and extremely boring.

1012
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,030
I didn't want to listen,

1013
00:38:34,030 --> 00:38:35,710
so I opened a jar of wine for him.

1014
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:37,150
That senior clerk couldn't
hold his liquor.

1015
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,030
He passed out after just two bowls

1016
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,090
and slept for most of the night.

1017
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,630
I took that opportunity

1018
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,360
to go home.

1019
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,280
Because I needed a lot of paper

1020
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
to continue writing the strange tales,

1021
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,590
and using the ministry's paper

1022
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,050
wouldn't be appropriate.

1023
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,610
Ever since Yan Junxian

1024
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,920
returned to the capital for his post,

1025
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,760
Hongyao and I haven't been getting along.

1026
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:21,360
So,

1027
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,040
I've always suspected him.

1028
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,400
After I entered the courtyard,

1029
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,710
I saw candles lit in the room.

1030
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:27,820
So I went up and pounded hard on the door.

1031
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,680
I just wanted to give them a scare.

1032
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,320
Hongyao,

1033
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,430
open the door!

1034
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,400
Who is it?

1035
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,280
Me!

1036
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:36,600
Open up quickly!

1037
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,160
Coming, coming!

1038
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,880
Weren't you supposed to be
on night duty tonight?

1039
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,250
Why are you back so soon?

1040
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,760
Why are you looking around?

1041
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,890
Did you come back to catch me cheating?

1042
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,590
Let...

1043
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,280
Let me ask you!

1044
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:57,250
I should be the one asking you!

1045
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,590
You told me you held a position
at the Ministry of Revenue,

1046
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:00,630
but a secretary is just

1047
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,840
a minor clerk.

1048
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:04,960
There are 50 or 60 of you
in the ministry alone!

1049
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,880
Not only is the position lowly,

1050
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,320
it doesn't even qualify
as a proper official rank!

1051
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,070
How much longer do you plan to
keep lying to me?

1052
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,130
Who's lying to you?

1053
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,510
Though the secretary position is minor...

1054
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,230
it carries significant responsibilities!

1055
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,510
It's still a ninth-rank position!

1056
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:17,280
Come on,

1057
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,280
how can an unranked position

1058
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,210
compare to a proper official rank?

1059
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:20,670
I...

1060
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,880
You've been in the secretary position
for seven years.

1061
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,000
If you ever thought of me,

1062
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,710
you wouldn't spend every day

1063
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:25,590
writing those strange tales

1064
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,920
instead of trying to advance yourself!

1065
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,630
Divorce me!

1066
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,410
What did you say?

1067
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,440
Divorce me!

1068
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,760
Divorce you

1069
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,660
just so you can get back with Yan Junxian?

1070
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,610
Not a chance!

1071
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,450
Though I didn't confront them directly,

1072
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:52,760
you, Yan Junxian,

1073
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,480
were hiding in my house at that time.

1074
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:57,750
Tell me, where exactly were you hiding?

1075
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,280
I...

1076
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,260
Well...

1077
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,620
Meng Buyi,

1078
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,070
you claim your wife has been unfaithful.

1079
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,270
Do you have evidence?

1080
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:05,640
Yes, I do.

1081
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,400
When I entered the room,

1082
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,440
I saw a pair of

1083
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,370
brown boots

1084
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:10,590
hidden under the bed!

1085
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:12,030
I saw them as clear as day!

1086
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:13,630
These very boots!

1087
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
Official Lu, I...

1088
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:17,800
Meng Buyi,

1089
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,910
do you have anything else to say?

1090
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,320
I... I...

1091
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,030
Nothing for now.

1092
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,860
Deputy Chief Physician Yan,
it's your turn.

1093
00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:32,470
Since someone drew my portrait...

1094
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,070
Hold on!

1095
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:35,920
Official Lu,

1096
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,880
what do you mean by this?

1097
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,360
You address him respectfully as
"Deputy Chief Physician Yan,"

1098
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,960
but call me directly by name?

1099
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,480
What are you two playing at?

1100
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Officials covering for each other?

1101
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,480
I am

1102
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,960
the current Yongzhou Judicial Official.

1103
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:54,630
Although I can't wear
the light crimson official robes,

1104
00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:56,590
I have no need to curry favor with him.

1105
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,190
After all,

1106
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:58,960
I was

1107
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,760
the former General
of the Right Imperial Guards

1108
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,440
and former Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court...

1109
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:02,840
But...

1110
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,480
But you make a valid point.

1111
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:07,230
I spoke inappropriately earlier.

1112
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,440
From now on,

1113
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:11,130
I shall address both of you directly
by name.

1114
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,440
Yan Junxian,

1115
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,360
Meng Buyi suspects

1116
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,560
you were in his home last night.

1117
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,420
What do you say?

1118
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,180
Think carefully before you speak,

1119
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:18,710
because everything you say

1120
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,020
will be recorded in the court ledger.

1121
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,510
Since someone drew my portrait,

1122
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,800
someone must have seen me

1123
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,110
entering and leaving the Meng Residence.

1124
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:30,670
Besides,

1125
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,760
I didn't do anything

1126
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,700
shameful.

1127
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,150
Why shouldn't I admit it?

1128
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,720
Curse you, Yan Junxian.

1129
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,150
You met my wife secretly

1130
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:39,590
while I was on night duty!

1131
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,280
So what if I went to your house?

1132
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,450
So what if I met with Hongyao?

1133
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,910
She was mine to begin with!

1134
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:45,190
How dare you act so disrespectfully

1135
00:42:45,190 --> 00:42:45,920
in court!
