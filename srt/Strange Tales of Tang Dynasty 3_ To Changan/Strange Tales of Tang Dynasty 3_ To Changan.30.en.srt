[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,979
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:39,759
I heard

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,600
she later remarried a merchant,

5
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,780
who is said to be

6
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,200
one of the biggest merchants in Chang'an.

7
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,150
Could it be He Bi?

8
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:51,420
He Bi also serves
as the president of An Society.

9
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,120
The status matches.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,400
But she has moved back
to her parents' home.

11
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,920
They couldn't have divorced, could they?

12
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,790
I'm not sure about that.

13
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:03,310
However,

14
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,950
tomorrow I can visit the Wei Mansion again

15
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,550
to gather more information.

16
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,919
Strictly speaking,

17
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,639
we shouldn't be prying,

18
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,310
but I have a feeling

19
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,640
it's related to our case.

20
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,170
Thank you, then.

21
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,280
Also,

22
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,520
I went to the south of the city today.

23
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,640
I remember you told me

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,490
your family has a villa there.

25
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,910
Is it rented out?

26
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,360
No.

27
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,040
Do you remember Little Yang Ji?

28
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:31,120
I had him stay there to study

29
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,840
and look after the place.

30
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,520
Sometimes he grows vegetables in the yard.

31
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,720
He sent over two large baskets
just yesterday.

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,910
Yang Ji?

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:40,850
Just tell him

34
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,290
a tall, handsome gentleman

35
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,890
gave you a delivery fee

36
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,720
and asked you to deliver it.

37
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,160
You need that villa?

38
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,000
Not exactly.

39
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,520
But I might need to borrow
the person there.

40
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,120
Greetings, Official Lu.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,520
It's unbelievable.

42
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,420
You've grown so tall.

43
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,310
[Yang Ji]

44
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:08,110
Miss Xijun left the entire villa

45
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,190
in my care.

46
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,280
There's plenty of food,

47
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,630
and I can sell the vegetables for extra.

48
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,360
That's why I've grown so strong

49
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:16,150
so quickly.

50
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,260
If I ever go to war,

51
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,560
would you like to come with me?

52
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,240
Yes!

53
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,079
As long as Miss Xijun agrees,

54
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:23,480
I'll go with you anytime.

55
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,000
You mentioned you had a task for me.

56
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,150
It's not going to
the House of Sorrow again, is it?

57
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,630
I'm grown up now.

58
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,680
Going to such places

59
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,000
and dealing with women...

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,130
It's not the House of Sorrow this time.

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,050
There's a larger villa

62
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,360
about 100 zhang from here.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,470
It's being expanded. Do you know about it?

64
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,530
It's An Society's. Who doesn't know?

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,590
They're loaded.

66
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,840
Do you know

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,290
anyone who works there?

68
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,700
I can't be bothered

69
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,280
with An Society's lackeys.

70
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,310
But I do know

71
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,550
the laborers there.

72
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,230
I always send the vegetables

73
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,820
I can't sell or eat to them.

74
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,040
That's perfect.

75
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,630
When you deliver veggies tomorrow,

76
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,960
pick the freshest ones.

77
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,700
And while you're there,

78
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,840
gather some information for me.

79
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,520
Okay.

80
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:11,320
[Mortuary of Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

81
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,190
Senior.

82
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,920
Lingfeng.

83
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,510
No need for explanations between us.

84
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,270
Old guy.

85
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,920
So you really are
hiding in the Earth God Temple.

86
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,580
Let's see where you can go now.

87
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,360
Old guy, I can see you.

88
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,310
Come out, old guy!

89
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:48,670
Didn't expect this, did you?

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,800
That's what they call
"while the priest climbs a foot"

91
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,390
"the devil climbs ten."

92
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,930
Who are you? State your name!

93
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,680
I am the Chicken Master of Tang,

94

95

I'm your Grandpa Fei!

96
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,240
Such a nobody!

97
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,320
How dare you act senior before me?

98
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,390
I've been in the Ghost Market for decades.

99
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,830
How come I've never seen you?

100
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,800
That's because you're too young.

101
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,270
During those decades
you were in the Ghost Market,

102
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,710
I was running my cane shop up

103
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:17,840
above,

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,820
too busy to come down.

105
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,990
Enough talk!

106
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,800
You're...

107
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,410
with the county office, aren't you?

108
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,560
You want to hold me accountable?

109
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,810
You're still too green.

110
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,430
See this?

111
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,540
This is Fengli cane.

112
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:36,700
If I point it at you,

113
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,870
you'll vanish into dust.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,260
I don't believe a word!

115
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,240
You don't believe me? Let's try it.

116
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,360
Point!

117
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,530
One more time!

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,160
Looks like you're the one
vanishing into dust.

119
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,470
This was soaked in Fengli beast's urine,

120
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:05,130
but it's completely useless.

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,510
I'll hit you to death!

122
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,400
Lady!

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,200
Keep running and you'll lose your head!

124
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:23,870
I won't run! I won't run!

125
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,730
I won't run.

126
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:26,630
Put Mr. Fei down now!

127
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,210
In the past three days,

128
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,920
we found one body each in

129
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:33,010
Xingdao District, Shanhe District,

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,120
Chonghua District, Da'an District,
Anren District,

131
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,480
and Anyi District.

132
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,669
Their identities have been confirmed—

133
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:43,440
missing merchants from earlier cases.

134
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,600
Together with Hua Fu,

135
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,200
Ma Kui, and He Qian,

136
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,510
there are nine bodies in total.

137
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,040
I've brought them all back.

138
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,030
Tell me what you found
from examining the bodies first.

139
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,210
Except for Ma Kui and He Qian,

140
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,390
who died in unusual ways,

141
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,940
the other 7 were all killed

142
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,630
by a heavy blow to the back of the head.

143
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,120
Also,

144
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:08,270
all bodies found in Chang'an County

145
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,270
were struck

146
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,930
twice,

147
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
and for each body,

148
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,000
one of the strikes
was from something very sharp.

149
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,600
But the bodies found in Wannian County

150
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,080
were hit by a relatively flat,

151
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,290
heavy object—

152
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,030
killed with a single blow.

153
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,870
Clearly,

154
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,420
the killer used greater force.

155
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,210
I've found something too.

156
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,260
It's about Jinguang Society.

157
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,790
Lu Lingfeng! Su Wuming!

158
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,200
Come get your delivery!

159
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,000
Hurry up!

160
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Hurry!

161
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,000
Hurry up!

162
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,750
Fei!

163
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,590
What are you doing?

164
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:51,390
This old man is over 100 years old.

165
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,720
He's a rare centenarian in Chang'an.

166
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,480
How can you treat him like this?

167
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,040
Untie him.

168
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,550
Hurry!

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,530
Alright!

170
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,960
He may be
over a hundred years younger than me,

171
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,420
but if it were one‑on‑one,

172
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,920
I'd definitely beat him.

173
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,150
Bring the hemp rope!

174
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:27,750
Fei! Sit down.

175
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,600
What a pity.

176
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:34,160
That beautiful but wicked lady

177
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,840
turns out to be his accomplice.

178
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,300
Who are you talking about?

179
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,370
You are beautiful.

180
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:45,610
See? This old guy

181
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,730
has been brought to the county office,

182
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,790
yet he still dares to harass Yingtao.

183
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:55,910
This man has confessed.

184
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,230
Six months ago,

185
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,200
he sold

186
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,620
a Fengli beast to a woman.

187
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,720
You'll need to draw a portrait of her

188
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,180
based on his description.

189
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:04,630
Alright.

190
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,180
Describe that woman's appearance
truthfully.

191
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,510
If you dare play tricks,

192
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,080
my dagger...

193
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,740
will fly out at any moment!

194
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,810
It would be spinning in circles

195
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,630
and aimed straight at your head!

196
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,960
No, no, no! Don't!

197
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,990
I'll talk. I'll talk.

198
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,080
I never expected this.

199
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:37,660
That little beggar Yang Ji

200
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,790
turned out to be so useful.

201
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:43,320
I was intending
to disguise myself as a laborer

202
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,630
to infiltrate the Jinguang Society,

203
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,790
but I feared
being exposed and alerting them.

204
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:49,000
So I sent Yang Ji instead.

205
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,480
And now,

206
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,670
the picture is getting clearer.

207
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,390
It's just that…

208
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,200
Let me say it for you.

209
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,790
It's just that the truth

210
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:04,080
is heading toward

211
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,200
the last place we want it to.

212
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,080
Wuming, Lu Lingfeng.

213
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:14,870
Xijun.

214
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,930
You finished that fast?

215
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,840
No need to draw.

216
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,410
I already know who it is.

217
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:21,970
Lu Lingfeng,

218
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,230
you saw her a few days ago—

219
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,320
it's Juniang.

220
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,880
I just remembered something too.

221
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,390
That day I went to Wei Mansion

222
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:33,510
with Xijun,

223
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,720
I smelled

224
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,150
a very distinct fragrance.

225
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,320
When I asked,

226
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,780
my female disciple,

227
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,750
Juniang,

228
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:42,900
said it was just ordinary sandalwood.

229
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,080
But it didn't

230
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,510
smell ordinary at all.

231
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,320
Now that I think about it,

232
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,320
it must've been sandalwood

233
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,910
mixed with the scent

234
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,440
of Fengli fluid from afar.

235
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,140
Official Lu! Mr. Su!

236
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,960
Sheriff Du from Wannian is here.

237
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,910
Du Yu?

238
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:16,190
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

239
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,020
Sheriff Du.

240
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:18,790
We all work for the county office.

241
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:21,320
Why didn't you come directly
to the west hall?

242
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,290
I came too early.

243
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,420
I was afraid of disturbing your rest.

244
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,360
Besides,

245
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,120
I came to deliver invitations today.

246
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,260
It seems more proper to do it here.

247
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:29,960
Here.

248
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,000
Tonight I'll prepare
a modest dinner at my humble home.

249
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I sincerely hope

250
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
you'll honor us with your presence.

251
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,870
To view the Du family's
merit-record pillar?

252
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,910
An ancestral treasure

253
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,150
has been unearthed in your family too?

254
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,960
Congratulations!

255
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,480
But my background…

256
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,850
It doesn't matter.

257
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,120
I'm not like that Wei

258
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
from Chang'an County.

259
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:57,870
Today I invited

260
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,270
only my friends I value highly.

261
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,330
It has nothing to do

262
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,840
with background.

263
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,150
Lu, of course,

264
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,510
I've admired you for years.

265
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,850
And Su, you recently discovered

266
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,960
several bodies in Wannian County.

267
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,840
I feel both ashamed and impressed.

268
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,030
You truly are Master Di's disciple.

269
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,720
Therefore,

270
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,800
I'm inviting you sincerely.

271
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,080
If that's the case,

272
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,870
I appreciate your kindness.

273
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,080
I will definitely attend.

274
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,630
Thank you for your generous invitation,
Sheriff Du.

275
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:33,230
I'll come.

276
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,510
Well then,

277
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,720
thank you.

278
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,870
I'll take my leave now.

279
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,920
I look forward to seeing you.

00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:06,670
[To Follow in the Footsteps of the Wise]

281
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:37,090
Gentlemen, everyone in Chang'an knows

282
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,080
I don't get along with Wei Tao.

283
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,870
Recently, both the Wei and Du families'
merit-record pillars

284
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,790
were unearthed in the south of the city.

285
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,370
I've been busy with official duties

286
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,630
and hadn't had a chance to host a banquet,

287
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,160
but Wei Tao beat me to it.

288
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,250
He invited only the gentry.

289
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,670
I, Du Yu,

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,510
proud of my heritage as a member

291
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,960
of the Du family of Jingzhao,

292
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,550
am not so arrogant

293
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,090
as to socialize only with the gentry.

294
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,840
That's why today all the people I invited

295
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,690
are the talents

296
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:06,220
His Majesty relies on most.

297
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,940
Chancellor Lu,

298
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,670
thank you very much
for honoring us with your presence.

299
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,270
You're too kind, Sheriff Du.

300
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,870
The wine of your Du family

301
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:17,080
is far better than the century‑old brew

302
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,810
from my hometown in Jiangdong.

303
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,510
Palace Attendant, thank you

304
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,640
for visiting my humble home
despite your busy schedule.

305
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,480
Lu and Su are new friends.

306
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,510
Although Su currently holds no office,

307
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,520
he used to be

308
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,030
the Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court.

309
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:36,960
More importantly,
he's a disciple of Master Di.

310
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,760
He has a promising future ahead.

311
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,090
Now that we've had 3 rounds of wine,

312
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,470
I'd like to show you

313
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,150
the newly unearthed treasure

314
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:51,750
of the Du family of Jingzhao.

315
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:52,960
Bring it in!

316
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,319
Chancellor Lu, Palace Attendant,

317
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:13,480
please help unveil
our family's merit-record pillar.

318
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,619
I've been waiting for this moment.

319
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,140
Great.

320
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,500
Truly a relic
that has survived six dynasties.

321
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,610
How beautiful!

322
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:47,550
It is indeed a family treasure.

323
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,030
It's just a pity

324
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,700
the pillar is incomplete.

325
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,280

326
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,490
do you know the content

327
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,770
of the missing part?

328
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,710
Of course I do.

329
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,400
Today,

330
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,810
I, Du Yu, will recite it for everyone.

331
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,090
Our ancestor Du Zhou

[To Follow in the Footsteps of the Wise]

333
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,750
served as Imperial Censor

334
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,440
under Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty.

335
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,830
He upheld the law with integrity,

336
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,960
enforcing order so firmly that the court
and officials were impressed.

337
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,110
His family later moved

338
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,780
from Nanyang to Maoling in Guanzhong.

339
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,200
In the year of Ziyan,
during Emperor Xuan's reign,

340
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,830
they held high office
and were honored in the Qilin Pavilion.

341
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:28,300
Later they moved to Duling.

342
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,720
From then on, the Du family
became a prestigious family in Jingzhao.

343

Ministers Du Ji and Du Shu,

344

an ancient family
from Han and Wei-Jin dynasties,

354
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,200

Long time no see.

Attendant Yang.

370
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,920
His Majesty often speaks of you,

00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,400
praising your unwavering loyalty

372

and your many achievements.

373

Lu Tong is getting old,

374
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,240
and he's lost an eye.

00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,880
His Majesty's safety

will depend on you in the future.

377
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:00,750
Everyone, today I've invited

378
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
the most popular music and dance troupe

379
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,310
from the Persian House.

380
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,270
We must

381
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,510
drink to our fill

382
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,450
and enjoy ourselves tonight.

383
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,830
Please.

384
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,900
Chancellor Lu,

385
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,500
excuse me for a moment.

386
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,720
Well... Chen Chong is really out of line.

387
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,590
He invited the High Priest for drinks,

388
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,270
and he's not even coming out to greet you.

389
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,370
It's fine.

390
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,900
I heard his ancestors were gentry too.

391
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,880
He even has ancestral portraits at home.

392
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,210
Let's go straight to their ancestral hall

393
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:49,870
and see what his ancestors
really looked like.

394
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,440
[Ancestral Virtues and Legacy]

395
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,280
Chen Chong, where are you?

396
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,840
The High Priest has arrived.

397
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,430
Come out and welcome him.

398
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:06,160
[Ancestral Virtues and Legacy]

399
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,830
So this is his ancestor?

400
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,480
Looks ordinary.

401
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,660
The painting is ordinary too.

402
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,550
I'm sure I could buy something like this

403
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,440
in the Ghost Market for a few coins.

404
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,030
Exactly.

405
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:19,650
What do they have to be so proud of?

406
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:28,790
Sheriff Wei?

407
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,510
Chen Chong invited you too?

408
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,350
Tie yourself up.
Don't wait for me to do it.

409
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:43,960
Run!

410
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,630
Run!

411
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,440
Where do you think you're going?

412
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,680
Shi Qiansui

413
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,540
is a fifth-rank official
appointed by His Majesty!

414
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,150
What are you trying to do?

415
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:59,400
We're writing the word "gentry"

416
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,510
across Chang'an.

417
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,030
Now,

418
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,720
we just need this final stroke
in Tongji District.

419
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,660
I invited you here

420
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,690
to add that

421
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,930
final stroke.

422
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,910
Let's fight them!

423
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,990
Mr. Taiqiu,

424
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:33,560
I'm Wei Tao.

425
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,230
I'm Du Yu.

426
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:39,340
Please forgive us
for shedding blood in the hall

427
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,480
to slay treacherous merchants.

428
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,960
Stop!

429
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,220
Stop this at once!

430
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,590
Wei and Du,

431
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,090
drop the weapons, now!

432
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,640
Are you really going to
make more mistakes?

433
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,000
Du Yu, you arranged this banquet

434
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,240
just to keep us occupied

435
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,660
so you could come here
and kill, didn't you?

436
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,110
Your scheme

437
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,770
isn't clever at all.

438
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,770
Well, well, Du Yu.

439
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,570
This has nothing to do with you.

440
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,510
So you stalled me until now

441
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,510
just so they could come

442
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,590
arrest me.

443
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,770
Come on then! I, Wei Tao, fear nothing!

444
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,050
Saying that now...

445
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:09,920
are you trying

446
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,790
to paint me

447
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,750
as disloyal and unjust?

448
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:13,680
Enough talk!

449
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,510
I killed them all anyway.

450
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,890
Draw your sword.

451
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,920
Draw your sword!

452
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,550
Tao,

453
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,350
when we were kids,

454
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,750
I often quarreled with you.

455
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,070
After we both became county sheriffs,

456
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,920
I even boasted

457
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,000
I'd eliminate you.

458
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,360
That was only because

459
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,180
my sister married you.

460
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,950
She raised me,

461
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,440
and she's the one I loved most.

462
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,800
I was just jealous.

463
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:39,910
But ever since

464
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,200
we started searching
for the merit-record pillars together

465
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,130
and swore to wipe out

466
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:46,260
all villains of the Jinguang Society,

467
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,290
I've seen you

468
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,230
as my big brother.

469
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,550
And now,

470
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,440
how can you abandon me

471
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,960
and shoulder all this by yourself?

472
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,790
Du Yu!

473
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,640
Tao!

474
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,050
Lu Lingfeng is nothing

475
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,200
to be afraid of!

476
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,230
We can just work together,

477
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,480
take him down first,

478
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,880
and then kill these two evil merchants!

479
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,240
W-wait, wait!

480
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,880
You're all gentry.

481
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:22,880
What now?

482
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,100
You're going to use force now?

483
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,730
Three days ago, you found that Chen Chong

484
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,920
is from the Chen family of Yingchuan,

485
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,750
so you didn't kill him—

486
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,450
that was you, Du Yu, wasn't it?

487
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,390
It was me. So what?

488
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,120
Su Wuming, you were right.

489
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,170
Du Yu has never killed anyone.

490
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,870
All the evil merchants
of the Jinguang Society

491
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,500
were killed by me alone.

492
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:49,640
Tao!

493
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,640
They tracked us here,

494
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,160
so they must have evidence already.

495
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,310
Why do you

496
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,440
keep trying to take it all on yourself?

497
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,800
Actually, we don't have evidence.

498
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,000
But Official Lu has sent people

499
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,830
to infiltrate the Jinguang Society

500
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,480
and gathered some information.

501
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,810
Be careful! Don't damage it!

502
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,640
Make way! Make way!

503
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,590
Everyone, set aside

504
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:11,960
what you're doing for a moment!

505
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,490
I've brought you some wine!

506
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:18,480
Come on, have a drink.

507
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,160
Come on.

508
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:19,720
Is there more?

509
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,480
A month ago,

510
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,640
the Jinguang Society
was expanding their villa.

511
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,000
While digging the foundation,

512
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,590
they found two stone pillars

513
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,090
not far from each other.

514
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,910
Experts later confirmed

515
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,590
that one is the Wei family's
merit-record pillar,

516
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,960
and the other is the Du family's.

517
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,090
Both are treasures.

518
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,470
Those laborers
came from humble backgrounds,

519
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,830
but even they had heard the saying,

520
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,920
"South of the city live the Weis
and the Dus, only 5 feet from Heaven."

521
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
That's not right.

522
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:44,120
Our Tang Empire's Chang'an

523
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,830
and the Sui Dynasty's Chang'an

524
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,960
are the same city.

525
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:50,460
But the old site of Chang'an

526
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,680
before Sui and Tang lies to

527
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,940
the northwest of present‑day Chang'an.

528
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:56,400
But the Jinguang Society's villa
in the south

529
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,960
shouldn't be far from the old Chang'an.

530
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,590
It's not strange that

531
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,960
that area once held the old residences

532
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,530
of the Wei and Du families.

533
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,300
Yang Ji, keep going.

534
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,730
Not long after, the news spread.

535
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,960
The Wei and Du families

536
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,690
each sent people to negotiate,

537
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,480
willing to pay
a high price to buy them back.

538
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,300
Great.

539
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,750
With their ancestors'
merit-record pillars,

540
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,350
their families
would gain even more prestige.

541
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,720
Smash them!

542
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,660
He Bi,

543
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,670
you married Wei Jia.

544
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,650
That makes you a son‑in‑law

545
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
of the Wei family of Jingzhao.

546
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,230
How could you do something like this?

547
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,810
Our Wei family has no such son‑in‑law!

548
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,070
Lu Lingfeng, I respect you.

549
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,240
Su Wuming, I admire you.

550
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,920
Gentlemen,

551
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,080
please wait a moment.

552
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,790
After I kill

553
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,520
these two evil merchants,

554
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,410
I will turn myself in!

555
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
The Yongzhou Judicial Official is present!

556
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,120
How dare you kill anyone!

557
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:15,420
Let's clarify what happened first.

558
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,880
When returning them, He Bi ordered

559
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,160
a piece
of each family's merit-record pillar

560
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,350
to be cut off,

561
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
saying they would be used

562
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,070
to build stepping stones

563

incomplete,

566

you figured out why.

567
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,160
So you sneaked into the Jinguang Society
at night

568
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,000
and took back the missing pieces.

into peace between you.

598
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,550

599
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,400
and those of Wannian County
should be handled by Du Yu.

Du Yu, every time you kill,

Why kill innocents?

610

And why target only the merchants
of the Jinguang Society?

611
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,510
Because I wanted to.

612

traced us.

this headache has tormented you

for a long time, hasn't it?

619
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:11,290
Your wife, Du Juniang,
sought out famous doctors

620
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,420
and finally found the Sifang Cane Shop.

621
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,930

622
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:23,750

623

suffers from a chronic headache.

that the old owner
had preserved for years.

629
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,350
But because of its origin,

630
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:41,790
your wife
would surely find it unpalatable,

631
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:44,140
so she simply bought that Fengli beast

632
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,440
at a high price.

633
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,920
Ridiculous!

Do Master Di's disciples solve cases

Not entirely by guesswork.

00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,940
Please don't kill me!

751
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:07,280
We'll never dare come back again!

752
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,000
Never again!

753
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,480
We won't dare!

754
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,390
Never again!

755
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,510
Really?

756
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,960
This Du Juniang truly has the spirit

757
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:21,100
of Lady Xun Guan and Xie Daoyun.

758
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,660
Indeed.

759
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,240
My female disciple is just like that.

760
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:27,830
She's also good at acupuncture.

761
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,970
Wei Jia's condition

762
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,480
has improved significantly.

763
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,510
She's no longer crying or making a fuss.

764
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,230
If I could continue treating her

765
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,920
for another week or so,

766
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,210
she would recover fully

767
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,940
and remember everything.

768
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,760
Unfortunately...

769
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,620
What?

770
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,810
Juniang said

771
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,480
she's doing well now.

772
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,740
She has decided

773
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,430
to stop treating Wei Jia.

774
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,480
Why?

775
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:56,400
I see.

776
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,770
She was afraid Wei Jia

777
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,750
would remember the past.

778
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,340
So they really are hiding something.

779
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,320
But Wei Tao

780
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,760
refuses to say anything,

781
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,500
and so does Juniang.

782
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,040
What should we do?

783
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:14,280
We question He Bi.

784
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:16,360
Sir,

785
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,540
ever since I became a captain,

786
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:20,190
my master has been teaching me the law.

787
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:20,990
At the moment,

788
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:22,790
He Bi hasn't broken any laws.

789
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,400
How can we question him?

790
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,710
You're right.

791
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:32,710
What should we do?

792
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,360
Yingtao, why don't you give it a try?

793
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,550
Alright.
