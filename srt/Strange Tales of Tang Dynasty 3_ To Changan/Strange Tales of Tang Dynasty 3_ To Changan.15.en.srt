To Chang'an]

00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,890
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,000
How weird.

4
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:45,340
This is no ordinary weapon.

5
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,310
Or rather,

6
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,539
this wasn't even caused

7
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,759
by a weapon at all.

8
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,430
What makes you say that?

9
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,160
Wasn't Wei Qi

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,880
murdered by someone?

11
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,690
If it wasn't done by a human,

12
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,720
m-maybe it was that ghost.

13
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Shut up!

14
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,120
Huo You.

15
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:04,440
Lu Lingfeng.

16
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,350
Don't tell me you believe

17
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,479
that thief's supernatural nonsense!

18
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,080
She said, "That ghost."

19
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,910
There was "that" before "ghost,"

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,910
which means she was referring
to something specific.

21
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,750
Answer me.

22
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,360
Did you see something

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,690
eerie or supernatural?

24
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:30,880
I did.

25
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,020
It was in the Bai Ze Temple.

26
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,870
Now that I think about it,

27
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,670
it was either a demon or a ghost.

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,740
That ghost was in white,

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,230
with horns on its head

30
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,170
and two large fangs sticking out.

31
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,740
It looked just like this clay statue.

32
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,140
You bold thief!

33
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,190
Show some respect
in front of the statue of the deity!

34
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,850
Step back!

35
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,680
What was the size of that white figure?

36
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:06,110
I mean its height and build.

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,550
A-About the same as a human.

38
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,430
About the same as a human?

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Have you ever seen the Bai Ze mask
with horns on its head

40
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,280
and fangs that people wear to ward off

41
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,160
evil spirits?

42
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,040
Yes, I have.

43
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:22,280
Very similar.

44
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,410
They look very similar.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,960
It seems
that someone's been playing tricks

46
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,450
to pretend to be a ghost
in the Bai Ze Temple.

47
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,020
If that's the case,

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
Chen He, who mysteriously disappeared,

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,880
has probably been murdered.

50
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,670
Hermit Baize!

51
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,550
Are there any places

52
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,590
in this temple that we don't know about,

53
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,240
like hidden rooms or secret passages?

54
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,080
No, there aren't.

55
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,680
May I take a look at the corpse?

56
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,870
This happened because he irritated Bai Ze,

57
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,000
and the great deity

58
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,000
bit off his head!

59
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,900
Is it you, Great Deity Bai Ze?

60
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,360
What did you say?

61
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,890
Impossible!

62
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,180
Your reasoning isn't

63
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,750
as good as your folk storytelling.

64
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,720
What do you mean?

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,510
Since Bai Ze is an auspicious beast,

66
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,290
how could it eat people?

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,860
That being said,

68
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,170
none of those who offend the deity

69
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,950
can make it out of here alive.

70
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,180
Didn't you also say

71
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:06,150
it didn't look like a weapon wound?

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,060
That must've been
from Bai Ze's sharp teeth!

73
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:10,930
Nonsense!

74
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,270
Bai Ze doesn't exist in this world.

75
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,530
Stop talking rubbish.

76
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,460
You don't believe in gods?

77
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,280
Fine!

78
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,140
Then you can all wait

79
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:22,500
to have your heads bitten off!

80
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,480
You guys!

81
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,430
Officers,

82
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,400
please free my wife.

83
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,560
Don't leave her tied up here

84
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,360
to be bitten and killed by Bai Ze!

85
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,190
I confess.

86
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,830
I stole the treasures.

87
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,159
I was the prime culprit.

88
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,690
My wife has already

89
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:49,930
suffered a lot.

90
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,920
I beg you

91
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,550
to spare her life.

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,540
Shut up!

93
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,100
Su Wuming,

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,540
you are a master

95
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,890
of coroner skills.

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,000
Please take another careful look.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,060
I think that hermit

98
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,400
has got a point.

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,950
It does look like his head was bitten off

100
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,250
by some giant beast.

101
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,680
Huo You!

102
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,159
He's scared out of his wits.

103
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,680
Your Imperial Guards are

104
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,280
indeed "strong and mighty."

105
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,330
How dare you!

106
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,480
I'll kill you!

107
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,040
Ding!

108
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,140
Don't lose your composure.

109
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,040
General Ding,

110
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,680
you'd better go quickly

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,390
to calm Huo You down.

112
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,870
This temple is so peculiar.

113
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,650
From this moment on,

114
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,210
we must be extremely cautious

115
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,670
and avoid acting rashly.

116
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,430
Officers,

117
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,760
I'm begging you.

118
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,370
Please release my wife.

119
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,480
I forced her to be my accomplice.

120
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,720
No,

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,610
don't listen to him.

122
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,230
Officers,

123
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,310
please free my husband.

124
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,840
I'm the real prime culprit.

125
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,159
Years ago, I was raped by a lustful man.

126
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,720
After that, I made a vow

127
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,170
to dedicate my life
to punishing lecherous men.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,800
I'd marry whoever was

129
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
willing to lend me a hand.

130
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,900
That was why I made him

131
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:51,950
my husband.

132
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,090
Therefore,

133
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,159
he was just following my lead.

134
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,920
What nonsense are you talking about?

135
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,120
You're pregnant now.

136
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,090
You should beg the officers

137
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,600
to spare your life!

138
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,240
You two as a couple are

139
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,090
quite loyal to each other,

140
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,950
both caring about each other.

141
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,920
You're doing much better than those

142
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,520
who call each other brothers

143
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,880
in the martial world.

144
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,120
Is this your first time
in these mountains?

145
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:19,800
Yes,

146
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,540
we took a wrong turn

147
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,680
and committed the crime by the way.

148
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,320
Hey,

149
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:36,590
are you letting me have the chance
to do a good deed?

150
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,440
What are you going to do?

151
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,480
If you'll kill someone, kill me.

152
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,690
My wife is pregnant!

153
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,870
You evil man, I'll fight you...

154
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,150
Although there was a reason
why you did so,

155
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,190
you have still committed a crime.

156
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,510
So, you go down the mountain yourselves

157
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,840
and go to Yongzhou Prefecture

158
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,170
to confess your crimes.

159
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,250
Go down the mountain ourselves?

160
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,250
Aren't you afraid

161
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,920
that we'll run away?

162
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,840
As you can see,

163
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,910
this temple is weird and dangerous.

164
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:14,150
If we keep you tied up here,

165
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,600
you will lose your lives,

166
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,090
and that will be our fault.

167
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,610
As for whether you run away or not,

168
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,600
it's up to you.

169
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,840
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

170
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,320
-We will definitely go turn ourselves in.
-We will definitely go turn ourselves in.

171
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,380
No need to thank me.

172
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,600
That gentleman just now is

173
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,550
the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

174
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,510
Lu Lingfeng.

175
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,010
When you go to confess your crimes,

176
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,540
just say his name.

177
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,480
Jiao,

178
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:47,690
remember,

179
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:51,600
you must tell them that you're pregnant

180
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:54,190
for a lighter sentence.

181
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,060
Alright, get up.

182
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,390
Given that you two are
so devoted to each other,

183
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,370
I don't think you're bad by nature.

184
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,480
After you're released,

185
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,810
you should behave well
to live a good life

186
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,970
and raise your child

187
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,910
properly.

188
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,510
He said it was so weird and dangerous

189
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:30,630
that he feared we might lose our lives.

190
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,030
But why didn't they leave?

191
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:32,740
We

192
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,190
ran into good officials.

193
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,690
That's what

194
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,960
a good official should be like.

195
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,300
This is just an ordinary kitchen.

196
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,640
There's nothing suspicious about it.

197
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,910
What are you groping for?

198
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,750
The stove fire is already out,

199
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,600
but why is it so hot in here?

200
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,600
Is it hot?

201
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Don't you feel it?

202
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:14,520
It does feel a bit hotter than outside.

203
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,050
The floor is hot.

204
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,560
That roar is very close.

205
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,840
Su Wuming,

206
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:31,920
hide well.

207
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:34,290
There should be...

208
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,490
b-be a secret chamber under here. I...

209
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,240
Whatever beast you are,

210
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,230
please don't eat me. I'm skinny and small.

211
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,720
I'm barely a mouthful for you.

212
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
Besides, I can't use martial arts.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,100
I-I won't hurt you. I...

214
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,300
I need to find that secret chamber.

215
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,640
General Ding,

216
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,660
let's run.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,200
If we don't leave now, we'll end up

218
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,800
like Wei Qi, killed by Bai Ze.

219
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,520
Why panic?

220
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,000
Can't you hear

221
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,060
that loud roaring?

222
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,030
You've followed me for years

223
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,290
and been through countless battles

224
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,220
without fear.

225
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,390
What's wrong with you today?

226
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,290
General,

227
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,690
we've only dealt with humans before.

228
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,270
B-But

229
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,080
this time, we don't even know

230
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,810
whether it's a beast or a ghost!

231
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,760
General Ding!

232
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,060
Let's just leave!

233
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,870
Look how messed up you are!

234
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,720
Don't bring shame on the Imperial Guards.

235
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,270
Stand up!

236
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,220
General Ding,

237
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,890
I have a big family to support.

238
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,290
I beg you, General Ding!

239
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,510
Please let me survive!

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,960
I really don't want

241
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,360
my head bitten off,

242
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,260
General!

243
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,840
You good-for-nothing!

244
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,040
General Ding.

245
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,490
Sorry for my incompetence!

246
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,150
Huo You!

247
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,700
Huo You, come back!

248
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,400
Where are you going?

249
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,200
It's you.

250
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,360
Chen He?

251
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,660
Come on.

252
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,880
Have you two ever left your room?

253
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,760
Have you seen

254
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,619
a weird masked person in white?

255
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,760
I haven't seen any weird person.

256
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:25,970
But ghosts are common to see here.

257
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,400
I, Lu Lingfeng,
Yongzhou Judicial Official,

258
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,200
order you two
to be interrogated in the courtyard.

259
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,820
Huo You!

260
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,960
Ding Heng?

261
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,450
[Bai Ze Temple]

262
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:05,110
[Bai Ze Temple]

263
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,070
Bro...

264
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,510
Ding,

265
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,540
what happened?

266
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,470
Wei Qi died a terrible death.

267
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,030
Chen He disappeared.

268
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,180
Huo You was so frightened

269
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,890
that he wanted
to leave the temple and the mountain.

270
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,490
I scolded him, but I didn't stop him.

271
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,700
After a brief delay,

272
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,070
[Bai Ze Temple]

273
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,730
I was worried about his safety

274
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,740
and planned
to escort him down the mountain secretly.

275
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,800
So I went after him.

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,460
But as soon as I came out...

277
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,920
Could it really be

278
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,230
that Bai Ze bit off his head?

279
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,760
Absolutely not.

280
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:58,680
Someone's been faking
these supernatural things.

281
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,340
And there's

282
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,790
more than one person.

283
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:12,310
He's dead?

284
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,270
Nice. He got what he deserved.

285
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,960
What did you say?

286
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:18,750
Ding!

287
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,650
We must stay calm right now.

288
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,550
This woman is vicious, gloating

289
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,010
over others' misfortune.

290
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:25,160
Forget about Bai Ze.

291
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,150
Let's kill her

292
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,370
and return to Chang'an to report.

293
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,740
Commander Li isn't the murderer.

294
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,640
Are we letting the Princess's underling

295
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,030
bring this news back to Chang'an

296
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,680
so everyone

297
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,240
can mock our Imperial Guard?

298
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,160
That would utterly disgrace His Majesty!

299
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
Yet it still doesn't justify
killing to silence her.

300
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,590
Our Imperial Guards

301
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,440
have already lost three members.

302
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,590
It's no big deal
if the Princess's Mansion loses

303
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:44,720
a regimental commander!

304
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,120
But...

305
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,810
No buts!

306
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,600
Let me be frank with you.

307
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,600
His Majesty is testing your loyalty.

308
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
We both once served
as the Right Imperial Guards.

309
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
The night we executed Deposed Queen Wei,

310
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,920
we fought
that life-and-death battle together.

311
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,250
We're brothers in arms.

312
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
I don't want to see you

313
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,170
stand against His Majesty,

314
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,960
bringing utter disaster on yourself!

315
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,440
Will you help me or not?

316
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:08,510
Make your choice!

317
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:44,680
You...

318
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,450
Watch out for Commander Li!

319
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,070
Lu!

320
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,170
How dare you attempt
to kill the Princess's son?

321
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,420
Lu Lingfeng,

322
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,440
didn't you call us out

323
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,950
to be interrogated?

324
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:12,200
Can you still interrogate anyone now?

325
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,000
Li Nai'er,

326
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,590
you...

327
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:21,830
Li Nai'er!

328
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,660
I found this in your room.

329
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,880
As the Commander of the Princess's Guards,

330
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,400
why are you
playing supernatural tricks here?

331
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,010
I'm doing this to kill you!

332
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,180
How arrogant.

333
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:37,720
Although Lu Lingfeng is injured,

334
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,960
Ding Heng is the General
of the Right Imperial Guards

335
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,710
with unmatched bravery and strength!

336
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,770
You think you

337
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,750
and this old man can kill us?

338
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,200
She's got a helper.

339
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,540
It's an archer.

340
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
Watch out, General Ding!

341
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,630
Huo Jing?

342
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,840
It's her?

343
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,480
You treacherous woman!

344
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,360
You fell off the cliff

345
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,960
and faked your death
just to harm people in secret?

346
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,910
So what if I did?

347
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,200
Nai'er taught me

348
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,020
that all's fair in war.

349
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,710
Don't touch me,

350
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:49,760
you shameless scoundrel!

351
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,720
Huo Jing!

352
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,430
So that means

353
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:32,880
Huo You

354
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,170
and Wei Qi were

355
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,390
both killed by you?

356
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,570
That's right.

357
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
It was a joint effort
from Huo Jing and me.

358
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,660
Together, we're invincible.

359
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,490
Nai'er was being way too cautious,

360
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,400
saying that you and Ding Heng were
skilled fighters.

361
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,460
She wanted me to play dead
while she pretended to be weak.

362
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,060
That's why you could
carry her again and again.

363
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:52,920
The whole thing was just

364
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,420
to kill you one by one.

365
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,280
We once thought
spreading news about Bai Ze

366
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:58,790
would lure the one on the throne

367
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,190
who most deserves to die.

368
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,460
But unexpectedly,

369
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:03,070
even the blind Lu Tong

370
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,260
didn't dare to come up the mountain.

371
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,200
Instead, he sent
you minions to get killed.

372
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,240
You bold traitors!

373
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,750
Were you instructed by the Princess

374
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,310
to assassinate His Majesty here?

375
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,370
Confess the truth!

376
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
A mere Right Imperial Guard General
dares to interrogate me?

377
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,460
Let me send you to hell!

378
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,640
You're no more than a lame fighter.

379
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,900
You think you can do it?

380
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,080
Lu Lingfeng,

381
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,200
you've served
as an Imperial Guard for years,

382
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,840
rising to the rank of General,

383
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,720
but instead of serving your state loyally,

384
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,030
you helped these traitors

385
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,910
attack the Imperial Guards in secret!

386
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:30,880
I didn't!

387
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,040
General Ding,

388
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,680
it has come to this point!

389
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,200
What's the use of such a talk now?

390
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
Now, we should join hands
to fight our common enemy!

391
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,030
Shut up!

392
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,680
I'm talking to Lu Lingfeng.

393
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,960
Who gave you the right to chip in?

394
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,290
Who do you think you are?

395
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:43,800
Lu Lingfeng,

396
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,160
the stab she gave you is
neither too deep nor too shallow.

397
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,040
This girl has feelings for you.

398
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,830
You've repeatedly

399
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,990
saved her from my attacks.

400
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,450
You have feelings for her.

401
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,290
I'll remember all this.

402
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:55,920
After I

403
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:58,220
kill these traitors,

404
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:00,240
I will drag you back to Chang'an

405
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,040
to face His Majesty's judgment!

406
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:07,720
Girl!

407
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:52,270
What are you doing? Do you want to die?

408
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,330
Want to help? Watch my hidden weapon!

409
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,850
And one for you, too!

410
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:23,810
General Ding!

411
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:28,270
No!

412
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,160
Ding,

413
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:47,010
I'm so sorry.

414
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:49,110
Look, Nai'er.

415
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,320
They're on the same side.

416
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,120
Why show mercy?

417
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,550
Don't tell me

418
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:00,350
that you've fallen for that man.

419
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:07,240
Did you murder Official Wei Qi

420
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,210
and Official Huo You
in the same way like this?

421
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,490
Killing an official
of the Imperial Guards is

422
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,920
much easier

423
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,290
than hunting a leopard.

424
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,740
Is it you, Great Deity Bai Ze?

425
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,130
Where are you going?

426
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,200
It's you.

427
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,690
Judging from this murder weapon,

428
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,310
what's your relationship

429
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,610
with the guide Ling Ji?

430
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,800
Don't mention that useless man.

431
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,200
Commander Li,

432
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:17,830
when you saw
that Ling Ji had hanged himself,

433
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,930
you shed tears

434
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,620
and even buried him properly.

435
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,400
You two were

436
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:24,630
quite close, weren't you?

437
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,600
I owed Senior Ling Ji a lot.

438
00:29:33,930 --> 00:29:35,160
If I hadn't persuaded Senior Huo Jing

439
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,240
to help me seek revenge,

440
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,370
they would have been married already.

441
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,300
Perhaps

442
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:42,890
they'd even have children by now.

443
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,160
So the three of you are fellow disciples?

444
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,050
That's right.

445
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,780
I am the junior of Li Nai'er's master.

446
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,360
And he's also my father.

447
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
That's my mother.

448
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,030
Back then,

449
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,720
I gave birth to her

450
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,840
under a Huo Jing persimmon tree.

451
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,670
So I named her Huo Jing.

452
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,960
I was somewhat deranged before,

453
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,680
but after giving birth to her,

454
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,210
I surprisingly recovered.

455
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,750
Huo Jing has been fond of dolls
since she was little.

456
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,480
So I'll make dolls for her my whole life.

457
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,030
Don't waste our breath on them.

458
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,240
The injured one has good fighting skills.

459
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,280
Don't let him get a chance to escape.

460
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,780
This scholar is

461
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:20,580
a powerless weakling.

462
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,420
Let me have him

463
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,160
smoked into jerky

464
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,910
to feed my mount!

465
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,790
Ding,

466
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:31,690
I will avenge you.

467
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,290
That's enough.

468
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,110
Don't be rash.

469
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,760
You're not lying to me, are you?

470
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,620
If you're fellow disciples,

471
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,590
you should be accomplices!

472
00:30:44,790 --> 00:30:46,650
Then why did Ling Ji hang himself?

473
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,720
He was a coward.

474
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,790
I wanted to help
Junior Nai'er get revenge,

475
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:58,850
but he didn't dare.

476
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,830
He wanted to be a loyal subject
of the Li family's Tang Dynasty.

477
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,240
So I cut all ties with him.

478
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,590
I get it now.

479
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:09,400
You used him

480
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,640
to spread rumors that Bai Ze showed up.

481
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,560
But I still can't figure it out.

482
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,940
Wasn't he helping you all along?

483
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,600
Why would he kill himself?

484
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,900
I once promised Senior Ling Ji

485
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,000
to persuade Senior Huo Jing
to reconcile with him.

486
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,400
I never said
I wouldn't reconcile with him.

487
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,960
Taking the Heartbreak Cliff route was

488
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,750
just part of

489
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:32,930
our plan.

490
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:34,510
When planning it,

491
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,170
I just forgot how petty he was.

492
00:31:37,030 --> 00:31:37,720
Wait.

493
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You're the guide,

494
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,880
but have you never
been deep into Mount Zhongnan?

495
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,270
I'm a hunter from this area.

496
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,240
Of course I have.

497
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,530
Then why don't you know

498
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,000
that taking the Heartbreak Cliff route

499
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,800
would save us four hours' climb?

500
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,500
Are you sure we're going this way?

501
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:03,130
We must go this way.

502
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:08,850
People familiar with Mount Zhongnan

503
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:11,070
should all know that there's

504
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:13,000
a lore about the Heartbreak Cliff.

505
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,800
Any couple who are in love

506
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,050
should not cross this cliff together.

507
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,200
If they do,

508
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:25,290
their relationship will end forever.

509
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,930
This petty man

510
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,590
thought that I...

511
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:31,520
Senior Huo Jing,

512
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:33,830
I didn't think things through
and caused Senior Ling Ji's death.

513
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,480
Stop it.

514
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,160
Just the loss of a man.

515
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,510
Although we failed to lure

516
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,160
Emperor Li over with this plan,

517
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,490
killing several Imperial Guard generals

518
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:45,430
still got your revenge done
to some extent.

519
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:47,310
The completion of this great deed

520
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,270
has made our lives meaningful.

521
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,830
Wait a minute!

522
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,890
He's already seriously wounded.

523
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,280
And I'm just

524
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:05,710
a helpless, weak scholar to be killed.

525
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,270
What's the hurry?

526
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,510
Li Nai'er,

527
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,550
let me ask you.

528
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,490
What deep grudge do you hold

529
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,540
against the Imperial Guards,

530
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,640
or rather, against His Majesty?

531
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,070
I'm not a Li.

532
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,150
My surname is Shangguan.

533
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,100
Shangguan Nai'er?

534
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:29,300
Lu Lingfeng，

535
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,240
[Li Nai'er]

536
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:31,460
on the night of the Tanglong era,

537
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,200
[Shangguan Nai'er]

538
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:34,660
you were also involved
in killing my sister.

539
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,620
Therefore,

540
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,170
even if you're the Princess's son,

541
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,720
you must die.

542
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,440
Impossible.

543
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,830
The Shangguan family was prominent,

544
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,070
but during Emperor Gaozong's reign,

545
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,510
Empress Wu Zetian ordered

546
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,310
to execute their entire family.

547
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,110
Only the newborn Shangguan Wan'er

548
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,970
and her mother were

549
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,760
taken into the inner palace.

550
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,440
How could you possibly be

551
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,570
her younger sister?

552
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,110
My sister and I shared the same fate.

553
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,680
I was born into a family disaster.

554
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,130
What made me more miserable was

555
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,920
that even my nursing mother was

556
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,670
killed.

557
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,590
She took pity on me

558
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,920
and secretly took me in,

559
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,070
placing me in a Taoist temple
on Mount Zhongnan.

560
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,400
She often came to see me.

561
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,440
At first,

562
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,290
I called her "mother."

563
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:21,360
But she didn't allow it,

564
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
saying that her identity was special.

565
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,060
If anyone found it out,

566
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:26,880
it would put me in fatal danger.

567
00:34:28,110 --> 00:34:28,840
So

568
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,860
she only let me call her "sister."

569
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:36,190
She also gave me a beautiful name,

570
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,239
Nai'er.

571
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,480
She wanted me to take the surname Li,

572
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,679
but I preferred to be called Shangguan.

573
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,110
My sister was also my mother.

574
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,110
She was my everything.

575
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,639
And she gave me everything!

576
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,600
She was the "Red Plum Chancellor,"

577
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,520
virtuous, gifted,
and wise as a great help!

578
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,070
Without her,

579
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,210
how could Wu Zhao have governed the state?

580
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,590
Her literary talent was unparalleled.

581
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,110
Her brilliance in literature, poetry,

582
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,880
and calligraphy was exceptional.

583
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,760
Without her,

584
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,840
how would Chang'an have

585
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,300
so many amazing poems?

586
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,670
She has no family,

587
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,280
no heir,

588
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,280
and no allies. She was all alone.

589
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,460
She devoted herself entirely
to the Li family's Tang Dynasty.

590
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:26,880
Yet you

591
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,510
falsely accused her
of being Deposed Queen Wei's ally.

592
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,670
On what grounds?

593
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,470
Her fate being dragged into the storm,

594
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:44,060
she passed away in haste.

595
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,050
Lady Shangguan's passing is

596
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,320
truly heartbreaking.

597
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:49,920
Also,

598
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,830
she was never part
of Deposed Queen Wei's faction.

599
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,040
As far as I know,

600
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,350
in order to stop Deposed Queen Wei

601
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,630
and her daughter from usurping power,

602
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,710
she earnestly tried

603
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,590
to talk sense into Emperor Zhongzong
over and over again.

604
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:08,090
She also requested to resign
and shave her head to be a nun.

605
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,070
She even drank poisonous wine

606
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,870
to force the issue with her life.

607
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,220
To be fair,

608
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,890
her merit in protecting
the Li family's Tang Dynasty

609
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,980
should be recorded

610
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,540
in history under Lady Shangguan's name.

611
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:28,960
Facing death,

612
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,360
you, Su Wuming,

613
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,290
have finally said something fair.

614
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,120
That's not true.

615
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,510
He's just afraid of death!

616
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,720
But you failed.

617
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,480
I'm not as soft-hearted as Nai'er.

618
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,760
Yes,

619
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:46,720
I am afraid of death.

620
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:48,270
But I'm more afraid

621
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:50,470
that if you kill Lu Lingfeng,

622
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,490
you will fail

623
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,480
Lady Shangguan.

624
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,160
What did you say?

625
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,770
The waters of Xiaoxiang have run dry;

626
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,030
the Wanwei Mountain has collapsed;

627
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,580
the pearl has sunk and broken;

628
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,020
the most precious jade is shattered.

629
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,280
Gaze at the pines

630
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:11,840
and quietly listen at the grave.

631
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,360
For thousands of years,

632
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,440
may your name be sung forever and ever.

633
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,880
This is the epitaph
that the State-guarding Grand Princess

634
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,740
wrote for Lady Shangguan,

635
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,000
showing Her Highness's deep affection

636
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,920
for Lady Shangguan.

637
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,550
But now,

638
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,320
you've set a trap

639
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:34,020
to harm Her Highness's son.

640
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:36,030
Can you face

641
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,530
Lady Shangguan in heaven?

642
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,630
I've long heard that Master Di
has two disciples

643
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:44,030
who solved some cases in Chang'an

644
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,230
and earned some fame.

645
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,580
Today I've finally seen them for myself.

646
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,930
One with a silver tongue.

647
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,640
And the other one

648
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,130
with a good-looking face.

649
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,490
Lu Lingfeng,

650
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,480
you know what?

651
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,220
If you were less handsome,

652
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,230
Nai'er would have stabbed
all the way through

653
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,490
and twisted the blade,

654
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,570
and you would have been dead already.

655
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,960
Su Wuming,

656
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,450
stop wasting your breath on them.

657
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,070
I will kill these traitors

658
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:34,350
and avenge my fellow Imperial Guards!

659
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,800
Nai'er!

660
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,150
Pull yourself together!

661
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:02,750
Go help your Senior Huo Jing.

662
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:46,860
Li Nai'er!

663
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,410
Shangguan Nai'er!

664
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,400
Stop fighting.

665
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:52,630
He really is the Princess's son.

666
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,810
Stop making more mistakes!

667
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,230
You scholar, you are truly annoying.

668
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,280
If you say one more word,

669
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,670
I'll kill you first!

670
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,510
You jerk,

671
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,670
just try to come at me!

672
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,900
I, Su Wuming, am protected
by divine power!
