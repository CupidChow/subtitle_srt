[Dayu Fish Market]

4
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,680
You think I only sell

5
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,310
those small fish out front?

6
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,680
I have big fish, too.

7
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,070
Let me show you.

8
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,720
Would you like to swim

9
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,040
with my big fish?

10
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,350
I'll let you down.

11
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,410
Start talking.

12
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,680
Otherwise, even if

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,940
you have a pretty face,

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,710
I'll have to feed you to the fish.

15
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,590
I don't care about why you were

16
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,590
stalking Liu Jun.

17
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,090
What I want to know is

18
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,370
how you obtained intel

19
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,470
about Yenisei Kirghiz.

20
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,520
[Bream]

21
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,180
You're from Yenisei Kirghiz?

22
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,710
Yes.

23
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:48,120
[Bream]

24
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,840
You're already fish food now.

25
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,710
With you,

26
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,030
I have nothing to hide.

27
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,240
Speak.

28
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,690
How did you get the intel?

29
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,190
I don't know about the intel.

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,960
But my husband does.

31
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,000
Who is your husband?

32
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,960
Lu Lingfeng,
Yongzhou Judicial Official.

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,150
If you take me back
to Yongzhou Prefecture,

34
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,320
I promise you

35
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,120
he will tell you everything.

36
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,430
Lu Lingfeng?

37
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,870
The Princess's son

38
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
is your husband?

39
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,800
Haven't I caught a treasure then?

40
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,360
The Princess suddenly cut off

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,090
contact with Yenisei Kirghiz.

42
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,120
Perhaps you

43
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,690
can help restore

44
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,350
relations between Yenisei Kirghiz
and the Princess's Mansion.

45
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,730
Your Highness.

46
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,680
Why are you in such a hurry?

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,160
I received a message by carrier pigeon.

48
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,190
If you want Pei Xijun alive,

49
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,710
then grant what Yenisei Kirghiz demands.

50
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,560
Go to Yongzhou Prefecture.

51
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,190
Give this to Lu Lingfeng.

52
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,430
Remember,

53
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,510
only he is allowed to see it.

54
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,160
Yes.

55
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,240
Please.

56
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,829
Mr. Fei.

57
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,630
Mr. Fei, where's Xijun?

58
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,800
I found a restaurant in Qinglong District

59
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,630
that sells delicious pig organ soup,

60
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,290
so I brought some back for her.

61
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,870
You only think about Xijun,

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,920
but not about me.

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,159
Of course, I got something
for you too, Mr. Fei.

64
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,070
Here, Gourd Chicken.

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,460
Yingtao, you're so kind!

66
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,700
We got paid today,

67
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,720
so of course I had to treat everyone.

68
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,560
Where's Xijun? Call her out to eat.

69
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,460
She went out.

70
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:52,560
Lu Lingfeng sent her

71
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,800
to follow someone.

72
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,680
Xijun?

73
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,159
Is Xijun back yet?

74
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:58,240
Lu Lingfeng,

75
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,050
you sent Xijun to follow someone?

76
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,560
Yes.

77
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,370
Isn't she back yet?

78
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,430
Master!

79
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,310
Master.

80
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,630
The Princess sent someone
to Yongzhou Prefecture,

81
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,890
saying there's an urgent matter for you.

82
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm Lu Lingfeng.

83
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:18,290
Official Lu, may I have a word?

84
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,800
[Liu Mansion]

85
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,720
Open up!

86
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,870
Who are you looking for?

87
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,800
Is Liu Jun here?

88
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:48,000
At this hour?

89
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,870
How could Magistrate Liu be home?

90
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,000
Then where would he be?

91
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,930
Only two places.

92
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,250
Either the Persian House

93
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,710
or the Pingkang District.

94
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:59,330
The usual approach. Let's split up.

95
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,680
Nice dancing!

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,680
I like it.

97
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,270
This way.

98
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,630
Gentlemen,

99
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,190
what would you like to drink?

100
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,720
Any wine available in the world

101
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,270
can be found at the Persian House.

102
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,240
We're looking for someone.

103
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
Then you've come to the right place.

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,830
All of Chang'an's officials
and wealthy merchants

105
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,390
can be found here.

106
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,830
If you're looking for women,

107
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,850
any one of them

108
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,409
can captivate your soul

109
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,380
for the rest of your life.

110
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,560
Is Magistrate Liu from
Yongzhou Prefecture here?

111
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,290
Who?

112
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,040
Liu Jun.

113
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:42,430
Oh, Mr. Liu!

114
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,640
He's a magistrate?

115
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,630
I didn't know

116
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,120
he held such a high position.

117
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,180
Stop the idle talk.

118
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,720
He's involved in a case now.

119
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,860
Involved in a case?

120
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,680
That's frightening.

121
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,020
But he hasn't visited

122
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,240
Persian House at all tonight.

123
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,270
Really?

124
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,120
You're so intimidating,

125
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,780
how would I dare to lie?

126
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:05,720
Let's go.

127
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,430
No need to see me out.

128
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,690
I'll be back tomorrow.

129
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:14,340
All right.

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,920
Master, don't worry.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,440
Perhaps Liu Jun went to Pingkang District.

132
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,000
[Persian House]

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,040
Mr. Su and the others

134
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,440
might be able to find him.

135
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,040
Wait.

136
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,830
What did that female innkeeper

137
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,560
say just now?

138
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,800
She said

139
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,040
he didn't come tonight.

140
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,870
That's not right.

141
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,430
But he hasn't visited

142
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,640
Persian House at all tonight.

143
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,440
That statement is strange.

144
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,990
As a shopkeeper,

145
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,800
her normal response should be,

146
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:45,040
"Liu Jun didn't come tonight."

147
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,780
But she used the word "visited"

148
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,900
and emphasized "Persian House."

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
This sounds more like

150
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,150
she's repeating someone else's words.

151
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,830
Master,

152
00:07:58,470 --> 00:07:59,800
now that you mention it,

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,860
it does make sense.

154
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,090
Shopkeeper, you're lying.

155
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,430
Where is Liu Jun?

156
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:28,730
Don't move!

157
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,150
I had no choice.

158
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,890
I had to rat you out.

159
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:35,990
You can have

160
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,320
your silver back.

161
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,559
If anyone comes looking for me,

162
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,090
just tell them that I've not

163
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,840
visited Persian House at all tonight.

164
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,360
Where is Miss Pei?

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
Why are you asking
such a strange question?

166
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,200
Who is Miss Pei?

167
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,530
I don't know her.

168
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,120
By the way,

169
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,200
I am the honorable
Magistrate of Yongzhou Prefecture.

170
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,930
How dare you treat me like this!

171
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:08,970
I'm asking you,

172
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:10,910
where is Pei Xijun?

173
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,690
Lu Lingfeng,

174
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:14,490
you're just a Judicial Official.

175
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,510
Your rank is below mine.

176
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,790
I know

177
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,200
you have a special relationship
with the Princess,

178
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,930
but you can't abuse your power.

179
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,380
Put it down!

180
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,320
Xue Huan.

181
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,270
Stop! Stop!

182
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,080
Lu Lingfeng,

183
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,790
I will definitely report you!

184
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,960
You can report me,

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,480
but first you must tell me

186
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:45,960
where Pei Xijun is.

187
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,730
I don't know any Pei Xijun.

188
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,650
Even if you beat me to death,

189
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,100
I still wouldn't know.

190
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,360
Official Lu.

191
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,870
What brings you here?

192
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,020
I took the portrait

193
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,390
and traced it to Chongxian District.

194
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,480
The district head recognized

195
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,720
this person as the owner
of Dayu Fish Market.

196
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,910
I didn't dare act rashly,

197
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,200
so I investigated secretly.

198
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,400
A secret agent told me

199
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,150
Magistrate Liu frequents there.

200
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,210
He was there today.

201
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,530
Dayu Fish Market...

202
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,870
I've found the answer.

203
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,160
Liu Jun, since you won't admit it,

204
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:27,700
you can go to the King of Hell

205
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:28,780
and repent for your sins!

206
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,870
I confess!

207
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,870
Yes.

208
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,240
It's the Dayu Fish Market.

209
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,770
You can't blame me for this.

210
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,920
Miss Pei was following me.

211
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,480
Jia.

212
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:38,150
Yes.

213
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
Arrest him and take him back.

214
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,120
Yes.

215
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,610
How's it going?

216
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,750
Any movement from the Princess's Mansion?

217
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,240
No.

218
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,440
Don't tell me we've been

219
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,570
fooled by that girl.

220
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,960
Gather all our men.

221
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:01,960
Yes.

222
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:05,240
Pack only valuables and money.

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,780
We'll return to Yenisei Kirghiz overnight.

224
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,510
Yes.

225
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,120
Let me go.

226
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,960
You're just a liar!

227
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:25,720
I knew it.

228
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,050
You're so plain-looking.

229
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,240
Why would the Princess's son

230
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,510
be interested in you?

231
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,850
I'm not lying to you.

232
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,720
My husband, Lu Lingfeng,

233
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,120
is Di Renjie's disciple.

234
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,530
He's an expert in solving crimes.

235
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,080
He already suspects

236
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,540
your accomplice, Liu Jun.

237
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,580
If I don't return,

238
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,510
it will solidify
the suspicion against Liu Jun.

239
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,330
Lu Lingfeng will be here soon.

240
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,770
If you surrender now,

241
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,600
I can plead for mercy on your behalf.

242
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,660
At least you'll have a proper burial.

243
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,270
Such brave words from a little lady.

244
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,320
Liu Jun's exposure was inevitable.

245
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,600
I've long been prepared.

246
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,960
You think you can scare

247
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,910
a Yenisei Kirghiz warrior
with a few words?

248
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,270
Dream on.

249
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,530
I'm tired of Chang'an anyway.

250
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,960
This is the perfect opportunity

251
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:13,490
to return to
the Yenisei Kirghiz Grasslands.

252
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,960
My fish, I'm leaving now.

253
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,510
This young lady

254
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:35,740
is a treat I'm leaving for you.

255
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,030
Enjoy her.

256
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,000
Lu Lingfeng!

257
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:07,290
Seize them!

258
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,150
Lu Lingfeng!

259
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:35,870
Lu Lingfeng!

260
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,930
[Yongzhou Prefecture]

261
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,970
Chief Administrator Xiong...

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,750
Liu Jun!

263
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,970
As the Magistrate of Yongzhou Prefecture,

264
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,630
how could you?

265
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,510
How did you fall so low?

266
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,870
Confess everything!

267
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:47,910
I...

268
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,170
Chang'an is just too dazzling

269
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,370
and too intoxicating.

270
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,390
I was fond of entertainment

271
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,120
and often visited the Persian House
and Pingkang District.

272
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,690
Those are expensive places to be.

273
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,840
Later,

274
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,910
I met the man surnamed Yu.

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,200
His name is Yu Matong.

276
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,430
At first, I only knew he was a merchant

277
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,200
who was generous with his money.

278
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
He often paid my bills.

279
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,600
Over time,

280
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,640
I spent a lot of his money.

281
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,510
One day...

282
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,930
What is this?

283
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,000
These are all the bills

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,030
I've paid for you.

285
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,610
How can it be so much?

286
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,000
Are you trying to blackmail me?

287
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,720
You...

288
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,200
He forced me to stamp my fingerprint

289
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,000
on those bills

290
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,380
and threatened to hand

291
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,440
those bills to the Censorate

292
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,600
if I refused

293
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,910
to help them.

294
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,440
Only then did I realize that
I had fallen into a trap.

295
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,270
But it was too late.

296
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Did you know he was Yenisei Kirghiz?

297
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,030
Not at first.

298
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,980
I found out later.

299
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,530
And you still worked for them
after knowing?

300
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,540
You...

301
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:12,720
You're an official of the Tang Empire!

302
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,960
You...

303
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,390
Liu Jun.

304
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,150
What have you done
for the Yenisei Kirghiz?

305
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,120
I told them about

306
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,440
everything the court assigned

307
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,840
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

308
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,220
And this time,

309
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,690
I learned from Li Zhuang

310
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,320
that you were investigating
Yenisei Kirghiz spies,

311
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,580
and that you were about

312
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:35,200
to discover the Ghost Market Intel Stall.

313
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,730
I told him all about it, too.

314
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:39,390
[Patriotic and devote to public service]

315
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,240
You...

316
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,090
Just wait and see.

317
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,010
For colluding with the enemy,

318
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,100
the court will execute you!

319
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:53,910
[Pei's Mansion]

320
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,910
It's all my fault.

321
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:57,110
When I heard Xijun's cries for help,

322
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,300
I panicked

323
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:01,430
and killed all 4
of the Yenisei Kirghiz men.

324
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,720
Good riddance.

325
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,270
They bred monstrous fish

326
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,589
and fed them with live people.

327
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,190
Such people deserved to die.

328
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,109
But

329
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,579
I didn't leave any survivors,

330
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:16,349
and now the trail has gone cold.

331
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:17,410
It doesn't matter.

332
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,940
We're both Master Di's disciples.

333
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,910
Solving a case

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,880
and finding clues
shouldn't be difficult for us.

335
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,900
Besides,

336
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,700
the Yenisei Kirghiz are going to meet

337
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,190
someone called Wolf.

338
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,200
This intel is also very important.

339
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,270
The meeting location

340
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:35,070
is at Dayan Pagoda in Jinchang District.

341
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,730
Also,

342
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,940
the contact sent by the Yenisei Kirghiz

343
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,790
is a woman.

That's tomorrow, isn't it?

So,

352
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,480

No, no.

This is indeed

Let me explain.

369
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,480
Vice Minister Pei's daughter, Pei Xijun,

370
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,150
is my sworn sister.

371
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,460
We're as close as siblings.

372
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:35,960
And you?

I...

374
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,070
Pei Jian has been posted elsewhere

and all his servants have been dismissed.

376
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,920
You are from the Lu family of Fanyang.

377
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,170

But due to my busy official duties,

382
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,570
we haven't married yet.

383
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,720
I see.

384
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,990
When did you get engaged?

385
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,430
When you got engaged,

386
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,980
did Pei Jian know about

387
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,350
your special relationship
with the Princess?

388
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:10,810
Well...

389
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,640
What does this
have to do with you, Chief Minister Pei?

390
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,960
When an elder asks you a question,

391
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
how can you be so disrespectful?

392
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,960
Just answer truthfully.

393
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,370
Could it be that

394
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
you two are secretly engaged,

395
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,700
and Pei Jian doesn't know?

396
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,990
The Tang Empire is certainly open-minded,

397
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,180
but marriage is too important

398
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,110
to be handled so carelessly.

399
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,440
No, Vice Minister Pei knows.

400
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,000
Chief Minister Pei,

401
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,610
do you remember the Black Tea Case

402
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:41,810
that shocked Chang'an 2 years ago?

403
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,070
Lu Lingfeng risked his life

404
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,200
to save Xijun.

405
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,830
At that time, Vice Minister Pei already

406
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:50,290
intended to betroth Xijun to him.

407
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
And after solving

408
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
the Cantian Tower case,

409
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,720
Vice Minister Pei formally

410
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,680
entrusted Xijun to him

411
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,540
before leaving Chang'an.

412
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,630
I know you're silver-tongued.

413
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,400
Do you dare swear

414
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,060
on Di Renjie's honor

415
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,930
that everything you said is true?

416
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,400
I do.

417
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,180
I, Su Wuming,

418
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,600
swear by my mentor, Master Di,

419
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,890
that what I just reported to you

420
00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:15,200
contains not a single lie.

421
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,190
I'll believe you for now.

422
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,540
What I care about is

423
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,750
whether Pei Jian, because of Lu Lingfeng

424
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,510
and his special relationship
with the Princess,

425
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:24,680
deliberately curried favor

426
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,210
and brought shame
to the Pei family of Hedong.

427
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,000
Tell Xijun to see me.

428
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,110
I've already examined her.

429
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,720
She's just had a shock.

430
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:41,090
It's nothing serious.

431
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,910
A good night's sleep will fix it.

432
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:45,510
Then let her rest.

433
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,750
Pei Mian is just
throwing his weight around.

434
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,210
There's no need to see him.

435
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,550
Lu Lingfeng!

436
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:52,730
Well...

437
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,430
You can't say that.

438
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,590
Chief Minister Pei is my granduncle.

439
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,960
He is a highly respected elder,

440
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
and everyone in our Pei family of Hedong

441
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,830
looks up to him.

442
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,550
If he's here, it must be important.

443
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,150
I must see him no matter what.

444
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,510
Fine, I'll go with you.

445
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,310
Granduncle, please have some tea.

446
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,550
I heard

447
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
you were injured?

448
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,580
No, it was a false alarm.

449
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,790
What happened?

450
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,760
Well...

451
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,830
My sworn sister, Pei Xijun.

452
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,480
was helping Yongzhou Prefecture

453
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,340
track down Yenisei Kirghiz spies

454
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:34,090
when she encountered danger.

455
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,880
We failed to protect her properly.

456
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,880
Please forgive us, Chief Minister Pei.

457
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,760
Is Su Wuming speaking the truth?

458
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:44,580
Yes, it's true.

459
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,320
It was my own carelessness.

460
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,590
I never expected that

461
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,450
you would be serving our country!

462
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,000
Yenisei Kirghiz spies
have infiltrated Chang'an,

463
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,240
attempting to disrupt

464
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,440
the international polo tournament.

465
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,230
At this critical moment,

466
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:01,160
a daughter of the Pei family
bravely took on this burden.

467
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,480
Admirable, truly admirable!

468
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,720
Granduncle, I haven't done
anything special.

469
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,780
You're too kind.

470
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm here to ask for a favor.

471
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,160
But I see you're not looking well.

472
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,200
You should rest first.

473
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,350
Tomorrow,

474
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,120
I'll have someone bring you some tonics.

475
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,720
If there's no one to attend to you,

476
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,480
I can also

477
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,640
send two maids over.

478
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,180
No need.

479
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,570
Everyone here

480
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,350
is my close friend.

481
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,810
They'll take care of me.

482
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,560
Very well.

483
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,440
I'll take my leave.

484
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:38,880
Wait.

485
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,970
Granduncle,

486
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,480
I'm perfectly fine.

487
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,960
Please tell me what you need.

488
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,830
If it's within my ability,

489
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,030
I'll do my best.

490
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,130
Well,

491
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:51,560
all right.

492
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,480
Here's the thing.

493
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,840
For this international polo tournament,

494
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,640
His Majesty wants to create

495
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,000
a brand new polo ball,

496
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,270
one that represents

497
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:04,200
the prosperity of our Tang Empire.

498
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,480
Those useless people at the Tribute Office

499
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,750
worked on it for 2 months,

500
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,930
but failed to produce a polo ball

501
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:10,680
to His Majesty's fancy.

502
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,640
The final match is approaching,

503
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,040
and I'm getting anxious.

504
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,000
Then I suddenly thought of you.

505
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,160
You've been clever since childhood

506
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,680
and especially skilled in painting.

507
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,440
That's why I've come to ask for your help.

508
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,110
I hope you can help design

509
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,310
this critically important

510
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,880
imperial polo ball for the Tang Empire.

511
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,880
I'm honored by your trust, Granduncle.

512
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,160
I'm willing to try.

513
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,320
But I know nothing
about making polo balls.

514
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,780
I can only provide

515
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,640
design sketches on paper.

516
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,510
That's perfect!

517
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,240
Then I thank you in advance.

518
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,620
Granduncle, you're too kind.

519
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,960
In my mind, prosperity means

520
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,160
the rain is falling outside the window,

521
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,860
I'm listening to raindrops
on flowering trees,

522
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,760
teaching the children
calligraphy and painting,

523
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,600
and waiting for my beloved to return home
from the county office.

524
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,880
It's so sweet my teeth hurt!

525
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,070
Master Fei,

526
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,900
please don't tease me.

527
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,510
I'd like to hear

528
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,100
what prosperity means

529
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,240
to you.

530
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,350
Me?

531
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,880
I believe

532
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:48,260
prosperity is easy to achieve
but hard to maintain.

533
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,440
To keep prosperity forever,

534
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,480
first of all,

535
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:54,420
the emperor must be a wise ruler.

536
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,210
He must see things clearly,

537
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,110
and the common people shouldn't suffer.

538
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,030
Then I, Fei,

539
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,510
would have wine to drink every day.

540
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,310
Xue Huan, what about you?

541
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,790
I don't know what prosperity looks like,

542
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,590
but I know

543
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,950
if prosperity comes,

544
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:13,360
someone needs to protect our Tang Empire.

545
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,270
If anyone dares to provoke us,

546
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,550
I'll beat them until they're picking
their teeth off the ground.

547
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,270
Prosperity should include
the martial world too, right?

548
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:22,240
Yes, indeed.

549
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,070
I love the clouds, the smoke,

550
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,200
and the wilderness.

551
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,720
In my eyes, a prosperous era

552
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,720
is when all people of the Tang Empire

553
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,440
have their own place in the world,

554
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,550
and everyone finds
their rightful position.

555
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,440
Well said!

556
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,680
As expected from a heroic lady.

557
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,550
You two, stop pretending to be idle.

558
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,920
Share your thoughts about prosperity

559
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:44,510
and give Xijun some inspiration.

560
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,000
A truly prosperous era

561
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,200
requires both civil governance
and military strength.

562
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,030
Therefore, we must allow
citizens to flourish

563
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,640
while also conquering our enemies,

564
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,090
and making those ambitious nations

565
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,600
tremble with fear.

566
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,680
Otherwise, with unstable borders,

567
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,510
nothing else can be achieved.

568
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,500
So the longevity of prosperity

569
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:11,180
depends on how far our arrows can reach.

570
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,650
The prosperity of our Tang Empire

571
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,310
needs both poetry

572
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,030
and swords.

573
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,020
A balance of the pen and the sword,

574
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,060
that is the way of prosperity.

575
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,660
Well said.

576
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,810
Civil governance and military strength

577
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,410
are indeed both important.

578
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,920
I don't understand military matters.

579
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,800
As for civil governance,

580
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,250
I think there are just two approaches.

581
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,910
One is like the reign of Emperors Wen
and Jing of the Early Han,

582
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,070
adopting a hands-off approach

583
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,310
and letting citizens flourish.

584
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:49,170
As they say, governing a great nation

585
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,800
is like cooking a small fish.

586
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,570
Another example is Emperor Xuan's reign,

587
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:57,750
where he personally handled all matters

588
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,160
and enforced strict laws.

589
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,270
Though the common people
lived comfortably,

590
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,020
the officials lived in constant fear.

591
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,680
In comparison,

592
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,430
during the Wen-Jing era,

593
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:12,750
the people, officials, and emperor
all enjoyed prosperity together,

594
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,590
which was clearly better.

595
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,830
But I think

596
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,200
a truly prosperous era

597
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,280
has perhaps not yet arrived.

598
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:23,350
Because the prosperity in my heart

599
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,070
should be clearer, stronger,
and more prosperous

600
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:30,110
than during the times
of Wen-Jing and Xuan.

601
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,690
Oh boy...

602
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,930
These two talked eloquently

603
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,400
and went on for so long.

604
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,740
But how can all that

605
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,160
be represented on a single polo ball?

606
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,190
In my opinion,

607
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,110
the Tribute Office

608
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,680
isn't necessarily full of useless people.

609
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,960
Perhaps His Majesty was too presumptuous.

610
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,880
This might simply be

611
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,010
an impossible task.

612
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,300
What makes Xijun special

613
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,510
is her unique perspective

614
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,960
on beautiful things.

615
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,720
Everything we've discussed

616
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,440
will serve as her reference

617
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:09,480
and ultimately be reflected in her design.

618
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,510
Right?

619
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,640
I've remembered everything you all said.

620
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,880
I do need to think it through carefully.

621
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,580
However,

622
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,810
I'd like to get some good sleep first.

623
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,510
Good idea.

624
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:24,410
Clear your mind and rest well

625
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,310
to gather your strength.

626
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,790
Then the design will

627
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,180
naturally come to you.

628
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,640

Less than 5 days until the final match.

637
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,950
Whether we can eliminate

638

the threat of Yenisei Kirghiz spies
before the tournament

639
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,690
depends on today's operation.

640
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,920
Perhaps this meeting

641
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,110
has nothing to do

642
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,830
with the international polo tournament.

643
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,880
Maybe it's just false intel.

Many people make it their profession.

648
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,970
Hey, Su Wuming,

649
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,660
why do you act like

650
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,550
this doesn't concern you?

651
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,980
What I mean is,

652
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,090
the closer we get to the big battle,

653
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,060
the more we should stay relaxed.

654
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,900
We should believe that

655
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,270
mere Yenisei Kirghiz forces

656
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,480
aren't enough to disrupt Chang'an.

What you're saying

658
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:00,480
does make some sense.

But I'm feeling better now.

So today I've decided

00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,440
to eat one serving of sushan,

681
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,750
then drink a bowl of wonton soup,

then eat sushan again,

then drink wonton soup again.

is heavily guarded.

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,469
to stay at the Bafang Inn.

757
00:34:32,590 --> 00:34:33,030
Well,

758
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,960
shall we leave for Dayan Pagoda now

759
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,219
to wait for Wolf there?

760
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:38,000
What's the rush?

761
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,960
The meeting time is at dusk.

762
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,760
Try this sushan first.

763
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,139
It tastes good.

764
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,710
Official Lu, Sheriff Su.

765
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,480
- Chief Administrator Xiong.
- Chief Administrator Xiong.

766
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,680
What brings you here?

767
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,590
His Majesty has ordered
Yongzhou Prefecture

768
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,880
to co-host
the international polo tournament.

769
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,560
Security must be our top priority.

770
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,590
Of course. As for catching spies,

771
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,590
that's not my expertise.

772
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,230
Naturally,

773
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,690
I'll leave that to you two.

774
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,460
But I'm anxious.

775
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,230
I couldn't just sit

776
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,710
in the county office anymore,

777
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,310
so I came personally
to oversee the operation.

778
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,570
How's it going?

779
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,110
Have you spotted
any suspicious individuals?

780
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,320
Not yet.

781
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,030
[Pei's Mansion]

782
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:54,780
Granduncle.

783
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,110
Xijun, I'm here to check on your progress.

784
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,510
Since the tournament is approaching.

785
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:00,030
I...

786
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,230
Granduncle, you've come at the right time.

787
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:02,400
The design plan is ready.

788
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,600
Please, come inside.

[Back Design Blueprint] [Five Grains]

790
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,570
This imperial polo ball design

791
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,400
is very simplistic.

792
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,670
I'm worried that His Majesty...

793
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,230
Granduncle, please convey my ideas

794
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:19,400
to His Majesty first.

795
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,800
If His Majesty doesn't like it,

796
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,800
I'll redesign it.

797
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,990
I suppose you're right.

798
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:30,820
[Back Design Blueprint] [Five Grains]

799
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,800
The golden dragon
represents our Tang Empire.

800
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,090
The dragon is the king of all beasts.

801
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:40,370
It commands the heavens
and crowns all spirits.

802
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:43,480
The dragon soars through the sky,
bringing auspicious energy from the east.

803
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,760
It not only has a good meaning,

804
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:47,160
but also symbolizes the mandate of heaven.

805
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,000
True power lies not in weapons,

806
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,180
but in the brilliance of virtue.

807
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,920
The prosperity of the nation

808
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,440
depends not only on vast territories

809
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:55,780
but on the wealth of its people.

810
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,960
[Body wrapped in high-quality animal hide]

811
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:02,230
Rice, millet, wheat, beans, and sorghum.

812
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,800
These 5 grains are the foundation
of people's survival.

813
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,930
Depicting the 5 grains on the polo ball

814
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,780
symbolizes abundant harvests

815
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,560
and the people's happiness.

816
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
Externally, all nations pay tribute,

817
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,200
bowing before our court.

818
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,760
Internally,

819
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,630
the people are well-clothed and well-fed,

820
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,980
singing as they play,

821
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:20,580
eating to their fill,

822
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,450
and dancing in the streets.

823
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:25,320
That is the sign of prosperity.

824
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,360
I wonder what Your Majesty thinks.

825
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,280
Good.

826
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,630
[Body wrapped in high-quality animal hide]

827
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,150
The golden dragon with the 5 grains

828
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,210
may appear simple,

829
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,890
but it perfectly matches my intentions.

830
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,320
The Retired Emperor

831
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,070
once praised you as a pillar of the state.

832
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:42,800
No, no.

833
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,210
Looking at this design,

834
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,630
the praise was well-deserved.

835
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,190
No, no.

836
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,270
Your Majesty, I dare not take credit.

837
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,680
This design was created by my relative,

838
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,070
Pei Xijun, daughter of Pei Jian.

839
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,300
Pei Xijun?

840
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:55,960
Yes.

841
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:58,350
I met her once at Chengfo Temple.

842
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,290
She truly is a talented woman.

843
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,990
Xijun hopes

844
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,210
that the ball

845
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,350
can be made with premium sandalwood

846
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:12,810
and wrapped with the finest

847
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,250
beast hide.

848
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,480
Of course.

849
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,580
Sandalwood is easy to obtain.

850
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,860
As for the hide...

851
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,190
Last year, among the precious tributes

852
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:30,280
from various nations that were displayed

853
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,710
at the Qu River banks by the
Court of the Imperial Treasury,

854
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,110
there were two luminous hides.

855
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,590
Attendant Yang,
do you remember that?

856
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,110
They were tributes from
the Byzantine Empire,

857
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,550
the hides of the Seven-Colored Beast.

858
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,030
The beast is the size of a rabbit.

859
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,920
Its rarity lies in its hide,

860
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,000
which emits a strange

861
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,230
seven-colored radiance under sunlight.

862
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,360
It's truly a wonder of the world.

863
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,510
I had planned to wait until
Your Majesty's birthday

864
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,960
to have something made for you with them.

865
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,800
Let's use those for the polo ball.

866
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,250
Only those two hides

867
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:54,360
are worthy of

868
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,340
this ingenious design.

869
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:56,840
Yes,

870
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,590
I'll get it from the Court
of the Imperial Treasury right away.

871
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,250
Deliver them directly to Pei.

872
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:04,930
I look forward to the final match day,

873
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,620
when the Imperial Polo Ball will shine.

874
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,850
Make no mistake

875
00:39:11,110 --> 00:39:12,630
during preparation.

876
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:15,360
Otherwise, you will be held responsible.

877
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,280
Your Majesty.

878
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:38,780
Pei Mian

879
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,710
isn't considered
one of Her Highness's people.

880
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:41,360
But he has never

881
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,760
shown loyalty to Your Majesty.

882
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,360
Moreover,

883
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,070
he openly defied Your Majesty
the other day.

884
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,270
In my humble opinion,

885
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,290
I fear he has

886
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,150
already secretly allied with Her Highness.

887
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:52,010
Therefore, we should use
this polo tournament

888
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,700
to seize his weakness.

889
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,810
I am tired again.

890
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,160
Even if Pei Mian doesn't object,

891
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
it's not certain

892
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,500
if I can

893
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,420
triumph on the polo field.

894
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,320
Tell Yin

895
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,280
to prepare the gastrodia powder soon.

896
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:12,670
Yes.

897
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,670
Do you like this one?

898
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:25,920
Yes, I do.

899
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,450
I'll wrap it up for you.

900
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,480
Sachets and pendants!

901
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,400
What would you two like to buy?

902
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,670
Trinkets!

903
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,880
All kinds of trinkets!

904
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,720
Sachets and pendants!

905
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,880
Take a look!

906
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,510
Look around!

907
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Look, over there.

908
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,770
Why does that man in red

909
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,760
look familiar to me?

910
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,340
That beard looks strange.

911
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,030
It must be a disguise.

912
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,360
Sir, if you bring that fan

913
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,320
home to your wife,

914
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,840
she'll surely love it.

915
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,900
Quickly, seize those two!

916
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,550
You!

917
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,110
They're clearly spies.

918
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:37,150
What are you waiting for?

919
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:37,840
Arrest them!
