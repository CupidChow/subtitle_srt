Finally got it after waiting for so long.

00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:42,640
Yes.

5
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,070

has been urinated on by a Fengli beast.

61
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,350
It really has the smell of Fengli fluid,

How much for a Fengli beast?

72
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,360
You're from the county office.

73
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,920

do I look like someone
from the county office?

head ailment.

82

Then just buy some Fengli fluid

83
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,020
for them.

84
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,360
I have some here.

85
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,160
Here, a whole jar of it.

86
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,690
How much do you want?

87
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,270
But think carefully before you decide.

88
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,390
This one's expensive,

89
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,020
10,000 coins per tael.

90
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,510
How much?

91
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,830
Your Fengli cane is so cheap.

92
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,520
Why is this one so expensive?

93
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,960
How can you compare them?

94
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,430
These few pieces of broken wood

95
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,600
are good for nothing.

96
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,750
All those talk

97
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,430
about killing beasts and evil
with one point,

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,390
and summoning good things

99
00:05:56,390 --> 00:05:58,159
with another point

100
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,680
are just lies.

101
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,360
What I have here

102
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,680
is truly something special.

103
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,720
What is rheumatism?

104
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,350
It's when your body goes numb

105
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,960
and becomes paralyzed.

106
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,130
After using this stuff,

107
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:16,800
you'll be able to walk swiftly again.

108
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,510
So, is 10,000 coins still expensive?

109
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,190
Is it?

110
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,720
It's so expensive, does anyone buy it?

111
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,560
Whether people buy it or not

112
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,800
is none of your business. Really.

113
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:37,480

is on the case. Answer truthfully.

114
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,480
I just said

115
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,190
I wasn't from the county office.

116
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,680
I didn't say she wasn't.

117
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,690
Just answer his question truthfully.

118
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,360
Young lady, this is

119
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,230
really a century-old shop.

120
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,630
This shop was opened

121
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,840
when I was 80 years old.

122
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,560
This year marks exactly 100 years.

123
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,560
You're 180 years old?

124
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,950
I didn't come to hear your tall tales.

125
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,250
Tell me the truth.

126
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,950
What I mean is,

127
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,770
in the first few decades after opening,

128
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,600
someone did come and pay high prices

129
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,160
for the Fengli fluid.

130
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Though my shop is in a remote location,

131
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,300
it was once crowded with customers.

132
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,370
I don't know who

133
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,430
came up with

134
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
a prescription for rheumatism.

135
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,730
How despicable of them

136
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,960
to cut off my livelihood.

137
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,159
So this jar

138
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,130
has been sealed for over a decade,

139
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,000
and no one has shown any interest.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,200
That's why the urine scent

141
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:41,300
is so strong.

142
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:43,370
No, no!

143
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,159
I mean medicinal fragrance!

144
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,230
You're saying in the past decade or so,

145
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,820
you haven't sold it even once?

146
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,400
No, never sold it.

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,120
Look at all the dust on this jar.

148
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,600
This person is cunning.

149
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,310
It doesn't sound like the truth.

150
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:07,840
See?

151
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,930
The officer is suspicious of you.

152
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,360
Well, there's no choice then.

153
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
We'll have to take you
to Yongzhou Prefecture's

154
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,500

155
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,070
for questioning.

156
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,800
No, no!

157
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,950
These old bones of mine

158
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,510
can't handle such trouble.

159
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,270
I have it!

160
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,430
I've recorded every customer's purchase

161
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:26,260
in my ledger.

162
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,680
I'll bring it to you right away.

163
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,240
I'll...

164
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,930
I'll get it for you right away.

165
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,909
If you find any important clues,

166
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,840
don't forget to credit me.

167
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,630
Of course.

168
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,390
He escaped.

169
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,750
The situation below is unclear.
We need to be careful.

170
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,360
We can't just

171
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,750
watch him get away.

172
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,160
Such an impatient temperament.

173
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:22,960
Are you okay?

174
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:23,670
I'm fine.

175
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,830
I think he's over there.

176
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,870
What kind of place is this?

177
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
If that old man is really
over 100 years old,

178
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,560
wouldn't he have fallen apart just now?

179
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,470
Chang'an is vast
and encompasses everything.

180
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,870
It's normal to find extraordinary people

181
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,840
in the city.

182
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,840
According to my mentor's records,

183
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
the Sifang Cane Shop

184
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,440
has been open for more than 70 years.

185
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:04,140
The shopkeeper has long been over
100 years old.

186
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,200
From Master Di's records?

187
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,260
That must have been over a decade ago.

188
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,180
Could it be that

189
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,800
the shopkeeper is really
some ancient demon?

190
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:13,870
Stop!

191
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,670
I'll kill you!

192
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,670
Run if you dare!

193
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,000
Go ahead, run!

194
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,030
Looking for someone?

195
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,200
I know all of Chang'an's

196
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,600
most skilled assassins.

197
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,480
I know the cheapest ones too.

198
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,120
Get lost.

199
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,430
Sir.

200
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,910
The House of Sorrow
has a new top courtesan.

201
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,040
Let's go for a drink.

202
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,000
Young lady, are you here
at the Ghost Market

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,910
to look for work?

204
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,480
The House of Sorrow is a good place.

205
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,870
Many officials and nobles
have visited lately.

206
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,120
They're very generous,

207
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,240
and you have a chance to marry

208
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,630
into a good family this way.

209
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:56,160
Get lost.

210
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:00,740
This old man

211
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
escaped to the Ghost Market.

212
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,430
It'll be hard to find him now.

213
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,240
Why did he run away?

214
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,340
Should I not have

215
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,760
scared him with my sword?

216
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,710
He must have done something illegal

217
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,440
and is afraid of officials.

218
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,170
Perhaps

219
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,770
he really did sell Fengli beasts before.

220
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,360
Does he really have Fengli beasts?

221
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,280
Of course. If not,

222
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,030
where did he get those Fengli canes

223
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:24,690
and fluids?

224
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,230
Being able to uncover

225
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,360
the Wei family's merit-record pillar

226
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,020
must have been heaven's will.

227
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,550
It's also your ancestors' blessing.

228
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,320
That's why they were discovered.

229
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:42,840
Wei,

230
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:43,960
I'm late.

231
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,550
Lu,

232
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,320
Miss Pei.

233
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,890
Chancellor Cui.

234
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,670
Official Lu.

235
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,900
Since everyone is here,

236
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,160
let's take our seats.

237
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,460
Master Cui of Qinghe,
please take the seat of honor.

238
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,480
You are a minister in the court,

239
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,440
you should sit in the place of honor.

240
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,630
We won't consider official ranks today.

241
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,860
You should have the seat of honor.

242
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,780
I'll just sit beside you.

243
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:11,840
Gentlemen,

244
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:13,480
let's offer this seat

245
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,620
to Official Lu.

246
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,420
This...

247
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,510
This isn't appropriate.

248
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,570
No need to decline.

249
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,390
As a member of the Lu family of Fanyang,

250
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,270
it's most fitting for you to sit there.

251
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,210
It's fitting.

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,960
Yes, it's fitting.

253
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:25,920
Fitting.

254
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,440
I'll respectfully comply.

255
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:32,400
Miss Pei came with Lu,

256
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,720
so she should sit next to him.

257
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,950
Everyone, please be seated.

258
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,670
Alright.

259
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,270
This way.

260
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:41,750
Please.

261
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,320
Please.

262
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,140
Please.

263
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:50,790
Today, Wei Tao of the capital
is hosting a family banquet.

264
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,850
Everyone present, regardless of age

265
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:53,790
or gender,

266
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:55,750
is from a noble family.

267
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,840
Let me introduce everyone in turn.

268
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,900
-This...
-Wei Tao.

269
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:02,510
Just have everyone introduce themselves.

270
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,200
As for me,

271
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,200
you may call me

272
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,150
Master Cui of Qinghe.

273
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,480
Lu Lingfeng of Fanyang.

274
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:25,440
Cui Shi of Boling.

275
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,750
Pei Xijun of Hedong.

276
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,270
Wang Dezhao of Taiyuan.

277
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,000
Zheng Ying of Xingyang.

278
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,930
Wang Boyu of Langya.

279
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,150
Li Shiyue of Zhaojun.

280
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,000
Yang Xuan of Hongnong.

281
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,270
Liu Gongda of Hedong.

282
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,860
Xiao Bang of Lanling.

283
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,440
Gao Tai of Bohai.

284
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,120
Everyone,

285
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:57,590
please enjoy.

286
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,120
Madam, they've started the banquet.

287
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,440
When should we invite the guests
to view the merit-record pillar?

288
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,570
I'll go prepare now.

289
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,840
The merit-record pillar...

290
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,000
Jia, you look especially beautiful today.

291
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,930
Drink this tea.

292
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,650
You'll look more beautiful with each sip.

293
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,740
Have her drink the tea.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
Make sure she finishes it all.

295
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,330
Understood.

296
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,630
Miss, please drink your tea.

297
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,350
The merit-record pillar...

298
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,520
Our Wei family's merit-record pillar

299
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,550
reach to the clouds!

300
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:58,920
[Wei family of Jingzhao, Wei Jia]

301
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,880
After several rounds of drinks,

302
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,820
I'd like to say a few words.

303
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,850
Today, you are our most honored guest.

304
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,070
We'd like to hear your insights.

305
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,800
In the Later Han Dynasty,
the great scholars,

306
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,000
Yuan An of Runan,

307
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,720
and Yang Zhen of Hongnong

308
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,670
studied classics diligently
when out of the office,

309
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:26,000
and feared no power when in court.

310
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:29,000
The prestigious families of Runan
and Hongnong

311
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,400
thus became renowned throughout the land.

312
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,320
For four generations after,

313
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,240
they served as pillars of the state.

314
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,630
During the Three Kingdoms period,

315
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,230
the Wei, Shu, and Wu Kingdoms

316
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,720
had rulers from humble origins.

317
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,370
But the officials who held real power,

318
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,000
like Sima Yi, Zhuge Liang, and Lu Xun,

319
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,150
all hailed from prestigious families.

320
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,710
It was said that
the Cui and Lu families were inseparable.

321
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:58,600
Lu Lingfeng, please continue.

322
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,230
Chen Qun of Yingchuan

323
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,680
established the

324
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,770
Nine-Rank Official System in Wei.

325
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,440
The Sima family of Henei

326
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,610
then unified the Three Kingdoms.

327
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,990
Official Lu, you're too kind.

328
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,960
Well, allow me.

329
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,550
During the Eastern Jin,

330
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,510
the Wang and Ma families shared power.

331
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:37,950
The Wang, Xie, Yuan, and Xiao families
represented the South,

332
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,160
while the North had
the Cui, Lu, Zheng, and Wang families.

333
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,840
Xie An achieved victory at Fei River,

334
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,750
and Cui Hao unified the North.

335
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,630
So many talents of that time

336
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,670
were the glory of our noble families.

337
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,270
But by the early Sui Dynasty,

338
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:02,300
they abolished
the Nine-Rank Official System

339
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,790
and established the imperial examination.

340
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:07,650
Sons of noble families
seeking official positions

341
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,670
had to take these examinations.

342
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,880
They left their hometowns,

343
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,880
causing their ancestral lands
to fall into ruin.

344
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,230
With family members scattered

345
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,550
and genealogical records lost,

346
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,720
the glory was gone.

347
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:21,450
Therefore,

348
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,930
today's banquet is of great significance.

349
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,110
We view the Wei family's
merit-record pillar

350
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,980
to remind us of our ancestors' glory,

351
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,450
and remind future generations

352
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,580
not to sink into decline.

353
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,000
Well said!

354
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,120
The dynasty of the Li family from Longxi

355
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,720
was fortunate to have you

356
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,590
as their chancellor.

357
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,350
Master Cui, you're too kind.

358
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:49,450
Master Cui,

359
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,050
best not let those words spread.

360
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,200
Sheriff Wei,

361
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,440
can we see your family's newly unearthed

362
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,220
merit-record pillar now?

363
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,110
Of course.

364
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:02,390
Servants,

365
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,040
send for my wife.

366
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,750
Then I invite Master Cui, Chancellor Cui,

367
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,990
and Brother Lu

368
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,310
to unveil the merit-record pillars.

369
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:26,960
No.

370
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,410
The family treasure
of the Wei family of Jingzhao

371
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:33,960
should be unveiled by you, Wei Tao.

372
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,040
Very well.

373
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,110
Then I invite my wife to join me.

374
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:01,510
Look!

375
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:03,760
This is the glory of the Wei family!

376
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:11,440
The Wei and Du families from the South
have been close for generations.

377
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,790
Sheriff Wei, I heard your wife

378
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,740
is from the Du family of Jingzhao.

379
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,140
Thank you all for honoring us
with your presence

380
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,160
[Wei Tao's wife, Ju Niang]

381
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,310
to witness

382
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,140
our Wei family treasure together.

383
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,370
This is also the honor

384
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,030
of the Wei family of Jingzhao.

385
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:33,350
My husband and I thank you all.

386
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,160
To have a merit-record pillar unearthed

387
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,820
is truly fortunate!

388
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,830
Is this a merit-record pillar
from the Wei-Jin period?

389
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,030
It's at least a relic
from the Northern Dynasties.

390
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,480
Miss Pei has a discerning eye.

391
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,810
It is indeed from the Northern Dynasties.

392
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,790
Wonderful!

393
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,200
It's just a pity

394
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,650
that the character 'Wei' is missing.

395
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
Have you gone to the excavation site

396
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,360
to search thoroughly

397
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,350
and dig around?

398
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,220
We haven't found it yet.

399
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:09,430
But I believe

400
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:12,890
what belongs to the Wei family
will eventually return.

401
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,640
Well said.

402
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,420
County Sheriff Wei,
I've heard your wife is virtuous

403
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,240
and very knowledgeable.

404
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:22,880
Why not invite her

405
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:25,200
to read what's written
on this merit-record pillar

406
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,510
for all of us to hear?

407
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,930
Chancellor Cui,

408
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,410
I dare not follow your command.

409
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,030
This pillar is the Wei family's treasure.

410
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,310
The inscription
should be read by my husband

411
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,640
to all of you gentlemen.

412
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,350
Truly a lady from a noble family

413
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,680
with sound mannerisms and reasoning.

414
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,790
Wei Tao.

415
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,410
The Wei family of ministers

416
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,240
was the most prominent clan
of the three regions.

417
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,600
Our ancestor, Wei Meng,

418
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,000
lived for generations in Qi and Lu.

419
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:09,870
He studied Zhou rituals
and the Book of Documents,

420
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,630
and passed down Lu's poetry.

421
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,720
Our family's scholarly tradition

422
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,920
was renowned throughout the land.

423
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,780
When Wei Xian became chancellor,

424
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,240
he assisted Emperors Zhao and Xuan

425
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,000
and was granted
the title of Marquis of Fuyang.

426
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,600
Later, he moved to Chang'an.

427
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,510
The family nurtured generations
of high officials and marquises

428
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,040
in the Han and Wei-Jin period,
producing many notable figures.

429
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,350
During the
Southern and Northern Dynasties,

430
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,020
in the South there was Wei Rui,

431
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,310
and in the North there was Wei Xiaokuan.

432
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,310
They were both pillars of the state.

433
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,820
From the west of Xiao Mountain

434
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,310
to the lands within Hangu Pass,

435
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:45,030
it was the most prominent clan,
nurturing ministers for generations.

436
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:46,290
Among noble families,

437
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:49,680
none surpassed the Wei clan.

438
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:53,510
Excellent!

439
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,750
Let us drink three cups

440
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,550
to honor the Wei ancestors.

441
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,750
Excellent!

442
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,000
Let's drink heartily!

443
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,640
My wife,

444
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,480
join me in paying respects to our guests.

445
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:08,390
Servants!

446
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,480
Bring wine!

447
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:15,960
Wei.

448
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,350
Congratulations, Wei.

449
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,310
Thank you.

450
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:21,480
You are the daughter of Vice Minister Pei,

451
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,580
Xijun, aren't you?

452
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:24,650
Before I was married,

453
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,750
during spring outings by the Qu River,

454
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:28,270
we played polo together.

455
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:32,270
I remember now.

456
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:33,720
I was still young then.

457
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,520
Juniang,

458
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,480
you were outstanding on the polo field.

459
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,880
It's wonderful to meet again.

460
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,540
Let's visit each other often.

461
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,380
Certainly.

462
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:42,500
-Come on.
-Please.

463
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,160
Please.

464
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,660
The merit-record pillars

465
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,480
placed at the family gate

466
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,030
record the merits of ancestors.

467
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:53,280
The left pillar is called "Fa,"

468
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:56,130
and the right pillar is called "Yue."

469
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,970
Therefore, "Fayue" is often used

470
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,250
to refer to noble families.

471
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,600
I was born into
the Wei family of Jingzhao.

472
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:21,160
I am a lady from a noble family.

473
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,970
I cannot marry a merchant.

474
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,050
I cannot marry a merchant.

475
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,910
I shouldn’t marry a businessman!

476
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,450
Sister-in-law.

477
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,890
Jia...

478
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,550
I shouldn’t marry a businessman.

479
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:40,400
-I shouldn’t marry a businessman.
-I’m sorry. My sister is still sick.

480
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,460
Please forgive us.

481
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,430
Servants, take her back.

482
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,440
No!

483
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,780
The merit-record pillar is here.

484
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,770
I've disgraced the Wei family.

485
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,940
I've disgraced the Wei family!

486
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,150
I should kill myself!

487
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,860
Such madness.

488
00:23:59,070 --> 00:23:59,880
Take her back immediately!

489
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,880
I am from the Wei family of Jingzhao.

490
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,660
I am a woman of noble birth.

491
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,980
-I shouldn’t marry a businessman.
-Jia!

492
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:09,030
Sister-in-law, I was wrong.

493
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:12,340
Official Lu.

494
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,320
Let me toast you specially.

495
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,070
Chancellor Cui,
I should be the one toasting you.

496
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,070
It's all the same.

497
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,510
The wind is gentle
and the moon is bright today.

498
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,550
Join me for a walk in the courtyard.

499
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:31,880
Alright.

500
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,790
Official Lu, how was the banquet?

501
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,400
I'm glad

502
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,880
to have attended the banquet tonight.

503
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,070
I feel the same way.

504
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,580
Wei Tao's sudden invitation

505
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,890
was my suggestion.

506
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,110
Surprised?

507
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,640
It is somewhat unexpected.

508
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,110
The Wei family's discovery
of their merit-record pillar

509
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,110
is not just the Wei family's affair.

510
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,960
It's also a grand event for Chang'an,

511
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,000
and moreover,

512
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,200
a celebration for all noble families
of the Tang Empire.

513
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,010
However,

514
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,120
families like Wei and Du,

515
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:12,270
compared to our Cui and Lu families,

516
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:14,240
still fall short.

517
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:15,680
You know this

518
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,680
very well.

519
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:20,930
People say Cui and Lu

520
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,800
are the most prestigious families
of our time.

521
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,830
Cui and Lu.

522
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,200
Where there's Lu, there's Cui,

523
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,920
and vice versa.

524
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,200
I've had a few drinks today,

525
00:25:33,310 --> 00:25:35,110
and I have some heartfelt words.

526
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,210
Would you like to hear them?

527
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,640
Please speak freely, Chancellor Cui.

528
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,640
Miss!

529
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,960
Let go of me! I won't!

530
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,240
Xijun, I've troubled you.

531
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,310
Not at all.

532
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,640
I met Miss Wei

533
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,370
when I was young, too.

534
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,550
Yes.

535
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,620
She was there that spring day
by the Qu River.

536
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,260
What illness does she have now?

537
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:06,390
It's what common people call madness.

538
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,110
Have you consulted a doctor?

539
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,110
Of course we have.

540
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,920
We even got medicine prescribed.

541
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,200
But it barely helps.

542
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,040
She can't handle any shock.

543
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,720
Strong emotions of any kind affect her.

544
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,680
I have a friend.

545
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,510
He's a disciple
of the Medicine King, Sun Simiao.

546
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,440
Back in Luoyang,

547
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,640
he cured the princess
of the human-faced flower poison.

548
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,620
If you trust me,

549
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,200
I can invite him another day

550
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,540
to treat Miss Wei Jia.

551
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:33,510
That would be wonderful.

552
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:35,510
On behalf of my sister,

553
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,170
I thank you in advance, Xijun.

554
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,400
You're too kind.

555
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,640
In today's Chang'an,

556
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,880
there's talk of Su and Lu.

557
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:44,160
Do you know about it?

558
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,940
That person is very cunning.

559
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,160
He always uses the empire

560
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,590
and Di Renjie as a front to control you,

561
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,310
all to achieve his personal gain.

562
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,510
You must be careful.

563
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,640
Chancellor Cui, you may have some

564
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,700
misunderstandings about Su Wuming.

565
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,790
He always gives people

566
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,510
the impression of being indifferent
to fame and fortune.

567
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,550
But in reality,

568
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,040
his heart is full of hypocrisy.

569
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,230
He's not the same kind of person
as our families,

570
00:27:15,350 --> 00:27:17,010
who are educated in classics.

571
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,130
You and I

572
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,470
are elite nobles.

573
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,640
We must be true to our inner ideals.

574
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,960
In my eyes,

575
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:31,110
the emperor is not important.

576
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,350
You should know

577
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,230
that the current emperor

578
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,310
was once my neighbor.

579
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,110
If I had wanted,

580
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,030
when the emperor ascended the throne,

581
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,760
I could have become a new noble.

582
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,030
I didn't do that.

583
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,690
Because

584
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,030
I am not the villain people say I am,

585
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,540
nor have I attached myself to the princess

586
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,500
to gain power for myself.

587
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,480
My ideal is to be like Cui Hao,

588
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:07,110
the great minister of Northern Wei,

589
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,440
and establish

590
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,000
a court where scholarship

591
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,350
and nobility are united.

592
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:11,950
Of course,

593
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,010
he ultimately failed.

594
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,900
But I'm still striving for it.

595
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,920
Once successful,

596
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,000
His Majesty will merely be a figurehead.

597
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,270
While the affairs of state

598
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,070
will be managed by us nobles.

599
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,350
Just like in the Eastern Jin Dynasty.

600
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,000
By then,

601
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,000
the talented men from our
Cui, Lu, Zheng, and Wang families

602
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,460
can take turns governing.

603
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,200
Our families

604
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,590
have held high positions for centuries.

605
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:35,030
We certainly know better than His Majesty

606
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,640
how to govern the country

607
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,490
and bring peace to the people.

608
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,400
Scholarship

609
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,590
and nobility united in one court.

610
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,520
That's right.

611
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,540
What makes nobility precious?

612
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,510
First,

613
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,790
it's the unbroken tradition
of family learning.

614
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,990
Just like our families.

615
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,040
It brings me comfort

616
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,370
that you came to the banquet today.

617
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:13,270
Since the Proscription
of the Partisan Families in Eastern Han,

618
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,540
for these 500 years,

619
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,230
the fate of all noble families

620
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,400
has been tied together.

621
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,510
We should have been of one mind long ago.

622
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,440
Don't you agree?

623
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,560
What I've told you tonight

624
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,310
are all words from the bottom of my heart.

625
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,270
In my heart,

626
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,550
Cui and Lu outweigh everything else,

627
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,150
including the Tang Emperor,

628
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:33,550
and even the princess
I've always followed,

629
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,160
who holds great power.

630
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:37,720
Dynasties may change,

631
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,560
but those enjoying good reputations

632
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,440
are not them.

633
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,750
It's we who will never fall

634
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,770
on the imperial path.

635
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,110
Isn't that so?

636
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,650
Many of your words

637
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,480
are greatly agreeable wth me.

638
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,180
However,

639
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,880
why are you telling me all this?

640
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,880
You should know His Majesty's character.

641
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,160
He's wary of people like us.

642
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,110
What he wants

643
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,120
is to hold absolute power

644
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,590
and cast us nobles aside.

645
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:15,170
But if the princess replaces him,

646
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:17,110
she might delegate power to us.

647
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,720
Moreover,

648
00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:20,960
the princess is your birth mother.

649
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,490
Whether from filial duty

650
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:24,550
or from the perspective

651
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,830
of noble families' ideals,

652
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,480
you should make a choice.

653
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,280
As for which side to stand with,

654
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:32,790
you should know in your heart.

655
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,350
A mere Judicial Official title

656
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:39,680
is too humble
for the Lu family of Fanyang.

657
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,640
To become a general or chancellor

658
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,830
and govern the nation
on behalf of His Majesty,

659
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,690
that is your future, Lu Lingfeng.

660
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,640
The master of this house, Wei Tao,

661
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,270
though now only a county sheriff,

662
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,230
comes from a noble background.

663
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,280
In the future,

664
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,970
he will be someone we can use.

665
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:07,390
[Wei Mansion]

666
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,530
Wei, are you all right?

667
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,400
I'm fine.

668
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,240
Sorry, I drank too much today.

669
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,300
Lu, Miss Pei.

670
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,000
It's my honor to have you both

671
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,590
visit my humble home.

672
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,440
I'm truly grateful.

673
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,470
You're too kind, Wei.

674
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,220
It's an honor to view

675
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,920
the Wei family's merit-record pillar

676
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,440
and recall the glory
of the noble families.

677
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,040
Farewell.

678
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:45,910
Farewell.

679
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,110
Farewell.

680
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,640
Dragging me out
in the middle of the night...

681
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,380
I'm Boss Fei now,

682
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,400
and the Chicken Master of Tang.

683
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,590
How can we come to the Ghost Market,

684
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,830
such a dark place?

685
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:11,310
Stop rambling.

686
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:14,770
According to my mentor Master Di's book,

687
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,480
that old shop owner

688
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,490
is surnamed Song.

689
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,280
He claims to be 180 years old.

690
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,410
I don't believe it.

691
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,410
But if that shop has been open
for 100 years,

692
00:32:23,590 --> 00:32:25,730
then he must be at least 120.

693
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,520
And that cane shop is connected
to the Ghost Market

694
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,030
via a secret passage.

695
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,750
You've been around the Ghost Market
for decades,

696
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,070
haven't you heard about it?

697
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,400
Actually, no.

698
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,350
But there are a few old monsters

699
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,590
who are over 100 years old.

700
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,880
They mostly hang around
the Earth God Temple.

701
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,590
The Ghost Market
has an Earth God Temple?

702
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,030
Sure enough, bringing Mr. Fei along

703
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,660
will show us where to look.

704
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,310
Of course.

705
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,970
Wait, that's not right.

706
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:00,220
In the Ghost Market,

707
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:02,510
at this hour and this location,

708
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,070
it should be bustling with life.

709
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,200
I'll go ask around.

710
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,130
Wait here,

711
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,420
and don't mess around.

712
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,570
Especially you.

713
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,880
Even if you're a secret agent
of Yongzhou Prefecture,

714
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,540
you can't just draw your sword

715
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,830
whenever you want.

716
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:23,070
Yes, I'll listen to you, Mr. Fei.

717
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,310
I must catch that shop owner.

718
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,960
He got away

719
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,130
right under my nose.

720
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,600
It really infuriates me.

721
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,070
You're still too young.

722
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,880
Such a temper.

723
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,680
Good to be young.

724
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,620
The Ghost Market nowadays

725
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,160
is full of strange happenings.

726
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,070
What's wrong?

727
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,310
The Ghost Market now even has

728
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,570
a Zoroastrian temple.

729
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,350
A Zoroastrian temple?

730
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,060
See?

731
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,040
It's stealing all the attention

732
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:05,350
from the Earth God Temple.

733
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,750
I heard that in recent days,

734
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,610
it's been very lively over there.

735
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:10,150
Why don't I

736
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,409
take you there to check it out?

737
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,090
Sounds good.

738
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:15,320
Let's go.

739
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,560
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

740
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,110
Why are you elbow-locking me again?

741
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,840
Just behave.

742
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,190
Where to? It's here.

743
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,940
I only found these two.

744
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,840
Maybe

745
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:33,040
you shouldn't go, Yingtao.

746
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,000
Not bad, Fei.

747
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,120
Of course.

748
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,900
This Ghost Market is

749
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,070
my kingdom, Fei Yingjun's domain!

750
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,080
Mr. Fei, you're so capable,

751
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,480
why don't you help me

752
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,070
find the shop owner?

753
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:49,969
You think I can't find him?

754
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,150
Go on in.

755
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,550
This reverse psychology on Fei

756
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,880
really works.

757
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:03,290
Let's go.

758
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,630
What's wrong?

759
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,840
Why are you so sad?

760
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,280
My father has been missing for days.

761
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,480
No sign of him, dead or alive.

762
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,820
How can I not be sad?

763
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,090
What about you?

764
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,230
I... I'm here looking for my brother.

765
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:48,800
Where does your brother do business?

766
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,630
In the West Market. He sells spices.

767
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,130
Is your father also a merchant?

768
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,070
Father owns the largest

769
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,110
fabric business in the East Market.

770
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,280
I've already prayed to the
Zoroastrian god

771
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,960
at the Buzheng District for protection.

772
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,820
But it seems completely useless,

773
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,840
so I came to the Ghost Market

774
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,450
to seek divine protection again.

775
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,000
Shi Qiansui.

776
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,610
Who's there?

777
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,360
Su Wuming pays his respects
to the High Priest.

778
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,070
Su Wuming?

779
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,800
Didn't we just meet today

780
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,630
at the Buzheng District?

781
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,550
Did you

782
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,950
forget about me already?

783
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,190
You followed me?

784
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:11,360
Not at all.

785
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:13,590
It's just a coincidence.

786
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,880
High Priest,
you truly deserve your title as

787
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
the leader of the An Society.

788
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,550
Not only are you
the biggest spice merchant

789
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,400
in both East and West Markets,

790
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,840
you also receive a salary from the court,

791
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,660
and you even managed to build

792
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,210
a Xian temple here in the Ghost Market
to collect money.

793
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,670
You're truly impressive.

794
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:33,670
I didn't build this temple.

795
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,320
The merchants of the Ghost Market

796
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,760
built it on their own initiative.

797
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,760
I came today

798
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,260
not to collect money,

799
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,920
but to pray sincerely.

800
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:44,190
They say in the Ghost Market,

801
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,320
one can get closer
to the spirits of the dead.

802
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,580
And all these proceeds

803
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,320
will be donated to the An Society

804
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,190
to take care of the funeral arrangements

805
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:52,880
for those merchants who died tragically.

806
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,150
So you're saying,

807
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:57,280
besides Hua Fu, Ma Kui,

808
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,710
and He Qian,

809
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,840
other merchants have died too?

810
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,920
Here, take a look for yourself.

811
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,360
[Qin Zhiyuan, Jewelry Merchant]
[Zhao Shisi, Silk Merchant]

812
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,290
There are actually 6 people?

813
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:19,110
Yes.

814
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,850
They all disappeared
within the last 10 days.

815
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,110
The High Priest's Office
compiled this list.

816
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,500
Besides their names,

817
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,710
it also shows their occupations,

818
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:30,290
approximate time of disappearance,

819
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,330
and the district they were

820
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:34,800
last seen in.

821
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:39,250
Why didn't you mention this

822
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,760
at the Buzheng District today?

823
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,960
That guy from the Lu family of Fanyang,

824
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,150
I don't trust him.

825
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,620
What's wrong with him?

826
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,620
At the end of the day, those nobles

827
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,590
despise us merchants.

828
00:38:57,190 --> 00:38:58,000
Where has Mr. Fei

829
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,840
gone?

830
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,280
The Ghost Market is so big.

831
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,480
Where should we look?

832
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,190
Did you bring
the map of Chang'an districts?

833
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:06,800
Yes, I did.

834
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,730
What would you two like to eat?

835
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,780
Just borrowing your lamp.

836
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,400
Xingdao, Anren, Anyi.

837
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,320
Shanhe, Da'an, Chonghua.

838
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,210
Hua Fu died in Fengle District.

839
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,750
[Fengle District]

840
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,020
Ma Kui died in Jinggong District.

841
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,360
[Jinggong District]

842
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,350
He Qian died in Yanzuo District.

843
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,490
[Yanzuo District]

844
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:56,170
[Imperial City] [Fengle District]
[Jinggong District]
[Yanzuo District] [Tongji District]

845
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:02,290
[West Market] [Yanping Gate]

846
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:05,040
[East Market] [Yanxing Gate]

847
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,190
[Imperial City] [Mingde Gate]

848
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,720
[Anbei Gate] [Mingde Gate] [Qixia Gate]

849
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:18,450
[Tongji District]

850
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,810
[Imperial City]

851
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:24,240
[Noble]

852
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,320
Yingtao, Tongji District, now.

853
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,730
I've already sent Liu, Jia, and Luo

854
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,480
to search for bodies
in the other districts on the map.

855
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,080
Su Wuming.

856
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,060
You've become quite impressive.

857
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,200
Chang'an is so vast,

858
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:43,030
yet you somehow know
where murders have occurred.

859
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,000
We've been running for hours.

860
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,400
Say something, will you?

861
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm getting bored.

862
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,510
It's past curfew.
Who goes there in the night?

863
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,970
We're from the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

864
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,360
Tonight's password,

865
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,110
Chentaoxie.

866
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,110
Xiangji Temple.

867
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,320
So it's Mr. Su.

868
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,020
You know me?

869
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:12,630
During the Black Tea case investigation,

870
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,280
I was a minor soldier under the General.

871
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
I had the honor to participate,

872
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,480
and now I'm a captain.

873
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,130
So you're an old acquaintance.

874
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:21,280
You should continue your patrol.

875
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,710
I need to continue my investigation.

876
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:24,550
So you're investigating another case.

877
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,880
Do you need assistance?

878
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,550
No, no need.

879
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:29,480
Farewell.

880
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:30,960
Su Wuming.

881
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:31,960
Horses.

882
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,120
Right, I completely forgot about that.

883
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,920
Could I borrow two horses?
