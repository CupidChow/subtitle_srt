To Chang'an]

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,900
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,729
Grand General.

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
You're awake.

5
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,950
Don't scratch it!

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,229
You have to tend it well.

7
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,390
The wound will mend within ten days.

8
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,759
You must be

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,370
the Miracle Doctor Fei who saved my life?

10
00:01:58,039 --> 00:01:59,509
That's me.

11
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,480
Jsut call me Master Ji.

12
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,790
Or Benefactor, if you prefer.

13
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,199
Go get Lu Lingfeng.

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,360
Fei.

15
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,250
Here's the wine I got for you.

16
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,840
[Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart]

17
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,590
You're back just in time.

18
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,120
He's asking for you inside.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,890
The Grand General is awake!

20
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,180
[Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart]

21
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,540
Grand General.

22
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,760
Rest assured,

23
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,329
no matter when

24
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,280
or what injustice I suffer,

25
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,170
I, Lu Lingfeng,

26
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,030
will never harbor any personal grudge

27
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,230
against His Majesty.

28
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,120
Because my heart

29
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,450
remains loyal to the Tang Empire.

30
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,280
Good.

31
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,280
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,770
Prepare the horses.
Follow me to the palace.

33
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,120
You can't ride a horse yet.

34
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,750
I must see His Majesty immediately

35
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,780
to recommend you as my successor.

36
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,730
Grand General!

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,260
I must see the Emperor.

38
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,470
From today on,

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,220
you will be the Grand General
of the Right Imperial Guards.

40
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,280
Fei!

41
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,790
Master Ji!

42
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,420
-General.
-General.

43
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,000
Fei!

44
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,800
Don't move me!

45
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,120
My ribs

46
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,830
and my leg bones

47
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:00,560
are broken in at least four places.

48
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,480
Be gentle.

49
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,190
In this world,

50
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,000
the only person who can set his own bones

51
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,000
is none other than me, Fei Yingjun.

52
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,390
Fei, stop bragging.

53
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,550
Look how exhausted Miss Xijun is.

54
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,190
Xijun is clever
and has medicine knowledge.

55
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,520
She learns quickly.

56
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,850
Otherwise,

57
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,280
I, Master Ji, would be finished.

58
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,270
You saved my life.

59
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,160
I should repay you.

60
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,310
Xijun,

61
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,630
open my right hand.

62
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,020
A feather from the raptor?

63
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,350
Master Ji,

64
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,690
in that moment of danger,

65
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,890
you still thought to pluck its feather?

66
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,950
That's called staying calm in a crisis.

67
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,430
Or not leaving empty-handed,
if you prefer.

68
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,830
Even if I fell to my death,

69
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,780
I had to grab at least one feather.

70
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,030
Give it to Lu Lingfeng

71
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,950
so he can identify what bird it was.

72
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,350
He will surely thank you.

73
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,160
Doctor Fei.

74
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,450
Lu Lingfeng.

75
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,870
A feather Master Ji plucked

76
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,070
from the raptor's body.

77
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,930
Keep it for now.

78
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,240
How are his injuries?

79
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,120
Don't worry.

80
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,630
He won't die.

81
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,560
You saved me this time.

82
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,070
Thank you.

83
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:22,130
No need to thank me.

84
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,870
Since you're not going to die,

85
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,670
let me ask you.

86
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,480
What is this?

87
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,360
Last night,

88
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:33,580
I saw three golden peaches

89
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,060
rolling on the ground.

90
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:35,990
I thought

91
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:38,000
since you were with His Majesty,

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,430
you must have eaten some already.

93
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,510
I got these three myself,

94
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,510
and I'm the oldest,

95
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,250
so it's not too much to have one myself,
right?

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,159
The Kang Kingdom's golden peach,

97
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,480
truly worthy of being a tribute.

98
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,240
Wonderful!

99
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,190
Wonderful!

100
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:55,510
The remaining two

101
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,290
can be shared among the four of them.

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,010
Isn't that fair?

103
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,850
But you didn't leave any for us!

104
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,160
Blame it on

105
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,110
the golden peach's divine taste.

106
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:08,600
It...

107
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,330
It was luring me at every turn.

108
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,130
These three golden peaches

109
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,430
were actually rewards
that I requested from His Majesty

110
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,840
for all of you.

111
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,870
You ate them all by yourself

112
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,240
and then blame the peaches?

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,600
You...

114
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,070
Enough.

115
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,360
Though Master Ji is greedy,

116
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:25,170
he has already been punished.

117
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,020
Don't blame him anymore.

118
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,290
They've all had the peaches.

119
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,230
What's wrong?

120
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,159
Thank you for reminding me, Xijun.

121
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,250
You want to use my palace token?

122
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,159
I must go to the palace immediately

123
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,220
to see His Majesty.

124
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:01,430
Yes.

125
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,540
The Imperial Guards

126
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:06,270
cannot go a day without the Grand General.

127
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,130
Bring me paper.

128
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,980
I'll write a blood letter
recommending you.

129
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,840
Grand General,

130
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,250
that's not why I'm here.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,720
Then why?

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,330
The golden peaches from the Kang Kingdom.

133
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,240
What?

134
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,780
That evil bird has entered Chang'an?

135
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,630
Is the Grand General alright?

136
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,240
This time, the raptor

137
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,669
did not attack the Grand General.

138
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:36,409
Instead, it targeted

139
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:38,030
Fei Yingjun, who was treating
the Grand General's wounds.

140
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,549
Whether it's Your Majesty,
the Grand General, or Fei,

141
00:08:40,549 --> 00:08:41,630
before being attacked,

142
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,429
they all had one thing in common.

143
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,500
They had just eaten the golden peach.

144
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,390
You mean...

145
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:52,320
That bird

146
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,920
only attacks people
who have just eaten the golden peaches?

147
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,240
Although it's just a guess,

148
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,640
I humbly beg Your Majesty

149
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,330
not to eat any golden peaches.

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,600
Could it be

151
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,320
that Your Majesty has just eaten some?

152
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,120
No, I haven't.

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,890
However, as per custom,

154
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,510
tributes from foreign kingdoms

155
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,730
have already been distributed
to the Retired Emperor,

156
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,990
the Grand Princess...

157
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,790
As well as various nobles and relatives,

158
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,460
and meritorious ministers.

159
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,440
I respectfully urge Your Majesty
to act swiftly.

160
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:27,230
Recall all the golden peaches immediately.

161
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,020
I will personally meet the Retired Emperor

162
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,820
to explain the situation to him.

163
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,650
Your Highness.

164
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,530
Do you know

165
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,600
[Retired Emperor]

166
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,080
when I first tasted

167
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,380
these golden peaches,

168
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,240
how old was I?

169
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,660
I was two years old.

170
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,360
That year, Liu Rengui

171
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,920
annihilated the Wa Kingdom

172
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,280
at Baijiangkou

173
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,750
in Baekji.

174
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,960
Emperor Gaozong

175
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,220
held a grand fruit banquet to celebrate.

176
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,510
It just so happened

177
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,640
that the Tang envoys
returning from the Western Regions

178
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:28,040
brought back a few golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom.

179
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,280
Father placed one peach

180
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:31,430
in my hands.

181
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,270
But at that time,

182
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:36,410
I didn't have all my teeth yet.

183
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,690
How could I bite it?

184
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,170
Father said,

185
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,560
"The people of Wa

186
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,890
fear strength,

187
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,670
not virtue.

188
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,240
This war

189
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:48,270
showed the might of the Tang Empire.

190
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,130
Even if you cannot bite it,

191
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,420
you must suck its juice fiercely.

192
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,080

197
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,270

198
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:18,320

199
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,390

Emperor Gaozong's imperial presence

202

203
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,750
to still linger before my eyes.

204

was fraught with danger.

221

I must implore Your Highness

Eating this golden peach

00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,960
mother,

384
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,200
and two brothers

385
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:05,870
were all emperors.

386
00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:09,010
Now even my nephew

387
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,920
has become emperor.

388
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,820
As the one and only

389
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,440
Grand Princess of the Tang Empire,

390
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,030
why shouldn't I?

391
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,570
Look into my eyes.

392
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,510
I have four sons,

393
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,110
but only you

394
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:34,360
excel in both civil and military affairs,

395
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,780
have endured hardships,

396
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:37,270
remain resilient,

397
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,810
are selfless at heart,

398
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,930
and have the world in your mind.

399
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,410
Bear my surname, Li.

400
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,970
In the future,

401
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,870
I will pass the Tang Empire

402
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,240
to you.

403
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,450
Cen Dianjun.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
Did anyone leave the Princess's Mansion
tonight?

405
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,700
No.

406
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,340
Good. Prepare the horses.

407
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:10,960
Yes.

408
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,140
[Sangma Eatery]

409
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,310
Cen Zhi is dead?

410
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:23,590
[Ruling with the Harmony of the Qin]

411
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,680
He was lifted into the air,

412
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,700
dropped three times,

413
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,590
and then disemboweled
by that vicious bird.

414
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,520
It was horrific.

415
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,170
Any news on Aunt?

416
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,640
I heard Her Highness

417
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,830
held a golden peach banquet
in the back garden.

418
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:37,400
Even the guards

419
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,880
were rewarded with tribute peaches
and wine.

420
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,140
But except for Cen Zhi,

421
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,240
no one was attacked.

422
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
Where did Cen Zhi die?

423
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,880
Not far from here.

424
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,810
He must have been coming

425
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,410
to report information to me.

426
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,680
The situation has been extremely tense
lately.

427
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,210
I ordered him to report any news
immediately.

428
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,640
Kill me then.

429
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:02,800
I will be remembered throughout history.

430
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,850
People will call me

431
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,600
the most loyal servant of the Tang Empire.

432
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,510
As for you,

433
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,260
all sixteen members of your family

434
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,500
are in my custody.

435
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,320
Your little son

436
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,890
is four months old.

437
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,590
His little face

438
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,990
is so soft and rosy.

439
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,070
Absolutely adorable.

440
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,370
I already suspected

441
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,240
that this vicious bird
was connected to Her Highness.

442
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,370
Now it's confirmed.

443
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,720
Everyone who ate the golden peaches,

444
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,350
as long as stayed
within the Princess's Mansion,

445
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,880
remained completely safe.

446
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,830
Cen Zhi was the only one.

447
00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:53,560
This proves

448
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,480
that this vicious bird

449
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,410
is kept by the Princess's Mansion.

450
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:58,750
Therefore,

451
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,890
it doesn't attack people in its own home.

452
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,180
Nonsense.

453
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,680
[Ruling with the Harmony of the Qin]

454
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,940
Who do you think she is?

455
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,800
Would she need to keep birds
to harm people?

456
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,020
You servant,

457
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,800
stop making wild speculations out of fear.

458
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,570
Cen Zhi. Oh, Cen Zhi.

459
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,730
In the past,

460
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,750
Your Highness transferred him

461
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,370
from the northern city to the capital

462
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:24,370
was because you valued his loyalty.

463
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:27,960
Who would have thought
after the Chengfo Temple incident,

464
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,500
he would betray us.

465
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,290
He truly deserved his fate.

466
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,960
I don't blame him.

467
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,160
If anyone is to blame,

468
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:39,880
it's that person being overtly ruthless.

469
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,310
He even hold Cen Zhi's family hostage.

470
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,710
Chancellor Cui,

471
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,780
what would you do
if you were in his place?

472
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:54,200
I would never betray Your Highness.

473
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,600
If the person you love most

474
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,590
fell into enemy hands,

475
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,680
Chancellor Cui,

476
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,180
what then?

477
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:08,530
I swear to follow Your Highness
until death.

478
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,310
I have already

479
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,540
cast aside all personal attachments.

480
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,550
I only wish for Your Highness
to achieve greatness.

481
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:14,890
I long to see

482
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,580
a stronger Tang Empire

483
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,070
under the rule of a new empress.

484
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,330
If that day truly comes,

485
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,960
I will not disappoint you.

486
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,060
It's full now.

487
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,890
It was hungry for too long.

488
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,990
It's extremely happy today.

489
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,190
But I want to know

490
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,920
why it didn't go
to the golden peach banquet

491
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,450
at the Princess's Mansion.

492
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,830
There are places birds don't want to go.

493
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,490
The wings are on its body,

494
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,680
what can I do about it?

495
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:14,200
You're hiding something from me.

496
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,860
No, I'm not.

497
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,500
If the Princess's Mansion
can hold a golden peach banquet,

498
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,990
it means they don't suspect
the golden peaches.

499
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:21,450
So there's still a chance.

500
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,850
My bird will be working hard lately.

501
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:26,900
What if there are places

502
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,500
where birds don't want to go?

503
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,110
Our great undertaking is not yet complete.

504
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,310
We must be united in purpose and effort.

505
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:37,950
Are you really not hiding anything
from me?

506
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:38,750
No!

507
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,050
When the time is right,

508
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,440
places where birds don't want to go,

509
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,680
I'll go instead.

510
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:04,200
[Prison of Gantang County]

511
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,690
You don't want to starve anymore?

512
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,180
But today's food
has already been distributed.

513
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,530
This portion

514
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,680
[Liu XVIII] [Liu XIX]

515
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,930
is mine.

516
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,750
You insolent savage!

517
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,210
How dare you attack Mr. Su!

518
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,820
Yingtao, don't hurt him.

519
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,030
Sheriff Xu.

520
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,960
You've been starving him.

521
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,480
No,

522
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,680
he himself went on a hunger strike.

523
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:41,930
Hunger strike?

524
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,090
Since last autumn,

525
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,290
when Liu XVII was executed,

526
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,350
he went mad with rage.

527
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,830
He had bitten several guards,

528
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,270
so we had to put him in a cage.

529
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,000
Only then did he calm down a bit.

530
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,680
Liu XVIII, however,
focused on reforming himself.

531
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,960
He's also clever and diligent,

532
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:55,400
so we let him

533
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,830
deliver food to other prisoners.

534
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,760
Half a month ago,

535
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,860
Liu XVIII suddenly reported to me

536
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,960
that this Liu XIX

537
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,210
had gone on a hunger strike.

538
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,240
Liu XVIII.

539
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:12,110
He's become like this.

540
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,790
Don't you bear any responsibility?

541
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,110
He wants to die.

542
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,620
What can I do?

543
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,070
My life

544
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:21,730
is already miserable enough.

545
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,510
I don't have the energy to care about him.

546
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,830
You think everything now

547
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,790
is his fault?

548
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,950
My future is ruined. I'm better off dead.

549
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,500
Isn't it his fault?

550
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,640
He went mad

551
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:38,830
and wild

552
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,240
because he lost

553
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,340
his twin brother.

554
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,200
This is the most basic emotion

555
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,860
as a human being.

556
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:46,830
And you

557
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,140
are his last remaining relative

558
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,440
in this world.

559
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,200
Living in the same cell,

560
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,310
have you ever cared about him?

561
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,110
Your indifference

562
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,950
is like a cold knife.

563
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,550
You are killing your own brother,

564
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,200
cut by cut.

565
00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:12,140
You feel wronged,

566
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,570
and that I'm falsely accusing you?

567
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,270
I didn't mean to do it.

568
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,310
Despair has taken control of you.

569
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,150
And you dare to call yourself a scholar.

570
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:29,360
When Master Di was wrongfully imprisoned,

571
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,000
his life was hanging by a thread

572
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,430
but he never gave up.

573
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,110
With his intelligence

574
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,480
and his desire to live,

575
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:37,310
he finally walked out of prison

576
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,740
and returned to court.

577
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,590
He even planned ahead

578
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:42,360
and saved the Tang Empire

579
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,010
five years after his death.

580
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:45,680
Remember,

581
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,240
only by staying alive

582
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:53,480
can you live better.

583
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,520
The rice soup.

584
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,390
Bring it here.

585
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,270
Come closer.

586
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,880
Repeat the last sentence

587
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,070
I told you just now.

588
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:15,350
That's not just empty words.

589
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,070
Only by staying alive

590
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,880
can you live better.

591
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:25,960
Louder.

592
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:29,000
So your brother can hear.

593
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,640
Only by staying alive

594
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,550
can you live better.

595
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,000
Continue.

596
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,200
Only by staying alive

597
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,920
can you live better.

598
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,880
Only by staying alive

599
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,590
can you live better.

600
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,640
Only by staying alive

601
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:19,270
can you live better.

602
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,970
Only by staying alive

603
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,790
can you live better.

604
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,400
After an executed criminal is beheaded,

605
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,750
they're still placed in a coffin
for burial.

606
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:47,070
This is a new policy in Gantang County.

607
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,110
That's right.

608
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,350
When I first took office,

609
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:51,030
I wanted to introduce new practices.

610
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,830
This Liu XVII

611
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,570
is the first one.

612
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:58,880
Giving every deceased person the dignity
they deserve.

613
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,750
This is a good initiative.

614
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,690
Sheriff Xu,

615
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,590
please accept my respects.

616
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:09,880
Everyone,

617
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,170
who is willing to join me

618
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,480
to open this coffin?

619
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,830
I'll do it.

620
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,600
This is truly bizarre.

621
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,720
Where's the head?

622
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:43,960
That's what I should ask you.

623
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,890
What's going on?

624
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,440
I...

625
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,830
At that time, after the executioner

626
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,160
cut off Liu XVII's head,

627
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,840
I personally put it together

628
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,790
with his body into the coffin.

629
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,510
Mr. Su,

630
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,070
you insisted on opening the coffin.

631
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,870
Did you already know about this?

632
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,810
May I ask for your surname?

633
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,640
My surname is Ma.

634
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,550
Mr. Ma,

635
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,760
Liu XVII's head is missing.

636
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,110
And you're the one who did it.

637
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:17,880
Confess now,

638
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,360
or else I'll cut

639
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,159
your head off.

640
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,230
How...

641
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,880
How could I possibly have done it?

642
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,840
Just now when Mr. Su and Sheriff Xu

643
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
were opening the coffin together,

644
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,230
from your position,

645
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,889
you couldn't even see
if there was a head inside.

646
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:33,710
Could you possibly have foreseen this?

647
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,440
So it was really you who did it?

648
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,320
I trusted you so much

649
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,070
and entrusted you

650
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:54,020
with all the burial arrangements.

651
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,590
For what purpose
did you steal the criminal's head?

652
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:56,590
Tell me the truth.

653
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,720
I had gambling debts I couldn't repay.

654
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,320
So I sold Liu XVII's head

655
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,190
to a yin-yang merchant.

656
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,230
A yin-yang merchant.

657
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,000
Oh, lady.

658
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:19,230
My wife is quite a good dancer.

659
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,770
But this face...

660
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,800
If my wife looked like this,

661
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,840
why would I ever come to a tavern?

662
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,230
How about bring this face home

663
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,920
and swap it with your wife's?

664
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,110
What...

665
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:40,640
What do you mean?

666
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,070
Exactly what I said.

667
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,110
[Yin-yang Merchant, Ever-changing Master]

668
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,510
Three gold ingots

669
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,030
and that face is yours.

670
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,710
Who is it?

671
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,260
I didn't make any appointments tonight.

672
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,500
Coming!

673
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,670
Which gentleman is it?

674
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,210
Didn't even make an appointment in prior.

675
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,240
Oh, you.

676
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,440
You've become quite clever,

677
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,900
even learned how to knock.

678
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,840
Recently in the capital, there's a saying

679
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,640
going around,

680
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,070
saying that the current Emperor

681
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,320
is not the Retired Emperor's
legitimate eldest son.

682
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,510
He cannot sustain the Tang Empire.

683
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,110
Did you spread these rumours?

684
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,550
This time, it truly wasn't me.

685
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,190
It's because the news of him

686
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:06,450
not being able to enjoy

687
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,150
the golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom leaked.

688
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,590
This is the will of the people.

689
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,170
Speaking of which,

690
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,630
I want to eat golden peaches again.

691
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,290
Guards!

692
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,800
Cut some peaches

693
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,130
to go with fine wine.

694
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,080
Chancellor Cui and I shall drink together.

695
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:23,960
Yes.

696
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,820
Thank you, Your Highness.

697
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,880
However,

698
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:28,800
regarding the position
of the Grand General

699
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,460
of the Right Imperial Guards,

700
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,030
the few candidates that we recommended

701
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,840
were all rejected by the Retired Emperor.

702
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,070
It must be His Majesty's interference.

703
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,380
It doesn't matter.

704
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,630
Even if Lu Tong

705
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:42,920
doesn't give up his position
as the Grand General,

706
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,670
he's already a broken man.

707
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:56,180
[Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart]

708
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,370
Grand General.

709
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,800
What merit do I have

710
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,820
to have Your Majesty
visiting me in person.

711
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,400
There's no need

712
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,630
for such formalities between us.

713
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:12,360
Please rise.

714
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,590
Your wounds...

715
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:15,590
They're much better now.

716
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,050
Please sit, Your Majesty.

717
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,480
Your timing is perfect, Your Majesty.

718
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,110
I

719
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,570
have something to report.

720
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:23,800
Speak.

721
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,360
I am crippled now.

722
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:27,320
The position of Grand General
of the Right Imperial Guards

723
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,920
is beyond my capability now.

724
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,490
After much consideration,

725
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,160
only Lu Lingfeng
can take on this responsibility.

726
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:40,560
I know you value talent.

727
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,070
As do I.

728
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,320
But Lu Lingfeng's

729
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,360
primary task now

730
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,130
is to stay here and protect you,

731
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,960
in case that evil bird returns.

732
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,030
Your Majesty, that bird...

733
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,670
That bird

734
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,400
did attack the Grand General's residence.

735
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,760
The truth remains unclear.

736
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,000
We must remain vigilant.

737
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,660
But the Right Imperial Guards

738
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,070
cannot be without a commander.

739
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:00,800
You cannot give up your position
as the Grand General.

740
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,670
If you do,

741
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,650
the consequences would be unimaginable.

742
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:08,070
Since Lu Lingfeng has merit
in protecting you,

743
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,840
could he be restored
to his former position?

744
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,480
With the rank of Middle Commander,

745
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:14,140
he could temporarily lead
the Imperial Guards.

746
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,880
I

747
00:40:20,590 --> 00:40:22,850
truly cannot lead troops at this moment.

748
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,640
That's not a problem.

749
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,320
General of Loyalty and Valor, Li Feng,

750
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:28,590
can temporarily take command

751
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:29,880
until you recover.

752
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,140
Grand General,

753
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,880
please focus on your recovery.

754
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:38,440
Li Feng will not disappoint

755
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,100
His Majesty's expectations.

756
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:51,900
[Crimson Blood and Loyal Heart]
