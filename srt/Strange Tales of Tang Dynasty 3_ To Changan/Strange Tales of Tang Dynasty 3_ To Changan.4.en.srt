Yingtao,

10
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,030
is this a feather

11
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,160
from that creature?

12
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,040
That's right.

13
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,910
It was knocked off by my sleeve arrow.

14
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,750
That makes sense.

15
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,000
It's identical to the feather

A leaf?

19
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,030
The Ghost Market shouldn't have

20
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,090
such fresh leaves.

21
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,120
That human-faced raptor must have

22
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,920
brought it from somewhere else.

23
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,250

You are loyal to His Majesty.

194
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,440
Now

195
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,560
is the time to prove yourself.

196
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,690
Su Wuming

197
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,800
is clearly on the Princess's side.

198
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,150
His fate...

199
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,860
Just pay no heed

200
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,480
and His Majesty

201
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,230
will naturally regain his trust in you.

202
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,680
If you get involved in this case,

203
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,740
His Majesty will never trust you.

204
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,570
It might even

205
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,090
bring you deadly consequences.

206
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,510
Return to the Grand General's Mansion
immediately.

207
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,110
This case,

208
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,020
no matter how far it progresses,

209
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,180
you pay no heed.

210
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,750
Then, Grand General,

211
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,680
please behead me

212
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,650
and say I'm going to rebel.

213
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,320
You—

214
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,820
You think I dare not?

215
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,090
This sword

216
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,100
was given to me
by the people of Hanzhou Prefecture.

217
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,800
They hoped I would use it

218
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,390
to eliminate evil

219
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,110
and establish merit.

220
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Now that I've returned to Chang'an,

221
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,690
I've fallen into
a whirlpool of power struggles,

222
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,390
becoming timid.

223
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,630
Instead of living like a coward,

224
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,080
I'd rather go straight to the underworld

225
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,440
and share three cups of wine
with Guo Zhuang!

226
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:57,790
You—

227
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,690
You bastard.

228
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,750
Get up.

229
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,810
Get up!

230
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,780
It's not that I don't want to help you.

231
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,660
Even as the Grand General,

232
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,550
I don't have the authority

233
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,540
to search imperial villas.

234
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,840
Of those three residences,

235
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,090
one belongs to the Emperor,

236
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:35,690
one belongs to the Princess,

237
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:36,750
and one of highest altitude

238
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,550
belongs to the Retired Emperor.

239
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,880
How can we search them?

240
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,030
Ji,

241
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,120
it's so late.

242
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,790
What brings you here?

243
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,670
I'm sorry for disturbing your rest.

244
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,150
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

245
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:53,870
Nonsense.

246
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,730
Getting a visit from my son

247
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,030
makes me happy.

248
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,840
Alright,

249
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,360
when I heard you came
in the middle of the night,

250
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,160
I already knew why.

251
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,320
That senior brother of yours

252
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,150
was trained by Di Renjie himself,

253
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,550
but he was careless this time

254
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,150
and got taken by that raptor.

255
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,390
You want an official position

256
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,150
to legitimately investigate this case

257
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,370
and rescue Su Wuming.

258
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,680
First thing tomorrow morning,

259
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,600
I'll go see the Retired Emperor.

260
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:26,120
The Court of Judicial Review
or Yongzhou Prefecture?

261
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,380
Where do you want to go?

262
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,830
To rescue Su Wuming,

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,060
I need no official position.

264
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,720
I just ask for your permission

265
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,160
to search your villa on Mount Zhongnan.

266
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,760
What do you mean by that?

267
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,160
That raptor is extremely large.

268
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,500
It can't easily hide within Chang'an

269
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,650
and there are clues
pointing to Mount Zhongnan.

270
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,030
Therefore...

271
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,200
Are you suspecting me?

272
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,280
Suspecting that I'm the one

273
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,840
raising that raptor?

274
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,480
Other than the imperial forbidden grounds,

275
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,410
all other places

276
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,590
have been thoroughly searched.

277
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:03,260
The imperial forbidden grounds

278
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,340
don't just include my villa.

279
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,800
Why don't you suspect His Majesty

280
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,680
or the Retired Emperor?

281
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,790
Just because His Majesty
ate the golden peach

282
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,720
and was attacked by the raptor,

283
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,600
while I

284
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,500
ate the golden peach
and remained unharmed?

285
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,140
So you also believe those

286
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,780
baseless rumors

287
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,060
and suspect your own mother?

288
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,720
Yes.

289
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,490
That man is the one
sitting on the throne now.

290
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,080
You want to achieve merit

291
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,480
and show your loyalty.

292
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,610
I understand.

293
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:34,670
But

294
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:35,670
for you to suspect

295
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,930
that I would use such despicable means,

296
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,270
you are insulting me

297
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,610
and belittling me.

298
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,630
Lu Lingfeng,

299
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,910
you've broken your mother's heart.

300
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,520
Leave.

301
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,600
Leave right now.

302
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,630
Don't wait for me

303
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,800
to have someone drive you out!

304
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,150
[Great virtue can carry the world]

305
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:19,910
General,

306
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,250
having a drink?

307
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:22,120
Go ahead.

308
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:22,800
What is it?

309
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,020
A few days ago in Chang'an County,

310
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,870
a Paper Effigy Shop's owner was killed.

311
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:27,510
The murderer

312
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,840
was likely his assistant.

313
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,910
We looked at Miss Pei's drawing

314
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,570
of that bird-man

315
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,030
and thought it resembled

316
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:33,870
the Paper Effigy Shop's assistant

317
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,530
as described by the landlord.

318
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:36,300
What?

319
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,000
Do you think this could be

320
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,700
a lead?

321
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:39,960
Luo and Jia

322
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,910
have already gone to find the landlord.

323
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:42,550
Take me there quickly.

324
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:42,910
Yes.

325
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,200
This...

326
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,750
Why does he have wings?

327
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,260
Could he be some kind of demon?

328
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:55,090
Don't look elsewhere.

329
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,200
Both of you,
just look carefully at the face.

330
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,060
Is this the man?

331
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:03,890
Yes,

332
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:04,510
it's him.

333
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,040
It's him.

334
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,240
Sorry to disturb you so late.

335
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,840
Thank you both for your help.

336
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,390
This is a murder case.

337
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,790
Why was the investigation
done so carelessly?

338
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,840
None of us three were on duty that day.

339
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Somehow,

340
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,600
Official Wu got involved.

341
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,290
Think about it.

342
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,480
The Judicial Official
of Yongzhou Prefecture

343
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,940
personally investigated this case.

344
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:24,600
Who in Chang'an County would dare
to overstep and reinvestigate?

345
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,930
Wu Wenbin.

346
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,620
This Judicial Official

347
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,620
is quite skilled.

348
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,390
That day, Su Wuming and I

349
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:34,360
rushed to Yongzhou Prefecture overnight.

350
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,790
In less than two hours,

351
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,380
his undercover agents

352
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,020
located the Ever-changing Master

353
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,370
at his hideout in the Ghost Market.

354
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,300
His surname is Wu

355
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,970
and holds such an important position
at his young age.

356
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,100
Could he Empress Wu Zetian's relative?

357
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,030
My father mentioned his name before.

358
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,840
Wu Wenbin,

359
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,550
Empress Wu Zetian's relative.

360
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,550
I believe

361
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:55,160
he's also some general's son-in-law.

362
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,840
[Yongzhou Prefecture]

363
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:11,109
Lu.

364
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,480
All the men from Yongzhou Prefecture

365
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,609
have been deployed.

366
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,400
We've given all 110 districts of Chang'an

367
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,720
and the surrounding counties

368
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
a thorough search

369
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:19,550
but still couldn't find

370
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:21,079
Scholar Su's whereabouts.

371
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,359
I'm also extremely anxious about this.

372
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,770
Thank you, Official Wu.

373
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,849
No need for thanks.

374
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,040
Through Empress Wu Zetian,

375
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,640
we're actually relatives.

376
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,270
Lu, your identity

377
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,680
is no longer a secret.

378
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,070
Upon your return to the capital,

379
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,070
you'll surely rise quickly in rank.

380
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,790
I hope you'll remember me in the future.

381
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
No problem

382
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,750
I have

383
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,220
a small request.

384
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,680
Please go ahead, Lu.

385
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,900
Since you know my identity,

386
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,750
you must understand

387
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,400
that Cen Zhi,
Commander of the Princess's Guard, and I

388
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,470
were close friends.

389
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,010
[Yongzhou Prefecture]

390
00:17:58,010 --> 00:17:58,880
His body

391
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,920
must be kept
at the Yongzhou Prefecture, right?

392
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,520
I've brought a flask of wine.

393
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:03,440
I wish to see him

394
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,570
and pay my respects

395
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:06,200
as his friend.

396
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:09,660
Certainly.

397
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,020
No problem.

398
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:53,560
Lu Lingfeng,

399
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,320
you didn't sleep last night?

400
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,640
Have you slept

401
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,970
since Su Wuming disappeared?

402
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:01,690
I...

403
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,670
Do I look really bad now?

404
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,960
Someone who uses a sincere heart

405
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,240
to care for others

406
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,230
is always beautiful.

407
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:16,840
Master!

408
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,120
[Great virtue can carry the world]

409
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:21,960
Su Wuming has been missing

410
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,740
for 16 hours.

411
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,350
The evidence we have

412
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,300
is very limited.

413
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,360
I'm willing to trust Fei.

414
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,790
I bet that raptor is in Mount Zhongnan.

415
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,590
I have a plan,

416
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,750
but it's risky.

417
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,970
Therefore,

418
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,890
Xue Huan will stay to take care of Fei.

419
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:36,880
Master, what?

420
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,350
If it's dangerous,

421
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,750
shouldn't Miss Xijun stay behind?

422
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,640
She doesn't know martial arts.

423
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,510
Stop arguing.

424
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,680
I'm ordering you to stay.

425
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,680
Yes.

426
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:48,640
Let's go.

427
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:56,700
[Great virtue can carry the world]

428
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,310
[Princess's Villa on Mount Zhongnan]

429
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,270
We've searched the front and back gardens

430
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,420
and every room.

431
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,210
Nothing.

432
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,750
How did the Princess allow you

433
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,880
to enter this place?

434
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,510
Get out.

435
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,640
Leave immediately.

436
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,720
Don't wait for me

437
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,960
to have you thrown out!

438
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,240
Mother!

439
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,510
Until we catch the raptor

440
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,730
and find Su Wuming,

441
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,710
I have reason to suspect anyone,

442
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,570
including you.

443
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,270
But even if the raptor

444
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:39,590
is kept in the Princess's villa,

445
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:40,560
it doesn't prove

446
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,410
that the attack on His Majesty

447
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,740
was under your orders.

448
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,590
Searching is just a necessary step

449
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,640
to solve this mysterious case.

450
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,200
To ensure the real culprit
doesn't escape justice

451
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
and to clear the name of the innocent

452
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,030
is what Master Di taught me.

453
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:53,680
Please...

454
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,240
Mother,

455
00:20:58,850 --> 00:20:59,550
help me.

456
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,110
My son,

457
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
you've grown up.

458
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,880
What else do you need?

459
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,400
Say it all.

460
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,680
It's rare to see the Princess
being so generous.

461
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,140
But what should we do next?

462
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,310
We still have the Emperor's villa

463
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:23,640
and the Retired Emperor's villa.

464
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,030
Should we charge up the mountain?

465
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:25,550
No need.

466
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:29,830
Look.

467
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,470
The remaining golden peaches
in the Princess's Mansion

468
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,870
have all been given to me.

469
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,450
And wine too.

470
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,880
The Princess's wine must be excellent.

471
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,540
Paired with golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom...

472
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,740
Good strategy.

473
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,170
Are you afraid?

474
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,310
What is there to fear?

475
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,130
They're using themselves as bait

476
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,590
to lure the raptor out.

477
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,670
Why didn't they take me with?

478
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,780
They're not just
gambling with their lives

479
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,690
but with their futures too.

480
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,160
That's the imperial forbidden ground.

481
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,350
One careless move

482
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,670
and they'll be charged with treason.

483
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,630
Your master didn't let you go

484
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,320
because he cares for you.

485
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,480
He's afraid you would

486
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,200
die halfway.

487
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,030
You are younger.

if Su Wuming has ever tasted

496

such delicious golden peaches.

If my sworn brother had tried them,

498

he would surely have written notes

499

about their exquisite flavor.

What did I do to it?

509
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,350
What could I possibly do?

510
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,920
I didn't provoke it or bother it.

511
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,130
It suddenly became agitated.

512
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,860
I thought it was going to eat me!

513
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,540
I didn't even eat any peaches.

514

If you don't tell me,

515
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,600
I'll kill you!

516
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,520
Then go ahead.

517
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,620
Dying in the Retired Emperor's villa

518
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,610
would be a blessing

00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,530
If it can knock out a person instantly,

533
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,530
it will definitely knock out a bird.

I'm more curious about

00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,700
they still show past grandeur
and solemnity.

575
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,410
It must be an imperial villa.

576
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,270
I've been dizzy,

577
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,960
which means we're at a high altitude.

578
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,110
I recalled that Empress Wu Zetian's villa

579
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,790
on Mount Zhongnan's peak

580
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,790
was later given to the Retired Emperor.

581
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,270
You see,

582
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,560
that's how I figured it out.

583
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,860
No need to waste words on him.

584
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,240
Let me tear off his mask.

585
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,110
If you want to kill me, just do it.

586
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:19,200
Why humiliate me?

587
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,350
Don't be hasty.

588
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,040
Sit down.

589
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,680
I've already figured out who you are.

590
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,550
You cared for birds for Deposed Queen Wei,

591
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,920
didn't you?

592
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,730
Deposed Queen Wei?

593
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,640
During Emperor Gaozong's reign,

594
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,640
west of the Western Region
was a country called Amono.

595
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:50,240
The Tang Empire destroyed it

596
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,550
for provoking and invading our borders.

597
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,310
At that time, the Little Prince Lie Na

598
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:57,920
was just a small child.

599
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,200
He was taken to Chang'an

600
00:31:00,490 --> 00:31:01,880
and became a slave.

601
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,830
Deposed Queen Wei had just become
the Crown Princess then.

602
00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:09,350
She loved birds.

603
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:12,550
Knowing Amono was the kingdom of birds,

604
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,570
she had the Little Prince
tend to her birds.

605
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,850
She wouldn't allow him

606
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,000
to show his real face,

607
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,680
so she ordered craftsmen

608
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,480
to make a bird-shaped mask

609
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,400
and forcibly

610
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,590
put it on his face.

611
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:42,790
As the Little Prince grew up,

612
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,590
his facial structure

613
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:47,400
took on the shape of a bird.

614
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,050
Everyone called him

615
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,880
the Bird Slave.

616
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,850
Years later,

617
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,400
when Emperor Zhongzong
returned to the Eastern Palace,

618
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,960
Master Di was already elderly.

619
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,530
He had limited mobility

620
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,590
and needed accompaniment

621
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,870
wherever he went.

622
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:05,510
So,

623
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:08,710
when my mentor visited the Eastern Palace,

624
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,520
I had the honor to accompany him.

625
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,030
In the courtyard,

626
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,650
I personally witnessed

627
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:16,330
the Bird Slave
being tortured by Deposed Queen Wei

628
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:19,420
for making a mistake.

629
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,550
That scene

630
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,630
remains unforgettable to this day.

631
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,270
I never expected

632
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,980
you would remember me.

633
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,750
You said we had met before,

634
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,910
and this case involves a bird-man.

635
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,920
I instantly thought of you

636
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:40,030
because the impression you left on me

637
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,640
was truly profound.

638
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,750
I never expected there to be such a past.

639
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,480
Let me ask you.

640
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,170
How can he Flame Crow you raised

641
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,970
specifically attack those
who ate the peaches?

642
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:54,750
Six years ago,

643
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,450
I was able to return to Amono,

644
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,630
but my homeland had changed,

645
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,310
making it difficult to restore my country.

646
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,000
What saddened me more

647
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:11,440
was that our Flame Crows
had almost gone extinct.

648
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,850
One day,

649
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,070
when I had nothing left

650
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,400
but a piece of hardtack,

651
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,060
I suddenly discovered

652
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:21,400
a young Flame Crow in the grass.

653
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,700
I used that piece of hardtack to nurse it

654
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,820
back to life.

655
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,030
It stayed with me

656
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,920
and became

657
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,000
my only friend.

658
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,750
Later, I heard
that the neighboring Kang Kingdom

659
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:44,110
was resuming their tribute
of golden peaches to the Tang Empire.

660
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:45,970
Thus, I had an idea.

661
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,710
You used the golden peaches

662
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,860
to feed animals on the grassland,

663
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,230
then trained the Flame Crow

664
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,000
to hunt those animals?

665
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,440
The Flame Crow

666
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,180
is the fiercest bird on the grasslands.

667
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,350
It also has the keenest sense of smell.

668
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,050
But I didn't train it

669
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,070
using animals.

670
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,720
I used those who'd betrayed

671
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,280
Amono

672
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,770
as hunting targets.

673
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,880
First, I'd send them
the precious golden peaches from Kang,

674
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,940
then have the Flame Crow attack them,

675
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,510
carry them high into the air,

676
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,170
and drop them repeatedly.

677
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:19,880
When they were nothing but bloody pulp,

678
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,679
it would tear open their chests.

679
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,030
After years of this,

680
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,940
I finally finished training
the Flame Crow.

681
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,840
I also received financial support
from former officials

682
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,280
and found the former imperial advisor

683
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,830
of Amono.

684
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,820
He helped me use the collected feathers

685
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,630
to make

686
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,480
an even larger pair of wings.

687
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,170
With added mechanisms,

688
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,670
it was capable of swift flight.

689
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,520
Everything was ready,

690
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,270
so I returned to Chang'an.

691
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,760
You attacked His Majesty

692
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,929
to take revenge on the Tang Empire.

693
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:57,190
Only after returning to Chang'an
did I learn

694
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,450
that Deposed Queen Wei has already died.

695
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,840
I was furious—

696
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,590
furious that I couldn't take revenge
with my own hands!

697
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,960
But the current Emperor

698
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,840
is not the one who harmed you.

699
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,040
They're all the same!

700
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,390
They're from the same family!

701
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,550
Why doesn't your bird

702
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,350
attack the Princess's Mansion?

703
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,930
That's because

704
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,880
the Princess showed him kindness before.

705
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,290
How did you guess that too?

706
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,110
I didn't guess.

707
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,340
The Princess told me.

708
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,570
That raptor truly wasn't raised by you?

709
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:37,840
Su Wuming!

710
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,480
Kneel down right now!

711
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,230
Even if I die kneeling here,

712
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,030
I must get to the bottom of this.

713
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:44,690
Otherwise,

714
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,270
this mysterious case cannot be solved.

715
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:57,090
[Qingxin Pavilion]

716
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,620
After eating the golden peach
from the Kang Kingdom,

717
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,680
do not leave the Princess's Mansion.

718
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,470
Who else knows about this?

719
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Just the two of us.

720
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,440
That bird was too strange.

721
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,560
We took the liberty

722
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,480
of reporting directly to Your Highness.

723
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,400
Well done.

724
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:15,630
This matter

725
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,090
must not be told to anyone,

726
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,530
including Cen Zhi.

727
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,190
Yes.

728
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:22,590
If the Princess hadn't shown you kindness,

729
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:25,150
why would you have given a warning first?

730
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,360
Indeed.

731
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:37,190
That year, I accidentally killed

732
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,450
a parrot.

733
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,550
Deposed Queen Wei was about to

734
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:41,260
cut out my tongue.

735
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:48,630
The Princess happened to be in the palace.

736
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,720
She spoke up for me

737
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,760
and took me away.

738
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,190
I heard you're a prince of Amono.

739
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:02,070
You've suffered all these years.

740
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,010
I'll have your slave status removed.

741
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,630
You are free now.

742
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,450
I must certainly repay

743
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,180
the Princess for her kindness!

744
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,400
Knowing to repay kindness

745
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,830
means he's not beyond redemption.

746
00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:14,290
Who are your accomplices?

747
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,150
Who ordered you to do this?

748
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:17,760
No one.

749
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,110
You attempted to assassinate His Majesty.

750
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:20,920
Grand General Lu Tong

751
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,250
injured his eye as well.

752
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:23,840
The Tang Empire's miracle doctor

753
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,360
was nearly killed in a fall.

754
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,000
Tell me,

755
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,630
which of these isn't a serious crime?

756
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,830
Just kill me quickly and be done with it.

757
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,640
I'll go kill that bird first

758
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,530
to avenge Mr. Fei.

759
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,000
No!

760
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:42,920
Please don't!

761
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,660
Kill me first.

762
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:44,750
Kill me first, please!

763
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:45,350
Don't!

764
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,670
Such deep affection

765
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,370
for a bird.

766
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:52,230
You can't be a bad person.

767
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,510
I'm guessing

768
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,360
that after you came to Chang'an,

769
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,030
and heard Deposed Queen Wei has died,

770
00:37:57,030 --> 00:38:00,110
you abandoned your evil intentions.

771
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:01,710
You...

772
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,630
Stop making wild guesses.

773
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,990
Seems I guessed right again.

774
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,590
All of you, leave first.

775
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:15,070
Go.

776
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,490
Lie Na,

777
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,110
do you know

778
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,900
who that heroic person was?

779
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:31,100
How would I know?

780
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,400
He is the Princess's son.

781
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,980
If you don't reveal
your accomplices today,

782
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,030
we will all be implicated

783
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:42,320
and lose our lives.

784
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:43,630
Including

785
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,630
the Princess's son.

786
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,000
You must have accomplices.

787
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,980
Otherwise, how could you

788
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,360
hide in the Retired Emperor's villa?

789
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,630
Yes.

790
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:59,110
I returned to Chang'an

791
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:01,350
and learned Deposed Queen Wei has dead.

792
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:04,410
I wanted to make a living in Chang'an,

793
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,940
but because of my bird-like face,

794
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,670
I suffered great humiliation.

795
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,670
Eventually, I bought

796
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:13,830
this face that I liked
in the Ghost Market,

797
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,020
which gave me my current appearance.

798
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Unexpectedly...

799
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,030
Are you satisfied?

800
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,810
Thank you, Ever-changing Master.

801
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,320
I heard you have a strange bird.

802
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,190
Who are you?

803
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,810
And you can fly too.

804
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,230
You've been following me.

805
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,510
Respected Prince of Amono,

806
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:03,530
I can help you achieve

807
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:05,050
everything you desire.

808
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:07,190
He actually knew my identity

809
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,230
and told me about the golden peaches
from the Kang Kingdom

810
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,000
were about to enter the capital.

811
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,280
He wanted to work with me

812
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,150
to assassinate His Majesty, the Princess,

813
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,440
and the Retired Emperor.

814
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,150
After succeeding, he'll help me
restore my kingdom.

815
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:18,750
Of course,

816
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:19,960
I've already decided

817
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,150
not to harm the princess,

818
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,760
so I designated the Princess's Mansion

819
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,560
as a place where the Flame Crow
is forbidden to fly.

820
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,320
Do you know that person's identity?

821
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,660
He always wears a mask.

822
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,710
How did you get to

823
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:33,960
the Retired Emperor's villa?

824
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,710
I flew there.

825
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:36,190
After you flew there,

826
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,520
did you see anyone else?

827
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,890
The villa was always empty.

828
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,970
Completely empty?

829
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:57,100
The Retired Emperor's villa
on Mount Zhongnan

830
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,940
should be heavily guarded,

831
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,630
yet all guards were removed.

832
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,190
Thinking about it carefully,

833
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,590
it's terrifying.

834
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,880
The masked man who incited

835
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,010
Little Prince Lie Na

836
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,320
must be someone extraordinary.

837
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,220
Someone who could recognize a Bird Slave

838
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:21,840
must have

839
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,230
frequently visited

840
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:26,630
the Eastern Palace
when Emperor Zhongzong was Crown Prince.

841
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,300
The most likely candidate

842
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,520
would be from
the Li and Wu imperial clans.

843
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:41,230
[Virtue resonates far and wide]
