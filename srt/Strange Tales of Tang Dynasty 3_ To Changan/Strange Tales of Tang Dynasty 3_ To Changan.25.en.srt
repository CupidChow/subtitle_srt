[Episode 25]

3
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:40,100
Hurry up! Hurry up!

4
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,060
Second Master,

5
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,510
what took you so long?

6
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,760
You two!

7
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,560
You didn't come upstairs to save me!

8
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,290
Trying to keep the money for yourselves?

9
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,440
I should kick both your useless asses!

10
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,790
Wait, Second Master!

11
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,800
It's not what you think.

12
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,870
Second Master!

13
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,260
Second Master!

14
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,190
I'm sorry!

15
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,520
I'm sorry!

16
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:27,190
We surrender.

17
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,850
You two useless fools,

18
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,710
hurry up and carry me out of here!

19
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,840
I can't run anymore.

20
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,430
I can't run anymore.

21
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,230
I need a break.

22
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,710
A break?

23
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,130
Do you have a death wish?

24
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,190
Waiting for officials to arrest us?

25
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,310
Now lift me and run!

26
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,880
You aren't the one carrying the chest.

27
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,320
Why don't you try it?

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,829
How dare you speak to me like that?

29
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,240
Dagger, dagger.

30
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,840
No, no.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,400
-I dare you to say it again!
-Second Master.

32
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,310
The old man in the chest

33
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,420
is just too heavy.

34
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,820
We've been set up.

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,120
The money in the exchange shop

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
can't be retrieved anymore.

37
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,220
Why don't we

38
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,120
kill that old guy?

39
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,680
That's right, Second Master.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,520
Let's kill him

41
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:07,840
and take out what's inside.

42
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,310
We three can split it equally

43
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,370
and flee together.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,690
Who am I?

45
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,370
And who are you two?

46
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,950
You think you can share equally with me?

47
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:16,800
You!

48
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,800
What are you trying to do?

49
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:21,530
You…

50
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,700
Don't do anything stupid!

51
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,520
I'm the Deputy Leader!

52
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,120
No, no, no.

53
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,390
We're like brothers.

54
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,800
Back then,

55
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,640
I was the one who took you two in.

56
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:36,870
Took us in?

57
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,190
You just wanted us

58
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,650
to be your slaves forever!

59
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,480
The treasure in the chest is all yours.

60
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,000
Spare me, please!

61
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,800
Spare you?

62
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,170
So you can kick our asses again?

63
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:04,960
Qilang,

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,130
open the chest.

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,200
Let me rest a bit more.

66
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,210
How dare you talk back?

67
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,090
Why don't you open it yourself?

68
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,470
I'm not your real brother.

69
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,930
Why do you order me around?

70
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
Are you an idiot?

71
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,240
You want me to kick your ass, don't you?

72
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,700
You want to kick my ass too?

73
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,520
That's why I keep you around.

74
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,630
Splitting the loot two ways

75
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,310
is better than splitting it three ways.

76
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,360
But it's even better

77
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,690
to keep it all to myself!

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,840
Go to hell!

79
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,000
Sir.

[Wine and Verses]

81
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,680
This is the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

82
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,160
Lu Lingfeng.

83
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,480
[Yuan Li, leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe]

84
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,190
I'm Yuan Li, leader of the Xuanhuo Troupe.

85
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,630
Greetings, Officer.

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,360
These two are poets.

87
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,480
That one is the owner
of Ruan's Restaurant.

88
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,390
Thank you all, sirs.

89
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,920
If it weren't for you,

90
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,560
I would be dead by now.

91
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,580
Half a month ago...

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,040
Stop!

93
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:55,680
Stop!

94
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:01,420
[Xuanhuo]

95
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,630
I lied to those bandits

96
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,420
that I had a lot of money

97
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,830
stored in an exchange shop,

98
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,090
and only I personally could withdraw it.

99
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,850
That's why they didn't kill me.

100
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,160
[Wine and Verses]

101
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,430
They kept me in a chest

102
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,240
and gave me some food

103
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,630
and water at night.

104
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:24,310
They brought the Xuanhuo Troupe
to Chang'an this time

105
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,750
to force me

106
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,430
to withdraw the money
from the exchange shop.

107
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,000
Exactly.

108
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:29,950
They even threatened

109
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,390
to kill Mr. Yuan.

110
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,950
If we didn't obey,

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,000
they said they'd bury him alive.

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,190
Qilang also forced me

113
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,120
to be his lover.

114
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,040
I felt sick just looking at him.

115
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,630
I had no choice

116
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,690
but to submit to this fake leader.

117
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,190
I was terrified they'd go too far

118
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,390
and kill Mr. Yuan

119
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,600
and all the girls.

120
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,190
Sang.

121
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,730
Don't you have anything to say?

122
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,430
The girls have said everything.

123
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,600
Mr. Yuan survived a dangerous situation,

124
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,040
which is worth celebrating.

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,430
Those bandits had each

126
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,430
taken several lives.

127
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Using a leopard to punish them

128
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,630
and letting the leopard return to the wild

129
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,510
achieves harmony between humans

130
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,140
and beasts.

131
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,190
It seems quite fitting.

132
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,510
It's good indeed.

133
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,390
I was also thinking of
releasing that leopard,

134
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,630
but I'm curious how you

135
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,510
managed the switch.

136
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,850
If the leopard didn't wake up,

137
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,430
those bandits would

138
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,960
get away with their crimes.

139
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,120
Mr. Ruan,

140
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,870
don't worry about that.

141
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:39,190
[Wine and Verses]

142
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,590
If we weren't confident,

143
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,750
Official Lu would have gone after

144
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,080
those bandits already.

145
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,180
I'm also very curious.

146
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,600
I was tied up

147
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,800
and gagged.

148
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,360
Suddenly, I saw the chest lid open.

149
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,870
But...

150
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,580
for some reason, I felt very dizzy

151
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,800
and passed out.

152
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,120
How I got out afterward

153
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,070
and who exactly rescued me,

154
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,160
I never saw.

155
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,750
It was me, of course.

156
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,780
Besides me,

157
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,950
who else could carry you

158
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,950
out of that chest

159
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,560
and put the leopard in?

160
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,310
Thank you.

161
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,220
I must bow to you again, Official Lu.

162
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:20,920
[Happiness]

163
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,560
No need.

164
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,510
After such a busy night,

165
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,510
I'm hungry again.

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,570
Mr. Ruan,

167
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:30,070
do you have any wine and dishes left?

168
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,600
I was just thinking of
throwing another feast

169
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,270
to celebrate your success in cracking
another major case, Official Lu.

170
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,789
You caught these bandits

171
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,789
right here in my restaurant.

172
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,030
Mr. Wang, if this event

173
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,150
can be written into your poem,

174
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,510
I think the title

175
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,100
won't need to include

176
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,570
the words "Playfully Presented," right?

177
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,440
Whether I add them or not depends on

178
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,270
how sumptuous the feast is.

179
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,030
That's so you, Wang Youbo.

180
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,320
Lang!

181
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,320
Yes.

182
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:01,680
Set up another feast

183
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,960
with the finest wine

184
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,670
and all our signature dishes.

185
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,150
Yes.

186
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:09,750
Mr. Yuan.

187
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,480
I wonder what other skills

188
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,900
your Xuanhuo Troupe has.

189
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,240
Show us now.

190
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,120
Well…

191
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,670
I hope being tied up in that chest

192
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,750

a moment to prepare.

Don't just focus on the bridal chamber.

forced by that old man.

262
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,460
We're accomplices at most.

Master Fei.

266
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,120
I've been worried

267
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,550
you'd get drunk and mess things up.

268
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:37,910
I'm not drunk at all.

269
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,360
Su Wuming didn't

270
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,630
even let me drink.

271
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:42,270
I've been busy all day.

272
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,720
Time to reward myself

273
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,910
and drink my fill.

274
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:50,360
Fei, there's an important task

275
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,150
for you.

276
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,570
You must not drink.

277
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,440
What could be so important

278
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,170
that it keeps me from drinking?

279
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,790
According to our secret agents,

280
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,600
the long-hidden Black Fire

281
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,550
has sneaked back into Chang'an.

282
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,349
His target should be

283
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:06,510
Ruan's Restaurant.

284
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:08,550
This guy has killed countless people.

285
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,160
His methods are extremely cruel.

286
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,030
If you drink and ruin things,

287
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:14,440
the consequences would be unimaginable.

288
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,829
Who's back again?

289
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
The moment I heard that name,

290
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,880
I knew it was an old acquaintance.

291
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,589
20 years ago,
when I was at the Ghost Market,

292
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,000
he was hunted down by his enemies

293
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:27,970
and was almost bleeding to death.

294
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,310
It was I

295
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,710
who dragged you back from death's door.

296
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,400
And yet,

297
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,510
in order to get a magical elixir,

298
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,720
he murdered

299
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,200
four young disciples of the Medicine King.

300
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,880
Those children

301
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,270
all called me Uncle Fei.

302
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Today, I'll avenge them!

303
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,110
I...

304
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,350
Give me your sword.

305
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,880
Mr. Fei, why stain your hands

306
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,000
with this old scoundrel's blood?

307
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,720
Today, I must eat his flesh

308
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,150
and drink his blood. I...

309
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,130
-Mr. Fei.
-Fei, enough!

310
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:57,680
His crimes are numerous.

311
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,270
We must question him thoroughly

312
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,530
to bring justice for all those he killed.

313
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,720
Black Fire,

314
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,440
you've been hiding for 20 years,

315
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,640
yet you dare name this theater troupe

316
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,360
the Xuanhuo Troupe.

317
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,310
"Xuan" means black.

318
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,270
"Huo" means fire.

319
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
You're challenging the county office!

320
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,680
Lu Lingfeng.

321
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,880
Su Wuming.

322
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,880
You two are Master Di's disciples.

323
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,640
I heard about you a long time ago.

324
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
I never expected

325
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,880
to run into you here.

326
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,510
Guess I'm unlucky.

327
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,590
You didn't run into us.

328
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:35,240
We came to

329
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,550
Ruan's Restaurant

330
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,930
specifically to wait for you.

331
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,310
You…

332
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,160
I just don't understand

333
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,560
how someone with your skills

334
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,680
could possibly be

335
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,920
captured by Gou Mengchang's gang.

336
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,640
If they hadn't outnumbered me,

337
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:55,150
I would never
have suffered such humiliation.

338
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,960
You're lying!

339
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,000
The Black Fire

340
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,030
is known for his cunning.

341
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,440
If he can trick his way out,

342
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,040
he will never fight head-on.

343
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,400
His specialty

344
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
is killing with illusions.

345
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,070
If it had been a fight with real weapons,

346
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,160
you would have been

347
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,560
hacked to death
in the wilderness long ago!

348
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:16,830
Let me ask you.

349
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,830
After hiding for 20 years,

350
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,400
why have you reappeared to commit crimes?

351
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,860
My life belongs to Blood Drop.

352
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,690
I had no choice.

353
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,070
You received a Blood Drop Order?

354
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,080
I'm going to die anyway.

355
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,970
Don't expect to get

356
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,470
any information from me.

357
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,760
Arrest them all!

358
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,930
Official Lu, I'm not too late, am I?

359
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:51,790
Just in time.

360
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,590
Take these people in the courtyard

361
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,960
and Gou Mengchang inside

362
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,110
back to the county office.

363
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,590
Yes.

364
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,350
Get up.

365
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:58,880
Be gentle!

366
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,210
Move!

367
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,270
Tie him up tightly.

368
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,750
He knows illusion techniques.

369
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,240
Yes.

370
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,000
Mr. Su.

371
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,970
Something's not right.

372
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,830
You just said

373
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,960
you came here specifically

374
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,890
to wait for them.

375
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:12,640
Yet wasn't I the one who invited you all

376
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,200
to my place to make sushan?

377
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,550
You've confused me!

378
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,200
Sometimes, it's better to stay confused.

379
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,880
Right, right.

380
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,830
Miss Sang,

381
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,070
I could tell from the beginning

382
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,330
that you were coerced.

383
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,440
You stopped in time earlier

384
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,720
instead of helping them.

385
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,750
That proves it.

386
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,150
You're truly observant.

387
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,640
Help me! Help me!

388
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,920
They're already helping us.

389
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,850
So stop yelling.

390
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,400
Did you forget those girls before you?

391
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,770
Xiaopa and the other two

392
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,310
are all accomplices
of that so-called leader.

393
00:20:58,310 --> 00:20:59,270
They kidnapped

394
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,510
several other girls.

395
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,030
Because they were disobedient,

396
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:04,490
they were either strangled
or buried alive.

397
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,480
So...

398
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,000
Under such threats,

399
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,830
you still managed to find a chance

400
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,480
to reveal

401
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,240
the name Black Fire.

402
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:14,440
Yes.

403
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,270
Although I was held captive for years,

404
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,310
I refused to accept my fate

405
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,640
and kept looking for a chance to escape.

406
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,550
I accidentally overheard Xiaopa

407
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,030
talking with that old scoundrel.

408
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,550
I learned his alias was Black Fire

409
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,830
and that he was
an extremely wicked person.

410
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,960
If the county office got the news,

411
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,270
they would surely come to arrest him.

412
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,680
Then I would be saved.

413
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,680
So I deliberately leaked the information.

414
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,270
It was because of your tip

415
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,270
that the secret agents were able

416
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,590
to get crucial intelligence.

417
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,270
Only then could we connect
the Xuanhuo Troupe

418
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,790
with the Black Fire.

419
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,080
In that case,

420
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,350
I've managed to avenge

421
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,790
those few girls

422
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,680
they murdered.

423
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,210
You're registered as a slave?

424
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,550
Yes.

425
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,030
You've done a great service
to Yongzhou Prefecture.

426
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,200
As a reward,

427
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,400
the Yongzhou Judicial Official's office

428
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,830
will find a way
to remove your slave status.

429
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,500
That's wonderful!

430
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,510
Miss Sang, you'll be free soon.

431
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,440
Really?

432
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,200
You're not lying to me, are you?

433
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,750
I'm the Chief of Secret Agents
in Yongzhou

434
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,590
and also a disciple of Master Di.

435
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,680
I will certainly keep my promise.

436
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:38,480
Thank you very much.

437
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,880
Today,

438
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,310
I've proved
to be a qualified secret agent!

439
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,310
If it weren't for me…

440
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,810
if it weren't for me,

441
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,030
you'd have all been knocked out…

442
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:55,440
Let me do it.

443
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,350
By that Gou guy.

444
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,030
Xijun,

445
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:23,030
before they drink later,

446
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,750
let them eat sushan first.

447
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:25,680
Make sure

448
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,720
everyone finishes theirs.

449
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Alright, Fei.

450
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,000
Look at you,

451
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,350
always bragging.

452
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:38,240
But you managed to get that leopard

453
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,640
into the chest.

454
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,860
That does take some skill.

455
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,160
From what I know,

456
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,320
30 years ago, the Black Fire

457
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,510
had already killed multiple people.

458
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:54,000
But the troupe leader, Sai Mengchang,

459
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,480
and Lang Yehu—

460
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,880
their ages don't match his at all.

461
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:01,550
I will…

462
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,440
find an opportunity to uncover the truth.

463
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,900
Come on. Fill up the cups!

464
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,590
It's been 20 years

465
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,110
since I last saw that old crook.

466
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,090
So when I first saw him,

467
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,480
I wasn't sure right away.

468
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,070
But then I thought,

469
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,510
with Lu Lingfeng and Su Wuming here,

470
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,160
even if I let him out,

471
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,030
there was no way he could escape.

472
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,690
Therefore…

473
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,880
You knocked the guy out

474
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,720
and revived the leopard with incense

475
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,200
and made it obey you.

476
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,440
You are like a divine being!

477
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,680
In the past,
when I treated migraines in Nanzhou

478
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,750
and cured mute slaves in Yunding County,

479
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,350
they called me that too.

480
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,880
Since you are friends of Leng Ji,

481
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,670
there's no need to be so polite.

482
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:30,000
Where is Leng Ji?

483
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,960
Have him come drink with me.

484
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,510
I've gone a whole day without meat

485
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,160
and wine.

486
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,030
Leng Ji!

487
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,200
Mr. Fei.

488
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,440
Mr. Fei.

489
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,960
We can set up another feast,

490
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,240
but today

491
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,160
is Leng Ji's wedding day.

492
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,720
The wedding night is priceless.

493
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,590
So don't call him out

494
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,590
to drink with you.

495
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,110
Though

496
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,830
I'm not much of a poet,

497
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,510
Mr. Gao and Mr. Wang here

498
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,400
are famous poets.

499
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,000
How about we drink with you

500
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:58,750
instead?

501
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,270
As long as I'm drinking, anyone will do.

502
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,840
Lu Lingfeng.

503
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,570
I made great contributions today.

504
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,110
You're the Judicial Official.

505
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,000
You'll have to

506
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,730
toast me a few more times later.

507
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,400
Su Wuming!

508
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,000
You've been ordering me around all day,

509
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,460
so you need to toast me too.

510
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,510
No problem. I'll toast you too.

511
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,830
Yingtao, you're on duty.

512
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,380
You can't leave your post.

513
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,960
The task you assigned me…

514
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,750
Drinking will mess things up.

515
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,820
Hurry up and go keep watch for me.

516
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,840
The lights in the bridal chamber
are already out.

517
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,080
What's there to watch?

518
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,720
Wait.

519
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,750
Master Fei, I'll go with Yingtao.

520
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,070
A little drink won't affect the task.

521
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:44,930
Let's go.

522
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,350
You...

523
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,480
T-They…

524
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:51,910
If I remember correctly,

525
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,590
this should be the fourth time

526
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:55,200
we've reset the feast.

527
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,000
Come on, let's drink.

528
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,400
Cheers.

529
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:00,390
Everyone.

530
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,240
Tonight,

531
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,790
this bright moon hanging in the sky

532
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:24,040
is both the moon of the Tang Empire…

533
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,030
and the moon of poets.

534
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,330
Unfortunately,

535
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:34,240
I, Ruan Daxiong,

536
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,680
can help the Yongzhou Prefecture Office
catch criminals

537
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,200
but don't know how to write

538
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,110
better poetry.

539
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:44,310
Mr. Ruan, please sit.

540
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,350
The bright moon

541
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:51,510
can actually make a man like you

542
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,550
suddenly feel sentimental.

543
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,720
This shows

544
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:57,590
that Chang'an is filled
with poetic inspiration.

545
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:00,110
Writing good poetry

546
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,480
is just a matter of time for you.

547
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,550
For a long time,

548
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,030
I believed

549
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,640
that poetry came from the poem itself.

550
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,480
That fine language was enough.

551
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,000
But traveling sorrowfully south,

552
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,240
then westward,

553
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,510
wandering the world made me realize

554
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,910
that to write good poetry,

555
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,350
you must love the vastness of the world

556
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,680
and embrace the life within it.

557
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,760
Only then can one have a poetic heart.

558
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,830
Poets should be like this.

559
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,790
Heroes too.

560
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,720
Well said!

561
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,030
Lu is modest

562
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:42,530
and claims he's not a poet,

563
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,480
yet he summed up

564
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,200
the essence of poetry.

565
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,400
"Hero" is a great word.

566
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,780
Mr. Ruan, didn't you complain

567
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,420
that your restaurant's name
was too common?

568
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:54,830
In my opinion,

569
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,220
you can rename it "Hero Restaurant."

570
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,270
What do you think?

571
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,680
That's a wonderful name!

572
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,400
I'd be honored

573
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,390
to inscribe it for you.

574
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,720
H-How can I possibly thank

575
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,640
you two?

576
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,070
No need to thank us.

577
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:18,530
Come on.

578
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,680
Let's drink.

579
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,010
Sure.

580
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,800
Let's drink.

581
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,610
Let's drink.

582
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,200
Let's drink.

583
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,200
Come on,

584
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,030
let's drink!

585
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,920
Cheers!

586
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,930
[Happiness]

587
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,280
I agreed with Leng Ji to meet at 9 AM.

588
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,200
It's time now.

589
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,790
Why is there no sign of him?

590
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:49,490
I'll go knock on the door.

591
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,960
Mr. Leng.

592
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,440
Leng Ji!

593
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:04,200
Yingtao,

594
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,790
you didn't drink too much and fall asleep,

595
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,920
letting him leave
without noticing, did you?

596
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
-I…
-No.

597
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,440
I was with Yingtao the whole time.

598
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,970
Neither of us even blinked.

599
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,070
Oh no!

600
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:15,640
Last night, they said

601
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,750
they'd commit suicide together.

602
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:17,400
Have they…

603
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,660
Move aside.

604
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,070
Ruan Daxiong!

605
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,830
What happened?

606
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,400
Look.

607
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,880
Explain this.

608
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,830
I drank too much.

609
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:56,720
This room—

610
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,240
to prevent intruders,

611
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,720
a tunnel was dug under it.

612
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,630
How could I have forgotten?

613
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,750
Since the three talents of Nanzhou
died one after another,

614
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,760
I've been the loneliest man alive.

615
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,440
This journey north,

616
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,640
first to Luoyang and then to Chang'an,

617
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,720
was all to find you.

618
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,110
Today, my wish has finally been fulfilled!

619
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,790
Having been reunited for one night,

620
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:30,450
I have no regrets in this life.

621
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,530
Why do you insist on taking me away?

622
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,440
Aren't you afraid
of being pursued by the authorities

623
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,240
and losing a poet's freedom

624
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,640
for the rest of your life?

625
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,490
Staying by your side forever

626
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,830
is the greatest

627
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,000
freedom

628
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,350
for me.

629
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,440
It's just that we've put Gao Da
and Wang Youbo in a tough spot.

630
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,110
They'll

631
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,480
survive it.

632
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,930
I'll thank them properly another day.

633
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,940
What about
those two disciples of Master Di?

634
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,670
They'll really have trouble with this.

635
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,730
They'll have to rack their brains

636
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,600
to find a way to clear your name.

637
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,450
Otherwise,
they'll be held responsible too.

638
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,750
You can still laugh?

639
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,510
Thinking about every day from now on,

640
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:16,910
I want to laugh heartily.

641
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:17,960
Tell me.

642
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,920
Where do you want me to take you?

643
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,050
My hometown is in Nanzhou.

644
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,110
If you want to go, I'll take you there.

645
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,720
If you want to return to Luoyang,

646
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,780
we'll go together.

647
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,240
In short,

648
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,450
I once let you down, but I'll use

649
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,980
the rest of my life to make it up to you.

650
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,440
What if I prefer a simple life

651
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,680
and want you to spend every day

652
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,340
being a normal couple with me?

653
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,460
How will you be a poet then?

654
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,240
Who says a poet cannot live

655
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,770
among the rising smoke
of common households?

656
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,710
Perhaps my best poems

657
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,920
will be born

658
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,640
in the simple days spent with you.

659
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,680
My strange yet familiar poet,

660
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,480
let's go.

661
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,510
My familiar yet strange assassin,

662
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,410
where are we going exactly?

663
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,910
It's up to you.

664
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,070
Wherever you want to go,

665
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,070
I will go with you.

666
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,160
Official Lu.

667
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,510
I am the guarantor.

668
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,830
I'm ready

669
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,630
to accept the punishment
for covering for Leng Ji.

670
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,010
Do you need to tie me up?

671
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:47,920
Go ahead.

672
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,640
How can I possibly

673
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,170
be left out of this, Mr. Gao?

674
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,370
Besides, didn't we

675
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,480
agree to travel beyond
the Great Wall together?

676
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,200
At worst,

677
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,000
we'll leave after serving our sentence.

678
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,660
This way, I can write

679
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,190
more magnificent poems.

680
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,830
Well, well, you two—

681
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,230
you had this planned all along.

682
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,360
Even Su Wuming and Lu Lingfeng

683
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,110
got fooled.

684
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
What's going on?

685
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,510
I was drunk just now.

686
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:43,760
I know nothing.

687
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,320
The mess still needs to be cleaned.

688
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,120
It's all on me.

689
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,590
We caught the assassin Black Fire

690
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,510
and the bandit Gou Mengchang.

691
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,760
This trip has been quite fruitful.

692
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,900
As for the rest…

693
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:02,150
actually, I was drunk too.

694
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:04,960
Great. Then let's go.

695
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,110
Go where?

696
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,000
How can we

697
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,260
let them off so easily?

698
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,040
Then what do you want?

699
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,230
I can't release them anyway.

700
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,320
Unless...

701
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,280
Unless what?

702
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,260
Unless they run away on their own.

703
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,760
Wuming, you mean

704
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:28,080
we'll let them crawl out from there?

705
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,290
That's a good idea!

706
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,600
Those arrogant poets

707
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:33,170
should be taught a lesson.

708
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,960
Balancing emotion and law is tough,

709
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,360
but today's matter
still has to be reported.

710
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,880
I'll head to the office first.

711
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,410
The rest is yours to handle.

712
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,130
[Hero Restaurant]

713
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,160
[Hero Restaurant]

714
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:03,920
[Hero Restaurant]

715
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,480
Mr. Gao personally inscribed this plaque.

716
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,620
Lang. Let me hang it myself.

717
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:11,070
[Hero Restaurant]

718
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,130
Please be careful.

719
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,970
Mr. Su, you came?

720
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,360
How can we let Mr. Su

721
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,370
hold the ladder?

722
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,130
Lang, go

723
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:21,360
bring Hou out here

724
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,540
to hold this ladder.

725
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,670
[Hero Restaurant]

726
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,110
Okay.

727
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,750
Mr. Ruan,

728
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,630
you and Leng Ji are old acquaintances,
aren't you?

729
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,240
Don't deny it.

730
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,480
I'm not the Judicial Official.

731
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,000
Mr. Su.

732
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,380
Come.

733
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,630
[Hero Restaurant]

734
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,000
No lies in front of an honest man.

735
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,920
Leng Ji and I

736
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,420
were old friends back
in the Divine Capital.

737
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:51,280
Or rather,

738
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,760
I admired him even then.

739
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,030
I once witnessed

740
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,960
the love between him and Jiaonu.

741
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,960
A month ago,

742
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:00,670
I met Leng Ji in Chang'an

743
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,960
and promised him

744
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,660
that once I found Jiaonu,

745
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,550
I would do whatever it took

746
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,440
to help them reunite.

747
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,230
[Hero Restaurant]

748
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,030
A few days ago,

749
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,150
Lang told me

750
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,360
that Hou was up to something.

751
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:14,840
He warned me to be careful.

752
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,370
So I pretended to go hunting

753
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,710
and secretly followed him.

754
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,100
I discovered he was hiring an assassin.

755
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,540
And the one he hired

756
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,240
was none other than Jiaonu.

757
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,310
I told you to hurry up.

758
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:27,510
Hurry!

759
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:32,960
Then why do you still dare

760
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,820
to let him hold the ladder for you?

761
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,510
He used to be a servant

762
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:38,320
working under my father.

763
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:39,840
I lost my mother young

764
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,070
and grew up on his back.

765
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,960
He is

766
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,830
disappointed in me
because he cares a lot about me.

767
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,600
If he really wanted me dead,

768
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,280
he wouldn't need an assassin.

769
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,800
He prepares my meals every day.

770
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,860
One dose of poison,

771
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,480
and I'd be dead already.

[Hero Restaurant]

773
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,280
What are you standing there for?

774
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,230
Hold the ladder!

[Hero Restaurant]

776
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,150
You wastrel.
It's a century-old family business.

777
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:09,810
You've even changed its name.

778
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,250
What are you muttering about?

779
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,480
I wish I could push this ladder over

780
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,140
and let you fall to your death!

781
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,320
Come, take the ladder away.

782
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,110
In the past,

783
00:38:22,190 --> 00:38:23,440
this place was called Ruan's Restaurant.

784
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,370
The boss had to be me, Ruan Daxiong.

785
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,480
But now,

786
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,660
it's called Hero Restaurant.

787
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,000
From now on,

788
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,710
the boss here

789
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,840
is you.

790
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,150
That…

791
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,480
Daxiong.

792
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,140
Hou, you care more about

793
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,090
this business of mine than I do.

794
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,560
I can entrust it to you

795
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:49,730
with peace of mind.

799
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,190
Who's going to pay for the sushan?

800
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:07,170
He is the boss. He'll pay.

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,400
Ruan Daxiong!

803
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,920
The poets were invited by you to help?

804
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,480
You're the one who deceived Lu Lingfeng

805
00:39:24,190 --> 00:39:25,550
and me?

807
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,400
However, you truly deserve

808
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,360
to be called a hero.

809
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:03,910
We're finally going
beyond the Great Wall.

810
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,150
It's a pity Mr. Leng

811
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,280
can't join us.

812
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:15,070
What do you think of Ruan Daxiong?

813
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,710
One can't judge a book by its cover,

814
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,890
nor judge someone by their profession.

815
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,400
This man who runs a restaurant

816
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,080
has the spirit of a poet.

817
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,770
Why don't we

818
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,000
go back and ask him to come along?

819
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,230
You think so too?

820
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,620
My poet friends!

821
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,250
Wait for me, my poet friends!

822
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:42,090
I've finally caught up with you.

823
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,190
I've heard

824
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:45,140
that in the north,
snow falls even in August.

825
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,760
I wonder if you two
brought enough clothing

826
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,070
for the journey to the north.

827
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,930
Also, here are some Sesame Bakes,

828
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,590
some meat, and wine.

829
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,630
These two gourds contain
sour cabbage soup.

830
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,090
You can take it on the road.

831
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:56,710
Mr. Ruan,

832
00:40:58,110 --> 00:40:59,240
would you be willing

833
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,400
to go beyond the Great Wall with us?

834
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,030
Youbo is asking

835
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:07,480
if you'd like

836
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,630
to head beyond the Great Wall with us.

837
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,480
I would love to!

838
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,190
Of course I would!

839
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,230
Do you have family to bid farewell to?

840
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,560
I have no family left,

841
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,150
and I've already entrusted the restaurant

842
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,280
to Mr. Hou to manage.

843
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,920
I'm free as a bird now.

844
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,320
Then what are we waiting for?

845
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
The three of us...

846
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,030
No.

847
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,510
We three Tang poets

848
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,030
will head west together

849
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,630
and go beyond the Great Wall!

850
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,840
A poet...

851
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,260
I've actually become a real poet?

852
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,570
Poet Ruan, don't hesitate.

853
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,840
Ride fast and join us!

854
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,240

855
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,130
sets off today

856
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,440
