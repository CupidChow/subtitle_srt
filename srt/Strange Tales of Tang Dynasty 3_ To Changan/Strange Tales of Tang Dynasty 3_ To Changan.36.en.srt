00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,310
the spies from Yenisei Kirghiz
as soon as possible

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,600
There must be no mishaps.

10
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,650
Understood.

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,600

15
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,070
Why don't you see Grand General off first?

16
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,040

Ji,

31
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,910
you haven't visited me for days.

32
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,590
You've been solving mysterious cases
one after another,

33

34
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,130
so you must be very busy.

35
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,680
But

36
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,910
I miss you, my son.

37

How has Your Highness been feeling lately?

38

My health is fine,

39
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,430

40
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,000
my mood is not.

41
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,810
What troubles you?

42
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,560
I've been worried about

43
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,420
the prosperity of our Tang Empire

44
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,960
every day.

45
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,470
Are you planning to say that

46
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,240
with His Majesty in charge,

47
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,870
I shouldn't worry?

48
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,520
I wouldn't dare think that.

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,350
I am the Grand Princess
of the Tang Empire.

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,650
Tang Empire's affairs are my affairs.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,520
Take the foreign nation,
Yenisei Kirghiz, for example.

52
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,120
They have been eyeing our borders

53
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,280
with covetous intent.

54
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,800
My heart

55
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,370
will never be at peace

56
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,090
until they are eliminated.

57
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,560
During Empress Wu Zetian's reign,

58
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,800
at the Battle of Wushan,

59
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,400
our army suffered a terrible defeat

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,860
which boosted the foreign nation's morale.

61
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,780
Lu Lingfeng,

62
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:11,940
let me tell you.

63
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,910
Yenisei Kirghiz excels at espionage.

64
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,089
It's said that in Chang'an,

65
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,800
they've planted formidable spies

66
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,370
who are now stirring

67
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,340
with malicious intent.

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,860
Yenisei Kirghiz is also
skilled at sowing discord.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,120
If you captured any spies,

70
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,440
just kill them.

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,360
No need for interrogation.

72
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,950
Whatever they confess

73
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:37,880
will just be pre-fabricated lies
meant to divide us.

74
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,830
Do you understand

75
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,470
what I'm telling you?

76
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,890
Her Highness really said that?

77
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,230
For once,

78
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,000
I fail to grasp

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
any of her hidden messages.

80
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,940
Then, let's do it this way.

81
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,420
Once a Yenisei Kirghiz spy is caught,

82
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,420
if they confess

83
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,120
to having connections
with the Princess's Mansion,

84
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,580
we kill them immediately.

85
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,750
Su Wuming, you...

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,630
The Princess mentioning this in advance

87
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,560
proves that her household

88
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,000
indeed has connections
with the Yenisei Kirghiz.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,120
But if Yenisei Kirghiz
intends to cause chaos in our empire,

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,560
Her Highness would never do anything

91
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,270
to help them.

92
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,880
That's what Her Highness means.

93
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,330
Do you understand?

94
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,230
Well...

95
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:25,430
Are you currently

96
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:27,630
investigating Yenisei Kirghiz spies?

97
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:28,950
How did you know?

98
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,550
Doesn't it all fit together?

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,110

100

without hesitation.

101
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,800
I think I understand now.

102
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:39,240
The Princess's Mansion must have
also received

103
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
intel about
the Yenisei Kirghiz spies,

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,240
but cannot speak about it directly.

105
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,070
Exactly.

106
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,330
Let me tell you.

107
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,490
Whether it's His Majesty, Her Highness

108
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,630
or even the Retired Emperor,

109
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,560
they all have dedicated people
managing intel.

110
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,270
Chang'an is the most crucial place
of the Tang Empire.

111
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,510

and united citizens.

114
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,390
But we also need to gather intel
and anticipate threats

115
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,560
to be truly secured.

116
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:10,110
Have you heard of
the Ghost Market Intel Stall?

117
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,400
More than just heard of it.

118
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,720
Back then, Master Di and I

119
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,500
even went there in disguise.

120
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,070
Your mentor went there too?

121
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:20,720
Yes.

122
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,390
But the one from back then was destroyed.

123
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,790
The current Intel Stall must be

124
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,170
rebuilt since then.

125
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,480

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,290
What do you want it for?

193
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:15,100
I want to open a branch of my Sushan Shop.

194
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:16,360
Sushan?

195
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,870
I've heard of it.

196
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,910
It's just shaved ice, isn't it?

197
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,440
Thats...

198
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,170
That's not very nice of you.

199
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,540
I'm not renting it.

200
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,970
You can't say no.

201
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,840
Because we're destined to work together.

202
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,220
What destiny?

203
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,190
Look.

204
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,720
Your inn is called the Bafang Inn,

205
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,240
right?

206
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,550
These wontons are called Sixi Wonton,

207
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:39,200
right?

208
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,060
And my Sushan Shop

209
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,990
is called Liuhe Sushan Shop.

210
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:45,020
Isn't that destiny?

211
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,240
It's just a coincidence.

212
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
Stop trying to get friendly.

213
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,270
You said just now

214
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,250
that you're Lady Chong the Thirty-Sixth.

215
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,910
Six times six is thirty-six!

216
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,320
This means my Liuhe Sushan Shop

217
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:04,030
was always meant to include you,

218
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,100
Lady Chong the Thirty-Sixth.

219
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,030
It's your destiny!

220
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,280
If you flatly refuse,

221
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,600
it might bring you bad luck.

222
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,500
I'm not opening this branch

223
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,420
just to make money.

224
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,720
I mainly want to promote sushan.

225
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,280
How about this? After the branch opens,

226
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,150
anyone who eats your wontons

227
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,930
can buy my sushan at 40% off.

228
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,130
On top of that,

229
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,550
those staying at your inn

230
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,410
will each get a serving of sushan

231
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,630
for free.

232
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,810
How about it?

233
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,000
You...

234
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,080
Are you serious?

235
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,330
Of course.

236
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,270
That would cause you to lose money.

237
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,140
What's in it for you?

238
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,630
Well, I'm here...

239
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,380
For your beauty, of course.

240
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,310
Aren't you too old

241
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,670
to take a fancy to me?

242
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:55,910
Everyone has a love for beauty.

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,700
It has nothing to do with age.

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,300
I'm a gentleman.

245
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,380
I may admire you,

246
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,540
but I would never harass you.

247
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,150
You're certainly not off-putting.

248
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,210
Then it's settled.

249
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,150
Yang Ji!

250
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,220
Coming!

251
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,890
Pay your respects to the innkeeper.

252
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,220
Greetings, Innkeeper.

253
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,350
He's our Sushan Shop's assistant.

254
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,970
After the branch opens,

255
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,150
he'll be stationed here permanently.

256
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,440
If you need any heavy lifting done

257
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,310
at the wonton shop

258
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,760
or the inn,

259
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,380
just call for him anytime.

260
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,750
Yes, I have plenty of strength.

261
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,870
If you need any help,

262
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,730
please don't hesitate to tell me.

263
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,440
Greetings, General.

264
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,550
Oh, it's you, Li Zhuang.

265
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,270
I already knew

266
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,480
you left the Imperial Guard.

267
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,320
But I didn't expect that

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,150
you were collecting intel

269
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,340
for the Grand General.

270
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,200
[Court of State Ceremonials, Li Zhuang]

271
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,130
My duty needed me

272
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,330
to keep my special identity a secret,

273
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,530
so I couldn't inform you, General.

274
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,190
I understand.

275
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:20,980
Have a seat.

276
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,840
Where do you normally work?

277
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,770
At the Court of State Ceremonials.

278
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,000
That would indeed help

279
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,340
with gathering intel.

280
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,050
But I heard this intel

281
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,630
came from the Ghost Market.

282
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,270
Gathering intel
through foreign delegations

283
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,640
is too difficult.

284
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,980
After all, many of them

285
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,360
have the same role as I do.

286
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,600
They either keep their mouths shut

287
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,750
or spread false intel

288
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,950
to create confusion.

289
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,330
I still have to do my job.

290
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,200
So I had to send my secret agents

291
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,360
to frequent the Intel Stall

292
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,490
at the Ghost Market.

293
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,130
And look,

294
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,110
we obtained this

295
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,380
useful piece of intel.

296
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,070
Who is this secret agent?

297
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,430
A man named Liu Xi.

298
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,600
How much did this intel cost?

299
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,980
100,000 coins.

300
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,750
Li Zhuang.

301
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,630
You're quite generous.

302
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,000
Useful intel is expensive.

303
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,150
I want to meet Liu Xi.

304
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,840
How annoying.

305
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,440
You may go.

306
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,050

307
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,630
In you go.

308
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,550
I...

309
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,120
Forgive my poor eyesight.

310
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,790
Could you be Official Lu?

311
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,120
You know me?

312
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,870
You're from the famous
Lu family of Fanyang,

313
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:08,510
and your mother is the Grand Princess.

314
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,510
So you come to places like this, too?

315
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:11,560
What did you say?

316
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,120
Did I say something wrong?

317
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:18,270
[Secret agent, Liu Xi]

318
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,510
Right, your relationship with the Princess

319
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,720
hasn't been made public yet.

320
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,650
But don't forget

321
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,350
what I do for a living.

322
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,870
As early as a year ago,

323
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,790
someone at the Ghost Market

324
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:29,480
was already selling intel
about your mysterious background.

325
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,880
It was worth 5,000 coins.

326
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Cut the nonsense.

327
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,150
About the intel
you sold to Li Zhuang,

328
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,630
who at the Ghost Market Intel Stall

329
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,720
did you get it from?

330
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,350
Sun Zi.

331
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,670
Who is Sun Zi?

332
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,450
He's the tenant
of the Ghost Market Intel Stall.

333
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,150
That place is the most active

334
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,950
intel market in all of Chang'an.

335
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,930
That naturally makes Sun Zi

336
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,600
the biggest intel broker.

337
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,510
Is the intel true or false?

338
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,390
It can't be false this time.

339
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,080
After all, I spent so much money.

340
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,320

00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:03,640

those informants,

Placing informants in foreign states

502
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,780

Of course.

504
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,520
When did you receive this intel?

505
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,930
Half a month ago.

506
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,640
And when was it sent

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,940
from Yenisei Kirghiz?

508
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:17,030
About two months ago.

509
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,390
So you're saying

510
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,270
the pigeon flew for a month and a half?

511
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,400
Yes.

512
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,450
The journey from Yenisei Kirghiz

513
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,270
to Chang'an is very long.

514
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,400
It's 6,000 li from Chang'an
to Yenisei Kirghiz.

515
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,720
That's certainly far for humans.

516
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,200
But for a carrier pigeon,

517
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,310
it's not that bad.

518
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,720
The mentor, Master Di,

519
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,780
noted in his investigation journals

520
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,930
that he once kept a carrier pigeon.

521
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,530
It could cover a thousand li

522
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,780
and return to its nest in just 4 hours.

523
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,230
Even the slowest pigeons

524
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,280
can easily fly 500 or 600 li

525
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:50,350
in a single day.

526
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,390
Yet your pigeon took

527
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,030
a month and a half to fly 6,000 li.

528
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,400

00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,000
despite your serious injuries,

530
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,640
I still need to ask you:

531
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,680
Are you

532
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,430
really telling the truth?

533
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,720
How dare you, Sun Zi!

534
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,830
Don't you know that

535
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,960
lying to a constable

536
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,160
is a punishable offense?

537
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,760
All right.

538
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,520
Since you're unwilling to break the rules,

539
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:16,390
I'll investigate
the source of this intel myself.

540
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,880
Wait.

541
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,680
Rules are minor matters

542
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,550
compared to the safety of Chang'an.

543

This intel

544
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,150
was sold to me by someone.

545
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,240
I am the owner of the Intel Stall.

546
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,430
I take all kinds of intel,

547
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,850
but only if

548
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,310
it's worth the coin.

549
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,200
Is an intel about the capital's safety

550
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,480
valuable?

551
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,640
I meet a handful

552
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,350
of people like you every day.

553
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,210
Some even claim

554
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:53,950
it concerns the safety
of the entire Tang Empire.

555
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,830
Soon, Yenisei Kirghiz spies will

556
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,060
enter Chang'an

557
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,270

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,640
to plot something big.

560
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,160
Does this concern

561
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,110
the safety of the capital?

562
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,470
Normally, it wouldn't.

563
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,390
But now...

564
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
the international polo tournament

565
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,400
will be played by

566
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,350
the Tang Empire and Yenisei Kirghiz.

567
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:16,610
The key question is...

568
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,090
Why should I trust you?

569
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,170
You want to know

570
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,270
how I got this intel?

571
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,240
I won't reveal anything.

572
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,140
That's the rule, isn't it?

573
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,300
So,

574
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,170
it's up to you to take the risk.

575
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:36,880
How much do you want?

576
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,310
30,000 coins,

577
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:43,270
and I'll tell you the meeting location.

578
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,870
As for the time,

579
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,320
it's 3 days from now.

580
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,790
At that time,

581
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,870
you just need to wait patiently

582
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,750
for your catch.

583
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,720
Did he tell you the meeting location?

584
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,310
Yes.

585
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,550
I wanted to sell the intel first.

586
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,240
Someone would naturally find me.

587
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,780
This way,

588
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,640
I can sell the intel twice,

589
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,720
then sell the meeting location
for another 30,000 coins.

590
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,350
You bought it for 30,000 coins

591
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,070
and planned to sell it for 130,000?

592
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:09,920
How did you get 130,000 coins?

593
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,110
I sold the intel to Liu Xi

594
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,690
for only 10,000 coins.

595
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,600
Liu Xi

596
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,240
bought the intel for 10,000

597
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,510
and sold it for 100,000?

598
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,600
He deserved to die.

599
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,090
Are you sure that person had 6 fingers?

600
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,030
Yes.

601
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,680
He had 6 fingers

602
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,510
on his right hand.

603
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,590
Search the entire city for a man

604
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,390
with 6 fingers on his right hand.

605
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,660
He has a booming voice,

606
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,910
a strong build,

607
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,640
and is over 6 feet tall.

608
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:44,790
Yes.

609
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,980
Don't alert him.

610
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,240
Give me the remaining 3 silver ingots!

611
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:56,450
One life for 4 silver ingots.

612
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,830
That's not a low price in Chang'an.

613
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,110
I even personally

614
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,770
lured him to the Ghost Market.

615
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,260
But you failed.

616
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,780
How dare you come see me?

617
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,270
But you never told us

618
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:12,910
who we were supposed to kill.

619
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,660
Though I escaped,

620
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,280
I still faintly heard...

621
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,400
Yongzhou Judicial Official investigating.

622
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,040
Confess who's behind this.

623
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,850
The current Yongzhou Judicial Official

624
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,310
is Lu Lingfeng.

625
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,070
He was once a top-tier

626
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,370
Imperial Guard.

627
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,270
If you'd told us it was him,

628
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,200
my brothers and I

629
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,960
would never have gotten involved.

630
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,420
Give me the 3 silver ingots

631
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,280
to give my 2 brothers a proper burial.

632
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,400
If you don't,

633
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,380
don't blame me for taking your life.

634
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:43,550
Okay.

635
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,200
I'll get it for you.

636
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,140
If the woman you saw

637
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,510
was actually a man in disguise,

638
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:25,850
then his real face

639
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,220
should look like this.

640
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,590
Miss Xijun, that's incredible!

641
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:31,350
I'll immediately have people
from Yongzhou Prefecture

642
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,470
make copies of this portrait

643
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,640
and search for him throughout the city.

644
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,160
Someone who can
disguise himself as a woman

645
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,760
must be skilled with makeup.

646
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,960
Xijun can draw out his appearance,

647
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,790
but we don't know

648
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,920
what disguise he might be wearing now.

649
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:42,800
Therefore,

650
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,680
the chance of catching him
in the entire city

651
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,540
is quite small.

652
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,140
What should we do then?

653
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,200
We saw him

654
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,370
in Fengyi District.

655
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,230
Have Jia, Luo, and Liu

656
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,720
each take a copy of the portrait

657
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,070
and search the districts

658
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,270
surrounding Fengyi District

659
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,000
one by one.

660
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,690
Yes, sir.

661
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,280
Official Lu.

662
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,580
Please sit.

663
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:15,750
Xijun.

664
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,270
Li Zhuang was my good friend

665
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,160
when I served in the Imperial Guard.

666
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,640
Please make some more sushan

667
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,440
for him to try.

668
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,210
Alright.

669
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,550
Delicious.

670
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,240
General.

671
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,670
You called me here

672
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
not just to eat sushan, right?

673
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,650
Not many of our old comrades are left.

674
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,840
I truly cherish

675
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:44,330
this reunion with you.

676
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:46,960
Indeed.

677
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,070
I've heard about what happened

678
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,200
to Wu and Guo Zhuang.

679
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,880
I'm partly responsible

680
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,440
for their deaths.

681
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,730
I feel ashamed.

682
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:10,470
Whenever I think about it, my heart hurts.

683
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:13,960
But...

684
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,300
Wu and Guo Zhuang

685
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,750
lived up
to the Imperial Guard's reputation

686
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,950
of eliminating evil with their swords.

687
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,400
They died with honor.

688
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,540
What about you?

689
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,530
What do you mean, General?

690
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,240
Now that you work for
the Court of State Ceremonials

691
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,510
and I'm with the Yongzhou Prefecture,

692
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,160
we can drop our old titles.

693
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:33,880
So,

694
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,200
are you interrogating me, Official Lu?

695
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,720
If I were interrogating you,

696
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,120
would we be sitting here?

697
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,640
Back then,

698
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,810
on your first day in the Imperial Guard...

699
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:46,830
Li Zhuang?

700
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,860
You share the same "Zhuang"
with Guo Zhuang.

701
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,710
What does "Zhuang" mean to you?

702
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,270
Confucius said, "When approached with
dignity, people respond with respect."

703
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:57,480
As a member of the Imperial Guard,

704
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,240
I'm always at His Majesty's side.

705
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,110
"Zhuang" means that

706
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:01,400
my every word and action
represent the dignity

707
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,240
and solemnity of the Tang Empire.

708
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,100
Well answered.

709
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,680
You'll surely
achieve great things someday.

710
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,480
If not for your recommendation,

711
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,750
I might still be

712
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,680
an ordinary Imperial Guard today.

713
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,080
But I believe

714
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:14,850
you're not bringing this up today

715
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:16,160
just to reminisce.

716
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,450
If you suspect me, just say so.

717
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,000
Fine.

718
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,310
I'll be direct then.

719
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,750
After you introduced me to Liu Xi,

720
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:28,610
I followed him to the Ghost Market

721
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,250
and was ambushed at the Intel Stall there.

722
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,180
Three assassins with crossbows

723
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,070
tried to kill me.

724
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:36,640
Apart from you,

725
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,790
no one should have known that

726
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:41,070
I was investigating
the source of the intel.

727
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,070
And Liu Xi

728
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,590
clearly knew

729
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,900
there were assassins waiting in ambush.

730
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Are you all right?

731
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,120
It's certainly possible that

732
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,180
Liu Xi hired those assassins.

733
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,080
Because he bought that intel

734
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,730
for 10,000 coins,

735
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,750
but sold it to you for 100,000 coins.

736
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,550
Now that Liu Xi is dead,

737
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,880
there's no way to find out

738
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,920
if the 90,000 coins

739
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,780
went completely into his pockets

740
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,570
or were split evenly between you two.

741
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:15,700
Since he was making money through you,

742
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,240
you might even have gotten a bigger share.

743
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,910
Yes, Liu Xi was my informant.

744
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:25,030
For 2 years,

745
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,840
he provided intel only to me.

746
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,540
Now that he's dead,

747
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,210
I truly can't prove myself.

748
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,400
Li Zhuang!

749
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,620
What are you doing?

750
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,160
My innocence is worth more than my life.

751
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,960
Official Lu.

752
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,200
If there is another life,

753
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
I would rather spend it

754
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
as just an ordinary Imperial Guard,

755
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,900
holding my sword firmly

756
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,400
to protect the peace of the capital!

757
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,100
Brother!

758
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,330
Put down your sword.

759
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,740
Without dying,

760
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,250
I cannot prove my innocence.

761
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,400
I was rash

762
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,780
and made unfounded assumptions.

763
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,810
Please forgive me.

764
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,030
I don't deserve to be called "brother"

765
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,960
by you, General.

766
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,000
Despite your years of mentorship,

767
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,690
I failed to achieve anything.

768
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,160
I was desperate too.

769
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,680
I didn't pocket a single coin
from the 100,000 coins.

770
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,240
If you don't believe me,
search my quarters.

771
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,040
I believe you.

772
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,110
It's all right now.

773
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,480
To everyone present,

774
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:48,000
all the sushan before you

775
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800
are now completely free.

776
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,640
It's on me, Boss Fei!

777
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,160
It's fine, it's fine.

778
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,180
That scared me to death.

779
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:56,960
Sit.

780
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:00,670
Li Zhuang.

781
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,910
You need to carefully recall

782
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,750
who else knew

783
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:07,130
about my investigation of this lead.

784
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,400
After we parted,

785
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,230
I went to the Yongzhou Prefecture.

786
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,400
The Yongzhou Prefecture?

787
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:13,920
Yes.

788
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,320
The Polo Tournament this time

789
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,400
is co-hosted by
the Court of State Ceremonials

790
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,920
and the Yongzhou Prefecture.

791
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,250
So we need to meet daily.

792
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,230
The Tournament is approaching.

793
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:23,230
I have so many things to take care of.

794
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,280
These so-called daily meetings

795
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,870
are just a formality.

796
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,090
How about this?

797
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,480
From now on, Li Zhuang will be the liaison

798
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
for the Court of State Ceremonials.

799
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:33,670
Li Zhuang,

800
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,650
if there's nothing important,

801
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,460
you don't need to report to me.

802
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:38,800
Yes.

803
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,110
As for Yongzhou Prefecture,

804
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:43,960
Magistrate Liu will be in charge.

805
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,969
Liu Jun,

806
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,469
we are just assisting.

807
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,110
Follow
the Court of State Ceremonials' lead.

808
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:50,710
Yes.

809
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,190
Li.

810
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,159
Magistrate Liu.

811
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,110
Since Magistrate Liu is a liaison,

812
00:34:58,110 --> 00:34:58,710
I thought

813
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,670
he should know about
the Yenisei Kirghiz spies

814
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:02,070
infiltrating Chang'an.

815
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,000
Besides,

816
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,320
didn't His Majesty assign

817
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,840
the case to the Yongzhou Prefecture?

818
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,440
Liu Jun?

819
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,510
No one else knows about this?

820
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,070
No one.

821
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,230
Xijun,

822
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
please do me a favor.

823
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,280
Go to Su Wuming

824
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,590
and ask him for Yingtao.

825
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,510
But Wuming just became the county sheriff,

826
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,570
and he's very busy in Wannian County.

827
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,960
What should we do now?

828
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,280
What's troubling you?

829
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,620
I need someone reliable to follow

830
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,750
Liu Jun, the Magistrate of Yongzhou.

831
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,840
But I just sent

832
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,150
Jia and the others out.

833
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,230
Liu Jun?

834
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,480
Liu Jun is just a scholar.

835
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,300
He's not very suspicious.

836
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,370
But we still need to investigate.

837
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,480
Then let me try.

838
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,360
You?

839
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,510
We've traveled south and west together.

840
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:55,110
I've witnessed the way you and Wuming

841
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:56,480
solve those mysterious cases

842
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,110
and learned

843
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,320
a thing or two.

844
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:01,090
Please give me a chance, Official Lu.

845
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,030
A scholar.

846
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,150
Very well.

847
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,070
Just follow him from a distance

848
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,520
and note where he goes.

849
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,070
You must be extremely careful

850
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,870
and return to Sushan Shop

851
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,920
before 7 pm.

852
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,760
[Yongzhou Prefecture]

853
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:53,880
[Dayu Fish Market]

854
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,480
The fish today is huge.

855
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,550
We can prepare it in two ways.

856
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,280
The middle part can be eaten raw.

857
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,320
The head can be used for soup.

858
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,110
It's so fresh,

859
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:02,510
it'll taste good
no matter how it's cooked.

860
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:05,440
Pick a big one for me.

861
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,070
How about this one?

862
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,150
Yes, this one.

863
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,160
This one is good.

864
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,590
Alright, I'll take this one.

865
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,590
Watch carefully.

866
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:16,800
Higher, higher.

867
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,280
Bang.

868
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,800
Watch the stall.

869
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,200
Got it!

870
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,270
Do you have any fatter ones?

871
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,770
Come take a look.

872
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,540
Come, sir, have a look.

873
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,590
Miss, what kind of fish would you like?

874
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:31,390
Our fish market has everything.

875
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,280
This won't do.

876
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,070
-Really?
-Let’s go there.

877
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,150
Chang'an is surrounded by 8 rivers,

878
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,190
Wei, Jing, Feng, Yu, Lao,
Hao, Chan, and Ba.

879
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,710
I want one fish from each river.

880
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,370
Sure thing!

881
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,800
Wait a moment.

882
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,690
You really have them?

883
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:41,690
I was just joking.

884
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:43,840
These fish look very fresh.

885
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,710
Give me two silver carp
from the Jing River.

886
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,310
All right.

887
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,210
Didn't I tell you

888
00:37:49,550 --> 00:37:51,560
not to find me unless it's important?

889
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:51,670
With your identity,

890
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,400
[Owner of Dayu Fish Market, Yu Matong]

891
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,060
appearing in places like this

892
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,770
will raise suspicions.

893
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,420
Of course it's important.

894
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,800
Your people

895
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,190
didn't kill Lu Lingfeng

896
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:01,320
at the Ghost Market.

897
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,540
You can't blame us.

898
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,360
You only said that

899
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,710
someone would investigate
the Ghost Market Intel Stall,

900
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,670
but you didn't tell me

901
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,370
it would be him.

902
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:24,830
What should we do now?

903
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,590
You've failed.

904
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,070
Lu Lingfeng will follow the clues

905
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,440
and trace them back to me.

906
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,370
What should I do?

907
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,760
I've just been appointed
as the Magistrate of Yongzhou Prefecture.

908
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,360
My career is just taking off.

909
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,860
You're going to ruin me.

910
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,550
What? Having regrets now?

911
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,150
You and I are riding a mad horse.

912
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,190
We must gallop all the way to the end.

913
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,160
If you try to get off midway,

914
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:51,510
you'll be smashed to a pulp.

915
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,610
Are you threatening me?

916
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,800
What I'm more concerned about now

917
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:01,280
is whether anyone followed you.

918
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,400
Who are you?

919
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,270
You're following me.

920
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:30,510
Your Majesty.

921
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,360
This polo ball is not only
made of fine materials,

922
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,190
but also scented with fragrance.

923
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,190
I wonder if you...

924
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,240
Scented with fragrance?

925
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,680
There's nothing innovative
about this polo ball.

926
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,670
The newly established Polo Tribute Office

927
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,480
isn't placed under
the Court of the Imperial Study

928
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,840
or any other county office,

929
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,170
but under the Court of State Ceremonials.

930
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,230
Do you know why?

931
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,500
It's because Your Majesty trusts us.

932
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,760
It's because although
polo balls are small,

933
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,710
the international polo tournament

934
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:03,400
brings together envoys from all countries.

935
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,730
Therefore, for the finals, I want to see

936
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,030
a carefully designed and crafted polo ball

937
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,710
that can represent

938
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,640
the prosperity of our Tang Empire.

939
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:13,960
An imperial polo ball...

940
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,890
I understand now, Your Majesty.

941
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,330
We still have a few days.

942
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,310
I will certainly supervise
the Tribute Office

943
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,710
and do our utmost

944
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,680
to create a polo ball

945
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,960
that meets Your Majesty's wishes.

946
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,420
Then I'll trouble you with this task.

947
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,320
How can a polo ball

948
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,840
represent prosperity?

949
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:39,480
I simply cannot understand it.

950
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,280
[Director of Tribute Office, You Tiancai]

951
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,670
In my opinion,

952
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,630
His Majesty is deliberately
making things difficult for you.

953
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,880
Why would he make things difficult for me?

954
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,760
You should ask
Chief Minister Pei about that.

955
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:53,480
Xiong Qiannian.

956
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,120
What gossip are you spreading now?

957
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,490
Chief Minister Pei.

958
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,260
I think

959
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,110
Director You's polo ball

960
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,750
is quite well-made already.

961
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:03,840
Besides,

962
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,630
how can a mere polo ball

963
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,960
represent a prosperous era?

964
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,540
His Majesty just clearly pointed out that

965
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,730
the Tribute Office

966
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,230
is under your Court of State Ceremonials.

967
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,920
Shouldn't you reflect on

968
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,180
how you defied His Majesty the other day?

969
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:21,670
You...

970
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:23,150
I understand now.

971
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,590
His Majesty is giving me a hard time

972
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:27,000
because he's dissatisfied with you,
Chief Minister Pei.

973
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,800
Nonsense!

974
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:29,140
You Tiancai.

975
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,760
I warned you long ago

976
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,620
that this polo tournament

977
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,230
is extremely important.

978
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,330
Days ago, His Majesty requested

979
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,970
that a special polo ball

980
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,750
be made for this tournament.

981
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I asked you to seek out master craftsmen

982
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,200
and design it carefully.

983
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,480
But what did you do?

984
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:46,040
You heard from someone

985
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:48,040
that His Majesty loves fragrance,

986
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,110
and thought that infusing it with incense

987
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,220
would please His Majesty.

988
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,760
And how did that turn out today?

989
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,360
Your clever plan backfired.

990
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:57,830
And you dare blame me?

991
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:58,800
I...

992
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:00,280
As for you,

993
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,410
Xiong Qiannian.

994
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,320
As Yongzhou's Chief Administrator,

995
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,800
you have no real skills or knowledge.

996
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,670
That's fine.

997
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,630
But you dared to stir up trouble

998
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,000
and instigate discord

999
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,550
between the emperor
and his officials in the palace.

1000
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,230
What are you trying to achieve?

1001
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:14,360
Chief Minister Pei.

1002
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
I was only joking.

1003
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,310
Why are you

1004
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,000
getting so angry?

1005
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:24,200
I apologize to you.

1006
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,550
I'm sorry.

1007
00:42:26,030 --> 00:42:27,630
Chief Minister Pei.

1008
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,800
I'll go back and fix it right away.

1009
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:30,880
I'll definitely make a polo ball

1010
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:31,710
that will satisfy His Majesty.
