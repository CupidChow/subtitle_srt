[Episode 21]

3
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,600
I admit it.

4
00:01:41,789 --> 00:01:43,390
That Perfect Purple is mine.

5
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:44,789
Two months ago,

6
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,130
in the herb garden
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine…

7
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,950
You don't need to buy

8
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,280
these herbs elsewhere.

9
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:52,479
I'll have an herbalist prepare them

10
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,280
for you later.

11
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,479
That's too much trouble.

12
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:56,479
Don't mention it.

13
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,840
We were classmates after all.

14
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,240
This is the least I can do.

15
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,680
Mr. Yan!

16
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:02,920
Mr. Yan!

17
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:03,730
Bad news.

18
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,350
That…

19
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,680
That snake got loose!

20
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:06,400
Snake?

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,490
Which snake?

22
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,520
The purple one

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,360
sent by the Palace Secretariat.

24
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,010
I remember now.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,870
It's quite scary.

26
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,440
Let it be.

27
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,360
It ran off on its own.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,160
Not our fault.

29
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,030
Just make a record

30
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,360
to avoid trouble later.

31
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,060
Yes, got it.

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,430
The moment I heard "a purple snake,"

33
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,250
I knew it was a Perfect Purple.

34
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,140
The herb garden borders the Qu River.

35
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,280
I figured that snake

36
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,480
must've slipped out of the herb garden.

37
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,750
So at night,

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,910
I took mugwort and smoked it out.

39
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,520
It took me

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,030
three or four nights,

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,710
and I finally smoked it out.

42
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,430
However,

43
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,870
its tongue was still red,

44
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,079
meaning it wasn't 60 years old yet.

45
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:43,940
I couldn't take its gallbladder.

46
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,750
So I thought,

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,190
before I could get

48
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,840
its extremely precious gallbladder,

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,120
I'd have to raise it

50
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,240
for a very long time.

51
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,000
I never expected

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,060
that a few days ago,

53
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,430
it actually changed.

54
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,890
Its tongue turned purple.

55
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,200
A pharmacy owner heard about it

56
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,880
and offered 30,000 coins for it.

57
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,310
I just haven't delivered it yet.

58
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,420
It's the Kangzai Pharmacy
in the West Market?

59
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,630
How do you know that?

60
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,250
Nothing stays secret

61
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,950
unless you never do it.

62
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,150
Official Lu already looked into it

63
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,470
and drew a portrait

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,950
of you dressed as a woodcutter.

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,760
Where's Yan Junxian?

66
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,150
Mr. Yan went to Mount Zhongnan for herbs.

67
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,400
He said he'd stay there for a few days.

68
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,329
Mount Zhongnan?

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,079
Are the herbs here not enough?

70
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:40,400
We find it strange too,

71
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,370
but that's what he told us.

72
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,590
Who went with him?

73
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,800
His servant Ming Shi was
driving the carriage.

74
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,430
There should have been no one else.

75
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,120
What do you mean, "should have"?

76
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,360
Mr. Yan was inside the carriage

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,150
and didn't say a word.

78
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,470
And it was Ming Shi

79
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,140
who told us about the trip.

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,400
I'll go after them right now.

81
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,800
But…

82
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,680
we don't know
which gate they left through.

83
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,740
If they were going to Mount Zhongnan,

84
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,130
they should've taken…

85
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,590
No.

86
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
The trip is probably just an excuse.

87
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,350
What should we do now?

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,540
I can sketch Ming Shi's portrait.

89
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,000
Do it fast.

90
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,560
If I'm right,

91
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,350
you hid the snake in the wardrobe first,

92
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,240
deliberately got the senior clerk drunk,

93
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,730
and then rushed back home,

94
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,750
planning

95
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,950
to use the snake on Yan Junxian, right?

96
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,950
Yes.

97
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,390
Hongyao

98
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,000
was once abandoned by Yan Junxian.

99
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,360
And she tried
to kill herself because of him.

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,220
Even though she married me later,

101
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,320
once Yan Junxian

102
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,770
came back to Chang'an,

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,400
he started seducing her.

104
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,060
How could I tolerate that?

105
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,600
Then how did you know

106
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,090
Yan Junxian would
go to your house that night?

107
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,430
I'm observant.

108
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,310
Hongyao and I

109
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,950
have been married for 7 years after all.

110
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,500
When she was cheating on me,

111
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,680
I'd notice.

112
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,000
I just didn't expect

113
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,270
that the one hiding
in the wardrobe that day

114
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:08,330
would be Zhang San.

115
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,210
Since things have come to this,

116
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,390
you should tell me everything you know

117
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,950
without holding anything back.

118
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,290
I've told you everything.

119
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,190
Then…

120
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,040
then where did I slip up

121
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,380
that led you to investigate
the Perfect Purple?

122
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,000
Your strange tales

123
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,680
are quite well written.

124
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,430
You didn't only record

125
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,290
the origin of the Perfect Purple

126
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,570
but also described

127
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,640
how it strangled people to death.

128
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,560
Of course, in your writing,

129
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,480
the Perfect Purple becomes

130
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,070
a beautiful woman dressed in purple.

131
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,270
So you read

132
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:00,360
my strange tales.

133
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,820
Thanks for liking my writing.

134
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,810
Then did you also notice

135
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:07,600
that in my book,

136
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,830
I also wrote about

137
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
an extremely wicked servant?

138
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,020
I mean that so-called servant

139
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,160
named Ming Shi, who's always

140
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,290
around Yan Junxian.

141
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,040
He's the truly vicious one.

142
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,950
I just don't know

143
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,080
whether Official Lu

144
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,270
can still find Hongyao.

145
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,200
If he's too late,

146

Hongyao

147
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,160
will die by Ming Shi's hand.

148
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,180
If my instincts are right,

149
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,950
you're still hiding something.

150
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,480
What exactly are you hiding?

151
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,650

00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,950
He provoked Lu Lingfeng and Su Wuming.

193
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,750
Those two

194
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,200
are hard to deal with.

195
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,549
Given time,

196
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,750
my manipulation of Moorhen
from behind the scenes

197
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,409
would eventually be exposed.

198
00:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,080
Then I'd suffer a huge loss.

199
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,440
Rather than living in anxiety,

200
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,390
taking risks,

201
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,280
and waiting for some

202
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,770
uncertain future that may never work out,

203
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,220
it's obviously better

204
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:51,250
to go home with my pretty girl

205
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,080
and be a rich, happy merchant.

206
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,150
It's just that nowadays,

207
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,070
people look down on merchants

208
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,240
from the bottom of their hearts.

209
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,520
But I believe

210
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,720
one day

211
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,200
people will look up to them.

212
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,670
Last night,

213
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,630
you said you'd tell me

214
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
who you used to be.

215
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,910
You want to hear it?

216
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,840
Of course I do.

217
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,650
I've been dying to know.

218
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,120
Ever heard of the top assassin
in the martial world,

219
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,220
the one called Beacon Fire?

220
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,150
That was you?

221
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,510
I was born into a merchant family,

222
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,910
but I loved martial arts.

223
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,910
So I trained under a master and completed

224
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,440
my training after 12 years.

225
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,550
Back then,

226
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,480
the biggest assassin organization

227
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,510
was Blood Drop.

228
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,870
I'd been in it for less than three years

229
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,800
and became famous across the land.

230
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:51,760
So you really were Beacon Fire.

231
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
I heard that name

232
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
when I was little.

233
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,440
Over those ten years,

234
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,020
I killed too many people to count.

235
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,320
But the killing became too much,

236
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,870
and I grew tired of it.

237
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,930
So I took my fortune

238
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:07,670
and returned home.

239
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,390
But when I returned to Lingnan,

240
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,990
I found my family in decline.

241
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,740
So I took over the business.

242
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,730
In five years, I rebuilt our wealth,

243
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,150
becoming one of the richest around.

244
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,390
But

245
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,840
being a merchant

246
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,040
was never my true ambition.

247
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,520
What I really wanted

248
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,470
was to earn an official rank.

249
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,390
I was excellent at studying

250
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,910
with a photographic memory.

251
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,360
But I was registered as a merchant,

252
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,420
and the exam vetting was very strict.

253
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,430
There was no way to slip through.

254
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,440
So,

255
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,630
I came up with

256
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,970
a brilliant plan

257
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,270
and began to groom Moorhen.

258
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,150
Master,

259
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,730
you mean you want me

260
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,520
to take the exams for you?

261
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,180
You are my servant,

262
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,230
but you're not a slave

263
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,010
or from a merchant family.

264
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,540
So from today on,

265
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,910
you'll focus only on studying

266
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,190
and follow all my instructions.

267
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,080
Master,

268
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,440
do you truly trust me that much?

269
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,510
I've watched you quietly

270
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,800
for a long time.

271
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,710
Study with undivided attention

272
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,510
and try to become

273
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,080
a Metropolitan Graduate in three years.

274
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,600
But you can't be called Moorhen anymore.

275
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,720
From now on,

276
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,560
you'll take the surname Yan.

277
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,480
I'll give you a name too.

278
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,270
Yan Junxian.

279
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:37,320
Moorhen

280
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,190
truly has a talent for studying.

281
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,600
A cowherd

282
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,760
passed the exams in three years.

283
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,830
This shows

284
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,630
we southerners,
especially those from Lingnan,

285
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:48,720
are no worse
than those from the Central Plains.

286
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,740
We absolutely

287
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
don't lack the talent for studying.

288
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,550
Why didn't he

289
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,430
prepare more mint leaves for me?

290
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,650
Useless!

291
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:03,920
Lingnan is so far away.

292
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,290
How long will it take

293
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,030
to reach your home?

294
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,260
With you beside me,

295
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:12,110
why worry about the long journey ahead?

296
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,270
But on this journey,

297
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,870
we aren't alone.

298
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,930
It ruins the mood, doesn't it?

299
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:19,910
Don't tell me

300
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,180
you'll still need

301
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,080
this former official

302
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,680
by your side back in Lingnan.

303
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,270
Not at all.

304
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,210
I have plenty of servants.

305
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,910
I didn't leave him in Chang'an

306
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,970
because someone might find his body.

307
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,790
Then we wouldn't be able to travel freely.

308
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,200
So now…

309
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,790
Stop for a moment.

310
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,510
Let's leave him

311
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,000
right here.

312
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,620
Ming, are you thirsty?

313
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,440
Yeah.

314
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,040
If only I had some mint leaves

315
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,710
to chew.

316
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,790
I just saw some wild mint

317
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,630
over there.

318
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,270
I'll go pick some for you.

319
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,550
Ming.

320
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,080
Look.

321
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,680
I picked this for you.

322
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:35,670
This…

323
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,970
Where did you get it?

324
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,650
I didn't see any mint.

325
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,810
That's why I've got good eyes.

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,660
I fell for you at first glance.

327
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,730
No wonder Moorhen was

328
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,650
so infatuated with you back then.

329
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,670
You are

330
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,670
a born temptress.

331
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,490
"Life feels like a dream."

332
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,190
That phrase

333
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,000
is exactly how I feel right now.

334
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,070
Business first.

335
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,760
He seems to have something to say.

336
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,660
Master.

337
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,900
Master, spare me.

338
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,150
I'll go back to Lingnan

339
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,810
and keep serving you, Master.

340
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,630
Gorgeous,

341
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,480
what do you think?

342
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,960
It's between you

343
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:00,010
and your servant.

344
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,510
I won't interfere.

345
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,530
Hongyao,

346
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,180
plead for me, please!

347
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,630
Everything I've done to get here—

348
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,160
it was all for you, Hongyao!

349
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,110
You're totally delusional!

350
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,170
You were nothing more than a fling to her!

351
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,190
Seven years ago,

352
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,890
the one she fell for at first sight

353
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:21,600
was me.

354
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,750
Impossible.

355
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,870
Back then, I was the master,
and you were the servant.

356
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,720
How could she ever…

357
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,450
Yan Junxian!

358
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,200
Ming was just praising you

359
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,130
for being smart,

360
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,050
yet now you're being so stupid.

361
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,080
If I were Ming,

362
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,730
I'd bury you alive!

363
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,870
Exactly.

364
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,590
If I weren't burying him,

365
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,270
why would I have dug such a big pit?

366
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,490
Master,

367
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,720
don't bury me!

368
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,480
Master, please! Don't!

369
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:58,370
Hongyao,

370
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,630
plead for me!

371
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:00,150
Hongyao!

372
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,650
Master,

373
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,910
for all the years

374
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,900
I've served you,

375
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,300
spare me, please!

376
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,510
I was wrong, Master.

377
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,960
Maybe…

378
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,000
you should spare him?

379
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,460
Master.

380
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,590
It's too late for that.

381
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,120
After all this,

382
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,840
if I keep him by my side,

383
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,200
what if he finds a chance

384
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,790
to poison the mint leaves

385
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,160
that I eat every day?

386
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,360
Wouldn't I

387
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,600
die an ugly death?

388
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,320
Moorhen,

389
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,690
you didn't even have a surname.

390
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,080
I gave you the name

391
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,510
Yan Junxian.

392
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,000
But you didn't behave

393
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,910
and even tried to kill me.

394
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,600
Once I'm back in Lingnan,

395
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,940
I'll build you

396
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,570
a proper cenotaph.

397
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,750
After all, back in the county,

398
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,480
you let me be the real county sheriff

399
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,820
behind the scenes.

400
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,730
I thoroughly enjoyed it.

401
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,960
Oh right,

402
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,410
on the cenotaph,

403
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,390
I'll carve the name

404
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,700
Yan Moorhen.

405
00:16:59,080 --> 00:16:59,870
How's that?

406
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,560
Isn't that a homophone for a dish?

407
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,839
What a pity.

408
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,589
He didn't live up to expectations

409
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,880
and ended up as a dish.

410
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,640
Master!

411
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,589
Don't bury me, Master!

412
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,640
Hongyao!

413
00:17:23,109 --> 00:17:25,030
Beg him for me, please!

414
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,310
Master!

415
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,230
Please spare me, Master!

416
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,980
I'm begging you!

417
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,400
Why do you keep staring at me?

418
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,890
Do you want me

419
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:34,360
to stare at this dying man instead?

420
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,240
You said

421
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:39,990
you're from Youzhou?

422
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:40,590
Yes.

423
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:41,870
Northern Youzhou.

424
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,180
Have you been there, Ming?

425
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,240
I went there once

426
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,310
many years ago.

427
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,590
Hongyao—

428
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,830
your name rings a bell.

429
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,260
Hong means red flowers.

430
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:54,480
Yao means peonies.

431
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,440
No.

432
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:00,250
Hong means crimson blood.

433
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,680
Yao means fatal.

434
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,590
You're really funny.

435
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,090
That look in your eyes—

436
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,200
I've seen it before.

437
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,990
19 years ago,

438
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,550
at that time,

439
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,750
I was seven.

440
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,110
[Hongyao's Old Home in Youzhou]

441
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,640
I bear you no grudge.

442
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,890
Why kill me?

443
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,960
I'm an assassin.

444
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,070
I kill for whoever pays.

445
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,770
The one who hired you

446
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,050
is definitely a Yan.

447
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,880
I only have one enemy.

448
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,490
Back then,

449
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,850
I served as an official in Gaotang.

450
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,710
That Yan scoundrel was my superior.

451
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,450
That year, the river flooded,

452
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:19,030
and people were starving to death.

453
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,510
That scoundrel embezzled

454
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,720
the relief funds
and supplies from the court.

455
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,120
I couldn't stand seeing civilians starve,

456
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,910
so I reported him.

457
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:28,970
I just take the money and kill.

458
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,520
I don't ask why.

459
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,350
Save your breath.

460
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,830
Do you dare leave your name?

461
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,400
Assassins don't leave names.

462
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,310
But my title

463
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,440
is known throughout the martial world—

464
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,750
Beacon Fire.

465
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,030
The top assassin in the martial world.

466
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,910
After you die, you can haunt me.

467
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:50,850
But I'm not afraid.

468
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,320
Because I kill ghosts too.

469
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:57,480
Sir,

470
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:01,640
please don't kill my father!

471
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,530
Hongyao,

472
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,400
stay back!

473
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,340
Run!

474
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,550
No need.

475
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,200
The employer didn't pay me to kill you.

476
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,350
Father!

477
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:22,790
Father!

478
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,030
Father!

479
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:32,690
Beacon Fire.

480
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,390
Someday I'll kill you

481
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:43,130
to avenge my father!

482
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,410
You're Hongyao.

483
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,880
You're that Hongyao.

484
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,450
The Hongyao
from that snowy night in Youzhou.

485
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,550
Back then,

486
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,330
I was just an insignificant little girl.

487
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,720
You, the top assassin,

488
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:11,200
truly didn't remember my name.

489
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
S-So you're my enemy.

490
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,790
So you…

491
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,480
you schemed so hard

492
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:28,830
to be with him,

493
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,400
to marry Meng Buyi—

494
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,510
everything you did

495
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,680
was just to get close to me

496
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,830
and take revenge?

497
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,980
I know no martial arts.

498
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,400
This was the only way.

499
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,000
Then why confess now?

500
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:45,890
Don't tell me

501
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:48,890
you want to die together with him!

502
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,120
The one who will die is you!

503
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,070
Well?

504
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,060
My acting was convincing, wasn't it?

505
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,960
I gave Hongyao

506
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,750
the deadliest poison in the world!

507
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,960
I just saw some wild mint

508
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:11,640
over there.

509
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:13,150
I'll go pick some for you.

510
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,480
Business first.

511
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,240
You're always too suspicious.

512
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,150
Even the mint leaves I washed for you—

513
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,000
you would

514
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,490
wash them again yourself.

515
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,610
If not for this,

516
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,740
we'd never have gotten
the chance to kill you.

517
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:02,960
Hongyao,

518
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,340
I've been so good to you…

519
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,230
Hongyao, now, get me out.

520
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:32,380
You want to poison me?

521
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,140
Then both of you

522
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,510
have to die with me!

523
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,240
Hand…

524
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,110
His hand! Deal with it!

525
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,080
You bastard!

526
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,360
You've been lording over me for years.

527
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,150
Now I finally get to bury you.

528
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,640
Hongyao,

529
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,360
how should you thank me?

530
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,060
That day at my house,

531
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,220
if you hadn't confessed early,

532
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,850
the one who died
wouldn't have been Zhang San.

533
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:53,050
It would've been you.

534
00:26:53,430 --> 00:26:54,070
Hongyao,

535
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,050
let's leave Chang'an.

536
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,920
I'll go back to your hometown with you.

537
00:26:58,920 --> 00:26:59,850
Youzhou, right?

538
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,400
I don't care
if it's a cold and tough place.

539
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,930
You're giving up your post?

540
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,640
Yes.

541
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,010
It was never my post anyway.

542
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,360
What do you mean by that?

543
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,020
Do you remember

544
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,310
that servant of mine,

545
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,030
Ming Shi?

546
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:21,720
All these years,

547
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,540
I've been his puppet,

548
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:25,220
his marionette,

549
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,810
controlled by him at every moment.

550
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:30,550
Rather than serving as an official,

551
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,750
I've been suffering.

552
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,690
My life has been worse than death.

553
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,300
Isn't Meng Buyi on night duty?

554
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:46,980
Get in here.

555
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,660
Hurry, get in.

556
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,250
It doesn't matter anymore.

557
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,030
It's all over.

558
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,490
I'm going back to Chang'an

559
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,110
to resume being
the deputy chief imperial physician.

560
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:05,490
That light red robe

561
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:08,160
will become crimson

562
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,400
and then become purple.

563
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,720
I, Moorhen,

564
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,310
will one day become

565
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,280
the Chancellor of the Tang Empire!

566
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,020
I'll be a man of high status
who's controlled

567
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,640
by no one

568
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,230
and bows to no one!

569
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,110
Back in that tiny county,

570
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,760
I was only an eighth-rank county sheriff.

571
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
But in the unseen,

572
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,470
the door of fate

573
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,480
has always been waiting for me,

574
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,770
waiting for me to open it bit by bit.

575
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,720
That feeling

576
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:39,750
is intoxicating.

577
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,830
What about me?

578
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,310
Why did you

579
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,770
marry Meng Buyi back then?

580
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:47,590
If I hadn't married him,

581
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:48,880
how would I have waited for your return?

582
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,720
If you hadn't married him,

583
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
when I came to Chang'an this time,

584
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,310
I would've taken you

585
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,770
out of Pingkang District!

586
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,970
A perfect couple

587
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,400
being together again—
how wonderful!

588
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,100
What is the use of saying that now?

589
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,650
I'm asking you—

590
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,080
how will you treat me now?

591
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,880
All I can say is I'm sorry,

592
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:31,440
Hongyao.

593
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,030
You must die here.

594
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,310
Otherwise, sooner or later,

595
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,770
you'll expose everything I've done.

596
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:38,230
That would ruin my career,

597
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,060
my future,

598
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,440
and my chance to bring honor to my family!

599
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,650
You're going to kill me?

600
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,110
Of course I won't admit it.

601
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,040
This is Ming Shi's sword. No.

602
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:50,550
It's the sword of the top assassin,

603
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:51,920
Beacon Fire.

604
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,540
You poisoned him.

605
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,620
He killed you with one stroke.

606
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,200
The two of you would be
buried together here.

607
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,260
Perfect, isn't it?

608
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,610
You're so evil.

609
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,790
How are you any different from Ming Shi?

610
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,920
I can endure better than he ever could!

611
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,270
I was born low.

612
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,070
If I hadn't endured,

613
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,470
I wouldn't be here today.

614
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:14,750
Hongyao,

615
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,160
you think I'd give up

616
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,650
my promising future just for you?

617
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,370
Truth is, with you,

618
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,930
I was merely playing along.

619
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:23,880
Back then,

620
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,110
if I hadn't pretended
to be intimate with you,

621
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,030
he would've already

622
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,490
seen through my ambition.

623
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,310
Then how would I

624
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,710
have survived until now?

625
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,140
How would I have waited for him

626
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,960
to pay my way up the ladder?

627
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,950
I refuse to accept this!

628
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,880
I… I don't want to die.

629
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:43,900
It's too late.

630
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,880
Everything's far too late.

631
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,270
I don't want this either,

632
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,030
but…

633
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:50,790
Don't…

634
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,920
I have no choice!

635
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,030
If he were a trained fighter,

636
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,240
even if he couldn't dodge,

637
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,750
he'd still flinch a little,

638
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,440
so it wouldn't have hit so precisely.

639
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,030
My bad.

640
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,270
I forgot he couldn't fight at all.

641
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:21,260
The best secret agent in Chang'an

642
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,590
is none other than Madam Yingtao.

643
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,030
Me?

644
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,360
Remember—

645
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:28,100
follow him all the way

646
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,270
until the crucial moment

647
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,190
before revealing yourself.

648
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,450
[Imperial Academy of Medicine]

649
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,560
May I know your name?

650
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:58,960
I once shared your fate,

651
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,830
but now I have a different identity.

652
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:03,690
I must take you back
to Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

653
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,400
Yan Junxian?

654
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,960
What's going on?

655
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,630
Official Lu,

656
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,790
I was ordered by Su Wuming

657
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,920
to follow Meng Buyi.

658
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,840
Then I found Yan Junxian

659
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,940
quite suspicious.

660
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,220
So I followed him next.

661
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,550
Then I found his servant Ming Shi

662
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,780
abducted Meng Buyi's wife, Hongyao.

663
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,640
Where is Ming Shi?

664
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,330
In the pit.

665
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,680
Yan Junxian poisoned him

666
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,070
and stabbed him to death.

667
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,960
We can dig him up
and take him back for an autopsy.

668
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,550
Ming Shi had another identity.

669
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:47,160
He was known as

670
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,350
the top assassin,

671
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,350
Beacon Fire.

672
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:51,750
And this guy…

673
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,410
Yan Junxian was vicious.

674
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,160
After burying Ming Shi,

675
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,470
he tried to kill Hongyao to silence her.

676
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,110
Following Su Wuming's instructions,

677
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:00,110
I didn't show myself

678
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,310
until the final critical moment.

679
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,310
But when he was about to kill

680
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,680
an unarmed woman,

681
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,960
I had no choice but to intervene.

682
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,930
Unfortunately,

683
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,200
my sleeve arrow was too accurate

684
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,440
and killed him on the spot.

685
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,790
But I've been there for quite a while.

686
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,920
Through Yan Junxian

687
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,000
and Ming Shi's conversation,

688
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,720
it's clear that the master and servant,

689
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,550
or rather the servant and master,

690
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,640
were both wicked men.

691
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,510
Especially Ming Shi,

692
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:21,270
who killed countless people
and committed hideous crimes.

693
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:22,000
Hongyao

694
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,940
is an innocent victim.

695
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,830
Escort her back
to Yongzhou Prefecture Office first.

696
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,790
We'll question her
before making a final judgment.

697
00:33:30,790 --> 00:33:31,200
Yes.

698
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,930
Secretary Meng.

699
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,240
Secretary Meng.

700
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,090
I saw your wife.

701
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:38,830
Where?

702
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,240
She was being escorted by two people

703
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,770
heading toward Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

704
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,350
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

705
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:48,070
I kept vigil for my father for three years

706
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:49,480
and studied the pipa for three years.

707
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,640
At 13, I wandered the martial world,

708
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,440
searching for news of Beacon Fire.

709
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,000
Later, I learned

710
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,460
that he served Blood Drop,

711
00:33:58,790 --> 00:33:59,350
a notorious

712
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:00,920
assassin organization

713
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,320
hidden right inside Chang'an.

714
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,720
So I came here.

715
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,640
To make a living,

716
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,080
I had to work in Pingkang District.

717
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,960
Then I heard

718
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
Beacon Fire had long
left the martial world

719
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,590
and was no longer an assassin.

720
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,400
I thought

721
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:21,510
I'd never have a chance for revenge.

722
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:24,230
Until…

723
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,850
Meng, let's go check it out.

724
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,550
Come on.

725
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,400
I'm going with you.

726
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:40,840
Come on.

727
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,639
I'm not going.

728
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,920
At that time, I couldn't be sure

729
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
it was really him.

730
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,630
After all, he had been an assassin,

731
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,090
and I was seeing a servant.

732
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,320
So,

733
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,590
I began

734
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,630
looking for every possible chance.

735
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,690
To uncover Ming Shi's true identity,

736
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,520
you got close to Yan Junxian?

737
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,280
Exactly.

738
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:09,530
Ming Shi was extremely cautious.

739
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,320
After months,

740
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,070
I still couldn't get near him.

741
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,960
Yan Junxian was tight-lipped too.

742
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,070
Even drunk,

743
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,550
he wouldn't reveal

744
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,880
who Ming Shi really was.

745
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,860
Maybe he didn't know at all

746
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,170
that his servant, or rather

747
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:28,110
his master, used to be an assassin.

748
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,280
Later,

749
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,520
Yan Junxian left without saying goodbye.

750
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,610
I fell into despair.

751
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,100
Thinking I could never avenge my father…

752
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,800
I wanted to end my life.

753
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,360
Father.

754
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,230
I failed to avenge you.

755
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,440
I'm too ashamed to live in this world.

756
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,370
Hongyao!

757
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,400
Don't do it.

758
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,110
Don't do it.

759
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:15,840
I think

760
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:18,250
maybe it was divine guidance.

761
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,490
They were classmates.

762
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,910
So if I married Meng Buyi,

763
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,390
then one day,

764
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,440
when Yan Junxian returned to Chang'an,

765
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,770
I'd get another chance.

766
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,100
And indeed,

767
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,460
seven years later,

768
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,800
they returned.

769
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,880
Why stop?

770
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,040
Continue your statement.

771
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,440
There's nothing more to say.

772
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,070
You already know

773
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,070
everything after that.

774
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,820
While Meng Buyi was on night duty,

775
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,110
you invited Yan Junxian to your home,

776
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:54,350
intending to kill him

777
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,250
and draw out Ming Shi, right?

778
00:36:58,960 --> 00:36:59,760
You admit it?

779
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,670
Then Meng Buyi

780
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,090
must be your accomplice

781
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:03,710
because that

782
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:05,000
deadly Perfect Purple

783
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,360
was hidden in the cabinet by him.

784
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,630
I know nothing about the Perfect Purple.

785
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:10,400
Meng Buyi doesn't know

786
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,330
what I have done.

787
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,670
Everything I said earlier

788
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,110
was planned solely by me.

789
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,440
So Zhang San

790
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,480
was part of your scheme too?

791
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,630
Yes.

792
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,650
I had grudges against him,

793
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,730
so I killed him too.

794
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:27,510
I plead guilty.

795
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,700
I've taken my revenge.

796
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,720
I can die without regret.

797
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,960
Who's beating the drum?

798
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,290
Captain Xue, go check.

799
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,710
Yes.

800
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,380
Meng Buyi!

801
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,230
Why are you beating the drum?

802
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:46,840
Arrest me.

803
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,590
I'm the murderer.

804
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:52,050
The drum beater Meng Buyi is here.

805
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:08,590
Meng Buyi.

806
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,280
In less than 24 hours,

807
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,800
you've already struck

808
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,110
the grievance drum three times.

809
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,710
This time,

810
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,060
what's the reason?

811
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,040
I've come to turn myself in.

812
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,710
I, Meng Buyi,
Secretary of the Ministry of Revenue,

813
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,240
killed the bully Zhang San.

814
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,620
I'm turning myself in.

815
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,510
You killed Zhang San?

816
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:28,110
Yes.

817
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,650
I killed Zhang San.

818
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Recently, I've often been in a daze.

819
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:33,280
I'm not sure

820
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,320
if it's because I write strange tales

821
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,220
or because

822
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,040
I suffer from insomnia and nightmares.

823
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:38,850
I suspected

824
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:42,360
that Hongyao and Yan Junxian

825
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,770
were having an affair!

826
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,250
That night on duty,

827
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,970
my eyelids kept twitching.

828
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:48,490
Something felt wrong,

829
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,550
so I went back home.

830
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,840
I didn't catch them in the act,

831
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,550
but I found a pair of men's boots

832
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,130
hidden under my bed.

833
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:57,710
Out of pride,

834
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,400
I didn't expose her on the spot.

835
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,030
After I left with my scrolls,

836
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,660
I became angrier and angrier.

837
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,480
So

838
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,070
I went back again.

839
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,030
What I didn't expect

840
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:23,000
was that the adulterer was Zhang San,
the mutton-soup seller.

841
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,960
In a rage,

842
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,440
I grabbed the scissors.

843
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,710
I'm a Metropolitan Graduate

844
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:39,440
and serve in the Ministry of Revenue,

845
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,440
yet I killed a man out of resentment.

846
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,710
I deserve to be punished severely!

847
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:45,280
But someone saw

848
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,520
Hongyao committing the murder
with scissors.

849
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,400
Who?

850
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,290
That white-haired little thief, Jiang?

851
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:56,190
That despicable house-squatter?

852
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,320
If his words

853
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:00,240
can count as evidence in court,

854
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
it'd be a disgrace to Yongzhou Prefecture

855
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,230
and to the Tang Empire!

856
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:05,840
Lu Lingfeng,

857
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,860
you've solved many strange cases

858
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,590
and gained quite a reputation.

859
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,150
What?

860
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,310
I'm turning myself in today,

861
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
and you're afraid

862
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,030
I'll steal your thunder?

863
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,410
I plead guilty.

864
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,070
I accept my punishment.

865
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,130
The case should be closed instantly.

866
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,150
It's good

867
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,760
that you pleaded guilty.

868
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,920
But the evidence must be solid,

869
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,710
and every detail

870
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,790
has to line up perfectly.

871
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:35,030
Only then

872
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,070
can Official Lu close the case.

873
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,480
What evidence do you want?

874
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,920
The murder weapon.

875
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,000
Where are those scissors now?

876
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,630
I threw them away.

877
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,840
Where?

878
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:56,070
Into the Qu River.

879
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:58,670
The Qu River is vast.

880
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Where exactly did you throw them away?

881
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,460
How much force did you use?

882
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,150
How far did they fly?

883
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,030
I… I…

884
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:09,930
It was pitch black.

885
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,960
Who could remember that?

886
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,020
In the herb garden
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine,

887
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,530
under a very tall Gastrodia stalk.

888
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,080
I buried them myself.

889
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:19,880
Hongyao!
