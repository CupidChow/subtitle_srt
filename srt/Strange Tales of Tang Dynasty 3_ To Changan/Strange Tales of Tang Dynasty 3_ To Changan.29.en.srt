00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,680
Yingtao, go knock on the door.

5
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,000
Yongzhou Prefecture investigation.

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,400
Get the district head here at once.

7
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:57,870
Yes.

8
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,090
Where should we go next?

9
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
After causing such a stir,

10
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,360
don't tell me you don't know where to go.

11
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,440
I really don't.

12
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,000
You...

13
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:24,290
I am the district head.

14
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
I heard you're
from the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

15
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,360
May I know

16
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,920
who you are, Officer?

17
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,030
I'm the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

18
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,470
Lu Lingfeng.

19
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,230
Let me ask you,

20
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,630
who is the most famous

21
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,960
and wealthiest merchant in your district?

22
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,890
There isn't one.

23
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,470
The Tongji District

24
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,370
is east of Zhuque Avenue,

25
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,530
on the east side of the second street,

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,000
the thirteenth district
from north to south,

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,530
and also the last district.

28
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,850
Just south of here is the city wall,

29
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,150
so it's pretty desolate here.

30
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,750
Why would a wealthy merchant

31
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,540
want to live here?

32
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,800
Really?

33
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,630
Wait, let me think.

34
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,190
In the Tongji District,

35
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:08,630
there are virtually no residences
of high officials

36
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,840
or famous people.

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,030
The only somewhat famous old residence

38
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:15,560
belonged to one of
the Five Leaders of the Shenlong Coup,

39
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,000
Huan Yanfan.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,920
That house

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,980
has changed hands several times.

42
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,030
Recently,

43
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,190
a man named Chen Chong has bought it.

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,800
Right, he seems to be a merchant,

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,000
a boot seller.

46
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
He has a very large business.

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,130

53

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,380
I have disgraced you.

Ancestor,

57
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:15,240
you were the most renowned scholar
of the Later Han,

58
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,560
but in my generation,

59
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,190
I didn't follow tradition
to become an official

60
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,950
and instead went into commerce.

61
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,240
I now have a small reputation in Chang'an

62
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,430
and have been invited
to join the Jinguang Society.

63
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,120
But its members are mixed,

64
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,150
and some often engage in shady dealings.

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
I have never involved myself
in any of them.

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,300

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,110
Based on mere imagination,

88
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,560
you pretended to be me
in the middle of the night

89
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,360
and went to the Tongji District.

90
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,370
When did our mentor ever teach you

91
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,110
to solve cases like that?

92
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Su Wuming didn't mean to impersonate you.

93
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,830
It's just that
he has no official position.

94
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,880
If he hadn't said he was you,

95
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,410
how would the district head
have cooperated?

96
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,480
Making assumptions,
disturbing people at night,

97
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,680
and even alarming the Imperial Guards!

98
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,950
You've not only disgraced
the Yongzhou Prefecture Office

99
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:36,190
but also brought shame
to our mentor, Master Di!

100
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,360
-I...
-How could you say that about him?

101
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,560
Just before we arrived,

102
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,890
Chen Chongzhen was nearly assassinated!

103
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,890
You are so certain of this,

104
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,920
but did you see it with your own eyes?

105
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,480
No!

106
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,120
But I heard it directly from Chen Chong!

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,850
Is that credible?

108
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
What if Chen Chong had an ulterior motive

109
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,430
and fabricated this assassination attempt?

110
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:55,830

My apologies, Miss Chu.

114
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:08,030

with Su Wuming.

00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,620

118
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,430
You've gone too far!

119
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,270
What makes you say that?

120
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,600
Let's not talk about

121
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,750
whether the list
the High Priest, Shi Qiansui,

122
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,430
provided is authentic or not.

123
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,520
Even if it is authentic,

124
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,980
why didn't you consider

[Imperial City]
[Yanfu District] [Yong'an District]

126

[Yanfu District] [Yong'an District]

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,430
This is the character that means "inch."

131
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:03,950
It symbolizes your shortsightedness!

132
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,720
Why didn't you consider

133
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,600
that Yanfu District and Yong'an District

134
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,260
would each have a murder case?

135
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:13,890
[West Market] [East Market]

136
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,280

138
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,310
[Yanfu District] [Yong'an District]

139
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,710
This is the character that means "thirty."

140
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,000
If you just use your brain a little,

141
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,870
you could create many more characters

142
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:28,260
on this map.

143
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,680
But you didn't think about it at all.

144
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,409
You decided that the murderer

145
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,000
intended to write the character

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,510
that means "gentry" in Chang'an.

147
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,710
You're prejudiced against the gentry!

148
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,360
I indeed failed to catch the killer,

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,670
but was my investigative approach

150
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,080
really so bad that it made you

151
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,360
fly into such a rage?

152
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,960
Compared to one's background,

153
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,750
I believe a person's virtues,

154
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,390
aspirations, and talents
are more important.

155
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,910
Some people are born into the gentry,

156
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,480
yet they do not see themselves

157
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,550
as nobler than the commoners;

158
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,360
they only see the suffering
of the common people.

159
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
In that case, he is

160
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,010
nobler than the average gentry.

161
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:16,910
Some people may be
born into common families,

162
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,200
but they care about the nation
and the people.

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,750
They are therefore worthy of respect.

164
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,950
You're praising yourself, aren't you?

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,550
My dear Official Lu,

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,270
the river of time flows ceaselessly.

167
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:38,270
Ever since the former Sui Dynasty

168
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,550
abolished the Nine-Rank Official System,

169
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,360
the era of the gentry

170
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,790
has already passed.

171
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,170
You need to accept this reality.

172
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,320
You're a Metropolitan Graduate,

173
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,630
so naturally you dislike
the Nine-Rank Official System.

174
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,000
Of course, the Nine-Rank Official System

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,060
had its drawbacks.

176
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,120
But if the court

177
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,850
had committed to reforming it,

178
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:56,720
it would still have been

179
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,960
an excellent system for selecting talent.

180
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,240
That's why at the beginning of Tang,

181
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,380
Emperor Gaozu restored this system.

182
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,950
But after Emperor Taizong took the throne,

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,720
didn't he abolish it again?

184
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,230
Therefore,
whether one is born into the gentry

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
is no longer that important.

186
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,320
The gentry are not that important?

187
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:16,830
Let me ask you,

188
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
the texts and classics that represent

189
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,670
the cultural lineage of China—

190
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,670
through whom were they passed down?

191
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,110
I admit that.

192
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,440
Many ancient classics

193
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,910
were passed down to the present day

194
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,640
precisely through the gentry.

195
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,000
Moreover, many gentry families

196
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,370
rose to prominence by annotating classics,

197
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,440
including your Lu family of Fanyang.

198
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,970
It's good that you admit it.

199
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,740
The gentry value refinement.

200
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,880
What is refinement?

201
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,840
It's not about holding high positions

202
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,240
or how much money one has,

203
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,550
but rather

204
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,030
excellent family education and traditions.

205
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,840
In short,

206
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,020
refinement is the love for books.

207
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,040
But Lu Lingfeng, have you considered

208
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,820
whether this, in itself,

209
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,460
is a kind of privilege?

210
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,460
The vast majority of common people

211
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,630
simply do not have the chance
to become literate

212
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:07,960
and read books.

213
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,360
If one day,

214
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,990
in the Tang Empire,

215
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,150
those classics

216
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,670
were available for every commoner to read,

217
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,990
wouldn't it mean

218
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,080
that whoever loves reading is noble?

219
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,570
You're twisting words.

220
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,540
Lu Lingfeng,

221
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,630
you were born into the gentry,

222
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:26,850
but since you traveled south with me,

223
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,210
I have clearly seen

224
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,490
that you care deeply
for the common people.

225
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
I am an orphan who grew up

226
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,510
in the Chongnian Temple in Luoyang.

227
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,190
I have always

228
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,970
cared about the common people.

229
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,740
I am also a gentry member.

230
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,030
I have the duty to defend

231
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,490
the dignity of the gentry.

232
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,320
In today's Chang'an,

233
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,440
there is indeed friction
between the gentry and merchants.

234
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,840
But when a merchant is dead,

235
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,200
you, without any evidence,

236
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,910
point the finger at the gentry.

237
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:05,370
What are your intentions?

238
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,820
I have not locked onto a murderer.

239
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,960
Is it not true that we have no new leads?

240
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,200
I simply connected those districts,

241
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,550
and when I looked at them,

242
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:14,440
they looked like the character "gentry."

243
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:14,960
You…

244
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,880
Look me in the eye.

245
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,200
Do you dare to say

246
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,960
that the killer you're imagining

247
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,220
isn't from the gentry?

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,670
Lu Lingfeng.

249
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,320
Su Wuming.

250
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,360
Come with me.

251
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,910
Yingtao, let go.

252
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,080
Yes, I admit it.

253
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,750
That's exactly what I think.

254
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,350
So you admit to your slander.

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,990
The gentry

256
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,000
should have the world in their hearts.

257
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,120
How could they possibly

258
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,180
kill innocent people as you imagine?

259
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,290
You think
your Metropolitan Graduate status

260
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,870
is more honorable
than a hereditary appointment?

261
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,780
Let me tell you.

262
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,910
Many of today's Metropolitan Graduates

263
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,630
possess only superficial literary talent.

264
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:03,080
They have no real ability
to govern the state.

265
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,080
They only know how to pass the exams,

266
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,720
and their sole purpose of taking exams

267
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,850
is just to gain a salary from the court.

268
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,320
But the gentry have family learning

269
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,870
and are familiar with court protocols.

270
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,900
If the court were to reform

271
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,460
and rebuild the gentry,

272
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,640
removing their old, corrupt flaws

273
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:22,420
and forging a new spirit
for the Tang gentry,

274
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,210
wouldn't that be a good thing?

275
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,000
I previously thought you only aspired

276
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,050
to protect the Tang Empire

277
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,030
and its people.

278
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,440
But to my great surprise,

279
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,550
you, Lu Lingfeng, also have

280
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,750
plans to become the Chancellor.

281
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,930
This has nothing to do
with what position I hold.

282
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,080
I, Lu Lingfeng,

283
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:50,190
am proud
to be from the Lu family of Fanyang.

284
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:51,240
Also,

285
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,080
I care about the common people.

286
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,990
The gentry aren't wrong.

287
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,830
They're wronged by misunderstanding!

288
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,960
Lu Lingfeng is truly unbelievable.

289
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,690
He showed you no respect at all.

290
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,840
Perhaps this time, I truly was wrong.

291
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,270
I mean my approach to the case.

292
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,000
Both he and I

293
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,260
are committed to the ideals in our hearts.

294
00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:28,360
Therefore, a debate is quite normal.

295
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,600
But today,

296
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,720
I've realized that Lu Lingfeng

297
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,460
has great aspirations.

298
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,720
He might truly become

299
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:37,910
the new hope for the gentry.

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,510
I'm genuinely happy for him.

301
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,960
He just lashed out at you,

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,730
and you're still happy for him?

303
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,750
Su Wuming,

304
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,480
are you a fool?

305
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:51,910
I'm a fool?

306
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,670
Then you're an even bigger fool.

307
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,420
You didn't catch up to him?

308
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,880
He ignored me
and just rode off on his horse.

309
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:04,830
Men, you know.

310
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,720
If he wants to be angry, let him be.

311
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,390
Sometimes,

312
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
you don't need to mind them too much.

313
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
Oh no! I left Mr. Fei

314
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,120
at the Ghost Market yesterday.

315
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,390
I wonder if he's come back.

316
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,390
The Ghost Market?

317
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,100
That place is very dangerous.

318
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,910
Mr. Fei.

319
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,020
Master Fei.

320
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,120
Master Fei!

321
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,480
You're back.

322
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,860
Yingtao was so worried about you.

323
00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:33,580
I'm Boss Fei, after all.

324
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,870
If I don’t come back,
who will run the shop?

325
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:36,440
Mr. Fei…

326
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,790
Yingtao, haven't you

327
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,550
had sushan in days?

328
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,490
I'll personally make one for you.

329
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,160
A cherry-flavored one!

330
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,010
If I want one, I can make it myself.

331
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,630
It's not the same.

332
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,730
Master Fei,

333
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,160
I have a favor to ask.

334
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,120
Who are you trying to catch?

335
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,230
It's not catching someone.

336
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,430
It's saving someone.

337
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,380
[Wei Mansion]

338
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm scared.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,080
It's alright, Jia.

340
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,550
I don't want to see strangers.

341
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,790
I don't want to see strangers,
Sister-in-law!

342
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,120
I don't want to see strangers.
I don't want to.

343
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,830
I don't want to see strangers.

344
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,600
Okay, no strangers.

345
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,600
You won't see anyone.

346
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,460
I don't want to.

347
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,340
I don't want to.

348
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,790
Please, have some tea.

349
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,390
What kind of incense do you use here?

350
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,320
Just ordinary sandalwood.

351
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,710
It's not ordinary;
the scent is quite unique.

352
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:45,720
Xijun, I am truly sorry.

353
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,870
My sister…

354
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,510
As you saw just now,

355
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:50,720
she acts like that whenever she hears

356
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,910
she has to see a doctor.

357
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,510
I'm afraid she may have a sudden episode

358
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,040
and hurt the old gentleman.

359
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,420
That won't happen.

360
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,620
Sir, you must not be careless.

361
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:04,170
After all, during the examination,

362
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,050
you'll be too close to her.

363
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,400
Some illnesses

364
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,230
require close examination,

365
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,270
but your sister does not.

366
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,160
I got a grasp

367
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,790
of her situation just now.

368
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,130
How about this?

369
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,069
I'll write a prescription.

370
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,440
After you give her the medicine,

371
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,240
she will soon fall into a deep sleep.

372
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:28,960
While she is asleep,

373
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,270
I'll perform acupuncture on her.

374
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,750
She'll get better within five days.

375
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,350
As for a full recovery,

376
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,670
that will take 49 days.

377
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,310
My sister has been ill for many days.

378
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,590
We've consulted
all famous doctors in Chang'an,

379
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:46,190
but none had a good solution.

380
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:50,120
You believe there is still
a chance for her to fully recover?

381
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,460
Of course.

382
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,750
Otherwise, I would not

383
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:53,590
have said so.

384
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,960
After all, a famous doctor
is not necessarily a miracle doctor.

385
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,810
And a miracle doctor like me,

386
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
though nameless...

387
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,750
Juniang,

388
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,770
Master Fei's medical skills are superb.

389
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,030
He has saved countless people.

390
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,110
I saw it with my own eyes

391
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,510
when we traveled south and west.

392
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,370
You flatter me.

393
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,270
That's truly wonderful!

394
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,680
However,

395
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,130
she'll need acupuncture for 49 days.

396
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,360
Having you come here daily

397
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,450
would be too much trouble for you.

398
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,110
That's true indeed.

399
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,930
After all, I, Boss Fei,

400
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,400
am very busy these days.

401
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:29,750
Why don't we have the patient

402
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,770
come to the Sushan Shop daily?

403
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,510
No.

404
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,730
Jia cannot leave the house.

405
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,880
I can't explain the reasons.

406
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,530
Please understand.

407
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:43,480
That…

408
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,240
I have an idea.

409
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,360
I learned acupuncture when I was young.

410
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:51,440
I just didn't know

411
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,480
acupuncture could cure
such a stubborn illness.

412
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,790
Miracle Doctor Fei,
if you don't find me too dull,

413
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:58,440
could you teach me
the acupuncture techniques?

414
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,440
How about I, on your behalf,

415
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,440
perform the treatment on my sister?

416
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,510
T-That's…

417
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,030
If you're willing to teach me,

418
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:10,060
I'll offer three teals of gold

419
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,660
and become your disciple.

420
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,570
There's no need for gold.

421
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
I'm not short of money.

422
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,640
Your husband

423
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,880
is friends with Lu Lingfeng after all.

424
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,680
Besides,

425
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,240
Xijun sees you as a sister.

426
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,830
You said you once learned acupuncture.

427
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,590
If you only know the basics,

428
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,270
then teaching you

429
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,920
would be quite difficult.

430
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,340
How about this?

431
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,270
You seem healthy enough.

432
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,110
I'll just pick a random acupoint

433
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,510
on your body and test you.

434
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,990
Bring strong liquor.

435
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:47,640
Yes.

436
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,350
You're a pro.

437
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,720
Can you learn this technique?

438
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:05,920
I will try.

439
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,680
Come on.

440
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,110
Try it on me.

441
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,860
That's…

442
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,280
It's fine.

443
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,510
If you don't try it on me,

444
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,400
how will I know

445
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,290
if your technique is up to par?

446
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,390
Alright.

447
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:31,770
Now, prick my Sibai acupoint

448
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,480
and Dicang acupoint.

449
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:49,650
Who taught you these techniques?

450
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,740
My parents know a bit of medicine.

451
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,730
Your parents are...

452
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:54,680
Master Fei,

453
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,590
Juniang is from the Du family of Jingzhao.

454
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,600
The Du family?

455
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,550
I never heard of

456
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,070
any famous doctors from the Du family.

457
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,440
They don't practice medicine.

458
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,640
It's just part of our family education.

459
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,480
These prestigious families

460
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,030
really are different.

461
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,200
You truly wish to be my disciple?

462
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,670
Then I've hit the jackpot.

463
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,750
-Master, please accept my…
- Wait a moment!

464
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,400

465
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,440
please accept my respect.

466
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,170

467
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,320

468

Juniang,

470
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,600
I'll teach you a set of needle techniques.

471

If you can perform acupuncture
on the patient

472
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,880

and once in the evening every day,

473
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,110
then a full recovery

474
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,830

475
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,200
In that case,

476

00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,350

to thank you in person.

Who's the man in charge here?

748
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,680
The officer
from Yongzhou Prefecture is here.

749
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,010
Step forward and speak.

750
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,840
Greetings, Officer.

751
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,550
It is certainly correct for you

752
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,350
to provide food and wine for the poor.

753
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,480
But why discriminate
based on background?

754
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,270
I apologize,

755
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,040
but I'm just following orders.

756
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,440
Look, I have a list here.

757
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,640
Districts where the gentry are
concentrated, such as Buzheng,

758
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:53,920
[Buzheng, Chongren,
Taiping, Wuben, Xuanyang]

759
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,710
Chongren, Taiping, Wuben, Xuanyang,

760
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,340
Guangde, Zhaoguo, Jinggong, and others,

761
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,200
are not included in the relief effort.

762
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,400
What can I do about it?

763
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:03,760
Who made this rule?

764
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,010
It was Chief He Bi.

765
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,570
I happen to know

766
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,000
where Chief He is right now.

767
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,590
Where?

768
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,070
At He Qian's residence,

769
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,640
arranging his brother's funeral.

770
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,280
But

771
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,240
I can't accompany you there.

772
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,270
Today, the magistrate

773
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:23,400
ordered me to punish those who litter.

774
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,700
So I can only take my men

775
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,480
and patrol the streets,
checking for garbage.

776
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:28,440
Look, look.

777
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,620
To think I'm a constable.

778
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,410
Sheriff Du,

779
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,310
I was the one
who combined the murder cases

780
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,830
with the disappearances

781
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,590
and brought them
to the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

782
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,030
I have no objections,

783
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,720
and I'm not complaining.

784
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
I just hope you solve the cases soon.

785
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,160
Also,

786
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,590
without the murder cases weighing on me,

787
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,920
I feel much more at ease.

788
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,920
In three days,
I'm hosting a gathering at my home.

789
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,050
Would you honor me with your presence?

790
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:59,310
Thank you for your kind invitation,

791
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,580
but I'm truly too busy lately.

792
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,590
What?

793
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,170
The Wei family of Jingzhao is
worthy of your company,

794
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,570
but the Du family isn't?

795
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,480
What do you mean by that?

796
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,120
The merit-record pillars.

797
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
As the Wei family
unearthed their merit pillar,

798
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,360
my Du family

799
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,960
also unearthed a record pillar.

800
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,150
This family banquet I'm hosting

801
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,070
is to celebrate

802
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:22,510
my family's merit-record pillar
seeing the light of day again.

803
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,639
If you could attend,

804
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,230
I

805
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,000
and my clansmen from the south of the city

806
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,659
will be very grateful.

807
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:35,480
The An Society helping the poor
is an act of charity.

808
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,760
[He Qian's Residence]

809
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
It's not easy
for merchants to earn money either.

810
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,670
We have no reason

811
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,710
to give food
to those high-ranking gentry families.

812
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:44,770
Besides, even if we wanted to give it,

813
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,650
would they even accept it?

814
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,810
It's your money,

815
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,159
so of course you decide who to give it to.

816
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:53,850
However,

817
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,030
intentionally escalating the conflict
between the gentry

818
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,550
and merchants is not right.

819
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:00,410
If guilty, make amends.
If not, strive to do better.

820
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:06,440
I heard that within the An Society,

821
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,920
there's an organization
called the Jinguang Society.

822
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,480
Yes.

823
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,550
I am the founder.

824
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,460
Could you tell me about it?

825
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,000
Among the gentry, farmers,
artisans, and merchants,

826
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,930
though merchants are ranked last,

827
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,280
they also make essential contributions

828
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,550
to Chang'an.

829
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:23,960
Among merchants,

830
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,560
there should be role models.

831
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:28,310
Therefore,
the Jinguang Society was founded.

832
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,800
Only those who run the best businesses

833
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,110
and earn the most money can join.

834
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,400
This also indirectly encourages

835
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,000
young people new to commerce

836
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:38,670
and those who are half-hearted

837
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,600
and not serious about their trade.

838
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,190
May I ask, was Hua Fu

839
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:45,290
a member of the Jinguang Society too?

840
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,920
Yes.

841
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
What about Ma Kui?

842
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,130
Ma Kui was also a member.

843
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,160
What about your brother He Qian?

844
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,590
M-My brother was also a member.

845
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,270
By the way,

846
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:58,320
several other members

847
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,710
have mysteriously disappeared.

848
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,110
Is the Jinguang Society…

849
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,120
Your ancestor

850
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,280
was from a famous family
in the Han and Wei Dynasties,

851
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,880
the progenitor
of the Chen family of Yingchuan,

852
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,960
respectfully referred to as Chen Taiqiu.

853
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,020
Taiqiu's grandson

854
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,360
was Chen Qun,
an important official of the Wei Dynasty.

855
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,230
He created the Nine-Rank Official System

856
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,250
and personally ushered in

857
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,510
the era of the gentry.

858
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:43,710
Indeed.

859
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,030
But I

860
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
have brought shame to my ancestors.

861
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,190
Last night,

862
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,610
a thief really came to your residence?

863
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,320
It didn't seem like a thief.

864
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,000
It should have been an assassin.

865
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
But for some reason,

866
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,490
he didn't attack me.

867
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,840
Thinking about it now,

868
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,160
perhaps my ancestor was protecting me.

869
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:08,590
Could you tell me

870
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,250
exactly what happened?

871
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,750
[Chonghua District]

872
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,080
Write this down.

873
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,170
No injuries on the body.

874
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,260
Heavy blow to the back of the head.

875
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,230
Non-standard weapon,

876
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,710
likely a sharp, heavy object.

877
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,040
It's the same killer.

878
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:45,150
The cloth sack must have contained
the murder weapon.

879
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,490
Based on your description,

880
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,660
it sounds like an iron weight,

881
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,150
or…

882
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,480
a large stone.

883
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,550
Yes.

884
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,840
That sound was muffled and heavy.

885
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:58,840
It could be a stone.

886
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,030
You've built quite a business

887
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,200
selling boots.

888
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,760
I hear you're the top seller
in Chang'an now.

889
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,800
So you must have joined
the An Society, right?

890
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,520
Yes.

891
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,150
And you've joined
the Jinguang Society too?

892
00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:10,630
You know about that too?

893
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,550
Yes.

894
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,280
The society leader
approved it a month ago,

895
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,140
so I joined the Jinguang Society.

896
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,630
What does the Jinguang Society usually do?

897
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:22,030
Actually,

898
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,230
we just gather at the society hall

899
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:25,490
for evening banquets,

900
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,480
eating, drinking,
and exchanging information.

901
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,230
But you see,

902
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,190
several people have died recently,

903
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,650
so we've stopped meeting.

904
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,030
It also happens that the Jinguang Society

905
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,960
is expanding its villa
in the south of the city.

906
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,510
Once it's completed,

907
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,730
we'll gather there for several days.

908
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,650
Official Lu,

909
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,440
the location of this villa

910
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,550
is truly blessed.

911
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,550
As soon as construction began,

912
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,440
they unearthed the merit-record pillars

913
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,570
of the Wei and Du families of Jingzhao.

914
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,320
Wait.

915
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,960
Both families' merit-record pillars

916
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,410
were dug up there?

917
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:56,960
Yeah, I guess.

918
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,370
That's just what I heard.

919
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,200
I don't know anything else.

920
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,240
I've said too much.

921
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:11,800
[Jinguang Society]

922
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,360
Come.

923
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:13,150
Good.

924
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:13,830
Lift it up.

925
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,540
Put it here.

926
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,230
Good.

927
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:16,320
Careful.

928
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,510
Put it here.

929
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:25,660
Good.

930
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,230
Come.

931
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:27,630
Come.

932
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:54,800
I was passing by the East Market

933
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
and brought you some snacks.

934
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:58,510
Why?

935
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,260
Do I really have to say it out loud?

936
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,760
You don't have to, Official Lu.

937
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:09,840
I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.

938
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,960
I apologize to you.

939
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:14,280
It's fine.

940
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:16,200
You don't need to apologize to me.

941
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,260
But Yingtao was quite upset with you.

942
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,480
Su Wuming will soothe her.

943
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:21,110
Besides,

944
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:22,880
she's a secret agent
of Yongzhou Prefecture.

945
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,960
We have different views

946
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,690
on investigation approaches.

947
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,840
Arguments are inevitable.

948
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:28,710
How about

949
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,960
you help me apologize to her?

950
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,380
All right. When she returns,

951
00:40:33,410 --> 00:40:34,660
I'll share these snacks with her.

952
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,120
She'll surely smile then.

953
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:37,450
Come in and have a seat.

954
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,910
Who is this person you've drawn?

955
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,800
Ms. Wei Jia.

956
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,800
She's only two years older than me.

957
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,760
We used to play together as children.

958
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,840
She's one of the most beautiful women

959
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,220
in the south of the city.

960
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,320
I remember that

961
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,630
after she married
into the Dou family of Fufeng,

962
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,590
her husband became a county magistrate
through family connections.

963
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,960
Unfortunately, just a few months
after their wedding,

964
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,560
her husband died of illness.

965
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,320
Is that

966
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:14,590
why she went mad?

967
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:16,920
Sit down.

968
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,360
I don't think so.

969
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,740
I heard

970
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,590
she later remarried a merchant.

971
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,590
This caused quite a conflict

972
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,590
with her family.

973
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,760
A merchant?

974
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:33,510
Rumor says

975
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:36,290
he was one of
the biggest merchants in Chang'an.

976
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,230
That's not quite right.

977
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,440
He Bi is one of

978
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,760
the biggest merchants in Chang'an.

979
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,020
He looks down on Ma Kui.

980
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,240
What's wrong?

981
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,470
Don't you know Sheriff Wei?

982
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,400
Of course I do. We're even relatives.

983
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,030
It couldn't be He Bi, could it?
