00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,560
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

4
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,310
Honey,

5
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:45,440
you've been so good to me.

6
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,840
I can never repay you in this lifetime.

7
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,970
So please stop taking the blame for me,

8
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:50,680
will you?

9
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,710
I'm begging you.

10
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:53,870
Honey.

11
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,370
Zhang San raped and killed Qingqing.

12
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,580
She was my good friend
when I was in brothel,

13
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:01,110
and I saw it with my own eyes.

14
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,090
It happened years ago
in Pingkang District.

15
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,810
The murder weapon was a pair of scissors.

16
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,310
Someone reported it
to the officials afterward.

17
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,240
But due to insufficient evidence,

18
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,240
that villain got away with it.

19
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,420
Since you saw it yourself,

20
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,470
why didn't you testify against him?

21
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:26,710
I didn't dare.

22
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,030
But looking at you today,

23
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,840
you don't seem like someone
afraid of death.

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,900
I don't fear death.

25
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,910
What I fear is that if he retaliates,

26
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,630
I'll never have the chance
to avenge my father.

27
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,890
But years have passed,

28
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,910
and I still feel

29
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,440
that I've failed Qingqing.

30
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,630
I thought of another way

31
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,750
to kill Zhang San,

32
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,570
which was to hire an assassin.

33
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,630
But I needed money.

34
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,280
So I asked Meng Buyi,

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,960
but he refused to give me any.

36
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,400
I...

37
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,400
Honey,

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,300
I know you grew up poor

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,930
and are only a minor clerk,

40
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,200
with a pitiful monthly salary.

41
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,650
I didn't tell you the reason,

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,530
so you didn't give me money.

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,840
I don't blame you.

44
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,340
Later I found out

45
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:10,000
that Qian Zheng,
the owner of Jinxiu Textile,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,030
came to the square every day

47
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,430
to watch me play the pipa.

48
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,880
I know what that look

49
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
in a man's eyes means.

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,870
Someone's here.

51
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,470
I'm sorry.

52
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,360
I should be the one saying sorry.

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,890
Are you taking shelter from the rain here?

54
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,770
Why don't we take shelter together?

55
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:45,780
Mr. Qian,

56
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,710
your clothes are all wet.

57
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,170
Don't put them back on.

58
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,110
You might catch cold.

59
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,680
My lady,

60
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,520
your clothes are wet too.

61
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,760
How about I start a fire

62
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,090
so we can dry them together?

63
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,080
I complained to Qian Zheng

64
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,150
about the unfairness of marrying Meng Buyi

65
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,150
and hinted that I might get close to him,

66
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,520
and I managed to borrow the money

67
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,870
to hire an assassin.

68
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,310
I failed you.

69
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,730
Secretary Meng,

70
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,310
please divorce me.

71
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,220
You're kind

72
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
and thrifty.

73
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,370
You deserve a good wife

74
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,240
and many children.

75
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,190
I killed Zhang San.

77
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:45,630
It has nothing to do with Qian Zheng!

78
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,280
Meng Buyi

79
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,560
doesn't even give Hongyao
any money to spend!

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,400
She's so beautiful.

81
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,510
Shouldn't she have

82
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:57,970
the finest jewelry and clothes

83
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,400
to suit her?

84
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,120
That day I arranged to meet Yan Junxian,

85
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,970
hoping to find out
Ming Shi's true identity.

86
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,030
Unexpectedly, Zhang San

87
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,830
suddenly knocked on my door

88
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,360
and forced me to give him money.

89
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:10,900
I thought

90
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,950
the assassin I hired
must have been incompetent

91
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:13,830
and slipped up.

92
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,090
I did have some money left.

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,270
Just as I was about to compromise
to save my life,

94
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,510
Meng Buyi returned.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,040
So I had Zhang San hide in the cabinet.

96
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,560
After I sent Meng Buyi away,

97
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,190
I sent Yan Junxian to leave first.

98
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:29,390
When I returned home,

99
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,430
I found Zhang San lying on the floor.

100
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,090
I thought,

101
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,860
isn't this the perfect opportunity?

102
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,100
Qingqing and I were like sisters.

103
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,830
Back when we were in Pingkang District,

104
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,480
she took the best care of me.

105
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,000
So I decided to use

106
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,840
his own methods against him.

107
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,730
I used the same method Zhang San
used to kill Qingqing...

108
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,680
The murderer was me, Hongyao.

109
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,610
It had nothing to do with Meng Buyi.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,480
You seem to have confessed,

111
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,480
yet deliberately concealed some details.

112
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,280
Let me ask you.

113
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,310
Did you know there was a Perfect Purple

114
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,570
hidden in the cabinet?

115
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,190
A snake?

116
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,110
I didn't know.

117
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:21,730
If there was one,

118
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,430
[A Loyal Heart]

119
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,870
it must have crawled in by itself.

120
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,470
My house is close to Qu River.

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,610
Perfect Purple is no ordinary snake.

122
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,720
And Meng Buyi has already admitted

123
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,120
he intended to use a snake
to commit murder.

124
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,590
Looks like you two

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,730
didn't have a chance
to coordinate your stories.

126
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:40,950
Alright,

127
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,920
let me piece this together.

128
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,159
Seven years ago,

129
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,880
Secretary Meng saved Hongyao

130
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,290
when she was about to take her own life,

131
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,070
and later they married.

132
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,020
According to Secretary Meng,

133
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:03,050
they were very harmonious
for the first 2 years,

134
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,510
but gradually grew distant,

135
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,920
and they often argued.

136
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,730
Therefore,

137
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,240
Hongyao often went to the square
to play the pipa.

138
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,310
Then she saw Zhang San open a shop

139
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,330
selling mutton soup.

140
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,240
Thinking of her friend's death,

141
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,380
she wanted to hire an assassin
to avenge her.

142
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,150
But Secretary Meng
was too stingy to give her the money,

143
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,650
so Hongyao briefly got close

144
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,830
to Qian Zheng.

145
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:34,000
Later,

146
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,870
Qian Zheng
hired the private detective Cat,

147
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,080
who was

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,000
actually Secretary Meng himself.

149
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,480
What's the name of your lover?

150
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,630
Hongyao.

151
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,190
I think

152
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,720
after this incident,

153
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,870
you two have become honest
with each other.

154
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,070
Why are you doing this?

155
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,870
Just because

156
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,680
I never took you to visit Chang'an?

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,120
Or...

158
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,870
Or is it because

159
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:08,950
I didn't give you enough money
for household expenses?

160
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:09,390
If...

161
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,040
If you wanted a life of luxury,

162
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,400
why did you marry me?

163
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,660
I'm not unwilling to live simply;

164
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,400
I'm just afraid that

165
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,880
I might lose the chance
to avenge Qingqing.

166
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,960
I suspect

167
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,480
that Hongyao had already revealed
everything

168
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,360
about her background,

169
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,929
her past experiences,

170
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,840
and the fact that Mingshi was the assassin

171
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,400
known as Beacon Fire.

172
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,870
In her reasoning,

173
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:48,960
Yan Junxian was also an enemy,

174
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,140
because her father once said

175
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,580
that the one who hired the killer
must have the surname Yan.

176
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,290
But as for Secretary Meng's attitude...

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,510
I infer that…

178
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,300
Your father

179
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,540
was my father‑in‑law.

180
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,450
Such a deep blood feud must be avenged.

181
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,750
But why do you have

182
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,540
to risk your own life?

183
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,900
I have indeed resolved
to sacrifice myself,

184
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,960
but I haven't figured out

185
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,150
how to take revenge.

186
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,510
You speak of it so lightly.

187
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:28,950
Are you mocking me?

188
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,750
No, no, no.

189
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,340
Don't be angry, Honey.

190
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,080
Let me explain.

191
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,260
Secretary Meng's plan

192
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,180
was to lure Yan Junxian to his home

193
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,320
and kill him with a Perfect Purple,

194
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:49,030
then hide the body.

195
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:51,810
Ming Shi would surely come looking.

196
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:54,410
By then, you two only needed to hide,

197
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,710
and the Perfect Purple
would take revenge on your behalf.

198
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,750
Am I right?

199
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,860
It was quite a meticulous plan.

200
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,890
Unfortunately,

201
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,870
the assassin Hongyao hired…

202
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,820
A silver ingot?

203
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,000
You really are an assassin now?

204
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,120
H-how would I have the guts,

205
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,790
Mr. San?

206
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,150
Where did the money come from?

207
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,690
Speak!

208
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,730
I'll kill you if you don't tell me!

209
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,960
Jiang's money

210
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,430
brought Zhang San knocking at the door,

211
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,480
and Hongyao

212
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,630
thought it was Meng Buyi.

213
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,600
In your original plan,

214
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,730
you were going to put Yan Junxian

215
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,750
into the cabinet.

216
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,900
But by coincidence,

217
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,550
Yan Junxian opened up

218
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:46,530
and revealed his background—

219
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,970
he was only a puppet,

220
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,880
his real name was Moorhen,
and he didn't bear the surname Yan.

221
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,440
So

222
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,530
you felt compassion for him

223
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,550
and hid him under the bed instead.

224
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,910
What you didn't expect was that the person

225
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,510
who arrived wasn't Meng Buyi,

226
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,300
but Zhang San.

227
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,270
Why is it you?

228
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,030
If you don't tell me

229
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,080
where your money is,

230
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,140
I'll strangle you!

231
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,810
The reason Meng Buyi came back late

232
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,320
was because the senior clerk

233
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,380
kept pestering him

234
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:25,790
by telling him stories about snake demons.

235
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:28,840
This cost you,
who've been frugal all your life,

236
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,120
quite a bit.

237
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,360
After all, a jar of wine

238
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,150
isn't cheap.

239
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:39,240
As for what happened afterward,
my deduction is…

240
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,000
Why are you back?

241
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,270
Aren't you on night duty?

242
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,480
What... what are you looking at?

243
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,610
Did you come back to catch me cheating?

244
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,030
No.

245
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,150
Let me ask you.

246
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,440
Let me ask you!

247
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,510
You told me you were an official

248
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,040
in the Ministry of Revenue.

249
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,540
But a secretary...

250
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,180
is just a minor clerk!

251
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,950
There are 50 or 60 of them

252
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,100
in the Ministry of Revenue alone.

253
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,040
It's a lowly position
with no official rank.

254
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,510
How long are you going

255
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,610
to keep lying to me?

256
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:24,390
Who's lying to you?

257
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,120
A secretary may be low-ranked,

258
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,350
but the duties are significant.

259
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,810
It's still ninth rank.

260
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,960
Come on.

261
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,670
An unranked position

262
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,930
can't compare to a proper official rank.

263
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:39,780
I...

264
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:46,860
You've been a aecretary for 7 years.

265
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,390
If you had ever considered my feelings,

266
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,270
you wouldn't spend every day

267
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,320
writing strange tales

268
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,980
instead of trying to advance.

269
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,320
Divorce me.

270
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,150
What did you say?

271
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,030
Divorce me!

272
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,320
Divorce you?

273
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,890
So you can get back together

274
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,480
with Yan Junxian?

275
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:15,320
No way!

276
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,330
Go.

277
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,120
Am I right?

278
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,640
If the two of you had shown
even the slightest flaw,

279
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,050
Zhang San

280
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,950
would have come out of the cabinet

281
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,510
and started killing.

282
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,750
Yan Junxian

283
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,240
would have seized the chance to escape,

284
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,440
and Hongyao's hope for revenge
would have been lost forever.

285
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,080

286

Otherwise,

Master Di?

301
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,880
Years ago, when my father

302
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,550
was framed by that corrupt official Yan,

303
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,550
it was Master Di who set things right

304
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,460
and freed him from prison.

305
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:17,190
So,

you're a descendant of an old friend.

307
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,480
Mr. Su, your deductions

308
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,520
are remarkably precise.

309
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,340
I'm deeply impressed.

310

The snake has been kept
at home for a long time.

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,330
It wasn't intentional.

330
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:16,980
This is not a court proceeding.

331
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:20,880
It's more like watching a play
or listening to a story.

332

00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,720
the charge that Hongyao
stabbed Zhang San to death

344
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,580

00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,510

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,930
Look at this.

566
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:00,170
Our Sushan Shop hasn't been open long,

567
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,790
and we've already earned so much?

568
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,520
Just because we earned too much,

569
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,640
I converted the coins into silver ingots

570
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,840
to take up less space.

571
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,260
That's because

572
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,980
I'm such a good boss

573
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:10,750
Right?

574
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,120
At this rate,

575
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,830
we won't have to wait
until next year to open branches

576
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,830
in the East and West markets.

577
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,310
Come on.

578
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,400
Branches?

579
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,240
I say

580
00:28:18,310 --> 00:28:20,510
we should first divide
these silver ingots.

581
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,000
Divide?

582
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,130
How?

583
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,800
Well, of course it should...

584
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,120
Al-although I didn't invest any money,

585
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,830
I am, after all, the boss.

586
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,830
I'm not greedy.

587
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,360
I'll take half first,

588
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,310
and you can split the other half.

589
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:37,010
How's that?

590
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,410
You call that "not greedy," Mr. Fei?

591
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,580
Though you're the nominal boss,

592
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,820
the capital came from Xijun.

593
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,180
To open this shop,

594
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,630
she even sold a residence.

595
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,060
You...

596
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:48,340
Yingtao,

597
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,510
Master Fei

598
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:51,410
is just worried we'd waste money.

599
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,900
Xijun is so perceptive.

600
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,870
Fei is just joking with us.

601
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,270
He's a wandering cultivator;

602
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,880
what does he need so much money for?

603
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,640
"Wandering"

604
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,960
means to be free and unrestrained.

605
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,810
Holding so many silver ingots—

606
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,920
doesn't that dishonor
the wandering cultivators?

607
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,350
Am I right?

608
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,440
That's right.

609
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,570
I said I'd take half

610
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,640
because I wanted

611
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,100
to help you save money.

612
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,550
You young people

613
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,810
are so extravagant.

614
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:24,880
Yingtao.

615
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,070
Every time you have money,
you buy all sorts of delicacies,

616
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:29,520
and in large quantities.

617
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,240
Right?

618
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,050
Xijun,

619
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,750
you never charge for painting portraits

620
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,170
for Yongzhou Prefecture Office,

621
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:36,830
right?

622
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,510
But buying ink, brushes,
and pigments daily—

623
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,100
that costs money.

624
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:42,440
Su Wuming.

625
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,310
You're always browsing bookstores,

626
00:29:45,310 --> 00:29:46,880
and every time you go,
you buy so many books.

627
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,750
Isn't that also

628
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,150
a huge expense?

629
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,510
Fei.

630
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,860
The expenses you just mentioned

631
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,310
still can't compare to

632
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:55,750
what you'd spend on a good drink.

633
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:56,390
Exactly.

634
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,580
Little Xue Huan,
do you even know how to talk?

635
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,540
Do you think I won't hit you?

636
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,620
Just try it.

637
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,480
I'm Xue Huan,
captain of Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

638
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,080
If you can hit me that easily,

639
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,820
what would that make

640
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,570
of Official Lu?

641
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,460
This Little Xue Huan.

642
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,540
Since becoming the captain,

643
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:19,930
you've gotten even more handsome.

644
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:22,830
Alright.

645
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,170
Looks like this Sushan Shop

646
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,960
not only didn't lose our investment,

647
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
it even made a profit.

648
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,550
Doing business is really

649
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,680
quite interesting.

650
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,660
Congratulations to you all.

651
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,600
Xue Huan, it's time.

652
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:35,920
Let's head to the county office.

653
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,380
I'll get the horses ready.

654
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,890
Don't go!

655
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:41,750
The...

656
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,110
The six of us all have a share

657
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,270
of the Liuhe Sushan Shop's profits.

658
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,070
How can we divide it if you leave?

659
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,040
Don't...

660
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:56,560
It's better that they left.

661
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,120
Those two are officials,

662
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:01,000
not suitable for sharing the money.

663
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,330
Now we only need to divide it
into 4 shares.

664
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:05,110
Since I'm the boss,

665
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,200
can I take just a little more?

666
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:11,880
Master Fei, being the boss must be tough.

667
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,370
So yesterday at the West Market,

668
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,480
I specially picked a gift for you.

669
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,110
W-what is it?

670
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:22,790
See for yourself.

671
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,880
A silver flask,

672
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,270
and even gilded with gold?

673
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:39,270
The craftsmanship is so exquisite.

674
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,790
This must have cost a fortune.

675
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,720
How can I accept it?

676
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,630
Is the Chicken Master of Tang present?

677
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,200
I am.

678
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,960
The "Chicken Master of Tang" title

679
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,670
that the Princess granted

680
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,770
has been made into a gold medal.

681
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:00,260
A gold medal?

682
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,590
I've been waiting for this for some time.

683
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,860
Delivered as ordered.

684
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

685
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,890
Come, help me open it.

686
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:14,520
Let me see.

687
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,920
Chicken Master of Tang.

688
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,070
Chickens offered from all regions.

689
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,600
Bestowed by the State-guarding Grand Princess
of Tang Empire.

690
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:33,160
I, Fei Qiao, Fei Yingjun,

691
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,640
have loved chicken and wine all my life.

692
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,660
With this gold medal,

693
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,880
no matter where I go,

694
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,610
people will offer me chickens.

695
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,290
And with the silver flask Xijun gave me,

696
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:46,130
whatever wine I put in it

697
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,130
becomes heavenly nectar.

698
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:50,350
Well...

699
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:52,310
I won't take a share anymore.

700
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,200
From now on,

701
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:55,920
why would I, Fei Yingjun, ever need money?

702
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:01,330
Fei, oh, Fei,

703
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:03,940
it's double blessings for you today.

704
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:06,040
Come on! Let's do it together!

705
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:08,550
Congratulations, Boss Fei!

706
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,680
Congratulations, Boss Fei!

707
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,330
[Sushan]

708
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,110
Wuming,

709
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,550
we still have to split the money
we earned.

710
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,750
You should get half.

711
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,510
I can't.

712
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,060
How could I take that?

713
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,970
It's not for yourself.

714
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,550
You're the Chief of Secret Agents,

715
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,270
but Yongzhou Prefecture Office

716
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,110
doesn't have enough funds
to run its network.

717
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,170
How can that help keep Chang'an safe?

718
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,570
You want to use your own money

719
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,830
to cover Yongzhou Prefecture Office's
expenses?

720
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,160
It's not just covering.

721
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:44,010
One day, you will build

722
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,080
a vast intelligence network

723
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,190
for Chang'an,

724
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,480
gathering all kinds of important
information,

725
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,750
helping Yongzhou Prefecture Office

726
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,640
crack one strange case after another—

727
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,590
even

728
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:55,410
major cases that concern
the safety of the court.

729
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,350
When that happens,

730
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,270
there will certainly be generous rewards.

731
00:33:58,270 --> 00:33:59,750
So what does this little money

732
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,640
matter now?

733
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:02,150
Wait.

734
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,150
Have you and Lu Lingfeng

735
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,600
already discussed this?

736
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,199
It was his idea.

737
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,929
I see.

738
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,330
You truly are

739
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:15,360
the wise helper behind Lu Lingfeng.

740
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,440
But don't worry.

741
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,210
I'll never pocket a single penny.

742
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,520
All the money

743
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,230
will go into intelligence work.

744
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:28,080
I only hope this information

745
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,230
can keep the capital safe

746
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,150
and ensure the stability
of our Tang Empire.

747
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,320
If I truly receive
any reward because of it,

748
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,280
I'll return double to you.

749
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,370
With your character,

750
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,150
wisdom,

751
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,360
and courage,

752
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,880

as a secret agent?

3 greatest living poets

942
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,360
in the Tang Empire,

943
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,630
these two will surely be among them.

944
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,080
It's not too much

945
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,690
for Ruan's Restaurant to honor them

946
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,880
with exceptional courtesy.

947
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:54,710
Besides,

948
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,970
our Sushan Shop

949
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,280
has been open for a month,

950
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,360
and the staff
haven't had a single day off.

951
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,510
Though they don't complain,

952
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,730
as owners,

953
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,550
we can't treat them this way.

954
00:42:04,030 --> 00:42:04,740
But...

955
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:05,920
Listen to me.

956
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:09,740
Manager, what's your surname?

957
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,310
My surname is Hou.

958
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,020
Mr. Hou,

959
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,800
I can make decisions

960
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,610
in this Sushan Shop.

961
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:18,250
Go back and tell your boss

962
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,650
that it's our honor

963
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,480
to come to Ruan's Restaurant
to make sushan

964
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,650
for Gao Da

965
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,780
and Wang Youbo.

966
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,140
We will be there

967
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,690
at 2 PM, precisely on time.

968
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,870
Will that work?

969
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,370
The timing is perfect.

970
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,400
I can go back

971
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,660
and report to our boss.

972
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,670
Here's the deposit. Take it.

973
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,450
Okay.

974
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:42,260
Take care.

975
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
See you tomorrow.

976
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:46,430
I'm the boss.

977
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:56,210
[Temporarily Closed for One Day.
Thank You for Your Understanding]

978
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:56,520
Hurry up.

979
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,010
[Temporarily Closed for One Day.
Thank You for Your Understanding]

980
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:58,440
[Liuhe Sushan Shop]

981
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,370
They're closed?

982
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,480
It's all your fault for dawdling.

983
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,440
I didn't know they would close so early.
