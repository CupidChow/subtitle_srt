Why didn't you bring an umbrella?

You're soaked through.

It breaks my heart.

you've also been implementing new policies

381
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,070
by handling cases in the districts, right?

382
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:16,830
Therefore,

383
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,550
I suddenly came up with an idea

384
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,640
to launch a new initiative

385
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,930
in Qinglong District—

386
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:22,270
having everyone

387
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,000
donate the clothes

388
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,060
they no longer wear

389
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,450
to help the poor.

390
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,790
But Secretary Meng is extremely stingy

391
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:28,680
and hasn't donated anything.

392
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,400
Today I came specifically to urge him.

393
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,070
I called him a few times in the courtyard,

394
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,070
but no one responded.

395
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,110
Then I noticed the door was slightly ajar,

396
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,350
and fearing it might be a burglary,

397
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,160
I went inside.

398
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,510
But then...

399
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,590
What's Secretary Meng's name?

400
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,350
Meng Buyi.

401
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,110
Is this man Meng Buyi?

402
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,310
No.

403
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,510
His name is Zhang San.

404
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:47,440
He sells mutton soup in this district.

405
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,370
He was quite successful years ago.

406
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,110
But then,

407
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,360
he fell on hard times.

408
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,280
Actually,

409
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:53,960
he's nothing but a scoundrel,

410
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,310
extremely cunning.

411
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,590
Often when he does something evil,

412
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,000
he makes sure
the county office doesn't catch him,

413
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,240
and always escapes punishment.

414
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,000
In short,

415
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,540
he's no decent man.

416
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,720
But why did he end up dead

417
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:04,920
in Meng Buyi's house?

418
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:05,640
Well...

419
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,400
I don't know.

420
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,680
I heard Secretary Meng has been

421
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,440
on night duty at the county office
recently.

422
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,680
But the body

423
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,030
was discovered long ago,

424
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:14,070
and we still haven't seen

425
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,270
any sign of Meng's wife,

426
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:16,270
Hongyao.

427
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,850
Hongyao?

428
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,680
The woman who played the pipa

429
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,280
when we were handling the case
in the district.

430
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:37,760
Excuse me!

431
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,550
Excuse me!

432
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,740
Who died?

433
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,070
What's that question?

434
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,240
Someone died at Meng's house.

435
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,200
If not Secretary Meng,

436
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,160
then it must be Hongyao.

437
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,930
Hongyao?

438
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,440
So who actually died?

439
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,860
It must be Hongyao.

440
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,110
Isn't there a saying,

441
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:50,720
"Hongyao is short-lived?"

442
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,310
"Hongyao is short-lived?"

443
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,880
That saying is "beauties are short-lived."

444
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:54,830
You old fool know nothing

445
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:55,790
and talk nonsense.

446
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:56,400
Excuse us.

447
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,350
Who says
that if someone in the Meng family dies,

448
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,310
it has to be Secretary Meng

449
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:00,970
or Hongyao?

450
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,240
It could be a burglar.

451
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,270
See? Even a coroner is here.

452
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,400
That makes sense.

453
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,270
Mr. Su,

454
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,170
you're here.

455
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,920
Who is the deceased?

456
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,960
He's not the homeowner.

457
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
He's an outsider.

458
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,200
What took you so long?

459
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,270
My horse...

460
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:18,080
was slow.

461
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,440
The body hasn't been moved, has it?

462
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:23,680
Of course not.

463
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,950
[Autopsy Record]

464
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:39,010
Take notes.

465
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:42,270
The deceased
likely died around midnight last night.

466
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,790
There's a sharp cut
on the side of his neck,

467
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,070
enough to be fatal.

468
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:57,480
The blade wasn't the murder weapon.

469
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,750
The wound is very small.

470
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
Judging by its shape,

471
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,200
it was probably made by scissors

472
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,530
or a similar sharp tool.

473
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,850
He has bruises on his face...

474
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:14,010
and clear strangulation marks on his neck.

475
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,640
However,

476
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:17,750
they weren't caused by a rope.

477
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,880
What happened?

478
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,540
I heard someone died in there.

479
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,700
Make way! Make way!

480
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,350
What happened?

481
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,070
Secretary Meng,

482
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,110
there's been a death in your house.

483
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,310
Go in and take a look!

484
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,480
Hongyao!

485
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,750
Hongyao!

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,750
Why did Secretary Meng only come back now?

487
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,280
Hongyao!

488
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:43,080
Hongyao!

489
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:43,960
Hongyao!

490
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,310
Stop!

491
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,340
It's...

492
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:49,030
Mr. Guang,

493
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,160
where is my Hongyao?

494
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,750
I haven't seen your wife.

495
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:56,910
I'm Lu Lingfeng,
Yongzhou Judicial Official.

496
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,670
Greetings, Official Lu.

497
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,070
Secretary Meng,
when do you usually return home

498
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,720
after your night duty?

499
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,000
I...

500
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,500
I usually...

501
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
get home around nine in the morning.

502
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,550
But today, after I left the county office,

503
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:12,920
I went to the Ghost Market.

504
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,560
The Ghost Market? What for?

505
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,960
Recently,

506
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,270
I've been writing a strange tale.

507
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:20,430
Since it involves spirits and ghosts,

508
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,680
I feared it might harm my yang energy.

509
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,480
I heard that

510
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,790
the Yangzhou Liuhe paper
sold at the Ghost Market

511
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,110
has exorcising properties

512
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,570
that keep all ghosts away,

513
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,140
so I went to look for it.

514
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,460
Did you find it?

515
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:32,200
No.

516
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,820
If you ever find it,

517
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:36,790
let me know

518
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
where to buy it. I want some too.

519
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,900
You also write strange tales?

520
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,170
Have you published anything?

521
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,770
Which bookstore sells them?

522
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,440
Secretary Meng,

523
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,940
did you go home last night?

524
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,200
No.

525
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,510
Is there anyone who can verify that?

526
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,110
Lately, it's just been me

527
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,000
in the little hall where I work.

528
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,660
No one else has been there.

529
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,410
The senior clerk can vouch for me.

530
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,350
Last night,

531
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,510
I had a drink with him.

532
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,240
He knows I've been writing
a strange tale recently

533
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,440
and has been telling me
snake demon stories

534
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,570
these past few days.

535
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,650
Snake demon stories?

536
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:15,830
Who...

537
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,120
Who is this person?

538
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:18,290
This...

539
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:18,970
Zhang San.

540
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:20,510
Zhang San?

541
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:21,750
What does...

542
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,680
What does he do?

543
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,280
Why did he die in my house?

544
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,160
Secretary Meng,
you don't know this person?

545
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:27,640
I...

546
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:30,310
He's the one who sells mutton soup
in our district.

547
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:31,680
How would I know

548
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,680
a mutton soup vendor?

549
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,350
I just want to know

550
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,480
where my wife is.

551
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,920
Could she have gone back
to her maternal family?

552
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,650
Impossible.

553
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:39,590
She's not even from Chang'an.

554
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,270
She doesn't really have a maternal family.

555
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,790
Secretary Meng, how did you and your wife

556
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:43,880
first meet?

557
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,830
When we met, she was a pipa player

558
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:46,560
at a brothel.

559
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,310
Later, after I passed the imperial exam

560
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,110
and joined the county office,

561
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,070
I took her out of there.

562
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,350
Then we got married.

563
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,440
Secretary Meng,
you often work night shifts

564
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,780
and write strange tales.

565
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,080
It must have taken
a lot of your mental effort.

566
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,210
I hope it hasn't turned your hair white
from exhaustion.

567
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,750
My hair?

568
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,510
Well...

569
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,920
My hair is perfectly fine.

570
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,590
Look, not a single white hair.

571
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,410
What about your lady, Hongyao?

572
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,070
A few days ago, I saw her when I came

573
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,330
to Qinglong District.

574
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:19,030
However,

575
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,080
I didn't see her clearly.

576
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,330
Her? That's even more impossible.

577
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,400
She's so young,

578
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,110
and her hair

579
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,540
is black and silky.

580
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:37,400
Then how do you explain this?

581
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,370
I found it during my routine inspection
just now.

582
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,880
What is it?

583
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,160
Whose white hair

584
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,840
could have fallen onto my bed?

585
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:45,920
It's...

586
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,880
It's...

587
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,550
Who says
that if someone in the Meng family dies,

588
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:53,440
it has to be Secretary Meng

589
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,150
or Hongyao?

590
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,720
It could be a burglar.

591
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,660
Someone's coming out.

592
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:11,780
Excuse me, sir,

593
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,660
is the deceased

594
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,830
Hongyao?

595
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,440
You know Meng's wife?

596
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,000
I...

597
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,160
don't know her.

598
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,000
I'm just curious.

599
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:24,510
No comment.

600
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,310
Is it Hongyao or not?

601
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,420
Earlier, there was a young man

602
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,270
with a head full of white hair.

603
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,440
Do you remember him?

604
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,110
-Yes.
-Yes.

605
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,660
He was quite talkative.

606
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,760
Find him

607
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:42,350
and bring him to the county office.

608
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:42,950
Yes.

609
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,290
There's someone outside.

610
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,730
Keep an eye on him for me.

611
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:01,790
Jia,

612
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,880
you can move the body back
to the county office

613
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,240
and store it in the ice chamber now.

614
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,040
But remember,

615
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:10,200
cover it with a white cloth
when carrying it out.

616
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,960
Don't let anyone know

617
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,720
the identity of the deceased.

618
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,270
Yes.

619
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,130
Secretary Meng.

620
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,200
And you.

621
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,970
You two must keep this confidential
as well.

622
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,920
Xue Huan,

623
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,590
search every corner

624
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,200
of the Meng Residence with me

625
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,160
and see if there are any sharp tools,

626
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,680
such as scissors.

627
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:34,790
Yes, sir.

628
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:37,790
This...

629
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,590
Official Lu.

630
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,110
What about my wife?

631
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,000
You must help me find my wife!

632
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,240
We can't confirm

633
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,440
that your wife is missing.

634
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,430
If by nightfall
we still don't know her whereabouts,

635
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,430
the county office
will send people to search for her.

636
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:51,990
However,

637
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,790
I would like to ask you

638
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,140
to provide more clues.

639
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,110
For instance,

640
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,330
have you and your wife

641
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,020
had any arguments recently?

642
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,050
No, no, no.

643
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:01,190
We haven't argued.

644
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,100
Do you have any other clues?

645
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:04,830
Other clues?

646
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:05,920
There are none.

647
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:06,880
Official Lu,

648
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,110
you're a crime investigator.

649
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,110
My wife is missing,

650
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,840
and you're asking me for clues?

651
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,070
What clues could I possibly have?

652
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,280
And I have to wait until night.

653
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,110
What if some bad guy

654
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,000
kills my wife?

655
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,080
Official Lu,

656
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:19,550
I...

657
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,700
You can't just stand by and do nothing.

658
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:24,920
[Integrity] [Loyalty]

659
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,830
Mr. Su speculated that Zhang San died

660
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,830
from the scissors wound on his neck.

661
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:29,680
But we searched

662
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,600
the entire Meng Residence

663
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,860
and found no scissors.

664
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,570
That's very strange.

665
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,240
So I roughly conclude

666
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,310
that at the time, Zhang San

667
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:37,480
was likely hiding in the cabinet

668
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,410
with ill intent.

669
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,680
Hongyao discovered him

670
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,480
and stabbed him to death with scissors.

671
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,460
After killing him,

672
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,110
Hongyao didn't dare report it,

673
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,770
so she fled with the scissors.

674
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,920
How's

675
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,580
Captain Xue's deduction?

676
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,020
It makes sense.

677
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,270
But how do you explain

678
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,910
the knife found on the floor?

679
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,070
Judging by where it landed,

680
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,260
it should have been held by Zhang San.

681
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,160
Perhaps Hongyao caught him off guard,

682
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,140
so he didn't get to use his knife.

683
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,750
The sudden strength of a woman

684
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,480
shouldn't be underestimated.

685
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,920
Then how do we explain

686
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,350
the two white hairs

687
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:16,510
Official Lu found?

688
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:18,820
Perhaps

689
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,590
they were left a long time ago.

690
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,030
We can

691
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,440
ask Meng Buyi more carefully

692
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,030
whether an elderly person

693
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,770
had stayed in the house a month ago,

694
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:26,570
or even six months ago.

695
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,310
Zhang San had bruises on his face,

696
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,780
which indicate he was strangled.

697
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,440
This should be related to

698
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,680
the marks on his neck.

699
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,360
But these marks are very strange.

700
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,350
They weren't caused by rope,

701
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,680
cloth,

702
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,790
or any weapon.

703
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,970
Then tell me,

704
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,400
was Zhang San

705
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,290
strangled to death

706
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,480
or stabbed to death with scissors?

707
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,720
Or perhaps both?

708
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,070
If so, which happened first?

709
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:58,550
And which was more fatal?

710
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,620
How can we determine that?

711
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:05,150
Did you learn anything?

712
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,440
Yes, I did.

713
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,400
Mr. Su is impressive.

714
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:12,000
So what should we do now?

715
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,010
Let's wait until we can catch him
and interrogate him.

716
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,510
You didn't tell me to arrest anyone.

717
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:19,540
Liu and Luo have both disappeared.

718
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,830
And the secret agent Yingtao
has been sent out too.

719
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,030
Haven't you noticed?

720
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,260
Catching someone without any leads?

721
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,070
Who?

722
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,750
Silly boy.

723
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,510
It's not that there are no leads.

724
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,310
You just haven't found them yet.

725
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,640
Watch Su Wuming closely

726
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,700
and learn from him.

727
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:38,220
Xue Huan,

728
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:41,090
you are Official Lu's apprentice.

729
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:43,230
Learn more from your mentor.

730
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,030
Yes.

731
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,890
Mr. Su,

732
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,110
may I ask,

733
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,080
who have they gone to arrest?

734
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,270
Who is it?

735
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,310
The hair

736
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,790
is indeed mine.

737
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,480
I stayed at the Meng Residence
for half a month.

738
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,940
I didn't clean up properly when I left

739
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:28,200
and actually left behind some of my hair.

740
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,720
Truly embarrassing for us house-squatters.

741
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,310
House-squatter?

742
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,640
Can giving yourself

743
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,070
such an elegant name

744
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,790
really make you different from a thief?

745
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,110
If you see something

746
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:40,010
you like,

747
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,310
you would probably just help yourself,
right?

748
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,610
Absolutely not.

749
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,160
Otherwise, wouldn't it tarnish

750
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,750
the reputation of our line of work?

751
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,700
Official Lu.

752
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,920
Chang'an

753
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,510
really does have
so-called house-squatters.

754
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:54,850
Most of them are homeless and jobless.

755
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,630
A few have homes and jobs,

756
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,520
but, due to some eccentricity,

757
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:02,240
choose to sneak into
other people's houses to live.

758
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,750
That's a different matter.

759
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,350
You-you really know your stuff.

760
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,480
Are you also a...

761
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,680
Let me ask you.

762
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,860
When was the last time

763
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,020
you stayed at the Meng Residence?

764
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:15,250
Three days ago.

765
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,110
It was hailing that day.

766
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,460
Hongyao came back early,

767
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,000
so she caught me in the room.

768
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,750
Who are you?

769
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:22,970
You're a thief!

770
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,660
A white-haired thief.

771
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,360
Please don't report me.

772
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,760
I'll do whatever you ask.

773
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,160
But Zhang San's death

774
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,890
truly has nothing to do with me.

775
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:38,700
When did I ever say

776
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,400
the deceased was Zhang San?

777
00:31:46,790 --> 00:31:47,310
Jiang,

778
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,830
confess everything now!

779
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,430
I'll talk!

780
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,010
I'll tell you everything!

781
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,550
A silver ingot?

782
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,680
There's another one

783
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,750
after the job is done.

784
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,830
Who do you... want me to kill?

785
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,600
The one who sells mutton soup
in the district,

786
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,550
Zhang San.

787
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,350
Hongyao asked you to kill Zhang San?

788
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,160
Yes.

789
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,440
But now that Zhang San is dead,

790
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,960
I can't explain myself.

791
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,400
Jiang,

792
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,270
if you didn't kill him,

793
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,680
Official Lu wouldn't wrongly accuse you.

794
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,590
But you must tell us

795
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,830
everything you know

796
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,160
and everything you saw.

797
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,920
You must not hide anything.

798
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,480
Yes.

799
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,680
Let me ask you.

800
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,610
After taking the silver ingot
from Hongyao,

801
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:30,510
did you kill Zhang San?

802
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,900
I've never killed anyone.

803
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,310
And I don't even know how.

804
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,640
I hesitated for 3 days

805
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,820
and then found a butcher's knife.

806
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,830
But the moment I saw Zhang San,

807
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:39,560
I got scared.

808
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,630
I didn't dare kill him directly.

809
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:42,880
So I thought

810
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:44,240
I'd sound him out first

811
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,320
and figure out

812
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,010
what exactly he did to offend Hongyao.

813
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:47,160
[Zhang's Mutton Soup]

814
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:47,920
Take care.

815
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:48,490
Alright.

816
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:50,440
San!

817
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,130
I'm here to help.

818
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:54,960
You brat, whose house

819
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,320
have you been sleeping comfortably in
this time?

820
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,080
No one's.

821
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,960
Lately I've had nowhere to sleep

822
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,020
and nothing to eat.

823
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,000
San,

824
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,600
do you need any help here?

825
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,310
Wait.

826
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:03,440
San?

827
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,350
[Zhang's Mutton Soup]

828
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,680
Who are you to call me San?

829
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,730
You should call me Mr. San!

830
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,600
You're carrying a knife?

831
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,660
You've grown bold?

832
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,000
Are you done being a house-squatter

833
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,270
and now turning into an assassin?

834
00:33:20,270 --> 00:33:21,240
N-no...

835
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,100
Then why are you carrying a knife?

836
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
If you're an assassin,

837
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,590
someone must have paid you a deposit.

838
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,390
Let me see how much they gave you.

839
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:32,690
A silver ingot?

840
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,610
You really are an assassin now?

841
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,640
H-how would I have the guts,

842
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,330
Mr. San?

843
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,480
Don't... don't you know me?

844
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,580
Where did the money come from?

845
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,110
Speak!

846
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,610
I'll kill you if you don't tell me!

847
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,290
I didn't dare tell Zhang San

848
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,190
that Hongyao sent me to kill him,

849
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,350
so I could only say

850
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,110
I borrowed it
while staying at Hongyao's house.

851
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:50,880
Borrowed?

852
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:54,180
We house-squatters sometimes steal things

853
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,510
under special circumstances.

854
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,550
But we don't call it stealing.

855
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:57,310
We call it borrowing,

856
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,920
which means that if we ever become
successful one day,

857
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,880
we'll return to stay

858
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,880
and sneak it back.

859
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,650
But as far as I know,

860
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,350
no one has ever returned anything,

861
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,750
because no one has ever become successful.

862
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,670
What about the silver?

863
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,760
He took it.

864
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,550
He actually grabbed my silver.

865
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,810
It was so humiliating.

866
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,480
At that moment,
I really wanted to kill him.

867
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,810
But he took my knife too.

868
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,590
So I had no choice
but to follow him secretly.

869
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,449
Then I found out

870
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,449
he went to Hongyao's house.

871
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,000
He must have gone there to steal silver.

872
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,070
I know him too well.

873
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,030
At that time, I thought,

874
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,320
I definitely couldn't beat him,

875
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,580
but I could ambush him.

876
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,000
I planned to wait until he came out,

877
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,130
catch him off guard,

878
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,590
and kill him with a stone.

879
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,260
Then I could keep

880
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,420
the silver he stole

881
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:00,280
and go to Hongyao

882
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,880
to get the other silver ingot.

883
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,400
That way

884
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,930
I, Jiang, would be rich

885
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:04,710
and never have to be

886
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,110
a house-squatter again.

887
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,670
However,

888
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,780
before Zhang San came out,

889
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,190
I saw...

890
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,330
What did you see?

891
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,650
I saw Secretary Meng come back.

892
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,000
Meng Buyi?

893
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:18,800
You know him?

894
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:19,600
Of course.

895
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,030
As house-squatters,

896
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:21,800
we always have to figure out

897
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,000
who the homeowner is.

898
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:28,390
Meng Buyi went home last night?

899
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,110
Yes, he did.

900
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,160
But he was acting quite strange.

901
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:34,760
Strange how?

902
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,320
What happened next?

903
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:04,480
Later,

904
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,110
I heard someone knocking on the door.

905
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,550
Not long after that,

906
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,020
Meng Buyi came out.

907
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,480
He was carrying a roll of paper.

908
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,210
He climbed over the wall again?

909
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,190
No.

910
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,560
He came out through the door.

911
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,150
And then

912
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,670
something even stranger happened.

913
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:22,480
But honestly,

914
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,420
I shouldn't tell you this.

915
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,030
After all, Hongyao was the first person

916
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:27,280
who ever gave me a silver ingot.

917
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,150
If you hide anything...

918
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,150
I dare not!

919
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,960
At this point,

920
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,210
I can only let Hongyao down. Wait.

921
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,670
Wait.

922
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:51,960
Did you say that when Meng Buyi left,

923
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:55,960
he didn't close his door completely

924
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,610
and left a small gap?

925
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,120
And Hongyao didn't come out to close it?

926
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,480
No.

927
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,190
I hesitated then.

928
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,030
Was that bastard Zhang San

929
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,360
not there to steal?

930
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,190
Could he actually be Hongyao's lover?

931
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,230
That would really be a flower

932
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,230
stuck in cow dung.

933
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,740
Zhang San's character

934
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,130
is even worse than mine.

935
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,510
You're getting off track.

936
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:19,360
Just tell us what you saw.

937
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,120
Right, right. Seeing is believing.

938
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:25,510
About 30 minutes later...

939
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,810
Let's go.

940
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,110
He was lying on the ground?

941
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,230
Was he injured?

942
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:02,760
No.

943
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:05,630
Did you see it clearly
from outside the window?

944
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,920
I may have premature white hair,

945
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,670
but my eyesight is perfectly fine.

946
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,470
He really had no injuries on him.

947
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,630
Bold Jiang!

948
00:38:12,110 --> 00:38:12,920
To take back the silver ingot

949
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:13,920
Hongyao gave you,

950
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,270
you rushed into the house

951
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,270
and killed Zhang San with scissors!

952
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,070
No, no!

953
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,070
You're still trying to deny it?

954
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,470
Do you want to experience

955
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,150
Yongzhou Prefecture Office's
severe punishment?

956
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:23,960
Sir,

957
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,840
you look even younger than me.

958
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,000
Why are you so impatient?

959
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,400
You...

960
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:28,150
Can't you just

961
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,410
let me finish talking?

962
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,630
As you said,

963
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,250
I did have that thought.

964
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,420
But before I could enter the house...

965
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,320
Hongyao?

966
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,710
It was Hongyao?

967
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,670
Jiang,

968
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,320
do you know this is

969
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,150
the West Hall
of Yongzhou Prefecture Office?

970
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,800
Lying here is considered

971
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,260
as serious a crime as murder and plunder.

972
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,550
I dare not hide anything!

973
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,810
I'm telling the truth.

974
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:37,880
I swear on my honor

975
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:38,960
as a house-squatter.

976
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,030
Your honor as a house-squatter

977
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:40,960
is worthless.

978
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:43,320
If I discover during the investigation

979
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,140
that you've concealed anything

980
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:47,430
or deliberately fabricated anything,

981
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,190
your punishment will be increased.

982
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:50,990
Take him down!

983
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:51,940
-Yes.
-Yes.

984
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:56,440
Jia.

985
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:57,150
Yes?

986
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,480
Hurry up and invite Miss Xijun

987
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,670
to Qinglong District.

988
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:02,070
Have her make a portrait
of Hongyao based on

989
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:03,360
the descriptions of the district head
and the neighbors.

990
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:03,800
Yes.

991
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,230
Secretary Meng returned home last night,

992
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,480
yet he deliberately hid it.

993
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,710
There must be something suspicious.

994
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,440
Official Lu,

995
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,510
what should we do?

996
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,440
Ask Su Wuming.

997
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:21,830
Mr. Su, what should we do?

998
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,360
Meng Buyi is indeed suspicious.

999
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,120
But we shouldn't alert him.

1000
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,960
Here's what we'll do.

1001
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,110
Keep watch on him in secret.

1002
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,730
Hu Shentong!

1003
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,400
Sirs,

1004
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,030
has anyone seen Hu Shentong?

1005
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,490
Didn't he take your job?

1006
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,230
He left early to kill.

1007
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,390
You remember me?

1008
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,310
Of course.

1009
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:12,720
I can remember

1010
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,760
everyone who hires Assassin Hu.

1011
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,580
What's wrong?

1012
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,510
You want to back out?

1013
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,510
You want to take back your deposit?

1014
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:17,960
No.

1015
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,450
Dream on.

1016
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,720
Deposits are non-refundable.

1017
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,510
That's the rule in Assassin Street.

1018
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:23,710
I'm not here to get my money back.

1019
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,280
I...

1020
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,290
I have another job.

1021
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,630
Who wants to take it?

1022
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,630
Who's the target?

1023
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,110
It's not a kill job this time.

1024
00:41:31,110 --> 00:41:31,630
I...

1025
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,280
want you to find someone.

1026
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,290
Find someone?

1027
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:36,030
And you came to Assassin Street for that?

1028
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,190
Are you messing with us?

1029
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,860
You're insulting us assassins!

1030
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:39,320
Sir, sir.

1031
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,050
-I'll kill you!
-Don't get me wrong.

1032
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:41,670
Don't get me wrong.

1033
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,710
Let me put it this way—

1034
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,230
say

1035
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,840
I want to kill my enemy,

1036
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,710
but I don't know

1037
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,360
where he is right now. What...

1038
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:48,350
What should I do?

1039
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,090
Of course, you should find him first,

1040
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,970
then kill him.

1041
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:53,620
Exactly!

1042
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:54,110
So...

1043
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:55,880
I just want you to

1044
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,480
do the first step.

1045
00:41:58,150 --> 00:41:58,880
How is that

1046
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,190
messing with you?

1047
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,620
Who do you want to find?

1048
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,310
I can't tell you yet.

1049
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:06,230
For just the first step,

1050
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,600
how much...

1051
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,930
would you charge me?

1052
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,670
At least half.

1053
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,030
Come on,

1054
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:14,110
half isn't reasonable.

1055
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,230
Finding someone should be cheaper
than killing them.

1056
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,320
I think at most...

1057
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:19,280
20 percent.

1058
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:20,840
No way.

1059
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:22,560
What about 25 percent?

1060
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,230
I can't go any higher. And...

1061
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,960
it should be based on the price

1062
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,000
Hu Shentong and I agreed on.

1063
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,860
How about that?

1064
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:28,960
I...

1065
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,900
-Are you messing with us?
-No, no, no.

1066
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:33,490
I'll kill you!

1067
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:39,290
Who are you?

1068
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,720
Mind your own business!

1069
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,370
Just a boy?

1070
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,440
Move!

1071
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,030
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

1072
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,710
I'm a captain
of Yongzhou Prefecture Office,

1073
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,480
Xue Huan!

1074
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:51,820
He's...

1075
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,440
He's an official.

1076
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,590
Let's go.

1077
00:42:54,590 --> 00:42:55,160
Let's go.

1078
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:56,550
Let's go.

1079
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,120
Let me borrow this.
