To Chang'an]

[Episode 20]

3
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,759
Sir, one more serving.

4
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,560
Okay, coming right up.

5
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:47,990
Scholar,

6
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:48,920
stop reading.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,930
I'm really overwhelmed with work.

8
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,030
It would be nice
if you could help serve customers.

9
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:57,789
Yingtao,

10
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,170
I'll leave the Sushan Shop to you for now.

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,710
Hurry up, you over there!

12
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,710
Fei, come with me.

13
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,710
What for?

14
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,840
Where is he?

15
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,360
Fei!

16
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,960
I knocked him out in drinking, huh?

17
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,410
How...

18
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,030
How dare he claim to have never been
drunk in the Tang Empire?

19
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,890
What a bragger!

20
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,360
I am the real unmatched
drinking champion in Chang'an.

21
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,400
Seven years ago,

22
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,670
right before the imperial exam,

23
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:25,079
my classmates and I

24
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,540
went to Pingkang District

25
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,400
for a few drinks to unwind a bit.

26
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,030
We met Hongyao

27
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:00,890
on the same day.

28
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,800
But Hongyao didn't even

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,150
spare him a single glance.

30
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,240
Words like "charismatic"

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,440
or "handsome" simply

32
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,930
had nothing to do with him.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,310
Before coming to Chang'an for the exam,

34
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,310
he was just a country snake catcher.

35
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:11,710
You...

36
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,470
He was poor and extremely stingy.

37
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,030
Who would fall for someone like you?

38
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,280
That being the case,

39
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,850
seven years ago, you and Hongyao were...

40
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:20,000
An inseparable

41
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,100
perfect match.

42
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,000
That's why I was envied

43
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,400
by my classmates so much.

44
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,280
Naturally, he was also jealous of me.

45
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,680
You messed with and ditched her.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,810
You failed Hongyao!

47
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,470
I didn't take Hongyao with me,

48
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,800
but that was because...

49
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,960
Before the selection exam
of the Ministry of Personnel,

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,360
I sent the chief examiner

51
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,280
some local specialties.

52
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,960
I later learned that it's common practice.

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,120
But back then, I felt

54
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,150
that I had done something shameful

55
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,750
and feared it might
put my career in danger.

56
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,590
So I left overnight as soon as I

57
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,710
received my appointment.

58
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,560
I couldn't take Hongyao

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,690
with me as my family.

60
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,079
I do regret it somewhat.

61
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,079
I was young then, and didn't know

62
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:54,110
how to cherish what I had.

63
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,280
Meng Buyi,

64
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,400
how did Hongyao

65
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,880
end up marrying you?

66
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,760
Don't do this.

67
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,520
Shame on you, Meng Buyi!

68
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
You used her vulnerability

69
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,120
to win Hongyao's heart!

70
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,850
Yan Junxian,

71
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,720
Hongyao almost
committed suicide because of you.

72
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,240
I don't think it's appropriate

73
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
for you to say so.

74
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,780
Not long after,

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,680
I got a position
in the Ministry of Revenue.

76
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,630
With a glimmer of hope,

77
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,890
I went to find Hongyao.

78
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:39,870
I thought,

79
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:41,920
even if she rejected me,

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,050
it wouldn't matter.

81
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,730
If in this life,

82
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,190
I couldn't even express my true feelings,

83
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,000
that would be my greatest regret.

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,830
Unexpectedly,

85
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,760
Hongyao said yes

86
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,070
and agreed

87
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,510
to marry me.

88
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,830
Fei.

89
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,810
Come check this out.

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,890
This is...

91
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,560
A snake scale?

92
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
A snake scale.

93
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,860
Zhang San

94
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,490
must have been strangled by a snake first,

95
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,160
then stabbed with scissors.

96
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,480
And it's even purple.

97
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,430
When my mentor, Master Di,

98
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,480
taught me autopsy techniques,

99
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,230
he specifically told me how to tell apart

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,070
animals with fur, feathers, scales,

101
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,720
shells, and those with nothing.

102
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,040
But whether there are actually

103
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,190
purple snakes,

104
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,950
I'm a bit unsure at the moment.

105
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,460
[Strange Tales from the Western Capital
By Meng Buyi]

106
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,430
Let me finish reading this part,

107
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,159
and I might find the answer.

108
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,930
Finish reading?

109
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,880
Hey,

110
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,160
can you go somewhere else

111
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,360
to read strange tales?

112
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,690
This place is so gloomy.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,730
Doesn't it give you the creeps?

114
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,150
Hongyao was a pipa player

115
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,950
and spent years in entertainment houses.

116
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,360
She had an open, energetic personality

117
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,760
and loved lively places.

118
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
While I am the quiet type.

119
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,830
So, within two years of our marriage,

120
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,960
we began to quarrel.

121
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,360
All these years,

122
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,630
I've been writing

123
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,430
strange tales and supernatural stories

124
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,950
about ghosts and monsters,

125
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,950
with hardly a hint of romance.

126
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,090
So the conflicts between us

127
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,130
only got worse.

128
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,040
Hongyao was from Youzhou.

129
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,190
After she came to Chang'an,

130
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,610
she went straight to Pingkang District.

131
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,210
She was actually unfamiliar
with the capital.

132
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:52,520
She once asked me
to show her around Chang'an.

133
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,680
But I was afraid of the high expense,

134
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,460
so I turned her down
with the excuse of being busy

135
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,090
with work.

136
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,710
Now that I think about it,

137
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,510
I really shouldn't have done that.

138
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,040
You really shouldn't have!

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,830
For a while,

140
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,830
whenever we had a fight,

141
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,510
she would go
to the small square in the district

142
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,510
to play the pipa

143
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:11,810
for the dancers.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,830
As time went by,

145
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:13,960
it became her habit.

146
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:14,980
I was

147
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,650
so worried about this.

148
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,720
Although the dancers were

149
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,780
mostly women,

150
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,870
the spectators were mainly men.

151
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,930
So I often dreamed that she...

152
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,870
So I felt restless

153
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,390
and couldn't even fall asleep.

154
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,510
So you couldn't sleep well

155
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,480
because you suspected Hongyao?

156
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,430
Had I known, I wouldn't have

157
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,090
given you any prescriptions.

158
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,030
Just tell the facts

159
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,780
and don't slander each other.

160
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,650
So was I wrong to be suspicious?

161
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,280
After his return to Chang'an,

162
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,610
he often used the excuse

163
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,750
of visiting his classmate
to drop by my house.

164
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,040
That was all for Hongyao!

165
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,750
Hongyao returned to my embrace

166
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,190
because you kept hiding the difference

167
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,630
between an official and a clerk,

168
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:55,230
which really irritated her.

169
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,800
She returned to where?

170
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,360
Say that again.

171
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,210
Returned to your "embrace"!

172
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,470
I-I said

173
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,600
she returned to my embrace,

174
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,950
and it's just a figure of speech.

175
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,310
It never happened, actually.

176
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,920
I visited his place last night,

177
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,510
and it was also because Hongyao begged me

178
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,310
to find a way to help

179
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,870
this good-for-nothing man of hers

180
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,360
get promoted from clerk to official.

181
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,920
Who would believe that?

182
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,300
For the thing you said,

183
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,160
was it necessary for you
to take off your shoes and get into bed?

184
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,560
Yes,

185
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,920
Hongyao and I opened up to each other,

186
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,190
and feelings prevailed.

187
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,390
I did take off my boots

188
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,360
and got into bed.

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,780
Hongyao,

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,200
let's leave Chang'an

191
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,620
and go somewhere far away,

192
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,560
somewhere no one

193
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
knows who we are.

194
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,560
How is that possible?

195
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,909
You'll give up your position?

196
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,480
For you,

197
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,880
I'm willing to do so.

198
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:39,610
What...

199
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,780
Isn't Meng Buyi on night duty?

200
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,480
Yes.

201
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,860
Why did he suddenly come back?

202
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,320
Come on, get inside quickly.

203
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:48,890
Hurry up.

204
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,150
So you were hiding under the bed.

205
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,000
If I had known then,

206
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,320
I should have dragged you out!

207
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,980
The one who came in wasn't you.

208
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,470
Was it Zhang San, the mutton soup seller
from Qinglong District?

209
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,910
I did hear Hongyao call him

210
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:02,600
Zhang San.

211
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,440
Under the bed at that time,

212
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,370
I found that I had

213
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,830
forgotten to hide my boots well.

214
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,670
Why is it you?

215
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,020
What? You didn't expect this?

216
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,360
Have you made an appointment
with another lover?

217
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,270
Zhang San,

218
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,140
you scoundrel, get out!

219
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,400
W-What are you doing?

220
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,340
What am I doing?

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,610
What do you think I'm doing?

222
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,840
D-Don't come any closer.

223
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Or I'll scream for help.

224
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,030
Go ahead and scream.

225
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,440
It's been quite a while

226
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,910
since I heard you scream last time.

227
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,960
Back in the day,

228
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,820
when I was rich,

229
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,000
I also kept you as my lover,

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,440
the top courtesan of Pingkang District.

231
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,770
I'm a married woman now,

232
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:39,910
not who I used to be.

233
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,390
I-If you don't leave,

234
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,720
I'll call the officers to catch you!

235
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,380
Call the officers to catch me?

236
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,270
Don't think I'm trying
to make out with you.

237
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,120
Let me get to the point.

238
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,180
Where's the money?

239
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,240
My husband is just a minor clerk
in the Ministry of Revenue.

240
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,840
We don't have any money left.

241
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,120
You know I'm not gullible.

242
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:56,790
If you don't tell me

243
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,670
where your money is,

244
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,200
I'll strangle you to death!

245
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,320
Isn't your husband

246
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,000
on night duty at the county office?

247
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,630
As beautiful as I am, my husband

248
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,510
can't rest assured leaving me alone.

249
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,030
He returns to check on me
at a fixed time every night.

250
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,630
Otherwise, how would I

251
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,230
have opened the door for you?

252
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,170
W-What are you going to do?

253
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,410
I'll kill him.

254
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,630
No, you can't.

255
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,390
My husband is a Secretary
in the Ministry of Revenue.

256
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:25,330
If you kill him,

257
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:26,670
you'll lose your life as well,

258
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,600
unable to get away with it anymore.

259
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,530
I'll hide... I'll go hide myself.

260
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,020
No, not there!

261
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,980
Here, here.

262
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,280
Come, get in.

263
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,450
Keep quiet about it.

264
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
Or I'll kill both of you!

265
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,500
Okay.

266
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,810
The next one who came in was you.

267
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,470
After Meng Buyi left,

268
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,080
I heard clangs

269
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,600
from that cabinet

270
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,390
and Zhang San's continuous

271
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,380
low groans.

272
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,640
It was so terrifying

273
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,430
that I was scared, too.

274
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,350
Honey,

275
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,670
come out quickly.

276
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,780
Shoes, your shoes.

277
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:26,420
Hurry.

278
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,700
Go quickly.

279
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,740
As I expected!

280
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,550
Yan Junxian confessed!

281
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,390
He was the one

282
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:35,680
who took Hongyao away!

283
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,360
Tell me

284
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,090
where you've hidden my wife!

285
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,660
-Give my wife back!
-Stop!

286
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,660
Meng Buyi!

287
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,420
You...

288
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,650
I didn't take Hongyao away.

289
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,570
Last night,

290
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,270
she walked me

291
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:47,510
to the small square in Qinglong District

292
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,750
and told me to go first,

293
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,080
and then she went back herself!

294
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,740
After that,

295
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,510
you've never seen Hongyao again?

296
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:53,200
No!

297
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,150
I, Yan Junxian, am an official
of the court.

298
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:56,960
I've already admitted

299
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,840
such a shameful thing.

300
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,100
What else would I hide?

301
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,750
What do you think?

302
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,350
This case is quite interesting.

303
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,750
What's clear stands out.

304
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,350
What's murky is buried deep.

305
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,750
"What's clear stands out.

306
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,020
What's murky is buried deep."

307
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,750
Well said.

308
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,630
Neither Yan Junxian

309
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,980
nor Meng Buyi is simple.

310
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,530
They seem to have come clean,

311
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,780
yet they are still hiding something.

312
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,030
You're right,

313
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,600
I have the same thoughts.

314
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,630
Based on the current testimonies,

315
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,240
there's no substantial evidence
against either of them.

316
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,770
We had to let them go for now.

317
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,630
Thankfully, you drew

318
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:45,630
Hongyao's portrait.

319
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,360
I've ordered

320
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,910
a hundred copies to be made

321
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,240
and distributed
to all night shift officers in the city

322
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,790
-to search for her in full force.
-Lu Lingfeng!

323
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:52,600
I got it!

324
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:53,880
I've figured it out!

325
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,910
It was a snake.

326
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,390
Here's my preliminary conclusion.

327
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,390
There was a purple snake

328
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,080
that attacked Zhang San

329
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,520
in that wardrobe

330
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,000
and coiled around his neck,

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,810
causing him to lose consciousness

332
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,270
and fall out of the wardrobe.

333
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:13,600
Thus,

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,630
the blade

335
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,670
that Zhang San held had no blood on it

336
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:19,670
and just fell beside him.

337
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:23,030
Wuming, you're a genius.

338
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,530
It matches perfectly

339
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:25,690
with Yan Junxian's testimony.

340
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,020
I heard Hongyao call him

341
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,010
Zhang San.

342
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,150
According to Yan Junxian's words,

343
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,200
Zhang San seemed

344
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,060
to be fighting

345
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,410
a snake in the wardrobe.

346
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:35,390
But a purple snake?

347
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,320
I've never heard
of such a thing in my life.

348
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,520
But this book of strange tales mentions

349
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,000
that there's an island

350
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,630
called Dongyi.

351
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,670
Though it's far across the sea,

352
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,670
the island rulers throughout generations

353
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,870
have all claimed
to be scions of Emperor Shun.

354
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,520
The island abounds
with strange rocks and unusual trees,

355
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,450
and is home to all sorts of animals.

356
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,870
Most of the islanders

357
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,790
have short hair
and tattoos on their bodies,

358
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:58,750
mastering mysterious sorceries.

359
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,270
When the Tang Dynasty was just founded,

360
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,400
during the Wude era,

361
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,960
the Ruler of Dongyi Island
traveled for months

362
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,000
to reach Chang'an.

363
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,790
But he felt he wasn't properly received

364
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,390
by the Court of State Ceremonials.

365
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,890
So he held a grudge

366
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,350
and dumped all the specialties he brought

367
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,090
into the Qu River.

368
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,630
Among them, there was

369
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,880
an extremely precious medicinal herb

370
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,290
called Perfect Purple.

371
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,440
A medicinal herb?

372
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:23,480
What does it have to do with snakes?

373
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,870
It's a snake gallbladder.

374
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,030
This Perfect Purple is

375
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,090
both the name of an herb

376
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,640
and the name of a snake.

377
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,600
It's priceless

378
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:35,030
because the gallbladder must be taken out
while the snake is alive.

379
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:37,230
It can not only detoxify and heal sores.

380
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,490
Most importantly,

381
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,240
it's said to be able to bring

382
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,750
dead people back to life!

383
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,600
So,

384
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,240
what they dumped into the Qu River were

385
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
all live snakes?

386
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,280
That's right.

387
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,530
Legend has it

388
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,000
that these snakes
live extremely long lives.

389
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,810
Each one

390
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,190
can live for over 60 years.

391
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,510
What's more amazing about it is

392
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:57,390
that when the snake hits 60,

393
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:00,780
its tongue goes from red to purple.

394
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,320
And only at this time,

395
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,550
the gallbladder extracted,

396
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,360
while it's alive, is most valuable.

397
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,550
I remember now.

398
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,080
It's definitely not just a legend.

399
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,200
My old mentor

400
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,870
once used Perfect Purple

401
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,180
to bring someone back to life

402
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,600
from the brink of death.

403
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:15,950
Wait a moment.

404
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,070
I remember Yan Junxian also said...

405
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,270
Before coming to Chang'an for the exam,

406
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,270
he was just a country snake catcher.

407
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:23,880
You...

408
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,260
[Fair & Square]

409
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,630
It seems that I need to go

410
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,360
visit the Meng Residence again.

411
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,390
I need to confirm

412
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,870
if Zhang San's death was

413
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,100
directly related

414
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,910
to this Perfect Purple.

415
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,330
But Meng Buyi is

416
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,540
a hard nut to crack.

417
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,320
Even if Zhang San was

418
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,960
truly strangled to death by a snake,

419
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:41,840
he would never admit

420
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,120
it had anything to do with him.

421
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,670
After all, the Qinglong District is
close to the Qu River.

422
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,340
He would say

423
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,910
the snake crawled
into his house on its own.

424
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,280
That's right.

425
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,670
Since Perfect Purple really exists,

426
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,630
the most expensive pharmacies in Chang'an

427
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,830
must have some leads.

428
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,410
After all, these pharmacy owners are

429
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,880
the wealthiest people.

430
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,720
For something like this,

431
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,440
a medicine that can
bring people back to life,

432
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,640
someone will buy it no matter the price.

433
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,320
Also,

434
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,480
Yan Junxian is
a deputy chief imperial physician.

435
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,270
Perhaps

436
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:13,200
the Perfect Purple came
from the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

437
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,520
Then we should

438
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,120
split up.

439
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:18,400
Have you ever seen a purple snake?

440
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,530
-No.
-No, I haven't.

441
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,440
A purple snake?

442
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,170
It's said every spring,

443
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:25,270
for His Majesty's safety
during his spring outings,

444
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,910
the Palace Secretariat would clear

445
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,480
all snakes along the Qu River.

446
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,360
The ones caught are

447
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,270
sometimes sent to the herb gardens nearby.

448
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:33,200
I only became the deputy chief
imperial physician this year

449
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,440
and started managing this herb garden.

450
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,600
Shortly after I assumed the post,

451
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,240
they brought here a purple snake,

452
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,120
saying it had medicinal properties.

453
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
But I truly didn't know how to use it.

454
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,270
Where is the snake now?

455
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,550
No one in the herb garden
knew how to keep it.

456
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,670
It wouldn't eat anything we fed it.

457
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,120
After some time, it disappeared.

458
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,750
I guess it burrowed into the ground

459
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,480
and escaped.

460
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,970
Come with me.

461
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,140
Follow me this way.

462
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,030
Please.

463
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,380
Official Lu,

464
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,850
you still suspect I abducted Hongyao?

465
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:04,220
I didn't hide Hongyao!

466
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,510
What's the point of searching

467
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,970
for her in the herb garden?

468
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,109
They're not looking for a person,

469
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:10,440
but for a snake.

470
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:13,010
Has that escaped Perfect Purple

471
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,170
ever hurt anyone?

472
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,550
No.

473
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,710
This place is not far from the Qu River.

474
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,880
Wild flowers and trees abound there.

475
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,569
The snake probably crawled
back to the Qu River.

476
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,569
How long has the snake been missing?

477
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,750
Two months.

478
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,000
I remember when the snake disappeared,

479
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,310
Meng Buyi happened to visit me.

480
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,350
I was prescribing

481
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:31,100
sleep-inducing herbs for him.

482
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,160
Mr. Yan, did you study medicine

483
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,400
through a family tradition?

484
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,960
No.

485
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,400
Then did you learn from a medical master?

486
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,250
No.

487
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,760
It was just fate.

488
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,240
The county I governed these years is known

489
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,770
for producing Gastrodia.

490
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,590
It's offered to the court every year.

491
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,480
Over time,

492
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,320
I developed

493
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,750
some knowledge of herbs.

494
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,240
After the new Emperor ascended the throne,

495
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,570
he particularly valued Gastrodia.

496
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:56,900
So I had the opportunity

497
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,200
to become the deputy chief physician

498
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,800
and herb garden supervisor.

499
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,160
Though it's the eighth rank,

500
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,830
it's treated as the fifth rank.

501
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,400
I can wear a light crimson robe

502
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
and was granted
a silver fish-pattern pouch.

503
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,830
This made Meng Buyi,

504
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,680
that petty clerk, even more jealous,

505
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,540
so he framed me.

506
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,540
Let me say this again.

507
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,200
Last night,

508
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,130
I did leave together with Hongyao.

509
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:15,880
But after she walked me

510
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,070
to the small square in Qinglong District,

511
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,130
she just went back.

512
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,810
Her disappearance
has nothing to do with me.

513
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:25,880
If you continue

514
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,020
to harass me like this,

515
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,790
when I have an audience with His Majesty,

516
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,720
I will certainly file a complaint.

517
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,170
Mr. Yan, are you threatening us?

518
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,680
When you were young,
you studied with His Majesty.

519
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,610
You spent day and night together.

520
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,000
You know His Majesty best.

521
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,570
Would he fail
to distinguish right from wrong

522
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:41,500
and believe others' accusations?

523
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:49,280
Mr. Yan,

524
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:50,570
my men

525
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,270
will search the herb garden thoroughly.

526
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,920
That snake could hurt people.

527
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,590
It's also

528
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,070
for the sake of your safety.

529
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:56,670
Of course,

530
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,880
there are so many buildings
in your herb garden.

531
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,750
If someone is hiding in a secret spot

532
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,030
and you haven't discovered it,

533
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,700
they will help you find her.

534
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,070
Goodbye.

535
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,730
Take care, Official Lu.

536
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,510
Fei,

537
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:18,320
hurry up,

538
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,320
bring the candle over here.

539
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,970
Hold it higher.

540
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,620
This is a snake scale.

541
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,900
We didn't notice it

542
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,710
during the last inspection.

543
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:49,760
Su Wuming.

544
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,090
I think there's more than just scales.

545
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,070
Don't panic.

546
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,440
This snake isn't venomous,

547
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,570
and it doesn't bite.

548
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,960
It just likes to coil around things.

549
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,390
You...

550
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,400
Do not struggle against it.

551
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,860
The more you resist, the tighter it wraps.

552
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,000
Fei,

553
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,590
help me!

554
00:20:33,510 --> 00:20:36,250
This snake must fear mugwort.

555
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:45,010
Here comes the mugwort.

556
00:20:57,910 --> 00:20:59,480
The snake does fear mugwort,

557
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,540
but the smoke makes it more agitated.

558
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,270
Pacify it. pacify it.

559
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,240
Pacify...

560
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:08,200
Agarwood!

561
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,000
Mugwort is too strong.

562
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,030
The opposite of that is

563
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,540
gentle agarwood.

564
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,280
This snake must like agarwood.

565
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,860

00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,670
messing with that woman.

755
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,590
Carry him to the Gastrodia field
and bury him.

756
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,480
There's already

757
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,410
a hole dug there.

758
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,470
What are you waiting for?

759
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,750
You useless Moorhen!

760
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,270
Do you want to ruin

761
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,110
the future I've

762
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:53,110
arranged for you?

763
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:53,720
Hurry up!

764
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,160
A high nose bridge

765
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:30,160
and a fair,

766
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:30,980
clean face.

767
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,770
No need to continue.

768
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:43,790
It's Meng Buyi.

769
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:47,720
50,000 coins.

770
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,710
I won't sell for less.

771
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,590
Meng Buyi?

772
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,940
Su Wuming,

773
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,160
what happened to you?

774
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,510
Wuming, are you alright?

775
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:07,970
He...

776
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,760
Don't even ask.

777
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:12,540
I just had a brush with death.

778
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,790
That snake

779
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,620
almost strangled me to death.

780
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,500
By the way,

781
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:17,870
I found

782
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:20,160
a Perfect Purple in the room.

783
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,400
It must be the one that strangled

784
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,480
Zhang San to death.

785
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,240
The murderer is Meng Buyi.

786
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,070
He once sold this snake to a pharmacy.

787
00:30:28,070 --> 00:30:29,120
That's wrong.

788
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,880
If we're talking about the direct killer,

789
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,590
it could only be that snake.

790
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,010
Am I right, Official Lu?

791
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,070
Now we need to figure out

792
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,310
if the snake strangling Zhang San was

793
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,290
premeditated by Meng Buyi or not.

794
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,560
There's another possibility.

795
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,270
This Perfect Purple

796
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,680
might not have been kept

797
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,400
in the house for Zhang San.

798
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:50,690
After all,

799
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,610
Yan Junxian also visited last night.

800
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,440
Although I don't know much about the case,

801
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,750
that does make some sense.

802
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:04,550
It's just that Meng Buyi is not home yet.

803
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,610
Perhaps he's still on night duty

804
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,120
at the Ministry of Revenue.

805
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,590
[Ming Shi's Private Estate]

806
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,880
You finally came.

807
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,030
I'm here to tell you

808
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,730
to stay away from Yan Junxian.

809
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,830
Seven years ago,

810
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,200
it was you who separated

811
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,240
me and Yan, right?

812
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,750
Back then, I often hid in the corner.

813
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:42,810
You actually remember me?

814
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,040
Of course I do.

815
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:55,640
Master,

816
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,570
it's time to study.

817
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,850
I'm fully prepared.

818
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,310
The imperial exam is approaching.

819
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,850
Shouldn't you be hitting the books?

820
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,920
Have you forgotten

821
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,820
the grand ambition you pledged in Lingnan?

822
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,510
I should go.

823
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,500
I didn't let Yan Junxian get close to you

824
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,200
because I feared he would
indulge in romance

825
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,310
and fail to win the Metropolitan Graduate.

826
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,000
Was I wrong?

827
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:28,750
After being appointed as an official,

828
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:30,950
he abandoned me without saying goodbye.

829
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,200
Was that also your idea?

830
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:32,590
Yes,

831
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,720
so what?

832
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,750
You're just a servant.

833
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,000
Why are you meddling

834
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,460
in your master's affairs?

835
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,320
It's none of your business.

836
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,070
Actually, what confuses me most is

837
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,600
why your master

838
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,270
would listen

839
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,160
to a mere servant like you.

840
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:56,990
Don't ask about that.

841
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,790
It's not good for you.

842
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,110
How so?

843
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:03,640
Your life could be at stake.

844
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,880
What if I insist on asking?

845
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,050
Take your hands off.

846
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,980
I came here to drive you away.

847
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,280
Or I'll kill you.

848
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,800
Go ahead.

849
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,320
I'm willing to be killed by you.

850
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:40,050
You were in the shadows all along,

851
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,110
but you kept watching me.

852
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,880
Yan Junxian and I

853
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,280
seemed to be in love with each other.

854
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,360
But who would know

855
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,880
that deep down inside,

856
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,739
I actually fell for someone else.

857
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
You should leave.

858
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,980
If you keep this up,

859
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,280
it will ruin Yan Junxian's career.

860
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,340
Don't bring him up.

861
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,120
Do you still have no idea

862
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,670
who I truly love?

863
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,760
The first time I met you,

864
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,250
I just deeply fell in love with you.

865
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,620
At that time,

866
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,660
I only thought you were

867
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,130
a way too beautiful woman.

868
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,820
You would stand in Yan Junxian's way.

869
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,350
Back then,

870
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,360
I only thought you were

871
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,290
so dull

872
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,450
that you couldn't read my heart at all.

873
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,770
I'm not young anymore.

874
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,740
Matters of love belong

875
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,340
to talented scholars and beautiful ladies,

876
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,500
but not to me.

877
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,760
You lied so calmly.

878
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,550
You must have been

879
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,360
through ups and downs.

880
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:41,510
Talented scholars and beautiful ladies...

881
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:43,840
That's just a fairy tale to fool children.

882
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,030
Since I married Meng Buyi years ago,

883
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,830
I've never had true love for him.

884
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,650
I've been thinking only of you.

885
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:56,920
I guess

886
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,700
your past must be extraordinary.

887
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:01,930
Am I right?

888
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,060
What exactly do you know?

889
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,950
Seven years ago, when we first met,

890
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,670
before I left home,

891
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,800
I did the fortune-telling for myself.

892
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,930
The divination said

893
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,230
that I would meet

894
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,080
my life-long true love that day.

895
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,450
The moment our eyes met,

896
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,880
I knew that person was you.

897
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,710
But I didn't expect...

898
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,160
Why didn't you come back
to see me even once?

899
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,170
Do you regret it?

900
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,710
Regret?

901
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,070
I regret that when I first

902
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:05,110
laid eyes on you,

903
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,430
I was still hiding in the corner.

904
00:38:07,630 --> 00:38:09,960
Back then, I didn't allow Yan Junxian
to approach you.

905
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,280
I thought it was because

906
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,030
I feared he would be lost in romance,

907
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,230
and it would ruin the future

908
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,520
I had planned for him.

909
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:17,100
But now I think about it,

910
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,710
I already considered you mine.

911
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,960
When you and Yan Junxian

912
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,960
served in office in that remote county,

913
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,060
did you ever dream of me?

914
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:33,070
I actually did.

915
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,720
I dreamed that you

916
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,100
blamed me for breaking up a loving couple

917
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,670
and wanted to kill me.

918
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,590
That was because

919
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,360
I dreamed of you every day.

920
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,030
Each dream brought more hatred,

921
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,800
until the resentment gathered

922
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:56,280
and finally reached you
thousands of miles away.

923
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,470
Hongyao,

924
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:01,880
you made me change

925
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,180
all my previous thoughts in a single day.

926
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,840
I painstakingly nurtured Yan Junxian

927
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,110
and planned to use him to help me

928
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,000
become the power
behind the throne in Chang'an.

929
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,990
For this goal,

930
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,680
I spent a fortune

931
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,570
and invested ten years of my life.

932
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,360
But now,

933
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,510
I can give it all up.

934
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,700
I want to take you away.

935
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,480
I've long been tired

936
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,940
of suffering in Chang'an.

937
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,150
Then I'll take you back to Lingnan.

938
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,880
It's beautiful there
with mountains and rivers.

939
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,930
My mansion is

940
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,490
the largest and finest

941
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,590
in that area.

942
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:29,980
My private villa is

943
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,280
way larger than the herb garden

944
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,340
of the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

945
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,580
If I go back with you,

946
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,210
would you make me the mistress

947
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,670
of that mansion and villa?

948
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,840
Of course.

949
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:47,230
I mean

950
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:49,760
the real mistress.

951
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,630
I, Ming Shi,

952
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,980
have never married anyone in my life.

953
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,360
After returning to Lingnan,

954
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,560
I will hold a grand wedding to marry you.

955
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,190
Aren't you afraid

956
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,600
that I might fall for another man

957
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,010
and betray you?

958
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,110
If I revealed my former identity,

959
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:14,550
I'm afraid

960
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,510
you would never dare betray me.

961
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,070
I knew it.

962
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,250
Your past was amazing.

963
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,180
But instead of "extraordinary,"

964
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,420
it was rather bloody.

965
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:35,550
That makes it even more intriguing.

966
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:36,710
I'm willing

967
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,920
to wash mint leaves for you every day

968
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:39,960
as your snacks.

969
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,310
You can enjoy them

970
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,450
while telling me stories of your past.

971
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,510
If we could really live

972
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,630
such a life,

973
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:52,000
even if I'm going to die,

974
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,030
it'll be worth it.

975
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:00,740
What about him?

976
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,450
I already spotted you.

977
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,650
You

978
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,230
will always be

979
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,440
just a lame moorhen.

980
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,380
Be careful!

981
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,700
[Yongzhou Prefecture Office]

982
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,550
Who is it?

983
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:57,670
Meng Buyi?

984
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,360
Why did you beat the drum again?

985
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,190
I've found out Hongyao's whereabouts.

986
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,370
Please go save her now!
