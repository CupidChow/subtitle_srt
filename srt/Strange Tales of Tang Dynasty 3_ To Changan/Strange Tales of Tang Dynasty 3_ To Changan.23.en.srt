00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,360
I've been looking forward to this—
you're finally here!

374
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,670
I hope you've been resting well

375
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,330
at the inn these past few days?

376
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:14,030
Having you both grace my restaurant today

377
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,200
is a tremendous honor.

378
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,440
Mr. Ruan, thank you
for the daily delivery of food and wine.

379
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,750
We enjoyed all those Chang'an delicacies,

380
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,790
and they were never the same twice.

381
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,850
The two of us were amply satisfied.

382
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,330
Stop expressing gratitude.

383
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,870
About the poetry collection you gave us...

384
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,130
I didn't read it at all.

385
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,970
But you've been so thoughtful

386
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:33,990
as a host

387
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,120
that I've decided

388
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
to include you in my own collection.

389
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,780
I've even come up

390
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,980
with a title:

391
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,000
"A Playful Ode

392
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,090
to Ruan Ninety-Eight,

393
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,810
Owner of Ruan's Restaurant."

394
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,720
How does that sound?

395
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,610
Do you mean it?

396
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,160
Terrific.

397
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,480
A playful ode—that's perfect!

398
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,080
I love that title.

399
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,040
Well, allow me to thank you in advance.

400
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,050
You're welcome.

401
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,000
Lang,

402
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,070
why are you still standing here?

403
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,270
Go wait outside to greet

404
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,200
another poet, who is yet to arrive.

405
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:05,000
This poet is even purer of heart

406
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,820
than the two of us.

407
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:10,080
And it's harder to please him.
You must accord him proper respect.

408
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,550
Yes!

409
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,690
Daxiong, did you really manage

410
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,980
to get him to Chang'an?

411
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,910
You two are best friends with him.

412
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,110
Would I be bold enough

413
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,640
to lie to you, gentlemen?

414
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,270
When will he arrive?

415
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,270
According to our arrangement,

416
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,530
he should be here soon.

417
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,970
He'll arrive today?

418
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,600
Youbo and I thought we had to have

419
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,270
a long stay at Ruan's Restaurant,

420
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,600
waiting for 8 to 10 days.

421
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,870
When he comes today,

422
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,120
we'll make him drink all the wine

423
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,720
he's owed us for 10 years all at once.

424
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,520
Sounds great!

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,000
[Ruan's Restaurant]

426

[Ruan's Restaurant]

427
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,910
Who are you?

428
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,200
A servant of Sushan Shop.

429
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,960
Boss,

430
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,750
why is the restaurant
keeping such an animal here?

431
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,680
Are you in any position to ask that?

432
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,960
Since you're a servant of Sushan Shop,

433
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,620
you should stay in the kitchen

434
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,960
instead of wandering around.

435
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,750
Yes, sure.

436
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:25,600
Hey, beggar!

437
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:26,600
Get out of here.

438
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,330
"A Chang'an maiden
steps into spring sunshine."

439
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,670
"But where in spring
will sunshine not pine?"

440
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:36,270
"Her dancing sleeves and the arch
of her back are all forgotten."

441
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,170
"Only her silken robes remain,
coated with autumn frost."

442
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:41,910
Lu!

443
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,530
Am I seeing this right?

444
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,130
It really is you, Leng Ji!

445
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,480
[A poet from Nanzhou Prefecture, Leng Ji]

446
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,340

at the sight of your back,
Lu from Fanyang Prefecture!

448
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,740
When did you come to Chang'an?

449
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,800
You two...

450
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:58,950
Leng Ji?

451
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,000
Are you

452
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,150
one of the poets invited by Ruan Daxiong,

453
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,030
my employer?

454
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,960
Please announce my arrival.

455
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,349
Just say that Leng Ji
from Nanzhou Prefecture has come to beg.

456
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:06,880
Mr. Leng,

457
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,190
please don't say that.

458
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,540
I was as blind as a bat,

459
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,190
for recognizing you. Why...

460
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,160
Why did you use the rear door?

461
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,510
I...

462
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,680
I'll go inform Mr. Xiong right away.

463
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,589
Lu, upon arriving in Chang'an,

464
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,880
I heard that you're now

465
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,740
the Yongzhou Judicial Official.

466
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,310
Why would you have time
to visit this restaurant?

467
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:23,839
Mr. Leng,

468
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,050
please keep my identity secret for now.

469
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:31,310
I got it.

470
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,840
Where is Leng Ji from Nanzhou Prefecture?

471
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:34,960
Mr. Wang!

472
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,990
Mr. Leng!

473
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,190
Mr. Leng!

474
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,400
-Mr. Gao!
-Mr. Leng!

475
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,880
Mr. Leng, we finally met today.

476
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,790
Let's drink until we drop!

477
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,390
Sure!

478
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,750
Mr. Ruan?

479
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,360
Come on.

480
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,640
Let me introduce you to a gentleman.

481
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,590
This is...

482
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,550
I'm Lu Wuming.

483
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,160
Yes.

484
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,240
Lu

485
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,790
is an old friend of mine
back in Nanzhou Prefecture.

486
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,030
Isn't it a coincidence?

487
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,790
He and I have reunited in Chang'an!

488
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,720
That's perfect. Why not let him join us?

489
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,350
Sure thing!

490
00:17:59,350 --> 00:17:59,830
Hold on.

491
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,530
I'm afraid this is not appropriate.

492
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,150
Why is that, Mr. Ruan?

493
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:05,820
Have you not prepared

494
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,220
enough wine for today?

495
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,020
Today's banquet

496
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,910
is for poets only.

497
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,250
But this man...

498
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:16,160
He's just a servant of Sushan Shop.

499
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,790
I've fallen on hard times.
How embarrassing, Mr. Leng.

500
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,050
That's only recently.

501
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,110
He used to be a poet too.

502
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,220
A poet?

503
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,110
You must be kidding, Mr. Leng.

504
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,110
If you said

505
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,310
he used to be a house guard,

506
00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:30,910
I would probably believe it.

507
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,690
But a poet?

508
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,220
Mr. Leng did embellish my past.

509
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,050
I really shouldn't attend

510
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,640
this banquet for poets.

511
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,920
No way. Ruan Daxiong!

512
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,340
What does Lu have to do to gain a seat

513
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,140
in this banquet you're hosting?

514
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,110
If he can't write poetry,

515
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,440
at least he should be familiar
with others' works, right?

516
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,880
Then I bet you're well versed in the works

517
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,030
of the previous finest poets.

518
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:55,880
Of course.

519
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,790
I'm not boasting.

520
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,920
I just have to say
I'm not only able to write poetry,

521
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,550
but also excel in reciting it.

522
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:04,310
I know every poet and poem

523
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,630
from the Pre-Qin period,

524
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,790
the Six Dynasties, and the Sui Dynasty,

525
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,390
to the current Tang Dynasty.

526
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,580
Mr. Ruan, I wonder

527
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:16,720
if you have read Cao Zijian's poems.

528
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,980
Do you even need to ask?

529
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,020
What about Bao Zhao's and Yu Xin's poems?

530
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,480
Isn't the answer obvious?

531
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,160
That being the case,

532
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,740
I assume you, Mr. Ruan, must have read

533
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,180
Yuan Wuyou's

534
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:31,070
and Cheng Zixu's masterpieces.

535
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,400
Yuan...

536
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,110
Yuan Wuyou?

537
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,000
Cheng Zixu?

538
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,650
You're hesitant to answer, Mr. Ruan.

539
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,520
Oh, well...

540
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,880
These poets you're talking about,
Yuan and Cheng...

541
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,530
I bet they lived in the Wei-Jin period...

542
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,350
No.

543
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:55,750
Most Wei-Jin poets' given names
were in single characters.

544
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,830
These names, "Wuyou" and "Zixu..."

545
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,880
They lived
in the Southern and Northern Dynasties.

546
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,210
Right. They must live in those dynasties.

547
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,880
This is not much of a test, is it?

548
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,590
However,

549
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,840
the works of these two poets

550
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:08,680
are somewhat vulgar.

551
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:14,730
Daxiong,

552
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:18,000
invite Lu to the banquet already.

553
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Think about the names
of "Yuan Wuyou" and "Cheng Zixu..."

554
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,440
Those are fake names!

555
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,170
My apologies, Mr. Ruan.

556
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,630

Mr. Ruan, if you really don't think

559
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,270
I'm qualified for a seat in this banquet,

560
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,030

No, no, no!

562
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,400
I was being too rude.

563
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,740
Lu, I must invite you to the banquet
with reverence now,

564
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,640
or I would appear to lack

565
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,270

Good, Ruan Daxiong.

569
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,440
I see you stand corrected.

Daxiong!

578
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,790
Since I'm the oldest here,

don't mind if I take the seat of honor.

580
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,030
Mr. Leng,

581
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,140
why would you suddenly come to Chang'an?

582
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,240
Since the title
of the Four Poets of Nanzhou...

583
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:37,830
The main reason lied in
the remote and desolate southern region.

584
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:40,110
I was tempered through
wind and rain alone every day.

585
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:41,790
Though there were inspirations for poetry,

586
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,650
grandeur was nowhere to be found.

587
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:44,750
I started

588
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,300
to feel more and more stifled.

589
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,770
After much consideration,

590
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,240
I realized I had to free myself
from constraints.

591
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,480
Therefore, I decided to travel far.

592
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,720
Wonderful! Without grand ambitions,

593
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,130
how can one call himself
a poet of the Tang Empire?

594
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,440
Venturing beyond the frontier is a must
for those traveling far, right?

595
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,640
That is why I, Leng Ji,

596
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,960
plan to pass through Chang'an
and head to the Western Region,

597
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,000
where I can admire
the lonely moon and the yellow sand

599
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,000

You're just a tavern owner.

Do you also want to venture
beyond the frontier?

604

also intend to travel beyond the borders.

will definitely be added

And this is Wang Youbo.

You certainly get to do that.

642

Mr. Leng, you haven't changed a bit.

643
00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:08,330

are you planning to join the army?

Yes, exactly.

I started practicing martial arts
since childhood,

658

and then began entertaining myself
with poetry.

Though that can't be called
a waste of time,

660
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,270
I have been truly limited
by scholarly unworldliness.

In recent years, the Tang Empire's power

has been steadily rising.

663

But the imperial court
is in so much turmoil

664
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,240
that many foreign tribes
have taken this chance

665
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,550
to harass the border area

666
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,750

00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:03,990

00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,880
We've prepared four flavors.

739
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,200
Peach,

740
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:41,720
grape,

741
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,240
pomegranate, and...

742
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,160
Serve what you've made
to sober the guests.

743
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,890
They're drinking too quickly.

744
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,560
I'm afraid someone upstairs
is getting drunk.

745
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,030
You just mentioned three flavors.

746
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,240
What's the other one?

747
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,110
Cherry.

748
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,440
Serve them cherry-flavored sushan then.

749
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:01,000
See? Everyone likes the cherry flavor.

750
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,680
Xijun,

751
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:05,510
haven't you always wanted to see

752
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,370
how graceful poets are in person?

753
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,640
An opportunity is now presented to you.

754
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,380
Yingtao, go with me.

755
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,480
I'm not interested

756
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,440
in poets.

757
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,310
Though I haven't been assigned a task,

758
00:28:15,310 --> 00:28:16,590
as a secret agent,

759
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,880
I'll go

760
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,120
wherever Mr. Su goes.

761
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:21,920
Fei!

762
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,070
Don't you want to see the poets?

763
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,450
How am I in the mood for that?

764
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,000
After working for such a long time,

765
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,510
I must reward myself

766
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,960
with drinks.

767
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,880
Here comes sushan!

768
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,110
Su...

769
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:44,110
That's Su Lingfeng,
the owner of Sushan Shop.

770
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,410
Mr. Leng, long time no see.

771
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,830
It's been years since we parted.

772
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,960
I missed you so much.

773
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:59,110
I missed you too, Mr. Leng.

774
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,750
Back in Nanzhou Prefecture,

775
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,550
I didn't know how to make sushan.

776
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,980
I just learned the craft not long ago.

777
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,110
Have a try, please.

778
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,920
Pei...

779
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,830
I, Pei, give you my best regards,
Mr. Leng.

780
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,690
I luckily met you once in Nanzhou.

781
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,350
I didn't expect a great poet
such as yourself

782
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,480
to remember my name.

783
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,640
What an honor for me.

784
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:22,520
I'll taste it.

785
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,550
Please.

786
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,480
Sushan is indeed refreshing.

787
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,960
Amazing!

788
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,880
This delicacy originated
in Shazhou Prefecture.

789
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,550
It was then introduced to Chang'an by us.

790
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,750
In that case,

791
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,880
when we pass by Shazhou
in our journey

792
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,830
beyond the frontier,

793
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,430
we must try the sushan there.

794
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,640
We have prepared

795
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
four flavors in total.

796
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,030
Now, you're tasting the cherry flavor.

797
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,070
There are three more flavors

798
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,200
for you to savor, distinguished poets.

799
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,130
Wait, everyone.

800
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,720
Today, this is a gathering of poets.

801
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,480
We shouldn't let these iced treats
steal the thunder.

802
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,110
Mr. Ruan, you're suggesting...

803
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,570
This is the Tang Empire.

804
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:02,350
We're in Chang'an now.
How can there be no poetry?

805
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,260
Well said!

806
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,160
Daxiong,

807
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,960
are you planning to compose poetry

808
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,320
in front of everyone?

809
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,280
That's not it.

810
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:12,540
How dare I compose poetry

811
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,720
in your presence?

812
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,960
There's a special feature
in Ruan's Restaurant.

813
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,760
That is, I'd often hire troupes,

814
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:20,640
which make extended stays
in various places,

815
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,960
to perform for my guests.

816
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,680
I've had the somewhat famous

817
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,520
Xuanhuo Troupe come here today.

818
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,510
Let's invite their songstresses

819
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,840
to sing and dance for us.

820
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,630
I believe they will sing

821
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,300
some poems composed by you gentlemen.

822
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,940
Good idea! Let's put a mark on the wall,

823
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,060
when a poem of someone's here is sung.

824
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,000
Forget it.

825
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,880
It's not fair to Lu and Mr. Ruan,

826
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
as this game will basically exclude them

827
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:46,960
and involve the three of us only.

828
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,720
Are you having cold feet, Mr. Leng?

829
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,270
The audacious and talented Mr. Leng

830
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,240
that we were with

831
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,880
by the Yishui River and Luoshui River

832
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,510
was nothing

833
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,590
like you are now.

834
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,280
Don't worry about me, Mr. Leng.

835
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:01,310
I'm honored to just be

836
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,830
a spectator.

837
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,650
But how do we determine the winner

838
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,550
of this poets' contest in a tavern?

839
00:31:07,550 --> 00:31:09,790
The poet who's poems are most set to music

840
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,450
will be the winner, of course.

841
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,830
Well...

842
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Mr. Leng,

843
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:20,070
are you... afraid of losing?

844
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:23,720
I won't lose.

845
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,250
What about you, Mr. Gao?

846
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:29,950
I dare not to decline.

847
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,650
This poets' contest in a tavern

848
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,850
is truly a remarkable event
in the poetry circles.

849
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,850
As the owner of this place,

850
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,340
may I also take a part in it?

851
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,930
How about

852
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,720
I keep score for you?

853
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,590
Sounds good.

854
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,640
Everyone, we just arrived today.

855
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:51,590
In the next 15 days,

856
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,080
we'll be stationed here.

857
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,590
Therefore...

858
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:58,590
Girls, the troupe leader is asking us

859
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,950
to put in real effort.

860
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,550
Sing the songs you should sing,

861
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,790
and don't say anything you should not say.

862
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,180
Don't worry, Mr. Sai.

863
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,500
Your words are engraved on our minds.

864
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,890
Right, sisters?

865
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,510
Yes.

866
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,680
Compared to those poets,

867
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,210
our employer, Mr. Ruan,

868
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,270
look plumper and curvier.

869
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,110
Sisters, do you understand

870
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,430
what Mr. Hou just said?

871
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,440
Don't just flatter the poets.

872
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,550
Mr. Ruan is the master here.

873
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,340
Make sure
you show tremendous respect to him.

874
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,830
Yes.

875
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:43,960
Yes.

876
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,920
My name is Sang.

877
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,440
Today, it's such an honor for me to play

878
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:04,640
a stringed instrument and sing for you.

879
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:24,880
♫ Osmanthus branches sway,
casting shadows ♫

880
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:31,480
♫ Years quickly go by,
like clear running torrents ♫

881
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:37,790
♫ My life is free of mundane affairs ♫

882
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,720
♫ Even idle clouds rest before my eyes ♫

883
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:45,070
The first poem

884
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,840
was composed by me, Wang Youbo.

885
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,440
Will you two admit defeat?

886
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,680
The game has just started.

887
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,410
Put a mark on!

888
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,550
[One]

889
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:11,710
One poem composed
by Mr. Wang Youbo has been sung!

890
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,360
Mr. Wang took the first point.

891
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,920
Come on, let's drink a toast to him!

892
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,980
-Come on!
-Come on!

893
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,530
Drink up.

894
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,280
Mr. Wang.

895
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:19,150
Mr. Gao.

896
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,210
My name is Bi. Greetings, gentlemen.

897
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:40,070
♫ Climbing layered cliffs alone ♫

898
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,880
♫ I see a solitary crane
seemingly perching on the clouds ♫

899
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:50,110
♫ Mighty winds roll up
my sorrowful thoughts ♫

900
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,880
♫ On a mud flat there stand misty trees ♫

901
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,980
Pardon me, fellows.

902
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,530
This poem is mine.

903
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Oh, Mr. Gao...

904
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:11,840
[One]

905
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,440
A poem of Mr. Gao Da's has been sung!

906
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:51,000
♫ The peaks are sealed by snow
in twilight's hush ♫

907
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,800
Mr. Wang, another poem of yours?

908
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,320
♫ In the depths of clouds
hides a household ♫

909
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:02,920
♫ The closed door says no to visitors ♫

910
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:08,800
♫ The fragrance of plum blossoms
fills the courtyard ♫

911
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,110
Mr. Leng, this is another poem of mine.

912
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,840
Put a mark on!

913
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,880
[One]

914
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
[Two]

915
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,670
Two of Mr. Wang Youbo's poems
have been sung!

916
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,710
I'm temporarily ahead of you, gentlemen.

917
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,410
Here is a toast to everyone.

918
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,630
My name is Baobao.

919
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,520
It means I'm like a leopard,

920
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,950
though it sounds like asking for a hug.

921
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,280
Enjoy, gentlemen.

922
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:44,150
When you have a few rounds of drinks
and long for an embrace,

923
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,440
I'll come back to you.

924
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,110
My name is Xiaopa.

925
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,290
Greetings, gentlemen.

926
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:14,230
♫ Slowly, slowly, Mr. Ruan returns ♫

927
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:19,280
♫ Time flies like a shooting arrow ♫

928
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:25,030
♫ Holding wine and crabs ♫

929
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:31,400
♫ Let us cheer for peace and joy ♫

930
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,150
It's mine!

931
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,870
T-That's my poem.

932
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,750
Someone is actually singing

933
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,770
a poem that I, Ruan Daxiong, wrote!

934
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,110
Miss, have my poems started

935
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:46,840
circulating among the people?

936
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,000
Yes.

937
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:49,670
This...

938
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,440
This is making me

939
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,840
feel really awkward

940
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,700
in front of you three great poets.

941
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,500
I'm very flattered.

942
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,190
A poem of Mr. Ruan Daxiong has been sung!

943
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,000
It doesn't count.

944
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,800
It shouldn't be counted.

945
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,960
[One]

946
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,420
Well...

947
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,460
Mr. Wang.

948
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,360
This is the poem

949
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,510
I enjoy singing most.

950
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,370
I didn't expect

951
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,190
to see the author of it in this banquet.

952
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,790
Do I have the honor to propose

953
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,480
a toast to you, this great poet?

954
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,730
Miss, that's not quite right.

955
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,350
It should be me proposing a toast to you.

956
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,880
Pour her a glass of wine!

957
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,710
Mr. Leng,

958
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,890
so far to this point,

959
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,800
none of your poems have been sung.

960
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,000
Here's a toast to you.

961
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,550
Mr. Wang,

962
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,920
I've read Mr. Leng's poetry collection.

963
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,070
Though not many poems are in it,

964
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,480
some are truly classic.

965
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:12,510
They probably

966
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,530
haven't reached Chang'an yet.

967
00:39:18,110 --> 00:39:20,330
Lu Wuming, I know

968
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,530
you and Leng Ji are old friends.

969
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,930
As I said, I don't hate you.

970
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,920
But you're in no position

971
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,880
to speak up for him.

972
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,440
Mr. Wang actually means

973
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,660
that he and I have known

974
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:35,480
Leng Ji for a longer time.

975
00:39:35,670 --> 00:39:38,000
Mr. Gao, no need to explain to him.

976
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,140
Today, let's just speak our minds

977
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,510
right here.

978
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:42,810
Leng Ji,

979
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,480
years ago, in Luoyang, the three of us

980
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,150
had equal standing in the poetry circles.

981
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,360
But you chose to leave us

982
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,700
and go back to Nanzhou.

983
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,480
You claimed that the Four Poets of Nanzhou

984
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,000
were as close as real brothers.

985
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,440
But what happened in the end?

986
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,240
The Four Poets of Nanzhou
became a laughingstock!

987
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,110
Do you think you lost nothing

988
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,480
but your fame in the poetic circles?

989
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,230
You actually lost
something far more important

990
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,150
than you could imagine!

991
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:06,960
Mr. Wang,

992
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:07,920
you...

993
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,890
This is enough.

994
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,360
Did I say anything wrong?

995
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,000
Those songstresses

996
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:32,840
were just mediocre.

997
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,720
The poems they sang were quite crude

998
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:38,910
and way inferior
to the truly refined ones.

999
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,620
I'm far from an expert.

1000
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,880
The vulgar dare not

1001
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:44,440
touch my works.

1002
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,000
If no one sings my poems today,

1003
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,030
I shall punish myself
with three glasses of wine,

1004
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,800
stop writing poetry thereafter,

1005
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,670
and never compete with you lot again

1006
00:40:58,710 --> 00:40:59,910
in the rest of my life.

1007
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:17,550
What does he mean by that?

1008
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,120
Mr. Wang, back to your seat.

1009
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,440
This way.
