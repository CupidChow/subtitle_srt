[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:37,990
[Episode 32]

3
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,590
Are you Mr. Yin Yao?

4
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,400
That's me, Mortician Yin Yao.

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,759
Nice makeup work.

6
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,570
The details are exquisite.

7
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,160
I must thank you

8
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,870
for not using cosmetics

9
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,400
to cover the strangulation
and finger marks

10
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,790
on the victim's neck.

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,150
I've already examined it.

12
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,590
You can go in and continue your work.

13
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,510
I didn't see any coroner arrive.

14
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,919
Officer, are you sure
no further examination is needed?

15
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:11,870
Yin Yao.

16
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,470
You think without you,

17
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,800
Wannian County would lack good coroners?

18
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,030
County Sheriff Su himself

19
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:18,280
is an excellent coroner.

20
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,079
Impossible.

21
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,150
Coroners cannot take civil service exams,

22
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:24,410
so how could one become a county sheriff?

23
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:28,300
I am indeed not a coroner.

24
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,140
I only have

25
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,520
a rudimentary knowledge of forensics.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,680
But you, sir,

27
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:35,750
must be an excellent coroner.

28
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,800
You said earlier

29
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,150
that the victim was strangled first

30
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,960
and then made to look like a suicide.

31
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,210
Your judgment is correct.

32
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,010
Thank you for your help.

33
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,579
The victim's father already has

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,190
suspicions about the killer.

35
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,400
His wife died young.

36
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
He remarried last year.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,030
That woman was unfaithful.

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:05,280
She often had affairs with others

39
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,750
when he was not at home.

40
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,360
His daughter once caught her in the act.

41
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,580
Yesterday, he found his daughter hanged.

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,760
The stepmother claimed she was frightened

43
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,760
and moved back to her mother's home.

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,280
That's extremely suspicious, isn't it?

45
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,640
I'll go find that woman.

46
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,280
That would be excellent.

47
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,960
County Sheriff Su.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,520
Well...

49
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,800
Yingtao is from Yongzhou Prefecture.

50
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,240
It's fine to let her arrest that woman.

51
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:36,710
What we fear most now is news getting out.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,360
That woman's lover

53
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:40,180
lives in this district,

54
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,090
in the third house on the right
from the west gate.

55
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,190
He's an alchemist.

56
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,430
He knows some martial arts.

57
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:47,360
Go question him.

58
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,079
If no one's home,

59
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,329
check the situation inside.

60
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,870
If there are signs of escape,

61
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,200
immediately make a sketch for his arrest.

62
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,130
Understood.

63
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,930
This case isn't actually complicated.

64
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,350
The key lies in the coroner.

65
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,730
You've figured that out already?

66
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,280
According to you,

67
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,560
this Yin Yao...

68
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,720
What a ridiculous name.

69
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,649
He is a good coroner.

70
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,510
Then why

71
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,710
did he become a mortician halfway?

72
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,450
That's a good question.

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,920
Even if that

74
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,680
arrogant Qin Xiaobai were here,

75
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,810
he'd have to praise his makeup skills.

76
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:59,950
[Funeral]

77
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,560
Mr. Yin, are you free today?

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,040
I'd like to invite you for a few drinks

79
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,000
and make your acquaintance.

80
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,860
I'm busy today.

81
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,780
Hey, Yin!

82
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:13,100
The esteemed County Sheriff Su,
disciple of Master Di,

83
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,660
addressed you as 'sir'.

84
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,780
That's a show of goodwill.

85
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,480
How dare you be so rude?

86
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,040
Thank you for your kindness,
County Sheriff Su.

87
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,680
I still have
important matters to attend to.

88
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
I really don't have time today.

89
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,810
Please understand.

90
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,160
No matter.

91
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,370
I'll invite you another day then.

92
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,050
Satisfied now?

93
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,510
Look at him.

94
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,030
Talented people

95
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,280
always have a bit of pride.

96
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,750
When we were young,

97
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,050
weren't we the same?

98
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,500
If you put it that way,

99
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,320
you're really flattering him.

100
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,000
How could he compare to us?

101
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,190
Let's go. Hurry up.

102
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,390
Move.

103
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,360
County Sheriff Su,
you're truly prescient.

104
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,730
This guy was just about to run

105
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,070
when I caught him red-handed.

106
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,270
He has confessed everything.

107
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,480
He was having an affair
with a married woman

108
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,440
when the deceased caught them.

109
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,430
Afraid of being exposed,

110
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,470
he committed the murder.

111
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,240
He strangled her to death before
hanging her up

112
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,600
to make it look like suicide.

113
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,950
The woman has confessed too.

114
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,070
The idea of strangling her

115
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,130
was actually hers.

116
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,750
How vicious you two are!

117
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,130
[Geng]

118
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,310
[Geng Residence]

119
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:48,000
According to Captain Xu,

120
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,250
this is where Geng Wushang lives.

121
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,000
Knock.

122
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,920
Is anyone home?

123
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:02,310
Who are you?

124
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,200
Who are you people?

125
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,800
I'm Su Wuming,
the new Wannian County Sheriff,

126
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,830
here to visit Mr. Geng.

127
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,710
[Geng Residence]

128
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,000
Oh, visitors from the county office.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,260
I'll go tell my father.

130
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,240
Please come in.

131
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,150
I just heard your name, esteemed guest,

132
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,690
and you seem to be an old acquaintance.

133
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,270
Yes, it's me, Su Wuming.

134
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,870
Mr. Geng, how have you been?

135
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,980
Back when you followed Master Di,

136
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,060
[Elder Coroner of Chang'an, Geng Wushang]

137
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,800
you were a handsome young man.

138
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,000
But now...

139
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,310
After years in officialdom,

140
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,760
you've returned to serve in Chang'an.

141
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,220
Congratulations.

142
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,860
I often hear news about you,

143
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,870
like at the Cantian Tower,

144
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,870
and Chengfo Temple.

145
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:57,670
Your reputation
almost rivals your mentor's now.

146
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,440
You flatter me, sir.

147
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,270
I don't deserve such praise.

148
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,180
Let me introduce them.

149
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,270
This is my good friend,

150
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,560
Miracle Doctor, Chicken Fei.

151
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,720
Greetings, Coroner Geng.

152
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,680
Well met.

153
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,270
This young lady
works at Yongzhou Prefecture.

154
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,270
You can call her Yingtao.

155
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,890
Greetings, Coroner Geng.

156
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,270
Well met.

157
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,870
Suchan, greet our honored guests.

158
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,510
Greetings, Sheriff Su, Miracle Doctor Fei,

159
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,720
[Suchan]

160
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,720
and Miss Yingtao.

161
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,390
Is this your daughter?

162
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,720
Yes, my daughter.

163
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,800
Why were you wearing a mask earlier?

164
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,260
It was quite frightening.

165
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,630
This mask is meant to scare people.

166
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,299
Let me explain.

167
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,090
I've been a coroner my whole life,

168
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,150
helping the county office

169
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,510
catch many killers,

170
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,400
and made quite a few enemies.

171
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,550
Now that I'm old,

172
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,960
vengeful people often come to harass me.

173
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,480
I told Suchan

174
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,550
to wear that mask whenever she hears

175
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:53,080
someone knocking.

176
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,790
The timid ones will be scared away.

177
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,780
Those harassers
might not be seeking revenge on you.

178
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,600
They might actually be coming

179
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:05,230
for Miss Suchan.

180
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,360
After all,

181
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,020
she is a beautiful young lady.

182
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,690
You're our distinguished guests,

183
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,320
we should invite you in for tea.

184
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,270
But today,

185
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,870
we really have some business to attend to.

186
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,150
We're going out.

187
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,620
What business is so urgent

188
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,440
that you won't even
offer a drink of water?

189
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Today is my father's 70th birthday.

191
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,390
at the Dukang restaurant

192
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,250
to celebrate Father's birthday.

193
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,720
May I ask for your senior's name?

194
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,790
The one who booked the restaurant
is my eldest senior,

195
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:33,920
named Zhong Shizai.

196
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,750
My second senior will also
be coming to pay respects,

197
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,810
his name is Yin Yao.

198
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,000
I've long heard

199
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,330
that you have two favorite disciples.

200
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,630
What a coincidence,

201
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,870
we just met Yin Yao.

202
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:47,450
You've met Yao?

203
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,960
Was he

204
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,480
preparing a corpse?

205
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,270
Indeed.

206
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,000
This is my first case

207
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:54,950
since arriving in Wannian County.

208
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,720
The family thought it was suicide,

209
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,510
so they didn't report it
to the authorities.

210
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,240
Yin Yao went to prepare the body

211
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,750
and discovered it had been a murder.

212
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,870
Now the killer has been caught

213
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,890
thanks to Yin Yao's contribution.

214
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,520
In terms of talent,

215
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:09,480
over these years,

216
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,240
among all the coroners I've met,

217
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,500
Yao is certainly the best.

218
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,790
It's a pity he changed professions.

219
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,110
If he could return to being a coroner...

220
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,200
My purpose in visiting

221
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,600
is also to find talent

222
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,270
for the coroner profession.

223
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:27,550
If you don't mind,

224
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,670
could you invite us

225
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
to join your birthday celebration?

226
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,720
You won't regret inviting me.

227
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,720
Sir,

228
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:37,790
are you

229
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,080
suffering from a skin disease?

230
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,550
How did you know?

231
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,000
Didn't you hear Su Wuming

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,200
introduce me just now?

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,260
If I couldn't tell,

234
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,440
would I dare call myself a miracle doctor?

235
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,840
You invite me for a drink,

236
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,200
and I'll treat your skin disease.

237
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,100
How about that?

238
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,000
Miracle Doctor Fei,

239
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,080
I'm afraid

240
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,150
you're mistaken.

241
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:03,670
I'm just old,

242
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:05,630
I don't have any skin disease.

243
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,140
Suchan.

244
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,320

to follow us

246
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,510

Surprised?

254
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,390
We meet again.

255
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,630
In front of my mentor,

256
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,550
you shouldn't address me like that.

257
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:53,080
Master, they...

258
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,820
Sheriff Su is an old friend of mine.

259
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,000
He came to visit today,

260
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,790
so I invited him to join our feast.

261
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,030
I see.

to both honored guests.

how is your health?

269
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,550
Didn't you just visit

270
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:27,870
3 days ago?

271
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
If you're so concerned,

272
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,600
why not just move back in?

Is it appropriate for me to sit here?

from associating with me.

Can we find this person?

569
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,750
That shouldn't be difficult.

570
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:34,000
She often comes to Dukang Restaurant
to make reservations.

571
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,260
I know where she lives.

572
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:36,480
Bring her here.

573
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,000
Yes.

574
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,070
Sir,

575
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:42,920
can we leave now?

576
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,400
You may go for now.

577
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,920
But the Wannian County office

578
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,270
may summon you at any time.

579
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,790
Don't leave Chang'an in the meantime.

580
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,640
-Yes.
-Yes.

581
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,200
All these are grape wines.

582
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
Though not as authentic

583
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,400
as Yunding red wine,

584
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,800
since they can be transported to Chang'an,

585
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,160
they must be decent.

586
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,700
First, they had the booking agent
reserve a private room.

587
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,240
Then, they had to be sure

588
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,370
that Dong Yue would attend the banquet

589
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,880
and sit in that main seat.

590
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,240
They also had to ensure

591
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,600
that the window
would be open at that time,

592
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,920
and that Dong Yue
would get up to close it,

593
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,590
exposing his vital points completely.

594
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,680
Most importantly,

595
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,240
this person must be an excellent archer.

596
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,160
This killer is no ordinary person.

597
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,250
Qiu, open the door!

598
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,610
The county office wants to question you.

599
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,360
Qiu!

600
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,310
If you're home,

601
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,270
answer me!

602
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,350
Qiu.

603
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,270
Has anyone seen Qiu?

604
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,480
This guy owes me money.

605
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,360
I've been looking for him.

606
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:28,440
You're not him?

607
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,350
Are you human or ghost?

608
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,510
I could be

609
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,030
an ordinary person in our Tang Empire,

610
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,240
or a

611
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,680
rather pretty ghost.

612
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:08,540
Which one do you prefer?

613
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,720
Young lady,

614
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,350
don't look for trouble.

615
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,030
I never hit women.

616
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,240
But you can't stop

617
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,270
this woman from hitting you.

618
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:22,110
I...

619
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,030
I...

620
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:30,820
Tell the truth,

621
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,770
or face severe punishment.

622
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,480
When I was serving customers that day,

623
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,720
I stole a bite of food.

624
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:39,350
The boss caught me.

625
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,960
What bad luck.

626
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,960
Who knew when I got home...

627
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,070
Don't be afraid.

628
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:53,160
You're Qiu,

629
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,200
a servant at Dukang Restaurant.

630
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,680
Not for much longer.

631
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,480
Because you stole

632
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,340
food meant for customers, right?

633
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,750
How did you know?

634
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,640
The day after tomorrow, at 3 pm,

635
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,640
the Meiwu private room

636
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
will be hosting distinguished guests.

637
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,440
Do as I say,

638
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,720
and your boss will keep you.

639
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:13,000
Don't trust me?

640
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,880
You must trust this, right?

641
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,750
I didn't want to take it,

642
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,030
but

643
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:23,070
it was such an easy 100 coins to earn.

644
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,420
I just had to open the window

645
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,960
when I served the dishes.

646
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,110
Nothing else?

647
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,240
No.

648
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,160
How could I know
he was going to kill someone?

649
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,030
When I heard

650
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,180
someone shouting about
a dead person upstairs,

651
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,590
I was so scared my legs went weak.

652
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,050
So I ran away immediately.

653
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,400
I'm not guilty, am I?

654
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,160
I did take 100 coins,

655
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,160
but surely I won't have to

656
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,290
pay with my life for that dead coroner?

657
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,480
Because of your greed,

658
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45,950
you were used by the killer

659
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,480
and led to someone's death.

660
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,040
You...

661
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:48,590
I...

662
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,900
I know I was wrong.

663
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,550
Please consider that I, Qiu, have been

664
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,920
honest and decent for years.

665
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,200
I've never bullied the elderly or young,

666
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,510
or women, for that matter.

667
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,000
Please let me go.

668
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,530
Isn't that what you're supposed to do?

669
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,790
If you were truly remorseful,

670
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,640
you would have turned yourself in.

671
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,510
Why did you run?

672
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,000
I...

673
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,550
Can't answer that, can you?

674
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,550
Su Wuming.

675
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,510
This kind of person
must be taught a lesson.

676
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,440
Otherwise, who knows what kind of trouble

677
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,750
he might cause in the future?

678
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,310
I'll never be greedy again.

679
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,810
I accept my punishment.

680
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,310
How about giving him 3 strokes

681
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,830
as punishment?

682
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:26,310
So light?

683
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:28,610
It's because we're afraid of injuring you

684
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,640
to the point you can't
make a living anymore.

685
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:31,960
Remember this lesson.

686
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,960
Stay away from stealing in the future.

687
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,390
If you can't resist food,

688
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:38,510
don't work as a servant in a restaurant.

689
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,570
Do something else.

690
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:41,480
I'll remember.

691
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,340
I'll remember.

692
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,240
Take him away.

693
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:43,770
Yes, sir.

694
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Officer.

695
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,070
I'm Gao Wuniang.

696
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,640
I just helped that General Lyu

697
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,750
book a private room.

698
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,740
But how could I know
he was going to kill someone?

699
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:50,920
[Booking agent, Go Wuniang]

700
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,480
I'm just a booking agent.

701
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,790
This murder has nothing to do with me.

702
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,590
You're newly appointed.

703
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,820
Need to host a banquet?

704
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:00,810
If you need to host,

705
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:02,590
I can make reservations for you.

706
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,130
In all of Chang'an and Wannian,

707
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,600
I can book the best restaurants

708
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,750
in both counties.

709
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,680
Let's first talk about

710
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,270
where you met

711
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,350
this so-called

712
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,680
General Lyu.

713
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,540
At the East Market.

714
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,480
Business is slow these days.

715
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,750
That day, I was at the East Market,

716
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,030
wandering around all day

717
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,880
before I finally got this deal.

718
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,920
Can you book the Dukang Restaurant

719
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,440
in Changxing district?

720
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,920
Of course.

721
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,960
Which day would you like to book?

722
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,150
Three days from now, at 3 pm.

723
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:33,510
I want the south-facing
Meiwu private room.

724
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,510
Is that possible?

725
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,440
I see you're well-informed.

726
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,750
The best private room at Dukang Restaurant

727
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,880
is that one.

728
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,590
But it's really hard to book.

729
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,350
Once you're in line,

730
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,310
you'll have to wait 7 or 8 days.

731
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,980
But I know someone,

732
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:47,970
so I can definitely get it for you.

733
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,750
What's your name?

734
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:50,750
General Lyu.

735
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,270
Tell the restaurant,

736
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,750
no need to wait for all guests to arrive.

737
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,480
Serve the food promptly at 3 pm

738
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,900
with plenty of good wine.

739
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,480
Alright.

740
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,880
Here, take this deposit.

741
00:31:59,240 --> 00:31:59,960
Yingtao,

742
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,830
take her to Sushan Shop

743
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,650
and have Xijun draw a portrait.

744
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,450
Understood.

745
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:05,720
A portrait?

746
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,070
That sounds great!

747
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,750
But make sure I look beautiful in it.

748
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,370
You're dreaming.

749
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,160
What's the point of drawing you?

750
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,640
It's for that man in green robes
with the beard,

751
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,680
General Lyu.

752
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,960
When the time comes,

753
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,160
you need to describe his facial features

754
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,880
in detail.

755
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,690
The more specific, the better.

756
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:22,830
Let's go.

757
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:29,640
Sir.

758
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,270
Dong Yue never married.

759
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,200
Besides being a coroner,

760
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,480
he also ran a coffin shop.

761
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,400
This is the only assistant

762
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,240
of that coffin shop,

763
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,770
who is also his apprentice.

764
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,310
Greetings, Officer.

765
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,570
I've come to collect my master's body.

766
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:41,740
I will use

767
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,480
[Dong Yue's disciple]

768
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,590
the best coffin from our shop

769
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,640
to bury my master.

770
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,270
Did your master know someone

771
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,160
called General Lyu?

772
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,380
No.

773
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:50,510
[Dong's Coffin Shop]

774
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,160
That day,

775
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:53,270
just as I opened the door
to our coffin shop,

776
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,720
I found an invitation.

777
00:32:59,080 --> 00:32:59,160
[Invitation]

778
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,680

779
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,780
General Lyu.

780
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,110
Perhaps someone

781
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,400
I met briefly?

782
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,240
Why can't I

783
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,840
remember this person at all?

784
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:12,920
Master,

785
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,070
if you can't remember,

786
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:15,000
then don't go.

787
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,000
You should focus on preparing

788
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,460
for next month's contest.

789
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:18,510
Why not go?

790
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,860
They have the most authentic
Dukang wine there.

791
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:23,790
Besides,

792
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,440
even if I'm completely drunk

793
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,880
on the day of the contest,

794
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:30,630
the title of Chang'an's best coroner

795
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,920
will still be mine, Dong Yue's.

796
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,780
Master,

797
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,240
you said yesterday that
the top 3 in the contest

798
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,590
can become full-time coroners

799
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,880
and join the county office,

800
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,720
no longer bound
to the lowly status for generations.

801
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,950
Not only that.

802
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,160
Their descendants
can also earn official titles.

803
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,240
But I have no interest

804
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,480
in any of that.

805
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,310
I only want to be a coroner

806
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:50,480
for my entire life.

807
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,680
I want to take back

808
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,200
the title of Chang'an's best coroner

809
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,510
for my old mentor

810
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,070
from Geng Wushang's hands

811
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:58,000
myself.

812
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,240
Wait.

813
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,750
You mentioned a contest.

814
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,090
What's it about?

815
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,880
It was the day before
receiving the invitation

816
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,350
when Master told me about it.

817
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,510
He was drunk at the time

818
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,510
and very excited.

819
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,790
He said His Majesty ordered

820
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:12,520
a Coroners' Contest to be held.

821
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:14,480
I always thought

822
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,840
[Integrity and Harmony]

823
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,230
the news of the Coroners' Contest

824
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:18,550
only reached Yongzhou Prefecture

825
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,360
and hadn't spread among coroners.

826
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,400
Now it seems that's not the case.

827
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,230
In that case,

828
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,489
we have a lead on this case.

829
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,060
With so many coroners in Chang'an,

830
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,960
and all of them competing for

831
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,230
the top 3 places
in the Coroners' Contest,

832
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,520
can I assume that

833
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,920
this case involves

834
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,550
a coroner killing another coroner?

835
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,960
Your assumption is too arbitrary.

836
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:47,580
Come, follow me to Geng Wushang's house.

837
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,710
[Geng Residence]

838
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:49,760
I never expected

839
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,070
such a thing would happen today.

840
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,190
It's such a disappointment.

841
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:52,650
Master,

842
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,730
I'll arrange another banquet

843
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,100
to celebrate your birthday another day.

844
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,110
No need.

845
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,510
Everything is destined.

846
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,030
There's nothing to be disappointed about.

847
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,760
Actually,

848
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,140
I had good news to share

849
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,920
at your birthday banquet,

850
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,630
but before I could...

Good news is always welcome.

852
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,710

[Geng Residence]

854
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,280
Senior Yin,
the mask you painted was great.

855
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,070
Even the people from the county office

856
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,190
were frightened by me.

857
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:18,920
Is that so?

858
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,440
Senior Yin,

859
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,130
do you really want to continue

860
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:24,190
being a mortician?

861
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,480
I'm not like Zhong Shizai

862
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,800
who knows how to scheme.

863
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,710
Forget about the Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review,

864
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,710
I can't even handle the officials

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,510
that your leaving the coroner profession

876
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,510
was all his fault.

That's right.

It's just a pity...

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,400
My talents are mediocre,

892
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,840
I'm afraid I won't have a chance

to earn such an honor.

To win in the contest,

00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,310
one needs real skill.

900
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,500

00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,840
Now that Dong Yue is dead,

947
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,840
your chances have improved considerably.

948
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,630
That's true.

949
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,000
Zhong Shizai.

950
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,020
I'm here,

951
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,370
please speak, Master.

952
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,880
Today, I'm expelling you from my tutelage.

953
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:40,230
Master,

954
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:41,670
what are you saying?

955
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,320
Yao.

956
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,360
Suchan.

957
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,840
Come in.

958
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:47,750
Master.

959
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,880
You two can be witnesses.

960
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,630
I, Geng Wushang, coroner of Chang'an,

961
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,030
officially expel Zhong Shizai

962
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,960
from my tutelage today.

963
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,630
Master!

964
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,920
Father.

965
00:39:06,990 --> 00:39:08,190
[Geng Residence]

966
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,250
What have I done wrong

967
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,440
that you want to expel me?

968
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:15,510
Shizai.

969
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,470
I'm doing this for your own good.

970
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,320
For my own good?

971
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,940
Since they're holding a Coroners' Contest,

972
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:29,960
where the top 3
can officially enter the county office

973
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
and become professional coroners,

974
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,190
and their descendants
can escape the lowly status,

975
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:37,720
be educated, and take imperial exams,

976
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:41,440
wouldn't you, Zhong Shizai,
fight with all your might

977
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,190
for this opportunity?

978
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:49,320
Don't tell me you won't.

979
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:50,920
I will.

980
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:51,690
Therefore,

981
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,570
I must expel you from my tutelage.

982
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,880
But why?

983
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:57,960
It's simple.

984
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,320
Because I am also a coroner.

985
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,630
I will also participate in this contest.

986
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,630
If I don't expel you,

987
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,830
during the contest,

988
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:08,190
you would certainly

989
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,510
hold back because I'm your mentor

990
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,710
and wouldn't use

991
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,100
your full abilities

992
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,550
when competing against me.

993
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:15,070
What if this

994
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,590
ruins your future?

995
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,240
Wouldn't that be a shame?

996
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,710
Master, you're overthinking this.

997
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:22,190
I...

998
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,320
No.

999
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,920
What I mean is,

1000
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,630
at your age,

1001
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,000
do you really need to participate

1002
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,330
in a Coroners' Contest?

1003
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,580
I've been a coroner my whole life.

1004
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,490
I also want to use my skills

1005
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,160
to remove my lowly status

1006
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,710
and enter the county office.

1007
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,590
Moreover,

1008
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,110
I have a daughter.

1009
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,960
I must consider her future, too.

1010
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,480
Master.

1011
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,080
If that's the reason,

1012
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,150
I can withdraw

1013
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,030
from the contest.

1014
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:48,830
Zhong Shizai,

1015
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,800
you may go now.

1016
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:53,480
During the contest,

1017
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,880
neither of us should think of
our master-apprentice relationship.

1018
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,510
Master!
