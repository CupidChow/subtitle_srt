To Chang'an]

00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,970
[Episode 17]

3
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,870
Thank you both for seeing me off.

4
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:48,820
Du.

5
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,930
Ninghu is prosperous.

6
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,120
After you get there,

7
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,850
you won't suffer any hardship.

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,340
I just remembered—

9
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:57,560
you once served
as the magistrate of Ninghu.

10
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,350
Indeed I did.

11
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,560
But I've also heard

12
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,670
that place is crawling with alligators.

13
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:03,950
If you don't provoke them,

14
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,080
they won't bite you.

15
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,440
Still not as good as Guanzhong.

16
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,450
I heard they have good wine though.

17
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,740
What's it called again?

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,990
Nantian Wine.

19
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,560
Right.

20
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,280
Exactly.

21
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,410
That's the name.

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,900
Once I'm in Ninghu,

23
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,950
I'll finally get to enjoy

24
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,530
some Nantian Wine.

25
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,390
Du, are you happy

26
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,450
or not happy?

27
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,400
Of course I'm not happy.

28
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,240
I got demoted.

29
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,630
How could I possibly be happy?

30
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,290
But your face says otherwise.

31
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,680
You look absolutely thrilled.

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,860
Like you got exactly what you wanted.

33
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,930
Nonsense.

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,910
Su Wuming,

35
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,750
you're such a fraud!

36
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,680
Y-You fooled the Emperor.

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,150
You fraud.

38
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:53,600
But since you came to see me off,

39
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,510
I won't hold it against you.

40
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,240
Lu Lingfeng,

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,480
you're a true gentleman.

42
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,960
Upright and skilled
in both civil and military arts.

43
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,160
You're a rare talent.

44
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,000
By rights,

45
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,520
after killing that monster Ao Tian

46
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,080
and keeping the capital safe,

47
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,520
you should be promoted

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,840
and take my place
as Yongzhou's Chief Administrator.

49
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,170
It's a pity I don't make that call.

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,970
I wish you good luck.

51
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,030
Actually,

52
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,420
I once served under Master Di too.

53
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,680
Though I'm not as good
at catching criminals as Lu Lingfeng,

54
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,360
nor as sharp as Su Wuming with cases,

55
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,420
once I'm in Ninghu,

56
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,960
I'll still find a way

57
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,220
to put my skills to use.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,520
I'm off.

59
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,150
Gotta say,

60
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,000
the real winner here is His Majesty.

61
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,079
He sent me
to bury the four Imperial Guards

62
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,590
and wouldn't let Du Ming come along.

63
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,450
Do you know why?

64
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,400
To prevent others from seeing the bodies

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,820
and exposing your lie.

66
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,190
Exactly.

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,630
Seizing the opportunity

68
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,990
during chaos

69
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,600
and turning the Tang Empire's fate around,

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,710
His Majesty is no ordinary ruler.

71
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,310
He's truly admirable.

72
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,560
Not finding the real Bai Ze

73
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
was expected.

74
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,920
Nothing to feel down about.

75
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,870
It's just that...

76
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,040
Du Ming had sided with me,

77
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,600
but now he's kicked out of the capital.

78
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,310
The Princess

79
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,000
has recommended three people in a row.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,800
I turned them all down,

81
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,960
but if she brings up another name,

82
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,350
I'm afraid

83
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,670
I won't even have a good excuse
to reject it.

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,600
What do you think of Lu Lingfeng?

85
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,430
Your Majesty,

86
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,600
you've worked so hard

87
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,930
to get where you are now.

88
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,430
Yongzhou's Chief Administrator

89
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:02,160
is such an important position.

90
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,570
You must not act rashly

91
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,580
or easily give it to someone else.

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,950
But I

93
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,370
currently have no one suitable to use.

94
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:21,920
Xiong Qiannian's been back
in Chang'an for days.

95
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,780
I've been watching him in secret.

96
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,480
He hasn't had any contact

97
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
with the Princess's people.

98
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,730
He's been waiting
for Your Majesty's favor.

99
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,920
Xiong Qiannian?

100
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,380
He used to serve in the court.

101
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:36,830
It was only later

102
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:39,030
that he became the Governor of Nanzhou.

103
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,490
He is indeed a suitable candidate.

104
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,000
How could I have forgotten him?

105
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:48,480
Lu.

106
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,950
Su.

107
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,970
Governor Xiong, how have you been?

108
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,430
That title from my Nanzhou post…

109
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,950
I find it

110
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,600
quite endearing.

111
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,130
You've got the title wrong.

112
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,750
I am Su Wuming, a humble official.

113
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,120
Greetings, Chief Administrator Xiong.

114
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:18,550
Official?

[Xiong Qiannian,
Governor of Nanzhou Prefecture]

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,360
I just checked the roster.

117

[Xiong Qiannian,
Yongzhou's Chief Administrator]

118
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,830
There's no record

119
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:27,070
of any position you hold.

120
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:29,470
Su Wuming

121
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,150
is currently
the Criminal Scholar of Yongzhou.

122
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,150
He works under me.

123
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,240
Criminal Investigation Scholar?

124
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,560
Is that an official position
recognized by the Ministry of Personnel?

125
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:46,220
Du Ming was truly absurd.

126
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Someone as gifted as Su

127
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,270
shouldn't have been given

128
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,330
some vague and unofficial-sounding

129
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,310
"scholar" title.

130
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,830
Then tell me, Chief Administrator Xiong,

131
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,310
what position

132
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:05,510
should someone like me hold?

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,240
We must follow the court's regulations.

134
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,650
However,

135
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,310
I value friendship highly.

136
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,090
Aren't you also

137
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,920
the Chief of Secret Agents?

138
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,720
You can continue with that role.

139
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,120
I have no objections.

140
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,360
Furthermore,

141
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,560
once there's an opportunity,

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,820
I will certainly recommend you.

143
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,920
His Majesty is eager
to find talented people.

144
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
I believe that in the near future,

145
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,680
-you'll surely…
-I'll surely become like you,

146
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,770
wearing the robes of high rank.

147
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,600
I wouldn't dare to hope for that.

[Su Wuming, Criminal Scholar of Yongzhou]

149
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,570
Since my name doesn't appear

[Su Wuming,
Chief of Secret Agents of Yongzhou]

151
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,159
on the Yongzhou officials' roster,

152
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,800
I'll take my leave now.

153
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,720
I suppose

154
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,950
the newly appointed Chief Administrator

155
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,800
and the Judicial Official

156
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,190
must have much official business
to discuss.

157
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,250
I'll take my leave.

158
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,010
I'll take my leave.

00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,270
Su.

160

Su.

161
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,410
Look at him.

162
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,370
Su Wuming is one of the Princess's men.

163
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,170
She made him the so-called

164
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,490
Criminal Investigation Scholar.

165
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,600
Thank you for the heads-up.

166
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,630
I

167
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,420
know what to do now.

168
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,510
Lord Yan.

169
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,600
Lord Yan?

170
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:28,990
It really is him.

171
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
What took you so long?

172
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,330
I've been waiting for an hour.

173
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,960
Don't be upset, my lord.

174
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,790
The flight over Qinling
and Jianghuai was smooth.

175
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,420
But over Dongting Lake,

176
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,080
a heavy fog suddenly arose.

177
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,050
I got lost

178
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,200
and ended up flying toward Huating.

179
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,630
I had to turn around again.

180
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,290
That's why I was delayed.

181
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,960
Did you miss me?

Let's talk about Meng Buyi first.

185

We've rekindled our relationship.

186
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,820
Hasn't he noticed?

187
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,080
How could he notice?

188
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,240
He works the night shift
at the county office every day.

You're on night duty again tonight?

195
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,180
Would you like me

196
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,470
to get you some tasty food?

197
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:46,030

Your wife is truly considerate.

201
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,350
Indeed she is.

202
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,700
I heard

203
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,360
that the book you wrote,

204
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,510
"Strange Tales of the Divine Capital,"

205
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:01,810

You must have made quite a fortune.

208
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,010
How enviable.

00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,240

Rest assured, Secretary.

Don't put it like that.

306

am kinda famous, you know.

307
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,200
The strange tales I write,

308
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,510
bookstores will be fighting over them,

309
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:32,080
and they'll sell for a high price!

310
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,810
Who else has stories like mine?

311
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,440
And the key is—I write them well!

312
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,240

come over here.

313

-Great!
-Come on.

315
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:43,670

You were personally taught by Master Di,

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
yet you want to write strange tales?

322
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,960
Are you worthy of his teaching?

323
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,880
But I have to make a living!

324
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,960
I can't let everyone support me, can I?

325
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,870
I'd feel ashamed.

326
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:03,960

327
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,790
isn't worth a dime.

328
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:05,720
Just swallow it.

329
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,640

331
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,069
Harsh?

334
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,720
Not forever.

335
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,599
Master Di was a wise man.

336
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,250
He saw beyond the horizon.

337
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,720
He valued you

338
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,270
because he wanted you to become

339
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,470
a pillar of the state.

340
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,390

about ghosts and demons

342
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,010
to fool children.

343
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,400
That's a bit biased.

344
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,110
It's not just children

345
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:33,720
Exactly!

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,400
You see?

349
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,750
I won't argue with you.

350
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,750
In short,

351
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,440
this path won't work.

352
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,200
I forbid it.

353
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,830
I have an idea

354
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,920
that I've been thinking about for a while.

355
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,580
Since

356
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,120

357
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,420
may I tell you about it?

358
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,880
Xijun,

359
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,670
this is your home.

360
00:17:57,830 --> 00:17:59,110
You're the hostess.

361
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:00,390
Come over here

362
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,590
and say whatever you want.

363
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,410
Come on.

364
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,160
Master.

365
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,240
I grew up in Chang'an.

366
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,070
Now that I'm back,

367
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,440
I've come to love this place

368
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,670
even more.

369
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,160

370
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,750
to all 110 districts.

371
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,800
They are all busy and thriving.

372
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,830
No wonder Chang'an is
the greatest city in the world.

373
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:22,230
Just talking about food—

374
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:23,350
delicacies from everywhere

375
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:24,550
can all be found here,

376
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,240
except for one thing.

377
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,200
It's something I've been

378
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,830
dreaming about lately.

379
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,470
We all had it

380
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,160
in Shazhou Prefecture.

381
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,940
Sushan?

382
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,880
Yes,

383
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,070
sushan.

384
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,240
If we could bring that Dunhuang treat

385
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,100
to Chang'an,

386
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,510
then during the scorching summer,

387
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,770
the people of Chang'an

388
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,270
would have something wonderful to enjoy.

389
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,030
That would be a worthy deed.

390
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,920
So you want

391
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,000
to open a shop?

392
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:54,880
Yes.

393
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,750
To open a sushan shop.

394
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:57,960
As for the location,

395
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,750
we could choose Shengye District,

396
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,590
Pingkang District,

397
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,960
or the East and West Markets.

398
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,560
It doesn't need to be too big,

399
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,270
but it can't be too small either.

400
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,070
The decor needs to be refined

401
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,920
because those who enjoy this delicacy

402
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,720
aren't just eating to satisfy hunger.

403
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,350
Also,

404
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,150
we can innovate on its recipe.

405
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,440
Chang'an is different from Shazhou.

406
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,110
We've got way more seasonal fruits.

407
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:18,900
So sushan

408
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,930
can have a variety of flavors here.

409
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,030
Rice is expensive in Chang'an,

410
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:24,430
and housing even more so.

411
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,200
Opening a shop

412
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,900
requires a lot of capital.

413
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,100
I can sell one of my houses.

414
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,600
You'll sell this house?

415
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,550
This was left by Minister Pei.

416
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,720
Besides, we're comfortable living here.

417
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,580
If you sell it, where will we live?

418
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,600
Fei,

419
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:42,680
you clearly don't know

420
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,940
how rich Miss Xijun is.

421
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,880
Besides this house

422
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,140
in Chongren District,

423
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,210
Miss Xijun

424
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,410
has two more houses in Xuanyang

425
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,810
and Yanshou Districts.

426
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,480
In such prime locations,

427
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,540
those houses must be very expensive.

428
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,780
It seems Minister Pei's position

429
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,280
is quite profitable.

430
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,960
Master Fei.

431
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,050
You misunderstand.

432
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,070
My father only
receives a salary from the court

433
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,070
and has never taken any dirty money.

434
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,420
These three houses

435
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,480
were all bought
after we sold our ancestral properties.

436
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,740
My father asked me then

437
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,460
what I'd do with the money.

438
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,800
I said I'd buy houses.

439
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,750
Because Chang'an is beautiful

440
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,550
and the heart of the Tang Empire.

441
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,210
Everyone in the world wants to live here.

442
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,510
Xijun, you're remarkable.

443
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,480
If I had

444
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,610
a daughter like you,

445
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,240
I wouldn't have spent years

446
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,970
wandering in the Ghost Market.

447
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,100
Then,

448
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,270
don't call me Miss Pei anymore.

449
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,960
It's Boss Pei now.

450
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:40,920
-No!
-No!

451
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,820
Official Lu, you speak first.

452
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,340
Because of Ouyang Quan
from Nanzhou Prefecture

453
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,310
and Sima Liang from Yunding County,

454
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,480
I have greatly changed my view

455
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,530
of merchants.

456
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:53,650
But after all,

457
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,020
Xijun comes from the Pei family of Hedong.

458
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,410
If people find out,

459
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:00,830
your family might not tolerate it.

460
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,020
That's true.

461
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,530
If one day

462
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,920
Minister Pei returns

463
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,330
and questions this,

464
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,720
as her sworn brother,

465
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,520
I wouldn't be able to explain it.

466
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,020
How about this?

467
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,350
If you trust me, Xijun,

468
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,270
I can be

469
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,920
the boss instead.

470
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,770
That won't work either.

471
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,280
You still disagree?

472
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,310
You'd certainly be good at business.

473
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,110
That's right.

474
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,550
What about your position

475
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,110
as the Chief of Secret Agents?

476
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,640
Think carefully.

477
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,110
The secret agents work in secret,

478
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,650
but they help solve cases,

479
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,960
catch criminals, and protect

480
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,830
the capital.

481
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,230
And you once said

482
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,510
you'd devote yourself

483
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,970
to the people of Chang'an.

484
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,110
Are you going to go back on your word?

485
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:43,830
Being the boss of the sushan shop

486
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,440
and the Chief of Secret Agents

487
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,750
aren't in conflict!

488
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,060
As a secret agent,

489
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,500
you should remain behind the scenes.

490
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
If the sushan shop becomes popular,

491
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:53,640
everyone in Chang'an

492
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,860
will recognize you.

493
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,020
How can you stay

494
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,240
in the shadows then?

495
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,390
That does make sense.

496
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,220
In that case,

497
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,720
who better to run the sushan shop

498
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,800
than me, Fei Yingjun?

499
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,130
All in favor, raise your hands.

500
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,560
Master Fei is perfect for this.

501
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:16,840
I agree.

502
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,640
Whether you two raise your hands

503
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,720
doesn't matter anymore.

504
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,110
There are already four hands.

505
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,170
That's a majority.

506
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,310
From now on,

507
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:38,550
stop calling me Fei,

508
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,320
Master Fei,

509
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:42,000
or

510
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,370
Miracle Doctor Fei.

511
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,900
You should call me

512
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,850
Boss Fei!

513
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,680
I've thought of a name

514
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,830
for our sushan shop.

515
00:22:50,030 --> 00:22:53,510
It'll be called Liuhe Sushan Shop.

516
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,420
The six of us

517
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,830
will work together as one

518
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,110
to make a fortune.

519
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,580
Business will be booming!

520
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,090
Say "business thriving" from now on.

521
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:07,590
W-What's wrong with "booming"?

522
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,340
It's a taboo—same as the Emperor's name.

523
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,400
I'll say it anyway.

524
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,380
Booming, booming,

525
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,150
booming!

526
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,980
Lu Lingfeng,

527
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:19,400
it's fine to say it at home.

528
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:21,160
Xiong Qiannian is audacious!

529
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,010
[Crucial Nexus]

530
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,440
The position
of Criminal Investigation Scholar

531
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,880
was created by me for Su Wuming.

532
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,080
Doesn't he know that?

533
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,800
Of course he knows.

534
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,250
So you're saying

535
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,610
Xiong Qiannian
has allied himself with His Majesty?

536
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:37,640
We recommended three candidates

537
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,720
for Yongzhou's Chief Administrator.

538
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,200
His Majesty rejected them all.

539
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,840
Now,

540
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,790
Xiong has suddenly taken that post,

541
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,690
clearly becoming
His Majesty's loyal supporter.

542
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,910
So as soon as he took office,

543
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,070
he kicked Su Wuming

544
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,070
out of Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

545
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,630
This is clearly targeted at me.

546
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,420
Forgive my frankness,

547
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,520
but this might not be a bad thing.

548
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,510
What do you mean?

549
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:00,430
Su Wuming,

550
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,240
though promoted by Your Highness,

551
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,040
may not be

552
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,200
completely loyal to you.

553
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,110
Think about the Mount Zhongnan trip.

554
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,370
That nonsense about hearing Bai Ze's cry

555
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,000
was clearly meant to protect

556
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,480
His Majesty's reputation.

557
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,350
Without a doubt,

558
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,240
it must have been

559
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,980
fabricated by Su Wuming.

560
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,810
He plays both sides.

561
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,340
Not someone you can truly rely on.

562
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Unlike you—utterly loyal.

563
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:27,790
I promoted him

564
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,200
at the wrong time.

565
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,240
Su Wuming

566
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,110
was demoted from Vice Minister
of the Judicial Review Court,

567
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,880
and now, he's even lost his title

00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,380
I'll have a golden plaque made

757
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,930
and sent to you another day.

758
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,500
I, Fei,

759
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,880
am now one of the Princess's people!

760
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,480
Hurry up

761
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,560
and invite the Princess inside

762
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,120
to taste some sushan.

763
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:27,680
Okay.

764
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,860
Your Highness,

765
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,770
please try some sushan.

766
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,830
Sushan...

767
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,720
I've heard envoys
from the Western Region mention it,

768
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,500
but I have never tasted it.

769
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,000
Today's the perfect time.

770
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,300
Let's try it together.

771
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,200
Yes.

[Liuhe Sushan Shop]

773
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,740
I want to try it too.

774
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,790
I want some as well.

775
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:55,990
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

776
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,550
Xijun?

777
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,950
You're helping out here too?

778
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,270
More than just helping.

779
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,760
She paid for everything!

780
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:18,960
I made these three servings

781
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,220
of sushan myself.

782
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:22,310
Please try them, Your Highness.

783
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,000
So this is how it tastes.

784
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,550
Special.

785
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,030
Wonderful!

786
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
The Princess says

787
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,989
the sushan tastes wonderful!

788
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,630
Shout with me.

789
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:26,219
The Princess says

790
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,929
the Sushan tastes wonderful!

791
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,360
The Princess says it's wonderful.

792
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,290
Chancellor Cui.

793
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:35,840
Don't just stand there.

794
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,360
Try it later.

795
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,159
It's really delicious.

796
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

797
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,920
The Princess also says

798
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,520
sushan is really delicious.

799
00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:48,860
The Princess says it's delicious!

800
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,630
The Princess came to congratulate

801
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,710
on the opening of the shop

802
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:52,960
and tasted it herself.

803
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,800
This thing must taste amazing.

804
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,590
Exactly!

805
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,590
Who was saying earlier

806
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,690
that it might upset the stomach?

807
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:59,150
That's nonsense!

808
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,370
You were the one who said it.

809
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,630
You said it.

810
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,710
Did I say that?

811
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,480
To eat the same food

812
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,440
as the Princess,

813
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,960
even if I get a stomachache,
I'll accept it!

814
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,050
After the Princess leaves,

815
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,840
I'll be the first one to enter the shop

816
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,760
to eat sushan.

817
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,480
Right.

818
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,330
Me too.

819
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:15,360
I'll eat sushan.

820
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,290
I'll eat sushan.

821
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,190
Chancellor Cui, your sushan is ready.

822
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,840
Since you didn't actually
go into business,

823
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,970
come serve in the Princess's Mansion.

824
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,880
You'll start as a Consultant Official,

825
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,510
then be promoted to Chief Administrator.

826
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,440
Happy with that?

827
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,700
Your Highness,

828
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,840
perhaps not.

829
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,030
Do you find the position too low?

830
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:53,400
Then how about the Princess's Consultant?

831
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,260
I don't find the position too low.

832
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,290
I just...

833
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:59,360
I can't bear to leave Lu Lingfeng.

834
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,550
Although I am no longer
the Criminal Investigation Scholar,

835
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:05,150
I'm still the Chief of Secret Agents,
aren't I?

836
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,740
This post,

837
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,270
though not an official position,

838
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,840
is extremely important

839
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,880
to the Judicial Official.

840
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,840
Since Lu Lingfeng took office

841
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,920
in Yongzhou Prefecture,

842
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,840
he's established the Mobile Court,

843
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,280
handling cases in each district

844
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,940
and winning people's hearts.

845
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
However,

846
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,880
the capital

847
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,330
has a population of over a million.

848
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,510
The backlog of cases is truly too large.

849
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,190
I'm afraid Lu Lingfeng

850
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,940
will collapse from overwork.

851
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Therefore, I beg you, Your Highness,

852
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,880
to allow me to stay by his side

853
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,810
to offer him advice and strategies

854
00:36:41,190 --> 00:36:43,320
and help solve his problems.

855
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,150
Rest assured, Your Highness,

856
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:47,320
I will do my utmost

857
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,320
to assist him.

858
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,370
Are you saying that

859
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,030
because you are afraid

860
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,510
of offending that person?

861
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,590
With Your Highness valuing me so highly,

862
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,590
within the Tang Empire,

863
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:05,550
who would I have to fear?

864
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,480
Don't play dumb.

865
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,890
However, I do approve

866
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,230
of your excuse.

867
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,000
My son, Lu Lingfeng,

868
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,590
truly needs someone like you

869
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,920
to assist him.

870
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,080
Before long,

871
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,100
my son will surely
rise to the highest ranks.

872
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,400
By then,

873
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,920
you won't be beneath him in status.

874
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,050
In that case,

875
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,460
thank you, Your Highness.

876
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:36,110
Get Pei Xijun here.

877
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,220
Your Highness.

878
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,180
Sit.

879
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,460
I dare not.

880
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,360
If I tell you to sit, then sit.

881
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

882
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,760
My son is stubborn.

883
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,710
Do you often argue with him?

884
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:18,600
Sometimes we do.

885
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,930
But he always gives in to me.

886
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:24,690
Then he treats you much better
than he treats me.

887
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,510
The other day,
when I went to check on his injury,

888
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,090
we got into an argument.

889
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,230
He wouldn't budge an inch.

890
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,170
Lu Lingfeng must have

891
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,930
been tormented by his pain

892
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,490
and spoken some nonsense.

893
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,700
Although Lu Lingfeng is reserved,

894
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:44,310
he is not a fickle person.

895
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,520
In the future,

896
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,760
he will surely treat you well.

897
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,340
The shop is opening today.

898
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:54,240
Why didn't Lu Lingfeng come?

899

is in Qinglong District today.

-It's starting.
-Let's go.

Well, basically,

that's what happened.

906
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:24,170
It can hardly be called a case.

907
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,000
If we're late,
there won't be any seats left.

908

910

will just resolve it ourselves.

It's not a big deal anyway.

912
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,230
All right.

913
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:38,010
Try to get along with your neighbors.

914

Isn't this exactly what

925

we've been hoping for?

926
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,630
What kind of dance is that?

927
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:01,630
