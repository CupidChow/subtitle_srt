This...

4
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,360
That shot was really accurate,

5
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,310
but

6
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,430
you still have to get it into the goal

7
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,360
to score.

8
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,400
Maybe you were too far away
just now.

00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,430
Try to get a bit closer

10
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,360
and take another shot, Khan.

11
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,430
We'll have to switch to another ball

12
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,490
if we want to score.

13
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,750
Score!

14
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,000
The Tang Team scores!

15
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,960
2 to 1!

16
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,000
Excellent! Nice shot!

17
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:06,870
This...

18
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,080
What's going on with
the Yenisei Kirghiz Team?

19
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,400
Why aren't they aiming for the goal?

20
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,750
They hit the ball into the Qu River.

21
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,720
-What a pity.
-It should've been a nice shot.

00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,620
What even was that?

24
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,269
How could you play like that?

25
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,680
How could you hit
such a precious polo ball

26
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,560
into the water?

27
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,740
It's not a big deal.

28
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,250
We have spare balls.

29
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,950

make the Dragon Pearl catch fire

35

and then blow up the stands,

36
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,830
creating a bloodbath

of our Tang Empire?

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,310
What?

39
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,840
Are there your accomplices
in the stands?

Dismount and surrender now!

45
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
The name of Yenisei Kirghiz Khan

46
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,380
is not something
you can just call casually!

47
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,750
Yenisei Kirghiz Khan,

48
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,630
since you've already come to Chang'an,

49
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,230
why use someone else's name?

50
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,730
In that case,

51
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,830
you can't blame
our Court of State Ceremonials

52
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,890
for poor hospitality.

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:47,990
How did you know my identity?

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,900
We never doubted you identity

56
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,560
as Natie before.

57
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,000
But if there's anyone to blame,

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,720

Give me that soup then.

68
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,800
You Yenisei Kirghiz people actually
believe in Old Lady Meng too?

69
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,730
I've been in Chang'an for 14 years,

70
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,840
so of course I believe in it.

71

how the newly appointed

Yongzhou's Chief Administrator,
Xiong Qiannian,

106
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,510
is actually a spy of Yenisei Kirghiz

secretly stationed in a foreign land
as a third-rank official,

108

which is unprecedented,

109
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,840

during the Battle of Wushan Gorge!

117
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,550
You're right.

118
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,870
That was my first time

119
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:36,120
representing Yenisei Kirghiz
on the battlefield,

120
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,030

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,870
That's how I later got the chance

to become a general,

125
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,630

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,520

from back then

130
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,600

embroidered into the dragon pattern

of the stands.

collide with it,

00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:20,630
how could our Yenisei Kirghiz

190
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,030
ever dominate the world?

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,550
Khan...

192
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,920
Stop calling me that!

193
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,550
Attack!

194
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,280
W-What's happening?

195
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,840
What's going on?

196
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,900
What's happening?

197
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,670
What are they doing?

198
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,270
They've gotten into a fight!

199
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,440
-Someone got hit!
-Exactly!

200
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,500
What's this about?

201
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,390
-Don't move!
-Don't move!

202
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,720
-Sit down!
-Don't move!

203
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,910
Watch out!

204
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,960
Xiong, you traitor!

205
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,390
I, Li Zhuang, under the General's orders,

206
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:22,920
have been waiting for you
for quite some time!

207
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,150
[Peace and prosperity]

208
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,390
I'm here under Su Wuming's orders

209
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,850
to protect Your Highness.

210
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,870
Xiong.

211
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,840
If you know what's good for you,
surrender now!

212
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,530
I didn't expect

213
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,430
you'd actually have some skill!

214
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,120
Did you think I only know

215
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,670
ceremonial protocols?

216
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:14,570
Don't move!

217
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,390
[Peace and prosperity]

218
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,390
Cover this place!

219
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,960
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

220
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:53,630
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

221
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:58,440
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

222
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:02,600
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

223
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,840
The finals aren't over yet.

224
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,630
Khan Nasha.

225
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,390
Although your plot has been foiled,

226
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,790
the match is not over yet.

227
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,630
You still have a chance to defeat

228
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,230
our Tang Empire on the field.

229
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,080
So,

230
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:16,960
do you have the courage?

231
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,800
Your Majesty!

232
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,270
Such a grand event—

233
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,880
wouldn't it be a shame to quit halfway?

234
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,760
If we continue the match,

235
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,520
aren't you afraid
I'll strike at you again?

236
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,960
The rulers of our Tang Empire
are all emperors on horseback.

237
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,200
What's there to fear
from a mere Yenisei Kirghiz?

238
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,330
Then let's compete!

239
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,440
Alright!

240
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,080
The finals of
the international polo tournament

241
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,030
will continue!

242
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,270
The Tang Team led by me

243
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,630
will face the Yenisei Kirghiz Team

244
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,950
led by Yenisei Kirghiz Khan once again!

245
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,390
Minister Pei.

246
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,349
I heard that.

247
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,640
The finals continue!

248
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,790
The Tang Team

249
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,890
led by His Majesty, the Tang Emperor,

250
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,160
will face the Yenisei Kirghiz Team

251
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,349
led by Yenisei Kirghiz Khan, Nasha,
once again!

252
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:16,000
The match continues!

253
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:17,920
The Tang Team

254
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,089
led by His Majesty, the Tang Emperor,

255
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:22,920
will face the Yenisei Kirghiz Team

256
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,579
led by Yenisei Kirghiz Khan, Nasha,
once again!

257
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,750
Yenisei Kirghiz warriors!

258
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,920
We must win it back

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,830
on the field!

260
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,110
Yes!

261
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Xiong Qiannian.

262
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:35,920
[Peace and prosperity]

263
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,650
Do you have a grudge against me?

264
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,480
No.

265
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,880
Then why did you try to assassinate me?

266
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,210
Because I hate.

267
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,270
I hate your mother, Wu Zhao.

268
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,400
Why is that?

269
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,510
At this point,

270
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,100
what's the use of explaining?

271
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,240
Kill me or flay me as you wish.

272
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,110
Just do it.

273
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:58,720
You...

274
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,030
Let me explain it for you.

275
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,070
[Peace and prosperity]

276
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,000
Xiong Qiannian.

277
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,000
Back in Nanzhou Prefecture,

278
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,550
you were quite kind to me.

279
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,550
I, Su Wuming,

280
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,750
thank you for that first.

281
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,590
Save it.

282
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,350
How did you come to suspect me?

283
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,350
That Xiong Qiannian

284
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,830
is actually quite nice.

285
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,560
You all ignored my meals,

286
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,350
but he took care of me.

287
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:38,160
He came with his whole family,
and he even brought good wine.

288
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,750
You met Xiong Qiannian?

289
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,510
Yes.

290
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,680
Right after I finished treating
Sun Zi's wounds,

291
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,810
I ran into Chief Administrator Xiong.

292
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:47,590
When he treated me to drinks,

293
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,110
he also showed great interest in

294
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,840
your investigation progress.

295
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,030
Is that so?

296
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,030
My night watch

297
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,030
at Dayan Pagoda

298
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
wasn't in vain after all.

299
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,440
I thought of someone

300
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,000
who's been appearing frequently,

301
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,660
someone with a special status

302
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,480
who could actually affect
Chang'an's safety.

303
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,720
For the polo tournament
to proceed smoothly,

304
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,920
I, Lu Lingfeng, must look into this.

305
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,000
You're referring to...

306
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,720
Xiong Qiannian.

307
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,830
[Peace and prosperity]

308
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,630
The reason we came to suspect you

309
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,110
wasn't just because

310
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,790
you used Chicken Fei
to probe into the case,

311
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,880
nor merely because of

312
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,150
what you did at Dayan Pagoda.

313
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,790
It was also because of

314
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,400
that worn-out Heavenly King mask
you brought from Nanzhou

315
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
and left behind at the Ghost Market.

316
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,810
And these are enough to count as evidence?

317
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,350
Su Wuming.

318
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:45,680
You did solve many cases

319
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,070
back in Nanzhou,

320
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,200
but luck played a big part.

321
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,800
As Master Di's disciple,

322
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,120
you're nothing special.

323
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,070
[Peace and prosperity]

324
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,790
Xiong Qiannian, oh Xiong Qiannian.

325
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:04,720
You're the chief official of the capital.

326
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,030
Without permission from above,

327
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:09,640
I, a mere Wannian County Sheriff,

328
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,790
would never dare

329
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,240
to search your residence.

330
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,440
But if I did search,

331
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,960
I'm certain

332
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:18,640
I would find the masks

333
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,200
of the Four Heavenly Kings,

334
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,590
and also

335
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:34,270
the items you used
to impersonate Six Fingers.

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,160
Your impersonation
of Six Fingers was brilliant,

337
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,510
which temporarily misled

338
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,920
our investigation,

339
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,790
until Official Lu brought

340
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
your file from the Ministry of War.

341
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,200
This is

342
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:50,790
the official personnel record

343
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,790
I borrowed from the Ministry of War.

344
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:52,450
Take a look.

345
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,880
Xiong Qiannian once served in
the Heyuan Army?

346
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,830
Back in Nanzhou Prefecture,

347
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:07,790
he never mentioned that.

348
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,310
That's right.

349
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,350
Officials of our Tang Empire

350
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,480
usually take pride

351
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,410
in their military service.

352
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:17,000
So why didn't he mention it?

353
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,000
At that time, I served as an army adjutant

354
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,310
in the Heyuan army,

355
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,510
maneuvering against the Yenisei Kirghiz

356
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,110
under Heichi Changzhi's command.

357
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,830
Many battles took place,

358
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,160
but the one that changed my life

359
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:33,110
was the Battle of Wushan Gorge.

360
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,220
That should have been
in the second year of Chuigong.

361
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,400
[Peace and prosperity]

362
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,070
Our vanguard was ambushed

363
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,170
by the Yenisei Kirghiz in the valley.

364
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,350
Three thousand soldiers
were attacked from front and rear,

365
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,160
and the entire army
was nearly wiped out.

366
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,880
Only you, Xiong Qiannian,

367
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,270
led the survivors

368
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,350
and, against all odds,

369
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,680
escaped the peril.

370
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,440
I never actually escaped.

371
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,550
We didn't get far before

372
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,610
the hundred or so men under my command

373
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,960
were once again surrounded

374
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,020
by the enemy in the peaks and valleys.

375
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,350
I knew the Yenisei Kirghiz

376
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,830
had the cruel habit of killing captives,

377
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,290
so I negotiated with them,

378
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:07,310
asking them

379
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,480
to spare the other soldiers' lives

380
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,620
in exchange for my surrender.

381
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,400
But they

382
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,510
insisted I become their spy.

383
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,000
I didn't want to submit.

384
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:21,350
But for

385
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:23,480
the lives of my hundred or so comrades,

386
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,030
I finally...

387
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,240
[Peace and prosperity]

388
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,790
We agreed on a story,

389
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,680
that when we were surrounded,

390
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,070
suddenly on the hillside,

391
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,680
the Four Heavenly Kings appeared

392
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,590
and helped us break through
the encirclement,

393
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,070
and then we swore a blood oath

394
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,030
to keep the secret for life!

395
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,590
Thus,

396
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,690
though I was exiled to Nanzhou
for over 20 years,

397
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,920
I finally made it to this day.

398
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,350
But I regret it.

399
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:54,680
I should never have

400
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,030
returned to Chang'an.

401
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,920
If I hadn't returned to Chang'an,

402
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,670
perhaps the Yenisei Kirghiz

403
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,960
would never have found me.

404
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,720
[Peace and prosperity]

405
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,180
When two armies are at war,

406
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,200
this is a common occurrence.

407
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,200
Those with integrity earn respect

408
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,810
and are remembered
by future generations as heroes;

409
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,720
while those who failed to
keep their integrity

410
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,240
like you, Xiong Qiannian,

411
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,210
will surely be despised
by future generations!

412
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,830
Why do you think we were defeated?

413
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,750
It was all because your mother

414
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,270
sent her trusted followers
to interfere with our military operations.

415
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:37,920
Otherwise, Wushan Gorge

416
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:41,030
wouldn't have been covered with corpses!

417
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,590
Your Highness,

418
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,920
I think there's no need
to waste words on him.

419
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,160
I'll behead him immediately

420
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,090
and use his blood

421
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,440
to warn those

422
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,040
restless foreign nations!

423
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,790
Don't!

424
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,070
Today is the day of the finals.

425
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,200
Though accidents have occurred,

426
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,550
blood must not be shed.

427
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
If His Majesty were here,

428
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:03,520
he wouldn't allow you
to act recklessly, either.

429
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,310
Take Xiong Qiannian away.

430
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,110
Your Highness, please wait a moment.

431
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,960
I have one more question for him.

432
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,350
Go ahead.

433
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:14,020
[Peace and prosperity]

434
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,930
Xiong Qiannian.

435
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:19,010
The Ghost Market Intel Stall's information

436
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:20,760
was provided by you, wasn't it?

437
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,060
What was your reason for doing so?

438
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:24,720
Do you think

439
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,350
I truly wanted to see

440
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,790
the Tang Empire fall?

441
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:32,590
I didn't.

442
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,270
I deliberately provided the information

443
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,330
to the Ghost Market

444
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,270
just to see

445
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,680
if there were any capable people

446
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,550
who would step forward to stop

447
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,810
this conspiracy of the Yenisei Kirghiz!

448
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,510
Su Wuming.

449
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,830
Although I knew about

450
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:44,630
your and Lu Lingfeng's methods,

451
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,830
you still

452
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,680
exceeded my expectations.

453
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,680
It seems

454
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,240
you truly have some skills.

456
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,570
How did this turn into
a compliment for me?

457
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,680
Your Highness,

458
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,900
I have no more questions.

459
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,070
[Peace and prosperity]

460
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,730
I still have something to say!

461
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,000
All these years,

462
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,200
I've been torturing myself

463
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,400
with regret.

464
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,480
It was the lie about
the Four Heavenly Kings appearing

465
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,510
that kept me alive.

466
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,810
According to the Yenisei Kirghiz's plan,

467
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,920
this place would have been
engulfed in flames.

468
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,160
I didn't run away

469
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,550
because I wanted to end my life.

470
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,070
When I came to Chang'an,

471
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,590
I bought

472
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,790
the masks of the Four Heavenly Kings
from the Ghost Market.

473
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,590
I've already used 3 of them,

474
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,110
and only

475
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,620
the Guardian of the North's
remains unused.

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000

477
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,510
let me wear that mask

when I'm buried!

479
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,880
You mentioned the Four Heavenly Kings
just now,

480
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,810
so you must be a Buddhist believer.

481
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,640
I will fulfill your wish

482
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,000
and let the masks of
the Four Heavenly Kings

483
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,160
be buried with you.

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,520
in this match,

00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,090
you must give your all.

But...

536
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,090
This is a polo field,

537
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,550
not a battlefield between two armies.

538
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,080
However,

539
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,110
it's also a battlefield
between two armies.

540
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,710
A general on the battlefield

541
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,030

00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:29,150
Since this is a battlefield,

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,330
then I, Lu Lingfeng,

544
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,940
know what must be done.

00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:37,590
Excellent! Great!

565
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,590
leading a team of foreign players
and galloping across the field

566
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,200
with the spirit of
"all under Heaven as one"

567
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,830
fills us with utmost admiration!

568
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,160
Truly, the Heavenly Khan has been reborn!

569
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:49,350
Long live the Heavenly Khan! Long live!

570
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,070

[Grand Princess's Mansion]

574
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,640
Your Highness, have you noticed

575
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,030
that this international polo tournament

576
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,750
has actually become an arena

577
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,480
for him to win people's hearts?

578
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,480
That's not a bad thing, actually.

579
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,480
It helped me figure some things out.

580
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,000
What things?

581
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,070
[Crucial Nexus]

582
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,130
For the things that can't be avoided,

583
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,750
the sooner they happen, the better.

584
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,530
Rather than waiting for the right moment,

585
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,560
it's better to strike first.

586
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,210
Your Highness,

587
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,750
you've made up your mind?

588
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,510
Yes, I have.

589
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:57,680
Your Majesty.

590
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,270
Regarding the position of
Yongzhou's Chief Administrator,

591
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,640
the Princess's Mansion
has been paying close attention.

592
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,500
I can't think of a suitable candidate
at the moment.

593
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:05,720
How about letting

594
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,610
Pei take the position?

595
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,590
Pei Mian?

596
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:10,360
He...

597
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,280
That man has the talent of a Chancellor.

598
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,030
As the Minister of Ceremonials,

599
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,590
he could also serve as
Yongzhou's Chief Administrator

600
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,070
and would certainly excel at it.

601
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:20,760
Noted.

602
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,880
What punishment should be given

603
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,030
to the Yenisei Kirghiz Khan, Nasha?

604
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,840
According to the law of the Tang Empire,

605
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,000
depending on whether he shows remorse,

606
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,330
the relevant officials will handle it
at their discretion.

607
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,670
After all, I've only recently
ascended the throne,

608
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:35,270
and the people need respite.

609
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,370
Waging war at this time

610
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,239
would not be the best course of action.

611
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,630
According to our secret agents,

612
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,920
the Princess's Mansion

613
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,400
seems to be busily

614
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,679
planning something.

615
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,280
Would Your Majesty like to strike first?

616
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:54,320
You bastard!

617
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,679
Your Majesty.

618
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,540
What nonsense are you talking about?

619
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,550
Though fully aware

620
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,030
there might be danger
in the international polo tournament,

621
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:03,590
my aunt

622
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,510
still chose to stand by my side.

623
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,510
With a princess like this,

624
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,550
what's there to guard against?

625
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,630
The discord between my aunt and me

626
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:11,830
was exactly stirred up by people of you!

627
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,030
Get out now!

628
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

630
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:24,360
What did you hear?

631
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,360
I didn't hear anything.

632
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,030
Darling!

633
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,000
Where did this donkey come from?

634
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,670
I bought it.

635
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:52,690
From now on,

636
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,440
it can help you grind beans

637
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:55,760
to make tofu.

638
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:57,960
Then it can carry

639
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,800
the finished tofu to the market to sell.

640
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,860
Most importantly,

641
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,710
if you miss your hometown,

642
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,920
you can ride it

643
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,710
to gallop around Leyouyuan.

644
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,630
Who gallops on a donkey?

645
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,210
It may not run as fast as a horse,

646
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:12,630
but at least I can lead it.

647
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,350
This way, I can be sure

648
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,540
you won't fall off.

649
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:17,880
Honey.

650
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:21,320
Will they really not come to arrest me?

651
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,320
Sheriff Su said

652
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,510
although you were involved in
Nasha's plot,

653
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,550
you provided important information,

654
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:31,030
so your merits offset your crimes.

655
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,630
You've lived in Chang'an for 14 years,

656
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,760
so you should be considered
a Chang'an resident,

657
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,490
which makes you a Tang citizen.

658
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,070
You can register your citizenship
tomorrow.

659
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,710
Really?

660
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:42,440
But

661
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,440
if you marry me,

662
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,630
wouldn't it waste all those years

663
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,830
of your hard studies?

664
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,070
How could it?

665
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:50,960
What if they don't let you

666
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,820
become an official because of me?

667
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,670
Studying is not just for
becoming an official.

668
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:58,550

than fame and fortune.

From now on,

00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,560
I'll farm and you'll weave,

671
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,010
and I can write poems for you every day.

672
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,830
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

673
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,920
Farming and weaving together,

674
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,880
writing poems every day—

675
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,010
that sounds lovely.

have once again—yes, once again—
achieved great merit!

681
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:40,150

682
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,510
how His Majesty and Her Highness

683
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,510
will reward them.

684
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:46,150
They deserve high positions.
The higher, the better.

685
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,590
Or perhaps like me,

686
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,190
they could get a gold medal.

687
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,990
No worries about food and drink—

688
00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,190
that's practical, isn't it?

689
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:56,070
In my opinion,

690
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,630
[Great virtue can carry the world]

691
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:00,630
the one who truly accomplished
great things this time

and the Golden Dragon
paired with the Five Grains

695

symbolize that the nation
depends on the people,

696
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,070
and the people are
the foundation of the nation.

697

This ingenious design

698
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,150
will surely influence our nation

No matter how much
we praise Xijun tonight,

00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,400
it wouldn't be too much.

is this Chang'an?
