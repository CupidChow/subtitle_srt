[Episode 35]

3
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,479
Who discovered the body first?

4
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,280
I did.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,680
Suchan,

6
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,039
the dead cannot be brought back to life.

7
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,280
Now, the priority

8
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,789
is to find the killer,

9
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,710
so as to let Mr. Geng

10
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,280
rest in peace.

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,130
There is no killer.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:05,640
What?

13
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,430
Have you examined the body?

14
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,090
No, I haven't even touched it.

15
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,840
But according to
what my father taught me a few days ago,

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,040
the state of his body was caused
by strychnine poisoning.

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,430
And strychnine...

18
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,030
is exactly what my father

19
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,030
took to relieve the pain from sores.

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,430
I've observed the scene
and found no signs of struggle.

21
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,560
So, I can conclude

22
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,680
that my father

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,670
died of an overdose of strychnine.

24
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,520
I've heard about

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,430
strychnine poisoning,

26
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,230
but never seen it happen before my eyes.

27
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,240
Strychnine is a medicinal material

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,730
that reduces swelling and relieves pain.

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,710
However, it's not commonly seen,

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,520
because patients
can be easily poisoned by it,

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
if it's used without caution.

32
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,120
Once the toxins kick in,

33
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,600
the affected will be in extreme agony.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,310
Their bodies will bend into a rigid arch,
with their heads and feet drawing close,

35
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,560
resembling looms.

36
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,770
This is why it's also called
"the loom poison."

37
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,180
Those poisoned by strychnine

38
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,630
will first experience fatigue

39
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:01,760
and neck stiffness.

40
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,650
Then,

41
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,750
spasms will occur
in their shoulders and thighs,

42
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,810
followed by full-body convulsions.

43
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,880
In the end, their bodies will bend
into bow-like arches.

44
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,770
This last phase
will repeat multiple times.

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,520
It's fair to say this is the worst pain
in the human world.

46
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,210
Based on that what you said,

47
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,170
Mr. Geng was exactly poisoned
by strychnine.

48
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,140
Let me in!

49
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,010
Let me in!

50
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,280
Mentor!

51
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,560
Sheriff Su,

52
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,150
how did my mentor die?

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,370
Has his body been examined?

54
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,520
Not yet.

55
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,079
We suspect
that he consumed too much strychnine,

56
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,080
which resulted in fatal poisoning.

57
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,560
That's impossible.

58
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,870
My mentor
had a good knowledge of medicine.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He knew strychnine is highly toxic.

60
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,970
How could he have taken an overdose of it?

61
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:12,440
Could it be that he didn't

62
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,680
want to live anymore,

63
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,520
given the excruciating pain from sores?

64
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,800
Sometimes people just

65
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:19,019
lose the will to live

66
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,480
in an instant.

67
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,670
Nonsense!

68
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,920
My mentor endured many hardships
all his life.

69
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,520
What hadn't he been through?

70
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,560
How could he have

71
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,830
possibly taken his own life

72
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,120
due to the unbearable pain from sores?

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,310
-What do you think you're doing?
-Senior Yin!

74
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,000
Hands off!

75
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,040
Sheriff Su,

76
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,800
please allow me, Yin Yao,

77
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,960
to examine my mentor's body,

78
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,830
so as to find the real murderer.

79
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,020
I'll allow it.

80
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,270
Suchan,

81
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,120
assist him.

82
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,000
Yes.

87
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,920
I think it's time we issued a notice.

88
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,040
People should be advised not to

89
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,630
pick up life-borrowing pouches again,

90
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,790
if they see any in the streets,

91
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:24,680
especially at intersections.

92
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,560
This act will cause nothing but panic.

93
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,750
I've spent a long time
studying the 6 characters

94
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,070
written on the note
inside the life-borrowing pouch

95
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,270
found by that beggar.

96
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,280
The only thing I'm certain of

97
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:36,260
is that it must haven't been long

98
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,790
since the writer
began learning penmanship.

99
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,320
Mentor!

100
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,870
The autopsy is complete.

101
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,070
Yin Yao now believes his mentor

102
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,200
committed suicide.

103
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,000
My condolences to both of you.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,159
It's time you set up

105
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,790
a mourning hall for Mr. Geng.

106
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,720
Sir,

107
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,800
everyone,

108
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,030
Suchan,

109
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,180
while you're all here,

110
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,100
I'd like to make an announcement.

111
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,870
I owe Mentor a debt of profound gratitude.

112
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,380
Nothing disappointed him

113
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,040
more in his life than my choice
to change my profession.

114
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,310
In Suchan's presence,

115
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,370
he asked me

116
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,270
to co-author

117
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,250
The Autopsy Chronicles

118
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,920
with him,

119
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,950
and return to being a coroner,
bearing that identity.

120
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,750
I didn't agree to it at that time.

121
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,159
But now that I think of it,

122
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:36,620
he was basically using his life
as leverage.

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,060
It was I who caused my mentor's death.

124
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,310
Today,

125
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,690
before my mentor's spirit in heaven,

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,460
I call upon all here to witness

127
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,600
that I, Yin Yao,

128
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,430
will work as a coroner again

129
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,810
and stay in this profession forever.

130
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,120
I will also sign up

131
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:56,220
for the upcoming Coroners' Contest.

132
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,840
I swear to win the championship,

133
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,070
so that the title of "the best coroner"

134
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:03,720
will perpetually
belong to my master's school.

135
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,950
Great. That's good news.

136
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,310
Su Wuming,

137
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,610
despite Mr. Geng's sudden death,

138
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,000
Yin Yao's return to the coroner profession

139
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
is great news.

140
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,600
Shouldn't you be happy?

141
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,930
Didn't Mr. Geng tell you

142
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,630
that given Yin Yao's talent,

143
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,890
he would surely become the best coroner?

144
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,040
Mr. Yin,

145
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,330
I believe

146
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,680
what you just said

147
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:31,130
would bring peace

148
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,020
to Mr. Geng's soul.

149
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,840
But now, the urgent matter

150
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,840
is to quickly set up a mourning hall.

151
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
Are you Mr. Yin?

152
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,630
I'm so grateful to you

153
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,150
for tidying up my father's appearance,

154
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:08,870
thus making

155
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,150
his passing particularly dignified.

156
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,150
Thank you so much.

157
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,130
I was only doing my job.

158
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:32,120
How much is this box of makeup supplies

159
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,360
of mine worth?

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,260
Show me what's inside.

161
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,640
Are you selling them all?

162
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,630
Yes.

163
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
There are indeed many items.

164
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,720
Some are truly good stuff.

165
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,600
I'll offer...

166
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,030
2,000 coins.

167
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,390
I ask for 3,000 coins.

168
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,450
How about 2,300?

169
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,550
3,000 at least.

170
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,640
They were used

171
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:02,000
by the one and only mortician in Chang'an.

172
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,080
After today,

173
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,220
there won't be morticians here anymore.

174
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,960
These makeup tools are for the dead?

175
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,420
Then...

176
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,720
Who will know that if neither of us tell?

177
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,510
If this entire makeup kit

178
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:12,630
were for the living,

179
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,080
you would be charged 6,000 coins at least.

180
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,670
Will you take it for 3,000 coins or not?

181
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,320
Yes, sure.

182
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,000
You're back.

183
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,810
There are 3,000 coins.

184
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,320
Take them.

185
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,470
I sold my makeup kit.

186
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,320
Senior Yin,

187
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,000
I know that makeup kit

188
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,320

Now, look at this.

376
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,490
[Yin Yao is not allowed
to work as a coroner again]

377
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,630
[Yin Yao is not allowed
to work as a coroner again]

378
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,890
That can't be true.

379
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,170
During the three years I was away,

380
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,370
Mentor was drowned in regrets.

381
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,920
He meant to compensate me

382
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,720
by inviting me

383
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,590
to put my name
on The Autopsy Chronicles.

384
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,110
That day, despite the flattering words

385
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,570
he said about morticians,

386
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,580
I was well aware

387
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,810
that he actually wanted me

388
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,030
to return to the coroner profession

389
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,200
and to bring honor to our school.

390
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,310
Mr. Geng already decided

391
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,000
the title of the final chapter

392
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,200
of the last volume

393
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,200
of The Autopsy Chronicles.

394
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,550
[The final chapter:
Why coroners must not kill]

395
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,920
It's called "why coroners must not kill."

396
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:05,770
I also found it hard
to understand the title,

397
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,960
judging from it alone.

398
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:10,110
But after seeing this note,

399
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,910
I figured it out.

400
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,180
Mr. Geng actually dropped a hint.

401
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,070
[Yin Yao is not allowed
to work as a coroner again]

402
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:15,440
[The final chapter:
Why coroners must not kill]

403
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,550
You're not allowed

404
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,440
to work as a coroner again

405
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
exactly because

406
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:23,170
you killed.

407
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:36,050
In fact,
you've already given yourself away.

408
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,920
When Dong Yue's disciple died,

409
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,800
behind his body,

410
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:42,720
a square area on the floor

411
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:44,590
was not tainted by blood.

412
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,400
That happened

413
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,220
because of what you call
"the mortician's ritual," right?

414
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:56,830
No one else knows I'm here to tidy up

415
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,560
Dong Yue's appearance, right?

416
00:20:59,110 --> 00:20:59,720
Right.

417
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,000
I know my mentor and your school
were on bad terms.

418
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,680
So...

419
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,240
Thank you for coming here, Mr. Yin.

420
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
What is this for?

421
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,270
The mortician's ritual,

422
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,530
a ceremony that the deceased deserve.

423
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,830
How may I help?

424
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,480
Stand in front of me.

425
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,790
Do as I do.

426
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,200
Turn around to face the door.

427
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,550
Pray for your mentor.

428
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:05,710
Keep the posture.

429
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Close your eyes.

430
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,310
It was midnight.

431
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:48,890
The night watchman
must've passed by the coffin shop.

432
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,550
Out of fear of being discovered,

433
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:51,880
you fled in panic,

434
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,160
and didn't have time

435
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,150
to wipe the blood on the floor,

436
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,030
thus leaving evidence behind.

437
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,530
Comparison completed.

438
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,520
The handwriting

439
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,270
attributed to Yin Yao on this document

440
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,550
and that on the note
within the life-borrowing pouch

441
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:14,950
are from the same person.

442
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:17,350
Mr. Geng was a wise man.

443
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,630
I'm sure

444
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,790
he wouldn't have poisoned himself

445
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,270
if he hadn't found solid evidence.

446
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,350
At the thought of that,
I opened his coffin for an autopsy.

447
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,440
Just as I expected,

448
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,160
in his bosom, he did hide a note

449
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,580
that you wrote on

450
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,200
when you were off guard.

451
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,350
I should've been more careful.

452
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,440
I saw that document
when I examined his body.

453
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,240
I meant to have it buried with him

454
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:46,720
under the ground,

455
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,880
so no one would ever know

456
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,570
that I was the one borrowing lifespan.

457
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,790
When I write again,

458
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:56,940
I'll change that stupid writing habit.

459
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:57,880
Why did you

460
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,960
do all that?

461
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,000
Mentor adopted me when I was little.

462
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,910
But I really hope
I had a different adopter.

463
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,590
His face was full of wrinkles,
with gloomy looks in his eyes.

464
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,720
He dealt with dead bodies all day long.

465
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,920
I feared him so much.

466
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,110
I wanted to learn to read and write,

467
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,110
but he made me learn
how to examine dead bodies.

468
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:23,910
He even told me

469
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:26,070
that a coroner's knowledge
was passed down orally,

470
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,640
so there was no need to become literate.

471
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,310
However, later on,

472
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,240
he taught Suchan to read and write.

473
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,240
I found him repulsive,

474
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,810
but I knew I'd starve

475
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,830
to death if I left him.

476
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,750
Then, gradually,

477
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,680
I took a liking to

478
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,980
deal with dead people.

479
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:45,450
I realized I have a gift for it.

480
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:46,920
Meanwhile, he was

481
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,180
exploiting my talent.

482
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,240
It would be

483
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,830
more accurate to say
I was half a mentor to him,

484
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:51,400
than to say

485
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,750
he was my mentor,

486
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:54,350
because it was I who first came up with

487
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,350
the Open-Pit Bone Steaming Method.

488
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:57,300
Three years ago,

489
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,070
he wrote all that
into The Autopsy Chronicles,

490
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,330
which deeply upset me.

491
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:01,400
Writing it into the book was equal

492
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,070
to claiming that method as his invention.

493
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,070
Not a word about me

494
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,220
would be recorded.

495
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:06,350
Besides,

496
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,510
when the Ministry of Justice
and the Court of Judicial Review

497
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:09,030
asked him to recommend a coroner,

498
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:10,890
he always opted for Zhong Shizai.

499
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,950
He even said Zhong Shizai

500
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,550
was adept
in both literature and martial arts,

501
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,440
praising him as a rare all-around talent.

502
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,480
That just nurtured more hatred in me!

503
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,740
If he thought that way,

504
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:22,160
why didn't he teach me
how to read and write

505
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,360
and shape me into a well-around talent?

506
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,720
In the past three years,

507
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,590
you not only learned to write,

508
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:33,560
but also studied martial arts,

509
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:36,250
judging from the force
of your sword strike.

510
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,810
I don't know martial arts.

511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,200
But I'm very strong.

512
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,160
Every night, steeped in hatred,

513
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:46,340
I practiced stabbing and slashing

514
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,420
with all my might.

515
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,040
I'm not a fool.

516
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,370
I changed professions

517
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,910
only to provoke guilt in him.

518
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:10,950
I knew him well.

519
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,590
All his life, he cared about nothing

520
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:14,090
but passing down his autopsy skills.

521
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:15,400
Zhong Shizai was eager for quick success.

522
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,600
He would get in trouble sooner or later.

523
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,300
I was waiting for that day.

524
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:20,720
When that happened,

525
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,640
in order to persuade me to return
to the coroner profession,

526
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,440
my mentor would definitely make a gesture.

527
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,300
He would either

528
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,790
let me inherit The Autopsy Chronicles,

529
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,510
or give me

530
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,830
the recognition

531
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,720
I deserved—

532
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,280
the co-author of this book!

533
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:35,400
I waited three years.

534
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,960
This day nearly didn't arrive,

535
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,650
because his sores flared up

536
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,080
and he might die anytime.

537
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,470
Then I remembered

538
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:49,590
a case we worked on

539
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,000
when I was young.

540
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,970
A merchant borrowed lifespan
for his father.

541
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,110
You know what?

542
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,830
Though the merchant
was cut in half at the waist,

543
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,550
his father did

544
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,200
manage to live several more years.

545
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:01,830
So,

546
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,610
I decided to borrow lifespan too.

547
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
I needed my mentor to stay alive

548
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,790
till The Autopsy Chronicles was finished!

549
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:09,430
I must rise to fame with this book's help!

550
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,110
[Fair and Impartial]

551
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,820
How can an evil creature

552
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,170
like you work as a coroner?

553
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:17,240
It's important to have talent,

554
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,780
but one's nature matters most!

555
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,440
Yin Yao,

556
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,160
you will receive severer punishment

557
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,070
than your senior Zhong Shizai did.

558
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:29,830
You will pay for the deaths
of those three innocent people

559
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,890

[In loving memory of
my father Geng Wushang]

561
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,200
That night,

562
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:54,120
Father asked me a question.

563
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,830
Suchan,

564
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,510
if you attended the Coroners' Contest

565
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,160
on behalf of me and your fellows,

566
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,510
and the examiner asked you

567
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,810
why coroners must not kill,

568
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,170
what would be your answer?

569
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:09,730
Coroners must not kill...

570
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,950
Some may say

571
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,710
this is stating the obvious,

572
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,510
because no one

573
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,460
should take another's life.

574
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,070
[Speak and Seek Truth]

575
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,530
But that's the code of conduct
for coroners.

576
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,950
Here's the first reason.

577
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,680
Coroners are accustomed to seeing corpses

578
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,740
and murder scenes.

579
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,310
They're usually numb when looking at

580
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,510
the horrific scenes
where killings have happened.

581
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:29,160
Coroners also know a lot about the weapons

582
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,760
and methods used for murder.

583
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,350
Therefore, it has to be emphasized

584
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,950
that coroners must not kill,

585
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:36,350
or they could become bloodthirsty fiends.

586
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:36,960
Second,

587
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,380
if coroners kill and examine bodies,

588
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,640
the truth will be buried forever.

589
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,520
Third,

590
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:44,770
a coroner's duty

591
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,070
is to reveal the truth

592
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,130
and serve justice.

593
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,720
If coroners kill,

594
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:49,750
what will people

595
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,210
think of this profession?

596
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,750
When trust is eroded,

597
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,270
people will no longer

598
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,770
associate coroners with truth and justice.

599
00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,000
So, it has to be stressed
that coroners must not kill.

600
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:00,790
Only in this way

601
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:03,070
can this profession
be preserved and honored.

602
00:29:03,070 --> 00:29:03,880
Well said.

603
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:07,500
Excellent!

604
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,070
I'll put your remarks

605
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,840
in the final chapter

606
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,930

[In loving memory of
my father Geng Wushang]

608
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,350
I think Mr. Geng left

609
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,980
the final chapter unfinished

610
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,070
because

611
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,030
he wanted you to be his co-author.

612
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,430
What?

613
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,820
It was you

614
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:31,420
who first stated

615
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,960
why coroners must not kill.

616
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,820
As Mr. Geng's daughter,

617
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:39,680
you're responsible to finish this book
for him.

618
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,630
With this book's help,

in the coroner profession.

621
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,240
I believe

622
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,820
Mr. Geng intentionally

623
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,930
left this opportunity for you.

624
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,440
Complete the book.

a thousand years into the future.

626
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,790
It may become an essential read
for those who are to enter

627
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:06,190

[In loving memory of
my father Geng Wushang]

The Emperor has ordered

630
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,640
the Coroners' Contest to be cancelled.

631
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,880
That said, since Geng Wushang

632
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,720
and his daughter, Suchan,

633
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,650
made great contributions
by writing The Autopsy Chronicles,

634
00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:40,880
Suchan is specially permitted
to work in the county office

635
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,280
as a designated coroner.

636
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,510
She's removed
from the status of social inferiority,

637
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:45,200
and her descendants can choose

638
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,270
to be coroners or not

639
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,270
of their own will.

640

the Coroners' Contest

647
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,940
because he read the memorial
you submitted.

648

The memorial I submitted?

649
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,350
Yes.

650
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,270
Didn't you hand in a memorial

651
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:14,930
when you came back
from your journey to the west?

652
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:17,370

this entire series of murders

654
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,450
was actually caused by me?

655

the memorials submitted by you.

00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,350
"The world's greatest polo player"...

747
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,320
This title

748
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:16,630
was taken by Natie,

749
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,090
a Yenisei Kirghiz person?

750
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,590
That title was just given
by the Yenisei Kirghiz themselves.

751
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,710
After they play the final
against our Tang Team,

752
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,260
their arrogance today

753
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,500
will surely become

754
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,470
a laughingstock in Chang'an.

755
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,820
That's right, Pei.

756
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,920
On the day of the final,

757
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,960
I will personally lead the Tang Team

758
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,970
against the Yenisei Kirghiz Team.

759
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,030
I'll have them know

760
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,440
the Tang Empire is unrivaled

761
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,040
in the world's polo circles.

762
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:37,960
Lu Lingfeng!

763
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,090
Yes, Your Majesty.

764
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,190
Do you know

765
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,590
why I summoned you to the palace today?

766
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:44,630
Do you remember the previous

767
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,230
international polo tournament
from four years ago?

768
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,510
It was exactly the great teamwork
between you and I

769
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,480
that turned the tables

770
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,260
for the Tang Team in the final.

771
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,110
We defeated the Tulo Team at last.

772
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:54,000
You will join me

773
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,670
in the polo game 10 days later

774
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,070
to defeat the Yenisei Kirghiz Team.

775
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,800
Wait.

776
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,840
Your Majesty cannot play this final.

777
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,790
Are you concerned about my safety, Pei?

778
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,530
Don't worry.

779
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,320
With Lu Lingfeng's

780
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,510
close protection for me,

781
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,880
what is there to worry about?

782
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,680
That's not it.

783
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,280
Safety is not the reason

784
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,230
that I'm advising

785
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:17,480
Your Majesty not to play the final.

786
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,550
Four years ago,
Your Majesty was Prince of Linzi.

787
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:23,230
It was certainly fine
to gallop across the polo field.

788
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:24,070
But now,

789
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,140
Your Majesty is the Tang Emperor.

790
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,760
The Yenisei Kirghiz Khan

791
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,560
didn't come to

792
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,250
Chang'an for the games at all.

793
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,330
Therefore, it doesn't comply with

794
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:34,090
the etiquette or the protocol

795
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
for Your Highness to play the final.

796
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,390
Pei,

797
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,550
can't we find a reason

798
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,830
to make an exception?

799
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,070
For example... it allows me
to share joy with the populace?

800
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,550
No.

801
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,560
That's a ridiculous excuse.

802
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,280
Please refrain from doing so,
Your Majesty.

803
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,070
Fine.

804
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,310
Forget what I said.

805
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,480
I am the Emperor of the Tang Empire.

806
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,760
On the day of the final,
I'll simply take the field.

807
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,770
Let's see what Pei Mian can do to me.

808
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,150
I remember Your Majesty once said,

809
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,510
"Though I sit on the imperial throne,

810
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,510
I still uphold the diplomatic protocols
made by the Court of State Ceremonials

811
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,510
and observe the etiquette
respected by all vassals."

812
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,400
I wonder what that means.

813
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,290
How bold of you, Yin.

814
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,670
You cited my own words to lecture me?

815
00:37:46,670 --> 00:37:47,470
I dare not.

816
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:49,370
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

817
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:58,600
Your Majesty,

818
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,880
a secret message.

819
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,370
Where is it from?

820
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,910
The Yenisei Kirghiz.

821
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,460
Your Majesty,

822
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,150
Grand General of the Right Imperial Guard,
Lu Tong,

823
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,550
requests an urgent audience.

824
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,230
Let him in.

825
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:24,960
Yes.

826
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,280
Your Majesty,

827
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,670
I received a piece of urgent intelligence.

828
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,070
Say it.

829
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:41,460
Soon,

830
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,360
some Yenisei Kirghiz spies
will sneak into Chang'an

831
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,960
and make contact
with someone code-named "Wolf,"

832
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,480
who has infiltrated the city.

833
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,150
With the final of the polo tournament
approaching,

834
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:50,000
I'm worried that they may be plotting

835
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,400
against Your Majesty.

836
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,070
Is the intelligence reliable?

837
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:53,800
It should be.

838
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,110
What's the source?

839
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:56,360
My subordinate Li Zhuang

840
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,110
bought it at a high price

841
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,230
from an Intel Stall in the Ghost Market.

842
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:00,070
Li Zhuang?

843
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,720
If I remember correctly,

844
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,400
you've trained him for years

845
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,960
and designated him
to do intelligence work, right?

846
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,500
Yes.

847
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,690
He's trustworthy.

848
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,150
That said... there are many swindlers

849
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,280
in the Ghost Market.

850
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,220
At the moment,

851
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,110
I think it's better
to assume the threat exists

852
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,170
than to dismiss it.

853
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:18,960
The key is,

854
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,030
we'll be up against the Yenisei Kirghiz

855
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,690
in the polo tournament final.

856
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,560
The Yenisei Kirghiz...

857
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,030
is the Tang Empire's strong rival.

858
00:39:27,030 --> 00:39:29,360
They've always had rapacious ambitions.

859
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,280
Grand General, come here.

860
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:39,920
This is...

861
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,050
It's from the Yenisei Kirghiz.

862
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:43,510
I doubt the validity of it.

863
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:45,590
So, keep it between us only.

864
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,150
Got it.

865
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,170
Where is it from?

866
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,900
A carrier pigeon
sent by the Yenisei Kirghiz in secret.

867
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,010
[If Your Highness
promises us the land of Tingzhou,

868
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,150
when we attack the Tang borders...]

869
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:08,410
You've read it?

870
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:09,990
Yes.

871
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,980
How dare you bring it to me then!

872
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,250
[Crucial Nexus]

873
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,850
The Yenisei Kirghiz
must be out of their minds.

874
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,280
Who are they
to demand the land of Tingzhou?

875
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:21,390
Cut off all contact with them immediately.

876
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:24,860
If I ever ascend to the throne,

877
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,510
the first thing I'll do

878
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,440
is to send troops to the Yenisei Kirghiz,

879
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,300
seize their Khan,
and have him brought to Chang'an!

880
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,920
Your Highness, please calm down.

881
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,590
If we cut off

882
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,920
contact with them right away,

883
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,780
they won't attack the borders,

884
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,320
and we can't transfer Lu Tong
out of Chang'an

885
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,720
in the name of letting him

886
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,090
lead troops to fight the enemy.

887
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,220
I'd rather postpone this matter

888
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,030
than accept any terms

889
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,020
of theirs.

890
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,880
Your Highness, please reconsider.

891
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,540
There's nothing to consider!

892
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,290
But word from the palace says

893
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,350
the Imperial Guard

894
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:57,900
has learned that spies
for the Yenisei Kirghiz

895
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,360
will soon enter Chang'an.

896
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:01,210
If they are caught,

897
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,070
then the secret of us having contact

898
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:05,470
with the Yenisei Kirghiz may be disclosed.

899
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,680
What's so scary about that?

900
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,540
Even if this secret is disclosed,

901
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,110
what can the man sitting on the throne now

902
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:14,590
do to me?

903
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,150
I am the State-guarding Grand Princess
of the Tang Empire.

904
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,000
I will not trade the land of Tang Empire

905
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,100
for anything!

906
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,810
Chancellor Cui.

907
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,650
Go to Yongzhou Prefecture

908
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,400
and bring Lu Lingfeng to me.
