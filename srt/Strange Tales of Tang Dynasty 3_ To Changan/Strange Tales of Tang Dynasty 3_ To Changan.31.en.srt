[Strange Tales of Tang Dynasty III:
To Chang'an]

00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,940
[Episode 31]

3
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,070
Spare my life!

4
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,910
Spare my life! Please!

5
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
Immortal, please spare my life!

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,660
Immortal, please have mercy!

7
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,680
There're no immortals here,

8
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,600
only ghost officials.

9
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,700
A woman's soul

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,030
has reported you to the King of Hell,

11
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,750
so we've come to take your life.

12
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,490
Surrender your life!

13
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,710
No! I'm innocent!

14
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,250
I-I'm innocent!

15
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
Please, Official...

16
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,590
I beg the King of Hell for mercy!

17
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,160
The King of Hell never
makes a wrong judgment.

18
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,410
That soul's owner is surnamed Wei.

19
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,990
What exactly did you do to her?

20
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,490
Into the oil cauldron!

21
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,000
Into the oil cauldron!

22
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,120
I'll confess! I'll confess!

23
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,190
I'll confess! I'll confess!

24
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,960
Ghost...

25
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,310
I saw a ghost.

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
What ghost?

27
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,400
I say it's your guilty conscience!

28
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,370
Keep arguing,

29
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,150
and I'll throw you into the oil cauldron
and fry you!

30
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,280
Into the oil cauldron!

31
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,240
[Wei Mansion]

32
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,040
I'll confess.

33
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:28,680
Since ancient times,
merchants have had no status.

34
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,680
[Wei Mansion]

35
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,540
To establish myself in Chang'an,

36
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,280
I sought the hand of the widow

37
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,310
from the Wei family
who recently returned to Chang'an.

38
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,470
Wei Jia was proud,

39
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,320
and Wei Tao tried every means to stop us.

40
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,630
But my methods

41
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,090
were too clever to resist.

42
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,970
Finally, Wei Jia fell for me.

43
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,930
After a big fight with her brother,

44
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:55,870
[In Virtuous Company]

45
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,870
she pledged herself to me in secret.

46
00:03:57,950 --> 00:03:59,480
What the hell are you doing?

47
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,120
Throw all these out right now!

48
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,190
Tao.

49
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,710
These flowers have done nothing wrong.

50
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,910
I quite like them.

51
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,660
I originally thought marrying Wei Jia

52
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
would bring me the benefits
of the Wei family,

53
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,810
and it would be of help to me.

54
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,870
But I never expected

55
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,950
that not only would Wei Tao not help me,

56
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,680
he'd even constantly make things
difficult for me!

57
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,040
How I despise him!

58
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,040
Later, my business failed,

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,640
and I ended up owing
tens of thousands of coins.

60
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,130
The only one who could help me then

61
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,040
was Shi Qiansui.

62
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:33,800
He...

63
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,930
That old lecher...

64
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,320
I'm curious about

65
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,159
what gentry ladies are like.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,270
If I could get what I want,

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,780
those tens of thousands of coins
wouldn't be a problem.

68
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,070
I knew

69
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:55,760
Wei Jia would never consent,

70
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,360
so I had no choice but to
drug her unconscious.

71
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,070
But I didn't expect

72
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,790
the dose to be too weak.

73
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,120
Wei Jia woke up

74
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,590
before dawn.

75
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,150
When she saw Shi Qiansui,

76
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,610
she tried to kill herself.

77
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:29,950
I was worried

78
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,750
this would reach Wei Tao's ears,

79
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,150
so I had no choice but to lock her up.

80
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,720
But she made such a scene

81
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,510
that I had to beat her a few times.

82
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,000
I never expected...

83
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,470
I never expected she'd go mad
because of it.

84
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,270
Every night she'd cry and wail,

85
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,120
not letting anyone sleep.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,230
At that time,

87
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:59,140
your brother He Qian
was also living in your house.

88
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,730
He already suffered from insomnia,

89
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,230
so he tried to use

90
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,230
water-soaked paper to suffocate Wei Jia.

91
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:22,950
Let me go!

92
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,659
What are you doing?

93
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,390
We might as well suffocate her to death.

94
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,630
That way, she won't keep raving
every night.

95
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:46,070
And with no visible wounds,

96
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:46,920
her family will have nothing to say

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,830
when they come.

98
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,480
You bastard!

99
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,960
You saved Wei Jia

100
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,120
not out of kindness,

101
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,800
but because you found a new way
to make money.

102
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,140
She'd already gone mad anyway.

103
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,160
It was also Shi Qiansui's fault

104
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,300
for spreading this scandal.

105
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,630
Those merchants of the Jinguang Society

106
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,490
who were later killed by Wei and Du

107
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,360
were all willing to pay a fortune

108
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,310
for a night with a gentry lady.

109
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,820
So I made it happen for them.

110
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,310
Miss Wei would never have agreed to that!

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,150
It was you who kept drugging her.

112
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,580
You're the one who drove her mad!

113
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:49,060
Sister-in-law, who am I marrying today?

114
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,240
I...

115
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,230
You beast!

116
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,190
Xijun.

117
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:03,870
Xijun.

118
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,650
[Fair and Just]

119
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,040
What happened after that?

120
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:17,920
Later,

121
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,130
Wei Jia suddenly ran away one day.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,310
I knew she went back to her own family.

123
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,680
But when I went to get her back,

124
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,750
they refused.

125
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,310
Wei Tao even threatened to kill me.

126
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,870
After that,

127
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,200
when the Jinguang Society
expanded their villa,

128
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,909
the merit-record pillars of
the Wei and Du families were dug up.

129
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,309
And in a fit of anger , I...

130
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,430
Usually,

131
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:47,000
this kind of madness
doesn't remain constant.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,150
Wei Jia must have had lucid moments

133
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,320
when she told Du Juniang

134
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
about the abuse she had suffered.

135
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,850
That's why when Wei Tao killed He Qian,

136
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,250
he used such a distinctive method.

137
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,780
He deserves death.

138
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:08,080
[Grand Princess's Mansion]

139
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,600
Wei Tao must not be killed.

140
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,030
This man has long declared

141
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,600
his loyalty to Your Highness,

142
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,910
and he's talented both
in literature and martial arts.

143
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:15,630
He's someone with great potential.

144
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,270
Moreover,

145
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
those merchants he killed

146
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,830
all deserved to die.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,440
The so‑called Jinguang Society
is filled with wicked people.

148
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,120
According to investigations,

149
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,150
they've harmed many innocent women.

150
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:26,410
They should have been wiped out long ago!

151
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,390
Chancellor Cui,

152
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,860
I've never seen you so agitated before.

153
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,120
I apologize for my rudeness.

154
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

155
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,810
The Yongzhou Prefecture Office

156
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,600
has thoroughly investigated

157
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,400
all the details of the case.

158
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,440
Although there's no testimony
from Wei Tao,

159
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,440
I understand his anger.

160
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,700
My views are different from
my mother's.

161
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:50,550
I value the gentry more.

162
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,670
As for Wei Tao,

163
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,200
I didn't think much of him before.

164
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,200
But the fact that

165
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:00,030
he would do something so earth-shattering

166
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,980
for his sister and for the honor of
the Wei family

167
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,230
really makes me see him in a new light.

168
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,840
However,

169
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,510
one cannot govern a nation on impulse.

170
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,900
As for how to deal with Wei and Du,

171
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:16,040
I'm rather interested in waiting

172
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,080
to see what their attitude will be.

173
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,510
How could such a thing have happened?

174
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,630
Those bad apples are utterly despicable,

175
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,510
and they've tarnished the reputation
of the merchant community!

176
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:31,310
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

177
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,830
Your Majesty.

178
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,090
Du Yu cannot be executed.

179
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,110
He was merely an accomplice.

180
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,580
Those vicious merchants

181
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,720
smashed the Du family's
ancestral merit-record pillar.

182
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,120
How could anyone tolerate such an offense?

183
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,570
More importantly,

184
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,990
Du Yu has long declared

185
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,400
his loyalty to Your Majesty.

186
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,330
Though he's only a county sheriff,

187
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,290
he's a remarkable talent

188
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,020
of the new generation of the Du family.

189
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,720
Besides, his martial skills
are exceptional.

190
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,600
He's a promising talent
who could be of great use.

191
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,910
I've never seen you go to such lengths

192
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,510
to plead for someone before.

193
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:11,530
Your Majesty,

194
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,540
you asked me to secretly recruit talents.

195
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,590
After careful selection,

196
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,980
Du Yu was my top choice.

197
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,320
What a pity.

198
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,070
He has more than one life on his hands.

199
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,230
Even if I don't want to execute him,

200
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,240
the people

201
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,080
will say I favor the gentry.

202
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,840
Moreover,

203
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:36,070
there's also my aunt to consider.

204
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,220
I wonder what her opinion
on this matter is.

205
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,360
Ji, have a seat.

206
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,240
Yes.

207
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,150
Are you close friends with Wei and Du, Ji?

208
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,000
Not really.

209
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,730
We haven't known each other for long.

210
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,470
You have a heart for justice—

211
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,200
truly a rare talent for

212
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,160
governing the country.

213
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,030
If you ask me now,

214
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,480
I will ensure Wei and Du

215
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,000
remain safe and unharmed.

216
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,720
Your Highness must've misunderstood.

217
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,180
I'm Master Di's disciple.

218
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,840
My mentor taught me
that the law shows no mercy.

219
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,030
As for Wei Tao

220
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,120
and Du Yu,

221
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,670
their anger

222
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,200
is indeed understandable,

223
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,900
but taking multiple lives

224
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,610
is an unforgivable crime.

225
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,570
Though they're from the gentry

226
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,980
and they're talented,

227
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,360
the law of our country
must not be violated.

228
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,200
This is also one of the key principles

229
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:49,960
ensuring our Tang Empire's

230
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,090
path to prosperity.

231
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,230
Is this truly what you think, my son?

232
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:58,870
Yes.

233
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,480
The gentry

234
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,000
are supposed to hold themselves

235
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,200
to higher standards.

236
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,110
If one day

237
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,670
I, Lu Lingfeng, break the law,

238
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,000
I should also

239
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,960
be severely punished.

240
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,050
Ji, you're becoming more and more like me.

241
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,320
What's that merchant's name?

242
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,090
He Bi.

243
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,970
If Wei and Du are to be beheaded,

244
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,840
then have him cut in half at the waist.

245
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,370
If they're to be cut in half,

246
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,630
then have him torn apart by 5 horses!

247
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,760
Tell Xiong Qiannian to inform them

248
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,270
that these are my orders.

249
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,200
As for Shi Qiansui,

250
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,220
strip him of his position,
confiscate his property,

251
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,880
and banish him from Chang'an!

252
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,630
No,

253
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,760
from all Tang territory!

254
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,720
He's never to set foot on

255
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,580
the land of our Tang Empire again!

256
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,840
Yes.

257
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,720
I fully agree with my aunt's opinion.

258
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,170
For the position of High Priest
of the High Priest's Office,

259
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,750
do you have a suitable candidate?

260
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,120
The West Market Magistrate, Kang Yuanli,

261
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,030
is loyal and dedicated,

262
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:06,360
with an excellent reputation.

263
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,550
He can be promoted to the High Priest

264
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,960
and keep serving as
the West Market Magistrate.

265
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,120
Seems appropriate to me.

266
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,600
Have the Ministry of Personnel
issue the order.

267
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,150
Yes.

268
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,080
Xiong Qiannian.

269
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:19,600
With such incidents occurring in Chang'an,

270
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,600
what's your view
as Yongzhou's Chief Administrator?

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,800
Your Majesty,

272
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,290
I have failed in my governance

273
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,350
and am guilty.

274
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,360
Guilty indeed!

275
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,870
You'd been in Nanzhou Prefecture
for so long

276
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,960
and only returned to the capital
a few days ago.

277
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,480
Even if I wanted to assign blame,

278
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,910
it wouldn't fall on you.

279
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,480
What I want to ask you is,

280
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,340
with such a major case occurring,

281
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,080
what's your opinion

282
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,860
on it being solved so quickly?

283
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,680
Judicial Official Lu Lingfeng

284
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,270
deserves great credit.

285
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,880
Su Wuming has also done a lot, of course.

286
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,420
Very well, I understand.

287
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,560
You may go.

288
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,320
I take my leave.

289
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,670
Su Wuming.

290
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,960
Though you no longer
hold an official position,

291
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,000
you've been even more diligent
in case investigation.

292
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm truly

293
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:23,670
impressed by you.

294
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,740
I'm still

295
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,480
the Chief of Secret Agents
in Yongzhou Prefecture.

296
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,840
Although I can't exactly
be called an official,

297
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,430
I suppose I can be considered a clerk,

298
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,160
and I receive a monthly salary.

299
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,550
Everything I do is also within my duties.

300
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,780
I remember

301
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,920
you were once Chang'an County Sheriff.

302
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,530
You solved the black tea case then,

303
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,150
gaining quite a reputation.

304
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,240
In that case,

305
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:50,320
Lu Lingfeng deserved more credit.

306
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,770
How about I give you an official position?

307
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,870
Your Majesty,

308
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,480
that won't be necessary.

309
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,130
I'm quite content as I am.

310
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,000
It's just that Lu Lingfeng...

311
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:02,630
He's currently serving as
the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

312
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:03,960
which is

313
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,570
beneath his abilities.

314
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,520
Recently, he has repeatedly
solved complex cases

315
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,000
and protected Your Majesty multiple times.

316
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,080
He deserves a promotion.

317
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,200
Do I need you

318
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,480
to remind me about his promotions?

319
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:17,570
I spoke out of turn.

320
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,390
Your Majesty, please calm down.

321
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,720
You turned down my offer

322
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,790
to give you an official position.

323
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:29,120
Are you waiting for the Princess
to grant you a title instead?

324
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,270
Your Majesty, if you have to
put it this way,

325
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,510
I am truly speechless.

326
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:40,200
I intended to give you a higher position,

327
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,550
but it seems you don't care for it.

328
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,390
Then go back

329
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:45,520
to being the Chang'an County Sheriff.

330
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,150
No.

331
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,160
I want you to be the sheriff
of Wannian County.

332
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:53,830
Your Majesty.

333
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,410
Are you serious?

334
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,760
A ruler never jokes.

335
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,950
Thank you, Your Majesty!

336
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,950
I thought

337
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,150
that in this lifetime,

338
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,920
I would never have another chance
to serve in office.

339
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,650
So you do want to be an official.

340
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,810
I'm the one who gave you this opportunity.

341
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:14,440
You

342
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,400
must remember that.

343
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,190
Go back and wait for

344
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,570
the official appointment from
the Ministry of Personnel.

345
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,310
Move!

346
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,270
Kill him! Kill him!

347
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,620
Excellent!

348
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,920
Great! Excellent!

349
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,460
Nice kill!

350
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,830
-Well deserved!
-Great!

351
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,030
Bring the criminals,

352
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:18,720
Wei Tao and Du Yu!

353
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,550
The time has come.

354
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,600
Criminals, kneel
and receive your punishment!

355
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,000
Father!

356
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,780
Don't you kneel!

357
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,720
We're the ones who have erred.

358
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,270
You're descendants of the gentry.

359
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,060
You must not kneel before criminals.

360
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:52,550
Your uncle is right.

361
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,540
Ya, do not kneel.

362
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,000
Darling Wei.

363
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:10,830
Yu.

364
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,030
Rest assured.

365
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:17,400
I will definitely raise

366
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,750
Qing and Ya to adulthood.

367
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,590
The Wei family has passed down
the Book of Songs for generations,

368
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,830
and the Du family has always studied
the Spring and Autumn Annals.

369
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,850
In our old residence
in the south of the city,

370
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,310
I'll make sure to take them
to the study room,

371
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,070
where they'll study together
as classmates.

372
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,670
As descendants of Xuancheng

373
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,680

You can't make such claims lightly!

560

564
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,830
and fingernail scratches on her neck,

565
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,490

567
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,750
He must be making this up!

568
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,750
He's a mortician,

569
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,160
someone who applies makeup
to the deceased.

570
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,420
It's a new profession.

571

This girl

572

This...

586
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,110
You say my daughter didn't hang herself.

587
00:33:58,110 --> 00:33:59,720
Besides these fingernail marks,

588
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,450
do you have any other evidence?

589
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,440
A true hanging victim

590
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:07,270
has closed eyes and open lips,
clenched hands and exposed teeth.

591
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,320
If hanged above the throat,
the tongue presses against the teeth,

592
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,400
so the tongue often protrudes
below the throat.

593
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,860
But your daughter
shows none of these signs.

594
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:14,960
Look.

595
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:17,360
The ligature mark runs evenly
and straight around her neck,

596
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,630
and the color is rather shallow.

597
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,429
This is a sign of strangulation.

598
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,760
There are also fingernail marks,

599
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,070
likely left during an attempt

600
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,270
to struggle for life.

601
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,120
Furthermore,

602
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,250
in true hanging, both hands
should be clenched,

603
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,440
but your daughter's...

604
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:34,960
Could it be

605
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,590
that my daughter

606
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:38,280
was actually murdered?

607
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,350
It must have been him.

608
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:44,760

who killed my daughter!

Did Master pay you?

611
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,440
He went to report to the authorities.

612
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,400
When the coroner arrives,

613
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,060
he'll wipe off all the makeup.

614
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:57,730
Then I'll apply it again

615
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,930
and collect payment twice.

616
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,220
Are you a mortician or a coroner?

617
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:05,180
If you're a coroner, that's even better.

618
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,230

coroners right now.

I can still make ends meet

623

anyone who charges a commission over 10%

626
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:25,550
will be seen as monopolizing the market.

627
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,810
If you charge too much,

628
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:29,590
you'll be accused of disrupting the trade.

629
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,250

Was it you who just beat the drum?

743
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,760
Officer,

744
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:38,030
please seek justice for me!

745
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,510
My daughter was strangled to death!

746
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,510
Where is the body?

747
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:41,620
At my home now.

748
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:42,690
Lead the way.

749
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:46,000
Heading to investigate a case so soon?
