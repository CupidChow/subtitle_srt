00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,970
[Episode 38]

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,150
Seize those 2!

4
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,789
You...

5
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,509
They're clearly spies!

6
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,590
What are you waiting for?

7
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,370
Arrest them!

8
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,009
Don't move!

9
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,370
What are you doing?

10
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,789
What are you doing?

11
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,509
Stay still!

12
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,520
My order is correct.

13
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,840
I've got them!

14
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:09,410
More of a hindrance than a help!

15
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,000
Keep your voice down.

16
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,930
He's your superior.

17
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,030
He's just eager to solve the case.

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,750
The way he acted

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,000
makes it seem like he was

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,260
tipping off the spies!

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,660
You shouldn't say such things randomly.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,360
If those 2 were spies,

23
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,560
I

24
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,620
would resign as constable.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,590
Their movements are suspicious.

26
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,280
Definitely something fishy is going on.

27
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,410
Alright, calm down.

28
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,560
I'll go check it out.

29
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,770
Make way! Make way!

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,940
Look up.

31
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,280
You... You are

32
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,300
You Tiancai,
Director of the Tribute Office?

33
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,230
Y-Yes, that's me.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,430
I never thought

35
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,680
you'd be a Yenisei Kirghiz spy.

36
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm wrongfully accused!

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,310
I'm not a spy!

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,310
Sir,

39
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:05,320
this is what they were trading.

40
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,780
The admission tickets to the polo finals?

41
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,390
You Tiancai,

42
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,070
what's going on here?

43
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,190
Chief Administrator Xiong,

44
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,880
I just made a momentary mistake.

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
Although I'm a Director,

46
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,470
my monthly salary

47
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,590
is quite limited.

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,430
Besides,

49
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,210
there's no extra money
in the Tribute Office.

50
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,130
I have my own house,

51
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,370
but it's too small.

52
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,790
I want a bigger one.

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,579
I just want to move to

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,280
the north of Lanling District.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,650
As if you could move to the Imperial City.

56
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:45,310
Chief Administrator Xiong.

57
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,670
You're trying to use ticket scalping

58
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,680
to cover up your identity

59
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,079
as a Yenisei Kirghiz spy.

60
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,579
I'm not a spy, Chief Administrator Xiong!

61
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,670
D-Don't believe me? Ask him!

62
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,360
Get up!

63
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,470
Were you sent by the Yenisei Kirghiz

64
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:00,840
to make contact with him?

65
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,360
No.

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,800
My lady

67
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,520
has admired the Grand Princess
since childhood.

68
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,870
But she's never seen her.

69
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,870
She thought Her Highness

70
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,960
would surely attend the polo finals.

71
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,870
So earlier,

72
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,470
I spread the word at a restaurant

73
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,080
that I would pay 2 gold coins

74
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:13,910
for 2 tickets

75
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,270
to the polo finals.

76
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,490
He found me

77
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,430
and arranged to meet here today.

78
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:20,430
Chief Administrator Xiong,

79
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,910
take these 2 away quickly

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,160
before we alert the real spies.

81
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,080
Alright, I'll listen to your advice.

82
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,130
Take them away!

83
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,250
-Chief Administrator Xiong! Please!
-Move! Move!

84
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,680
Hurry up.

85
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,440
Chief Minister Pei!

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,630
Chief Minister Pei,
please put in a good word for me!

87
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,480
-Chief Minister Pei.
-Chief Minister Pei, take a look.

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,610
Chief Minister Pei!

89
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:00,680
Chief Minister Pei,
be careful not to hurt your back.

90
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,960
This You guy

91
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,720
is from the Court of State Ceremonials.

92
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,690
Especially now,

93
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,680
when the imperial polo ball

94
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,120
hasn't been designed yet,

95
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,250
as the Director of the Tribute Office,

96
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,090
without His Majesty's decree,

97
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,360
Yongzhou Prefecture Office wouldn't dare

98
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,890
to punish him arbitrarily.

99
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:16,920
That's why we've brought him to you.

100
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,050
Xiong Qiannian,

101
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,410
you deliberately brought

102
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,560
You Tiancai
to the Court of State Ceremonials

103
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,160
to embarrass me, didn't you?

104
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,430
I have important duties to attend to

105
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,360
and will deal with you later.

106
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
After the international polo tournament

107
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,520
has been successfully held,

108
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,240
I'll settle the score with you.

109
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,720
As for You Tiancai...

110
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,360
He's an official
who committed a serious crime.

111
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,000
Don't you know where he should be sent?

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,720
Which way the Censorate's gate faces,

113
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,320
do I really need to tell you?

114
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,040
As for the imperial polo ball...

115
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,190
The design plan of the polo ball

116
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,310
has already been approved by His Majesty,

117
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:48,360
and I'm personally
supervising its production.

118
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,760
Such a despicable person

119
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
shall not be allowed to tarnish

120
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,980
the imperial polo ball in the slightest!

121
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,800
Guards!

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,950
Drive them all
out of the Court of State Ceremonials!

123
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,480
Yes!

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,870
Chief Minister Pei!

125
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,830
Chief Minister Pei!

126
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,000
For the sake of our years of friendship,

127
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,070
please help me!

128
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,250
Chief Minister Pei!

129
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,800
The measurements here
must be absolutely precise.

130
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,270
Got it.

131
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,040
Got it.

132
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,640
Chief Minister Pei.

133
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,920
Everything is ready.

134
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,360
Can we start cutting the beast hide now?

135
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,070
Ma,

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,600
are you absolutely confident?

137
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,310
Yes,

138
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,240
we've practiced on fabric samples

139
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,630
100 times already.

140
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,190
Good.

141
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,190
Two pieces of beast hide for 2 polo balls.

142
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,720
One for the competition,

143
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,800
and one as a backup.

144
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,270
During the production process,

145
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,460
there shouldn't be

146
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,070
the slightest mistake.

147
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,310
Rest assured.

148
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,040
I'm entrusting this task to all of you.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,159
Please be at ease, Chief Minister Pei.

150
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,480
Good.

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,400
Palm-leaf fans, round fans!

152
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,360
All kinds of fans! Take a look!

153
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:52,950
How is it?

154
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,940
That shorter one,

155
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,040
though dressed as a man,

156
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,240
appears to be a woman.

157
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,710
I noticed that too.

158
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,659
I followed them

159
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
to the Bafang Inn.

160
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,560
Bafang Inn?

161
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,920
As I recall, didn't Lu Lingfeng

162
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,000
-ask Fei to send...
-Yes.

163
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:08,510
Didn't he open

164
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,800
a branch of the Sushan Shop?

165
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Yang Ji works there as a servant.

166
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,040
[Bafang Inn]

167
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,870
Those 2 people living in a premium room
on the second floor

168
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,870
claim to be father and daughter,

169
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,630
but I'm certain they're not.

170
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,000
How can you tell?

171
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,600
The one pretending to be the daughter

172
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,720
sit in the main seat.

173
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,000
The one pretending to be the father

174
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,390
acted more like her servant.

175
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:33,420
Well done.

176
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:34,560
Yingtao.

177
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,480
These 2 are indeed suspicious.

178
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,180
I'll leave them to you.

179
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,240
It seems we have no leads now,

180
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,360
but actually,
there are countless threads to follow.

181
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,159
I'll go first.

182
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,720
Here.

183
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,680
Okay.

184
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:49,990
By the way,

185
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,870
though that woman seems like a master,

186
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,720
in the past,

187
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,680
she must have suffered greatly.

188
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,610
How can you tell?

189
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,630
On that woman's left ear,

190
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,030
there are scars all over.

191
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,870
She must have been disobedient before,

192
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,800
and someone slit her ear with a knife.

193
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,400
Slitting her ear with a knife

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,990
is too cruel.

195
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,240
Today was really dangerous.

196
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,690
Master, Chang'an is unpredictable.

197
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,690
We should leave as soon as possible.

198
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Leave?

199
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,070
The mission isn't complete.

200
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:21,070
How could I face returning
to the Yenisei Kirghiz Grasslands?

201
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:21,870
Besides,

202
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,840
would the Khan spare us?

203
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,560
According to the previous agreement,

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,620
if the meeting at Dayan Pagoda fails,

205
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,270
then...

206
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:37,450
[Yongzhou Prefecture]

207
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,030
Well...

208
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,669
How did you know

209
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,929
that I have more intelligence?

210
00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:42,320
How dare you, Sun Zi!

211
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,670
You actually kept information

212
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,270
from Official Lu deliberately.

213
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:49,480
The county office
will punish you for this.

214
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,870
It wasn't deliberate concealment.

215
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,840
Everyone in our line of work knows.

216
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,910
For a piece of intelligence,

217
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,670
if there's additional information,

218
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,960
it costs extra.

219
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,320
So there is more.

220
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,120
You were trying
to extort the Yongzhou Prefecture Office?

221
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,440
Official Lu, you saved my life.

222
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,370
How would I dare?

223
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,030
Actually, this piece of intelligence

224
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:07,720
came to me
in a sudden flash of inspiration—

225
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
I managed to pry it

226
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,010
out of that masked man's mouth back then.

227
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,070
Wait a moment.

228
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,170
If the first meeting fails,

229
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,660
is there a follow-up plan?

230
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't say there isn't.

231
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,980
Otherwise,

232
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,150
I would doubt

233
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,950
the accuracy of your intelligence.

234
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:29,550
You're indeed an expert
in intelligence work.

235
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,390
There is indeed a backup plan.

236
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,610
If the meeting at Dayan Pagoda fails,

237
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,750
then the next day,

238
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,630
before dawn, at 4 a.m.,

239
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,990
at the quietest place in Chang'an,

240
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,270
you will meet
with the Four Heavenly Kings.

241
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,330
The Four Heavenly Kings?

242
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,460
Yes, I found it strange too.

243
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,850
Because he

244
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:48,910
was already wearing
a Heavenly King mask himself.

245
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,550
Which Heavenly King mask

246
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,150
was that person wearing?

247
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:56,600
It should be the Guardian of the East.

248
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,750
Actually, I know

249
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,150
where he bought his mask.

250
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,200
At the Ghost Market,

251
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,480
there's a specialized mask shop.

252
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:01,960
I saw

253
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,260
identical ones there.

254
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,360
The quietest place.

255
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,120
No specific reference?

256
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,120
No.

257
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,960
I didn't miss a single word just now.

258
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,320
At 4 a.m.

259
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,320
Where in Chang'an

260
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,580
is the quietest place?

261
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,630
Meeting with the Four Heavenly Kings.

262
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,120
The deeper meaning
must be hidden in this phrase.

263
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,870
The Four Heavenly Kings

264
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,800
are usually enshrined in temples.

265
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,440
Could it be referring to
the quietest temple?

266
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,960
That analysis makes sense.

267
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,000
Continue.

268
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
At 4 a.m.,

269
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,870
most people are still asleep.

270
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,890
The morning bell of temples
has already rung.

271
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,720
The monks
have already started chanting sutras.

272
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,750
Therefore, temples with monks

273
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,170
can't be considered quiet places.

274
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,030
I just thought of a place.

275
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,270
It's where they met today,

276
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,270
Dayan Pagoda.

277
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,720
As far as I know,

278
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,400
in Daci'en Temple,

279
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,110
many pilgrims stay.

280
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,120
But the area around Dayan Pagoda

281
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,120
doesn't allow pilgrims to enter
in the early morning.

282
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,270
So that place should be the quietest.

283
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,020
The same meeting location

284
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:20,970
both times?

285
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,480
That'll be indeed unexpected.

286
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,010
Then we need to split up.

287
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:30,320
I'll go to the Ghost Market
to investigate the mask lead.

288
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,790
I'll keep an eye on Dayan Pagoda.

289
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,430
Agreed.

290
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,510
[Yan Ruyu Mask Shop]

291
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,910
This should be the place.

292
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,170
Just wait for me outside.

293
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:53,870
Yes.

295
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:11,930
all know quality.

296
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,910
Not just in the Ghost Market,

297
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,240
but in the entire Chang'an,

298
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,720
no shop beats mine

299
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:19,120

303
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,550
Guardian of the South.

304

Guardian of the West.

305
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,390

Which one do you want?

307
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,560
These masks are really well-made.

308

How many can you sell in a day?

309
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,210
That's hard to say.

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,380
Sometimes, I sell 7 or 8 in a day.

311

to your shop

322

Was there anyone unusual,

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,180

00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,500

326
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,320
Yes.

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,240
Just a couple of days ago.

328
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,700
He was large and imposing,

329
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,920
with a booming voice.

330
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,830
He bought

331
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,270
4 of my masks at once.

332
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,010
What did he look like?

333
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,440
I don't know.

334
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
He was already wearing
a mask when he came.

335
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,440
If he was already wearing a mask,

336
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,200
why did he buy more masks from you?

337
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,560
His was old and worn,

338
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,250
clearly not from Chang'an.

339
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,770
He bought 4 masks from me,

340
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,630
and by leaving his old one behind,

341
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:48,430
got a discount worth half a mask.

342
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,980
Quite the cheapskate.

343
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,630
Is that old mask still here?

344
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:53,480
Yes, it is.

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,000

to be the Guardian of the East.

00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,030
to meet in a quiet place?

380
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,320
So Official Lu said

381
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,360
he didn't need many people,

382
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,000
afraid of alerting the suspect.

383
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,490
We were just wondering

384
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,400
if Official Lu

385
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,680
might have picked the wrong location.

386
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,390
Exactly.

387
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,840
If we're talking about quiet places,

388
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,670
it couldn't possibly be

389
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:16,800
the Daci'en Temple.

390
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,050
Then where should it be?

391
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,790
The quietest places in Chang'an at night

392
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,520
are Leyouyuan and the Qu River.

393
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:25,040
There are no temples along the Qu River.

394
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,030
There's a Leyou Temple in Leyouyuan.

395
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,670
The place I missed

396
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,580
is right there.

397
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:33,910
Hurry and follow me

398
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,960
to Leyouyuan.

399
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,060
[Leyou Temple]

400
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,750
It enshrines Han emperors,

401
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,640
yet has the Four Heavenly Kings
as guardians.

402
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,640
This temple is indeed quite strange.

403
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,160
Perhaps that's why

404
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,440
it's so desolate.

405
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,349
The pasture stretches vast.

406
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,030
The wilderness lies flat.

407
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,200
Wind sweeps the needlegrass.

408
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,350
The wolf appears.

409
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,070
You are the Wolf?

410
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,890
Who else would I be?

411
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,650
What are you doing?

412
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,160
I know you're not only skilled in combat

413
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,440
but also exceptionally agile.

414
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,270
Of course.

415
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,160
Would you like to test your skills
against mine?

416
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,910
No need.

417
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,110
The way you drew your blade

418
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:10,400
tells me enough.

419
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,640
The letter is inside.

420
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,080
Your mission

421
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,170
should be clearly written there.

422
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:27,720
You came through the door,

423
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,790
so you shall leave the same way.

424
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,790
You came through the door,

425
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,750
so you shall leave the same way.

426
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,240
Something's wrong.

427
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,890
What is it, Master?

428
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,480
His last sentence

429
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,960
was clearly redundant.

430
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,510
Also,

431
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,140
wearing a wolf's head
doesn't make one the Wolf.

432
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,010
Yenisei Kirghiz spies

433
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,040
would never be so ridiculous.

434
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,730
We've fallen into a trap.

435
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,470
Is this thing

436
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,250
really worth 3 silver ingots?

437
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
Stop right there!

438
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,680
Official investigation!

439
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,340
Hand over what you're holding

440
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,110
and come with me
to the Yongzhou Prefecture Office.

441
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:35,240
A female constable?

442
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,840
Not a constable. I'm a secret agent.

443
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,400
I'm not afraid of official forces,

444
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,660
let alone covert ones.

445
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,910
This woman is a secret agent.

446
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,400
Let's kill her together!

447
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,500
-Madam Yingtao!
-Madam Yingtao!

448
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,310
Perfect timing.

449
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,590
This woman is yours to handle.

450
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,200
Capture her alive.

451
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,930
Understood.

452
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,300
Where are you, Heavenly King?

453
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,360
I've done what you asked. Pay me.

454
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:10,030
There are pursuers behind.
Take care of yourself.

455
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:10,740
Stop!

456
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,930
Madam, listen!

457
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,680
The Tang Empire welcomes

458
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,160
guests from afar.

459
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:38,050
If you honestly reveal your intentions,

460
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:40,740
I, Su Wuming, Wannian County Sheriff,

461
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,440
will spare your life.

462
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,310
Yenisei Kirghiz warriors

463
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,070
can only die;

464
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,770
they never surrender!

465
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,390
Stop her!

466
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,110
Could it be

467
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,310
I've been wrong from the beginning?

468
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,160
In a single night,

469
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,690
I've made 2 mistakes!

470
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,200
First,

471
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,110
I never thought of

472
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,330
the Leyou Temple in Leyouyuan.

473
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,170
Second,

474
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:37,550
I failed to capture
the Yenisei Kirghiz female spy alive.

475
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
I simply can't forgive myself.

476
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,860
What a shame on me!

477
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,100
With the battle approaching,

478
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,780
you should relax your mind even more.

479
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,740
Spare me your unhelpful comment!

480
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,260
Don't blame yourself.

481
00:22:50,830 --> 00:22:52,230
The mere Yenisei Kirghiz

482
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,240
aren't enough to disrupt Chang'an.

483
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,030
But time is running out now,

484
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:58,450
and we have fewer and fewer leads!

485
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:00,510
Few doesn't mean none.

486
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,310
I waited all night at Dayan Pagoda,

487
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,790
and it wasn't in vain.

488
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,310
I've thought of someone

489
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,730
who keeps appearing.

490
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,880
This person has a special identity

491
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,580
and could truly affect Chang'an's safety.

492
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,400
For the polo tournament
to proceed smoothly,

493
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,380
I must investigate this.

494
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:24,180
[Noodle Soup]

495
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,480
Please enjoy your meal.

496
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,080
Thank you.

497
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,680
Stop thinking about it.

498
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,550
Eat first.

499
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:33,830
You haven't slept all night.

500
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,750
You must be hungry.

501
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,210
After eating,
go back and get some good rest.

502
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,870
People call me a master detective,

503
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,800
yet I keep making mistakes.

504
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,130
I'm truly a disgrace to my mentor.

505
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,270
That Yenisei Kirghiz woman's death

506
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:50,600
is indeed regrettable.

507
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,560
Regardless of her identity,

508
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,960
she must have suffered greatly.

509
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,920
Suffered?

510
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,820
How do you know?

511
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,170
Yang Ji told me.

512
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,480
When I fought with her,

513
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,810
I saw it with my own eyes.

514
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,520
It's my fault.

515
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,310
I left too early yesterday.

516
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,070
If I had heard Yang Ji

517
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,270
mention this detail,

518
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,070
I wouldn't have needed

519
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,680
to set up an ambush at Dayan Pagoda.

520
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,140
I could have just
kept an eye on her directly.

521
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,090
What do you mean?

522
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,810
This isn't about suffering.

523
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,620
This is called
face mutilation and ear cutting.

524
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,010
This precisely proves

525
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,680
she was from the Yenisei Kirghiz nobility.

526
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,210
Yenisei Kirghiz nobility?

527
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:43,970
Ear cutting

528
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,880
is their funeral custom

529
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,720
after they lose close relatives.

530
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,920
When younger female relatives mourn,

531
00:24:51,030 --> 00:24:52,310
blood must be drawn.

532
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,310
Several generations ago,

533
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,700
they had to cut their faces with blades.

534
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,890
Later, it changed to ear cutting.

535
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,510
This is their ritual?

536
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,440
That's terrifying.

537
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,880
By the way, the long paper tube
containing the secret message

538
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,440
was taken by someone

539
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,100
wearing a Heavenly King mask.

540
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,220
Unfortunately, I couldn't catch up.

541
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:12,850
Speaking of masks,

542
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,200
that's another lead.

543
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,140
Well,

544
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,270
let's visit the Ghost Market again.

545
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,140
What for?

546
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:20,000
Do you remember Feng Tai,

547
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,160
Old Master Feng?

548
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:22,840
Remember.

549
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,880
The old man

550
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,790
in the Cantian Tower case

551
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,850
who helped us a lot?

552
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:33,070
This is the structural diagram
of the Cantian Tower.

553
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,480
He's very knowledgeable.

554
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,210
I need his advice on something.

555
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,680
Powerful and imposing,
just like you, Magistrate Feng.

556
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
What brings you here?

557
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,510
I, Wannian County Sheriff,

558
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,240
pay respects to you, Magistrate Feng.

559
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,790
I know you're an official again.

560
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,070
What are you showing off for?

561
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,450
I...

562
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,310
Greetings, Magistrate Feng.

563
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,550
We're all old friends here.

564
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:21,510
No need for formalities.

565
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,920
Please sit down. Come on.

566
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:27,200

I haven't done anything special.

574
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,750
The reason
this place is called the Ghost Market

575
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,960
is that it operates differently

576
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,760
from Chang'an.

577
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,720
People who make their living
in the Ghost Market

578
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,350

It must be from either Xunzhou Prefecture
or Nanzhou Prefecture.

And in disguise too.

753
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,030
If not for the investigation,

754
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,230
what else could it be?

755
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,150
So I haven't escaped

756
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,520
your keen observation.

757
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,360
Then I won't hide it anymore.

758
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,040
I am Su Wuming, Wannian County Sheriff,

759
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:28,250
and I am indeed investigating a case.

760
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,670
Su Wuming.

761
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,920
Seems to have some reputation.

762
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,960
You didn't get your position
through family connections, did you?

763
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,710
No, I didn't.

764
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,690
By the way, Tian,

765
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,290
your place must be nearby.

766
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:45,030
Could I trouble you for a cup of tea?

767
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,670
Actually, if I had focused on my studies,

768
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,760
I could have passed the exam last year.

769
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,420
But I have no interest in that.

770
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:57,010
I only want to be like this,

771
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,680
seeing her every day,

772
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,190
enchanted by her every expression.

773
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,240
That's the best life for me.

774
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
You're talking about

775
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:08,710
the female innkeeper of the Bafang Inn,

776
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:10,630
Lady Chong the Thirty-Sixth?

777
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,330
Except for her,

778
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,920
my eyes see

779
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,580
no one else.

780
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,860
She is the kindest person,

781
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,590
so she must have nothing to do

782
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,090
with your important case.

783
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,750
Please, you must believe me.

784
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,630
I heard

785
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,600
you've come to the inn for 2 years.

786
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,760
Since your proposal failed,

787
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,880
why waste more time?

788
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,720
It could have worked out.

789
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,400
It's all my fault. I shouldn't have pried.

790
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,730
I shouldn't have asked.

791
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,550
If I hadn't asked,

792
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,510
we would be together by now.

793
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,010
What happened?

794
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
Tell me about it.

795
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:47,070
I rent this house

796
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,320
with the money she lent me.

797
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,890
The day I moved in,

798
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,960
she and I

799
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,710
cleaned this place thoroughly.

800
00:35:58,510 --> 00:35:59,710
Alright.

801
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:02,630
It's spotless now.

802
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:08,960
Lady Chong,

803
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:11,280
I like you.

804
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,510
Will you marry me?

805
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,930
Don't say anything.

806
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,890
Just let me lean on you for a moment.

807
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,740
What happened?

808
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,800
Who did this?

809
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,550
It's nothing. Don't ask.

810
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,530
Tell me who it was.

811
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:48,630
Who would do this to the woman I love?

812
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:49,760
Who would be so cruel?

813
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,050
Tell me where this villain is.

814
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,280
If I pass the imperial exam
and become an official,

815
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,880
I'll find him and avenge you.

816
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,650
What a mood killer.

817
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,320
From what you said,

818
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:01,540
she has scars on her ear too.

819
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,760
Her ear is covered in scars.

820
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,030
How much blood must have been shed?

821
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,440
It shows the torture and humiliation

822
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,840
Lady Chong has endured.

823
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,760
Now I

824
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,920
deeply regret it.

825
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,650
Since that day,

826
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,560
she has never come back here.

827
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,280
I go to the inn every day,

828
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
but she barely acknowledges me.

829
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,280
But I know

830
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,740
I have a place in her heart.

831
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,620
Because she never drives me away.

832
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,360
She even gives me some money every month.

833
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,840
Because she knows I'm poor.

834
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,630
If she's from a foreign land,

835
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,090
can you accept that?

836
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,280
Yes.

837
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,400
I've thought about this too.

838
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,350
The reason she didn't tell me

839
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,590
might be that

840
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,760
the villain who abused her

841
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,290
isn't from our Tang Empire.

842
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,620
So even if I pass the exam
and become an official,

843
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
I still couldn't do anything to him.

844
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,960
Tian,

845
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:00,440
let's pretend we never met.

846
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
But recently,

847
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,780
if anything unexpected happens,

848
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,290
you can come to the Wannian County Office.

849
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,370
No, come to Shengye District,

850
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,360
to the Liuhe Sushan Shop to find me.

851
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,820
What do you mean by "unexpected"?

852
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,700
For example,
if Lady Chong the Thirty-Sixth

853
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,470
is in any danger

854
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,120
or encounters any trouble.

855
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,590
If you notice anything suspicious,

856
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,800
you can come to me.

857
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,410
I can't betray the one I love.

858
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,000
No one's asking you to betray her.

859
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,680
For her,

860
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,640
this might be a form of protection.

861
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,800
Do you know?

862
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,300
The woman who stayed at the inn yesterday

863
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,480
is dead.

864
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,830
She, like Lady Chong the Thirty-Sixth,

865
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,960
had cuts on her ear.

866
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,960
[Court of State Ceremonials]

867
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,280
Chief Minister Pei, you called for me?

868
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,280
Come look at this.

869
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,030
These are finally completed

870
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:04,230
imperial polo balls.

871
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,720
Exquisitely crafted.

872
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,580
Truly a treasure of the world.

873
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:17,040
Congratulations, Chief Minister Pei.

874
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,630
It's the Tang Empire
that deserves congratulations.

875
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,960
Presenting such polo balls

876
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,380
before foreign envoys

877
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,830
befits the grandeur of our Tang Empire.

878
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,380
You're right.

879
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,690
There are only

880
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,950
2 days left until the tournament.

881
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,880
I'm entrusting you

882
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,690
with guarding these polo balls.

883
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,510
I'm the Minister
of the Court of State Ceremonial.

884
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:40,670
On the day of the tournament,

885
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:43,100
I shall perform my duties

886
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,990
with full ceremonial protocol.

887
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,670
Only then will foreign nations

888
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:49,070
not dare to underestimate our Tang Empire.

889
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:51,960
Therefore, I'm counting on you.

890
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,250
Please rest assured, Chief Minister Pei.

891
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,760
[Yongzhou Prefecture]

892
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,620
Grand General.

893
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:05,280
I'm here for you.

894
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,900
Come with me to the palace.

895
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,280
-Your Majesty.
-Your Majesty.

896
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,360
The Retired Emperor

897
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,400
heard about Yenisei Kirghiz spies

898
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,730
infiltrating Chang'an

899
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,360
and sent someone to inquire.

900
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,120
How should I respond?

901
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,090
The 2 spies have been executed.

902
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,710
But the intelligence has already reached

903
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,340
their contact, the Wolf.

904
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,560
The Wolf hasn't been captured yet.

905
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,670
Is that so?

906
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,030
It's my fault.

907
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,870
I dare not hide anything from you.

908
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,240
This complicates matters.

909
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,880
The Retired Emperor suggests

910
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,880
that if threats are not eliminated,

911
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,050
I should not attend in person.

912
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,280
Your Majesty, your safety

913
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,840
is of concern to the Tang Empire.

914
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,480
I believe

915
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,160
the Retired Emperor's concerns are valid.

916
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,130
Lu Lingfeng.

917
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,800
You have 2 days left.

918
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,920
Are you confident

919
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,150
you can capture the Wolf

920
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,680
and eliminate the threats?

921
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:00,170
No, I'm not.

922
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,150
I know you've done your best.

923
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,960
We'll have to proceed as is.
