[Episode 16]

3
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,880
Who dares to hurt Su Wuming?

4
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,440
Su Wuming!

5
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,700
Are you hurt?

6
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,710
No.

7
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,420
Madam Yingtao,

8
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,400
you're truly my protector.

9
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,530
Husband!

10
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,380
Husband!

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,079
Master!

12
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,470
-Official Lu!
-Official Lu!

13
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,220
Please step back.

14
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,220
I'll catch the criminals for you!

15
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:33,800
Lu Lingfeng!

16
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,900
What happened?

17
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,480
Why are so many people dead?

18
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,210
Master Fei,

19
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,870
quickly treat his wounds!

20
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:41,560
-Hurry!
-Come on.

21
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,390
Help him up.

22
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:43,800
Bring him there.

23
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,079
Fei,

24
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,220
Lu Lingfeng is in your hands now.

25
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:50,030
Don't worry.

26
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,400
Come.

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,060
With me here, he won't die!

28
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,810
Hold on.

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
How dare you hurt my husband?

30
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,400
Yingtao,

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,000
watch out for hidden weapon!

32
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,690
Using hidden weapons against me?

33
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,560
Zi!

34
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,800
Zi!

35
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,120
Mother!

36
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,360
Zi!

37
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,960
Mother!

38
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,520
Zi!

39
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,930
Daughter!

40
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:42,590
Daughter!

41
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,280
Huo Jing!

42
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,210
Daughter!

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,079
Daughter!

44
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,960
Daughter!

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,630
Huo Jing.

46
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:55,470
Huo Jing!

47
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,960
Huo Jing!

48
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,630
Huo Jing!

49
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,590
Daughter!

50
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,250
You killed my wife and daughter!

51
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,600
None of you will live!

52
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,340
What is this thing?

53
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,990
I don't know either!

54
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,660
Deer antlers

55
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,850
and a tiger head.

56
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,570
Could it be Bai Ze?

57
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:15,410
It can't be.

58
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,310
Bai Ze is an auspicious beast.

59
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,870
It shouldn't look this fierce.

60
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:20,050
It is Bai Ze!

61
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,750
The so-called auspicious beast

62
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,250
is just a fabrication.

63
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,620
This beast is raised by me.

64
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,730
It's my mount.

65
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,380
His Majesty likes it,

66
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,159
so I'll let it into Chang'an

67
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,010
to feast as it pleases!

68
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,070
Fei!

69
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,430
Spear!

70
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,160
What?

71
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Give me the spear!

72
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,060
This is definitely not Bai Ze.

73
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,610
This scholar

74
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,440
is as weak as a kitten.

75
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:00,910
Leave him to me later.

76
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,670
I'll smoke him into jerky

77
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,250
to feed my mount.

78
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,330
The mummy!

79
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,640
This is Ao Tian.

80
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,160
It resembles Bai Ze
but is a ferocious beast.

81
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,620
It likes to eat dried meat.

82
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:19,890
Fei,

83
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
come with me quickly to carry the mummy.

84
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,390
Wait!

85
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,120
It likes dried meat?

86
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:24,940
Well...

87
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:27,390
Would beef jerky work?

88
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,190
I just bought it at the West Market.

89
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:31,450
I was planning to share it with everyone.

90
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,710
This should work too.

91
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,659
Fei,

92
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,370
I'll leave it to you.

93
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:42,570
Alright.

94
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,159
Jia, Luo,

95
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:56,940
help me get on the roof!

96
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,000
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

97
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,470
Lu Lingfeng!

98
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,190
Lu Lingfeng!

99
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:24,270
Lure it over here.

100
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:01,020
Don't eat it!

101
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,300
Don't eat it!

102
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,410
It's poisoned.

103
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,200
You can't eat it!

104
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,220
Bite off those people's heads!

105
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,200
Don't eat it!

106
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:10,790
No!

107
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,790
Ah!

108
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,380
Stop!

109
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,780
Stop now!

110
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,910
Stop immediately!

111
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,820
Stop!

112
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,150
Stop right now!

113
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,910
[Bai Ze Temple]

114
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,740
Let me see.

115
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,750
Lu Lingfeng,

116
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,700
who hurt you?

117
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,840
Was it this female regimental commander?

118
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,570
She doesn't seem that skilled.

119
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:56,670
Could it be

120
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,960
she used her feminine charms?

121
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,160
Don't talk nonsense.

122
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:02,670
Tie her up.

123
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,600
Take her back for questioning.

124
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,920
You want to capture me

125
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,000
to claim credit before that Emperor

126
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,310
surnamed Li?

127
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,390
Dream on.

128
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,940
This sword

129
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,520
was a birthday gift

130
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,150
she gave me when I was 14.

131
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,360
She gave me my life.

132
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:26,210
Now, I'm giving it back to her.

133
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,390
Hey, don't!

134
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't!

135
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,720
Though your crimes are unforgivable,

136
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,910
I have one thing

137
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,270
to ask you.

138
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,710
Does the Princess know about...

139
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
your actions today?

140
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,200
You'll never know.

141
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:56,520
Lu Lingfeng,

142
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,100
could you please ask the Princess

143
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,960
to bury me on the Hongdu Plain

144
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,120
next to Shangguan Zhaorong's tomb?

145
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:03,880
If possible,

146
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,750
I need no epitaph,

147
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,480
just a simple stone

148
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:08,940
inscribed with

149
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,000
the words "Daughter of Shangguan Wan'er."

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,530
That would be enough for me.

151
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:22,480
Mother.

152
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,150
I'm coming.

153
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:51,730
[Bai Ze Temple]

154
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:18,550
Put me down.

155
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,730
Master, we're not tired.

156
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,230
I said put me down.

157
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,380
Careful, slowly.

158
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,420
Here, slowly.

159
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:26,510
Gently.

160
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,740
Do you know what I'm thinking?

161
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,000
To walk in the last rays of sunset

162
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
and retreat far into the mountains.

163
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,080
The one who knows me

164
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,840
is Lu Lingfeng.

165
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,680
We are senior
and junior brothers, after all.

166
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,880
All these years solving cases together,

167
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,550
we've become like family.

168
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:01,720
Get to the point.

169
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:03,910
Don't waste time with idle talk.

170
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:07,760
When reporting to His Majesty,

171
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
we absolutely cannot

172
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:12,480
reveal the whole truth

173
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:14,710
about what happened on Mount Zhongnan.

174
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,810
Talking about Ao Tian

175
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,590
is fine,

176
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,870
but Li Nai'er's identity

177
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,870
must not be mentioned at all.

178
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:21,910
Why not?

179
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,510
We cannot cause further conflict

180
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,240
between His Majesty and the Princess.

181
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,150
That would plunge Chang'an

182
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,210
into bloody chaos.

183
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,080
Su Wuming.

184
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,610
Can such a thing

185
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,700
really be kept secret?

186
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:40,200
For now,

187
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,710
we should be able to keep it hidden.

188
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:46,910
When it can no longer be concealed,

189
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,570
we'll have to leave it to fate.

190
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,270
You want me to lie before His Majesty.

191
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,770
I cannot do that.

192
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,600
That makes it even easier then.

193
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,510
Official Lu

194
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
is severely wounded
and unable to see His Majesty.

195
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,860
I will go in your place.

196
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,040
I'll follow your advice for now.

197
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,280
But there are things

198
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,700
I must ask the Princess.

199
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,150
There are matters

200
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,170
I need to understand clearly.

201
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,670
Why bother?

202
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,720
Some things are better left unclear.

203
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,250
I cannot remain in the dark.

204
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,600
You know my relationship with her.

205
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,160
People would say

206
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,620
I am the closest person to her.

207
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,660
Yet I am also very distant.

208
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,480
So distant

209
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,300
that I don't truly know her at all.

210
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,000
It's as if

211
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,170
I never knew her.

212
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,980
Ji.

213
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,500
Come here quickly.

214
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,840
Mother.

215
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,320
It's freezing cold.

216
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,390
Why are you using a fan?

217
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:03,910
Leave!

218
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,920
Your Highness, please wipe your sweat.

219
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:15,240
Lu Lingfeng

220
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,590
is brave yet cautious,

221
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,390
and skilled in martial arts.

222
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,110
With Su Wuming by his side,

223
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,740
he should be safe.

224
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,750
What?

225
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,640
Su Wuming,

226
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,250
repeat what you just said.

227
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,550
Is...

228
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,190
Is it that I

229
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,800
may not have spoken clearly

230
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,950
in some parts?

231
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,610
His Majesty
wants you to repeat everything.

232
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,840
If there's even half a lie,

233
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,440
I'll cut off your head!

234
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:00,320
Then allow me to report
from the beginning.

235
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,010
Your Highness!

236
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,380
Your Highness,

237
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,550
the team searching for Bai Ze

238
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,480
has returned from Mount Zhongnan.

239
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,090
Why are you so flustered?

240
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,940
Commander Li and her guide Huo Jing

241
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,200
didn't come back.

242
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,580
What happened?

243
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,880
They encountered a fierce beast

244
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:21,740
and died.

245
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,630
What about Lu Lingfeng?

246
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,320
Official Lu is severely wounded.

247
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,670
Only Su Wuming escaped unharmed

248
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,530
and went to report to His Majesty.

249
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:33,110
No wonder I dreamed of my son.

250
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,370
Where is he wounded?

251
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:36,870
Is his life in danger?

252
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,190
The details are unknown.

253
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,320
Where is my son now?

254
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,430
That's roughly what happened.

255
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,270
Though they drove away the beast Ao Tian

256
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,800
and forced it off a cliff...

257
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,550
General Ding Heng
of the Right Imperial Guards,

258
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,620
Records Official Chen He,

259
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,030
Military Affairs Official Wei Qi,

260
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,190
and Cavalry Official Huo You

261
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,530
all perished in battle.

262
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,750
Commander of the Princess's Guards,
Li Nai'er,

263
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,980
also lost her life.

264
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,880
But these five people

265
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,510
all faced the danger without fear.

266
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:12,270
Together with
the Yongzhou Judicial Official,

267
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,800
Lu Lingfeng,
they fought Ao Tian to the death.

268
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,140
The scene was heart-stopping

269
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,250
and what was even more touching

270
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,329
was that the five worked together,

271
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,069
each willing to sacrifice their lives.

272
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:25,030
Whenever I

273
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,040
recall that scene,

274
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:28,610
I just...

275
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,150
Your Majesty,

276
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,330
condolences.

277
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,770
How dare you, Du Ming!

278
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,920
You only listened to one hunter's words

279
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,720
and falsely claimed
an auspicious beast had appeared,

280
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,550
leading to today's tragedy.

281
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,010
How do you answer for that?

282
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,720
I...

283
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,190
I dare not speak carelessly.

284
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,110
I only reported what the hunter said

285
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:58,920
exactly as it was told

286
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,020
to Su Wuming.

287
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:01,720
The one who concluded it was Bai Ze

288
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,700
was him.

289
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,230
Chief Administrator Du!

290
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
Chief Administrator Du,

291
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,680
what was wrong

292
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,960
with my conclusion?

293
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,350
It wasn't Bai Ze at all.

294
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,440
It was the fierce beast Ao Tian.

295
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,400
-You said it yourself.
-Let me ask you!

296
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,240
Does Mount Zhongnan fall under
Yongzhou Prefecture's jurisdiction?

297
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,700
Well...

298
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:27,890
There was someone in the mountains
calling himself Hermit Baize

299
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,010
who occupied a temple
and raised a fierce beast,

300
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,000
robbing and killing people.

301
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,730
Whose responsibility is this?

302
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,510
Du Ming

303
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,840
bears an inescapable responsibility.

304
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,140
When a wise ruler appears, Bai Ze appears.

305
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,960
This is heaven's way.

306
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:52,660
Because the fierce beast Ao Tian
terrorized Mount Zhongnan,

307
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,310
Bai Ze had descended
to our world,

308
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,900
but we were not fortunate enough
to see this auspicious beast.

309
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,070
But our Tang Empire warriors,

310
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:01,920
united as one,

311
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,290
killed Ao Tian

312
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,320
and suddenly saw the sky clear
and clouds part.

313
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,390
and golden light
shines through the clouds,

314
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:12,220
and the call of the auspicious beast
was heard.

315
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,570
At that moment,

316
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:16,830
birds sang, swallows danced,
deer called, and monkeys cried.

317
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,780
All sounded like celestial music

318
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,640
and we felt as if bathed in spring breeze,

319
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:23,320
refreshed in body and mind.

320
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,950
Even Lu Lingfeng who was severely injured

321
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,820
suddenly

322
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,570
improved quite a bit.

323
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,750
Is it really so?

324
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,310
Did you really hear the call

325
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:35,480
of the auspicious beast?

326
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,010
It's absolutely true.

327
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,320
That sound was almost like human speech,

328
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,620
as if expressing

329
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,960
a longing for peaceful times.

330
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,680
Not only did I hear it

331
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,720
but everyone from Yongzhou Prefecture

332
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,160
who came to help

333
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,520
also heard it.

334
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,680
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.
-Congratulations, Your Majesty.

335
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:59,940
-Congratulations to the Tang Empire.
-Congratulations to the Tang Empire.

336
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,520
It's just a pity about Ding Heng.

337
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,120
They were all
meritorious officials of the Tanglong era,

338
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,500
my beloved generals.

339
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,590
But because of a fierce beast,

340
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,680
they perished in Mount Zhongnan.

341
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,820
Where are the bodies

342
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,920
of Ding Heng and the other three generals?

343
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,650
They're temporarily placed at
the Bai Ze Temple on Mount Zhongnan.

344
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,440
Go there on my behalf

345
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:44,080
and give those four generals
a proper burial on Mount Zhongnan.

346
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:46,640
Yongzhou Prefecture
will certainly handle this matter well.

347
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,860
Did I tell you to go?

348
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,960
Please calm your anger, Your Majesty.
I acknowledge my fault.

349
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,480
What fault do you have?

350
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:30,840
Tell me,

351
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,550
was Su Wuming telling the truth?

352
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:36,320
I don't know, Your Majesty.

353
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,830
He speaks nothing but nonsense.

354
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,630
Are you saying

355
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,070
that there is absolutely

356
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:45,030
no such thing as Bai Ze
appearing in this world?

357
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:45,640
No, no.

358
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,550
Either

359
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,310
my beloved generals killed each other,

360
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,680
or those four imperial guards

361
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,750
were no match
for a female regimental commander.

362
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,750
How could that be possible?

363
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,280
Then why did you say
he was speaking nonsense?

364
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,660
What a formidable disciple of Master Di.

365
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,700
Not a single word of truth,

366
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,240
yet impossible to find fault with.

367
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,990
And he still manages to save my face.

368
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,290
Yes,

369
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,440
how frightening indeed.

370
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,640
If in the near future,

371
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,030
he stands among the enemy ranks,

372
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,760
he would become
Your Majesty's greatest threat.

373
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,400
For such a person...

374
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,920
Kill him

375
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,970
to prevent future trouble.

376
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:26,590
But he ventured into the secret realm
of Mount Zhongnan

377
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,110
and brought back news of Bai Ze.

378
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:29,170
How can we kill him?

379
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,790
Make way!

380
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,060
-Move!
-Move!

381
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,920
The Princess has arrived!

382
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,920
Those inside, come out to greet her!

383
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,270
[Great virtue can carry the world]

384
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,270
[Pei's Mansion]

385
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,900
[Great virtue can carry the world]

386
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,450
Fei Yingjun,

387
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,380
I trust your medical skills,

388
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,980
but I also know how vicious beasts can be.

389
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,240
[Great virtue can carry the world]

390
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,450
I just want to hear from you directly.

391
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,860
Is my son's life in danger?

392
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,420
Of course...

393
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,530
there's no danger to his life.

394
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,210
I was just

395
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,170
about to change his dressing.

396
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:16,200
Your Highness,

397
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:16,350
[Great virtue can carry the world]

398
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:18,350
Lu Lingfeng was seriously injured,

399
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
but with Miracle Doctor Fei's treatment,

400
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,260
he is out of danger now.

401
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,110
He's just preparing
to have his dressing changed,

402
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,110
so he couldn't come out to greet you.

403
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,550
Then I can rest assured.

404
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,990
Take me to see him now.

405
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,590
Well done, Shangguan Nai'er.

406
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,720
Fighting four enemies alone,

407
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,780
she eliminated Lu Tong's
right-hand men in one breath.

408
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,810
Truly a woman matching any man's valor.

409
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:48,030
But she hurt my Ji.

410
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,740
She deserved her fate anyway.

411
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,270
Was Li Nai'er acting under your orders?

412
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,410
You must answer truthfully

413
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,770
without concealment.

414
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,870
I am the Grand Princess.

415
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,840
How dare a mere bandit-catching officer

416
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,790
interrogate me?

417
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,070
Your Highness still hasn't answered

418
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:21,800
my question.

419
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,260
Li Nai'er

420
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,160
killed a few people

421
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,520
to avenge Wan'er.

422
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,410
What's wrong with that?

423
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,830
That night Deposed Queen Wei was killed,

424
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,190
the night of rebellion,

425
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,720
I led the charge

426
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,080
as the General.

427
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:35,270
So...

428
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,020
In your plan,

429
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,670
should I die too?

430
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,630
Here.

431
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,680
Let me tell you about

432
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,440
Shangguan Wan'er.

433
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,450
Wan'er suffered tragedy as an infant,

434
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,970
so the palace became her home.

435
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,550
She was brilliant from a young age,

436
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,480
able to memorize everything at a glance.

437
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,850
At 14 years old,

438
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,020
she went to Empress Wu Zetian's side,

439
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,310
handling official documents

440
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:06,110
and participating in important decisions.

441
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:07,590
Writing with remarkable fluency,

442
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,320
she was admired by all at court.

443
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,450
She was one year older than me.

444
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,350
In that cold, fragrant palace,

445
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,070
with only the moonlight for company,

446
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:23,550
we became the best of friends.

447
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,920
During the Shenlong era,

448
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,450
Zhang Jianzhi and others
forced my mother to abdicate.

449
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,880
Under the pretext of restoring power
to the Li family,

450
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,280
they wanted to seize power for themselves.

451
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,070
If not for the support Wan'er and I

452
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,310
offered,

453
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,840
how could my weak brother,

454
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,330
the Emperor Zhongzong,

455
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,550
have secured his throne?

456
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,920
Later,

457
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,630
the Wei family seized power.

458
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,550
Wan'er navigated carefully
between factions,

459
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,720
trying to stabilize
a precarious situation.

460
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,700
Did you know

461
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,240
that Wan'er and I had already agreed

462
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,310
to work together from both sides

463
00:25:57,350 --> 00:26:00,350
to support
the current Retired Emperor's ascension?

464
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,840
We were the true planners

465
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,830
of the Tanglong Palace coup.

466
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,200
The one

467
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,110
sitting on the throne now

468
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,160
was merely the implementor

469
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,480
who stormed the palace.

470
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,450
Yet for the sake of power,

471
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,090
he caused Wan'er

472
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,390
to die in the capital.

473
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,030
Humans are more treacherous than demons.

474
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,200
I've witnessed it myself.

475
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,720
I buried Wan'er

476
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,310
in my family cemetery.

477
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,150
Also buried with her

478
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,960
was a 982-character

479
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,920
epitaph.

480
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,400
I deliberately had my name

481
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,510
engraved on it,

482
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,810
as a slap to his face,

483
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,580
accusing him of brutally killing
a loyal official.

484
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,480
I want future generations to know

485
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,590
that heaven has its own justice.

486
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:55,130
Your Highness,

487
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,750
you still haven't truthfully answered

488
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:57,550
my question.

489
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,350
Answer what?

490
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,670
Li Nai'er avenged Wan'er.

491
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,200
She killed those
who were the executioners back then.

492
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,510
Ding Heng was the one

493
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,720
who killed Wan'er.

494
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,640
He deserved to die long ago.

495
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,240
Answer my question!

496
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,750
Li Nai'er,
Commander of the Princess's Guards,

497
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:19,310
murdered four commanders
of the Imperial Guard.

498
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,490
Was it under your orders?

499
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,600
This concerns many lives.

500
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:25,800
You should answer truthfully.

501
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,860
Since you're no longer in danger,

502
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,400
just focus on recovering.

503
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:32,880
I'm leaving.

504
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,750
Mother!

505
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,850
I want to know

506
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,720
the truth.

507
00:27:52,350 --> 00:27:53,510
Silly child.

508
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,380
If I had ordered it,

509
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,690
how would you have gotten hurt?

510
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,640
That's good then.

511
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,650
Since it wasn't under your orders,

512
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,220
then what I fear most

513
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,480
won't happen,

514
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,830
right?

515
00:28:14,510 --> 00:28:16,480
What are you worried about, my child?

516
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,340
Speak plainly.

517
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,550
The Tang Empire
cannot withstand more turmoil.

518
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,610
The people need peace and stability.

519
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,160
Mother,

520
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,340
I sincerely ask you

521
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,800
to stay away from court affairs

522
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,870
and enjoy your remaining years.

523
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,860
Enjoy my remaining years?

524
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,710
Am I that old?

525
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,640
My mother

526
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,370
ascended the throne at 67 years old,

527
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,880
becoming China's first female emperor.

528
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,720
Why

529
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,890
can't I follow her example?

530
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,470
Empress Wu, for the sake of power,

531
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,810
either forced or harmed

532
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,510
and killed her own two sons.

533
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:26,440
Do you wish to follow that example too?

534
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,240
Unresolved incidents from the past

535
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,510
shouldn't be spoken of carelessly.

536
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,400
Sometimes,

537
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,000
past events are just stories
told by people today.

538
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,880
Then let's talk about the present.

539
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,550
On Mount Zhongnan,

540
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,280
we didn't find traces of Bai Ze,

541
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,400
but we did hear
the call of an auspicious beast.

542
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,630
The appearance of Bai Ze

543
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,350
is a good omen for the Tang Empire.

544
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:50,350
It also indicates

545
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,680
that the current Emperor

546
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,720
is a wise ruler.

547
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:56,660
I beg you, Mother,

548
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,760
not to go against heaven's will.

549
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,660
This was also authorized by
the Emperor, right?

550
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,960
Fooling the common people is one thing,

551
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,720
but trying to fool me?

552
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,240
Besides,

553
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,370
how do you know

554
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,100
I wouldn't be a better emperor than him?

555
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Is it just because

556
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,290
I am a woman?

557
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,550
I was born into

558
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,610
the world's unique imperial family.

559
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:34,920
I grew up beside the Empress,

560
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,790
influenced by what I saw and heard.

561
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,560
I've always wanted to be like my mother

562
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,440
to rectify the court

563
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
and bring prosperity to the people.

564
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,400
Empress Wu Zetian had an eye

565
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:49,790
for recognizing, valuing,
and nurturing talent.

566
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,550
Even someone like Shangguan Wan'er,

567
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,610
a descendant of a criminal official,

568
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,780
could be given important positions.

569
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,470
Does the current Emperor

570
00:30:57,790 --> 00:30:59,130
possess

571
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,330
such magnanimity?

572
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,030
If he can't recognize talent
or distinguish loyalty from treachery,

573
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:05,550
him remaining on the throne

574
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:07,150
may destroy the Tang Empire.

575
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,830
If one day

576
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,180
I truly face him in battle,

577
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,300
what I'm fighting for
is the fate of the Tang Empire!

578
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:16,590
My title

579
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
is Princess Protector of the State.

580
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,500
Do you know

581
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,980
what "Protector of the State" means?

582
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,450
Lu Lingfeng,

583
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,310
you are my child.

584
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,390
My blood flows through your veins.

585
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,640
When the time comes,

586
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,200
whether you stand with him

587
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,870
or by my side,

588
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,510
what you should care about

589
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,200
is the nation's welfare

590
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,970
and the people's livelihood

591
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,180
to truly live up to the title
"Protector of the State."

592
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,220
Guards! Guards!

593
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,350
Guards!

594
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,480
Your Majesty,

595
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,590
what's wrong?

596
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:41,170
I dreamed of many venomous snakes

597
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,310
crawling out from these reports.

598
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:44,360
Quickly,

599
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,800
take these old reports

600
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,750
and burn them all.

601
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,370
No!

602
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:49,070
What's the use

603
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,820
of keeping them here?

604
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:51,790
Shangguan Wan'er's

605
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:54,880
imperial edicts
written on behalf of Emperor Zhongzong

606
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,680
are sometimes

607
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,160
more practical than my own

608
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,420
governance policies.

609
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,000
No wonder Aunt was furious with me

610
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,520
after her death.

611
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,880
She called her
a literary star fallen to earth,

612
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,540
the most talented
among the imperial consorts,

613
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,850
a devoted statesman to the empire.

614
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,560
Why did I have such a dream?

615
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,440
Could I have executed the wrong person,

616
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,170
leading to Ding Heng
and the three other generals

617
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,860
meeting their deaths
in the jaws of a wild beast?

618
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,070
You may leave now.

619
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

620
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,480
I remember

621
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:45,160
you grew up in the palace.

622
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,160
Did you ever meet Shangguan Wan'er?

623
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,990
From the age of eight,

624
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:51,920
I worked at

625
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,750
Lady Shangguan's Ink Rhyme Pavilion,

626
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,720
grinding cinnabar for three years.

627
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:56,740
What was she like?

628
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,440
She always reminded us

629
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:00,640
that when walking in the palace,

630
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,300
we should never let cinnabar
stain our sleeves,

631
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,360
just as officials

632
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:08,350
should never let
personal interests taint...

633
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,780
their work.

634
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,139
So, you're saying

635
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,030
she was a loyal official?

636
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,230
After she was tattooed as punishment,

637
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:22,960
she was given calming incense,

638
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,350
but she didn't use it.

639
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,320
She said...

640
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:26,770
What did she say?

641
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,480
She said those with guilty consciences

642
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,150
are the ones who use slumbering incense.

643
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:34,409
She kept her broken body awake
to better atone for her sins.

644
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,510
Your Majesty,

645
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,800
the gastrodia powder is ready.

646
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,400
Would you like to take it now?

647
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,710
I must drink this gastrodia powder
every day

648
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,909
to sleep peacefully.

649
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,400
Could it be
because of a guilty conscience?

650
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,440
I didn't mean it that way.

651
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,360
I misspoke.

652
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:54,250
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

653
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,670
Your passing is like
the Xiao and Xiang Rivers run dry,

654
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,000
Mount Weiwan collapses,

655
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,880
pearls sink and break,

656
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,110
and jade shatters into pieces.

657
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,530
I gaze at the pine trees,

658
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,310
listening silently at your tomb.

659
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:35,950
May your virtue be extolled

660
00:35:37,230 --> 00:35:43,030
for centuries onward.

661
00:35:46,030 --> 00:35:46,960
Chancellor Cui,

662
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,930
do you know your crime?

663
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,060
Your Highness,

664
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,760
I don't know what crime I've committed.

665
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,190
Li Nai'er was Wan'er's adopted daughter.

666
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,590
When you introduced her

667
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,670
to the Princess's Mansion,

668
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,870
did you not know this?

669
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,030
I did not.

670
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,360
With your relationship with Wan'er,

671
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,630
how could you not have known?

672
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:07,560
Chancellor Cui,

673
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,660
I can make you Chancellor,

674
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:11,590
but I can also have you

675
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,040
imprisoned at any time.

676
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
I am well aware.

677
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,280
Since I chose to follow Your Highness,

678
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,960
even if I'm thrown in prison

679
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,080
or lose my head,

680
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,230
I have no regrets.

681
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:24,800
Today,

682
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:25,910
I would like to

683
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,790
congratulate you.

684
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,280
As soon as the team searching for Bai Ze

685
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,480
returned to Chang'an,

686
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,230
rumors spread through the districts.

687
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,280
They say Bai Ze's disappearance

688
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,600
is a heavenly warning,

689
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,670
that the one on the throne

690
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,270
is unworthy of the position.

691
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,150
And the four commanders
of the Imperial Guard

692
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:40,880
who died in the jaws of the beast

693
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,630
have become a laughingstock.

694
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,110
It seems

695
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:46,480
you not only knew about

696
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,870
Li Nai'er's identity,

697
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,150
but also knew about

698
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,390
all her plans.

699
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,860
Weren't you afraid that my son Lu Lingfeng

700
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,250
might've met misfortune on this journey?

701
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,320
How dare you!

702
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,350
I'll kill you!

703
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,880
If one day,
I fail when success is within reach

704
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,710
and become a ghost under my enemy's blade,

705
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,590
I would rather

706
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,360
have my life ended

707
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:19,160
by your hand today.

708
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,960
It would be my honor.

709
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:31,380
What failure are you talking about?

710
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,980
How discouraging.

711
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,630
The Cui clan of Boling

712
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,260
surpasses that of Qinghe.

713
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,150
We never resort to flattery.

714
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,520
Princess,

715
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:44,320
you are the one

716
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,150
most suited to rule the Tang Empire.

717
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,280
For that day to come,

718
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
you must plan strategically

719
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,510
and be resolute in your decisions.

720
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,590
Even if your closest relatives

721
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,780
stand in your way,

722
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,230
they must be eliminated.

723
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,090
On this matter,

724
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,840
Your Highness should think more about

725
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,640
how Empress Wu

726
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,270
handled such situations.

727
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,620
Du Ming, as the official of the capital,

728
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,670
falsely claimed auspicious signs
and failed in his duties.

729
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:16,190
Will the Censorate not intervene?

730
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,000
Since His Majesty abdicated
to become the Retired Emperor,

731
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,700
Du Ming

732
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
has clearly allied himself
with the current Emperor.

733
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,000
We can use this opportunity

734
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,480
to expel him from Chang'an.

735
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,740
What a brilliant plan!

736
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,030
I'll see to it immediately.
