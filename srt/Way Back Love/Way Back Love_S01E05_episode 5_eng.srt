1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,780
   

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,690
   

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,730
   

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,410
   

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,940
   

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:21,340
♫  Broken Hearts and dreams  ♫

7
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:26,220
♫  Burn all your troubles away  ♫

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:51,030


9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:57,250
He was in shock once.

10
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,450
His blood pressure keeps dropping.

11
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,470
 Kim Ram Woo. Kim Ram Woo. Kim Ram Woo. 

12
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:04,230
Pardon?

13
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,940
You understand everything I said, right?

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes.

15
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,560
D-Did I die?

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,730
Yes.

17
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,910
I'll take you to the netherworld now.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,940
You just need to follow me.

19
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,670
You pick things up faster than most.

20
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,110
Let's keep this simple.

21
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:25,830
- Okay. 
  - No, I'm not leaving! 

22
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,520
 Stop telling me to leave! I won't! 

23
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:32,290
Taking a dead away feels like lottery sometimes.

24
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,820
They show various kinds of reactions.

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,820
If they refuse to come with me,

26
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,200
they have the best odds.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,670
They must be leaving a lot behind.

28
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,210
I guess I understand.

29
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,730
A lot of them beg me to spare them, too.

30
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,400
There are all sorts.

31
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:51,500
So,

32
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,000
what do you regret the most now?

33
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,950
 Kim Ram Woo. 

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,090
 Switching names with you was so troublesome, 

35
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,890
 but it was the most fun thing I did in high school. 

36
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,610
 Want to sit together when we go home? 

37
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,190
 Okay. 

38
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,220
Gosh, you must've thought of something immediately.

39
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,700
Does a Grim Reaper talk casually to everyone?

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,390
Gosh, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,080
But it's not because you're a minor.

42
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,340
Because I died centuries ago,

43
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,920
everyone looks like a baby to me.

44
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,960
Okay.

45
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,270
You're like my ancestor.

46
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,650
Since I didn't accomplish much in life,

47
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,650
I have a lot of regrets.

48
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:45,970
I didn't want to become an evil spirit either.

49
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,170
So, I found a healthy solution.

50
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:51,550
Thankfully, I get to come and go legally

51
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,520
and see this world, too.

52
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,890
You can come and go?

53
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,700
Yes.

54
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,000
How do you become a Grim Reaper?

55
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,530
I asked the real estate agency.

56
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,260
No one knows what happened to her.

57
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,210
My mom...

58
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,120
What was she like at the funeral?

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,640
What?

60
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,270
Did she cry a lot?

61
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,750
It must've been tough for her alone.

62
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,280
She must've been lonely.

63
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:47,880
I'm not there. Of course, it was my funeral.

64
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,720
Was it always like that?

65
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,960
I don't know if I just failed to see it,

66
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:57,450
but my mom's parents

67
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,130
must've been all alone too.

68
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:09,210
Hey, what kind of Grim Reaper are you?

69
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,590
You can't even find a person?

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:14,550
Hey, do you think I'm God or something?

71
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:16,290
Of course, I know nothing outside of my job.

72
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,820
Then we'd be free to go anywhere.

73
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,490
You're strangely incompetent.

74
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:23,130
You only look like something.

75
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,550
You're a fake Grim Reaper, aren't you?

76
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,460
I look good because I'm the employee of the month, okay?

77
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,340
Gosh. Is it to maintain dignity?

78
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,080
Yes.

79
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,350
I saved up quite a bit because of that.

80
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,440
I opened a savings account early on.

81
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,490
I'll buy a house overlooking Samdocheon once my vacation ends.

82
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:46,200
I'll finally plan for the next stage in life.

83
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,330
Since I like having a lively home,

84
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,240
I'll have a puppy. I'll work less, too.

85
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,100
I think I'll get a Korean cuisine certificate, too.

86
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,560
How cool.

87
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,330
You must be happy.

88
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,300
Gosh, unbelievable.

89
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,660
- I was lying. 
 - What?

90
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,870
There's no such thing.

91
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,780
When you're dead,

92
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,750
there's nothing.

93
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,560
I want to become a Grim Reaper, too.

94
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,370
What do you have to do?

95
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:24,060
- What? 
 - Why not?

96
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,460
Don't I get to hang out with you after I die?

97
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:29,820
You can't.

98
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,310
Why not? You do it, too.

99
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,200
- Well, you— 
 - What? What? What? What? What?

100
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,780
You don't know Chinese characters.

101
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,120
Seriously...

102
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,190
You don't like studying.

103
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:44,330
I don't care. I'll just do it.

104
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,310
I think there's...

105
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,560
one person who knows my mom.

106
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,330
 Kim Ram Woo? 

107
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,930
You must be Kim Ram Woo.

108
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,120
I'm not. I'm Jeong Hee Wan.

109
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,470
   

110
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,590
I see.

111
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,210
You look a lot like someone I know.

112
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,500
Who are you?

113
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,800
   

114
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,920
This is who I am.

115
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,250
Keep it.

116
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,120
You might need me later.

117
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,220
   

118
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,040
   

119
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,330
   

120
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,870
Maybe I should've dressed up a bit.

121
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,940
What if they find me suspicious?

122
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,660
I know. You do look a bit drab.

123
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,440
Shit.

124
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,880
How should I explain myself, then?

125
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,180
A friend of her husband's child out of wedlock?

126
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,270
No, that doesn't sound right.

127
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:28,590
A student of her husband's mistress.

128
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,680
Geez, that's nonsense.

129
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,470
I'm screwed. What do I do?

130
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,000
You wanted to see me?

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,880
Hey, it's her.

132
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,970
Right.

133
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,210
How can I help you?

134
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,590
CEO Ryu, right?

135
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,990
I'm looking for an artist.

136
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:50,680
Because...

137
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,080
Because...

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,280
I... I'm a reporter.

139
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,240
Reporter?

140
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,880
You didn't call in advance, right?

141
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,410
Why are you taking it so far?

142
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,170
I can give your business card to an employee.

143
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,930
Business card?

144
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,130
Yes, my business card...

145
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,570
She doesn't have one.

146
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,370
Excuse me.

147
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,240
- You have one? 
 - Business card... Where is it?

148
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,130
I had a business card in here.

149
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,560
Here.

150
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,230
   

151
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:26,220
Student ID?

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,990
Jeong Hee Wan?

153
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,950
I've heard of that name.

154
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,370
I'm sorry I told such a silly lie.

155
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:38,160
I wasn't sure how to explain myself.

156
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,860
I was curious why he said he was Jeong Hee Wan.

157
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,730
I didn't know it was his girlfriend's name.

158
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,360
Well, I'm not his girlfriend.

159
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,790
I'm not... So...

160
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:56,610
I know it's out of nowhere, but I need your help.

161
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,930
This is very important to me.

162
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,360
I need to see Ms. Kim.

163
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,470
Why do you think I can help you?

164
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,940
Well, Ram Woo told me.

165
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,680
I mean, back in the day.

166
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,540
Because he's the son of my husband's mistress?

167
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,460
But...

168
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,970
would Ms. Kim be happy to see you, too?

169
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,930
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

170
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,770
I have no idea if she'd want to see you.

171
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,360
You could've lost touch for a reason, too.

172
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,880
Excuse me.

173
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:42,570
By chance, did you ever do this?

174
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,390
Hide or run away when you have to do something.

175
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,100
You did something wrong,

176
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,460
but because you didn't want to be judged or burdened,

177
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:57,120
you acted cowardly, perhaps.

178
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,970
I have done that to Ms. Kim.

179
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,760
Ram Woo...

180
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,570
I should've told her he died because of me,

181
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,750
but I ran away.

182
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,370
I was so cowardly then.

183
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,680
 I finally got to meet you. 

184
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,510
How long do we have to do this?

185
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,870
I want you to stop coming if you expect an apology.

186
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,310
I told you.

187
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,630
I didn't know he was married.

188
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,350
Your husband hid that fact.

189
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:38,370
I don't think I need to apologize for it.

190
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,330
But I took money, ran away, and hid.

191
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,070
That was cowardly.

192
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,800
I think I had no choice, but it's still cowardly.

193
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,020
So, I apologize.

194
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,070
You left an impression.

195
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,760
You willingly ran away after accepting money.

196
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,120
Not once, but seven times.

197
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,820
But he's CEO Park's son.

198
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,350
The father should pay child support.

199
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,820
Why would you return that?

200
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,620
- Maybe you should get more. 
 - Pardon?

201
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,070
Don't bother moving around anymore.

202
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,960
It's not like I won't be able to find you.

203
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,040
My husband doesn't want the rumor to spread

204
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,120
and have headaches over inheritance.

205
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:25,340
He'll pay you happily as long as he has that.

206
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,650
Take advantage of that.

207
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,980
His face will change the moment you sign.

208
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,950
Don't sign stuff like this.

209
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:37,150
- But why did you— 
 - Why follow you and sent you this?

210
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,470
Yes.

211
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,980
I needed a key, too.

212
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,790
As you must know,

213
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:47,180
I didn't marry him, but his family.

214
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,330
And you two are his huge weaknesses.

215
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,650
I'm sorry. I'm just like this.

216
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:58,840
That's why I found you so fascinating.

217
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:02,390
You could've used him more.

218
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,840
I wondered why you won't seize the opportunity.

219
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,910
I have a child, too.

220
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,250
He's starting school now.

221
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,710
He's getting old enough to know things.

222
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,950
The atmosphere at home, how the family looks,

223
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,330
and the conversations over dinner.

224
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,140
I was curious what

225
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:30,750
choosing a different path would've been like.

226
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,430
That's why I came.

227
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,130
I think I got my answer.

228
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,220
What was your question?

229
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,550
 Let me know if you need anything else. 

230
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,760
- Well done. 
 - Thanks.

231
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,250
What's this?

232
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:50,340
It was delivered earlier.

233
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,000
 CEO Park and I divorced. 

234
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,140
 Both of us have something to celebrate. 

235
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,520
 Congratulations on opening a studio. 

236
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:12,610
Don't go if you're going to do this.

237
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,020
How many times did I tell you?

238
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,320
I'll take it off the bucket list.

239
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,570
I don't feel comfortable either, you know.

240
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,590
I wanted you and Mom to go back to normal.

241
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,790
I wanted her to feel how she felt

242
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,910
when I was around even briefly.

243
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:30,550
That's why I wanted to go with you.

244
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,710
I really didn't want this.

245
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,760
Before she left,

246
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,390
she came to my dad's shop.

247
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,930
She told him that...

248
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,180
everything was her fault.

249
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,840
What will you do where you don't know anyone?

250
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:57,570
How about you rethink this carefully?

251
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:01,450
Ram Woo wanted to see the stars, so I let him.

252
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,080
I thought of it as a relief.

253
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,430
Because I'd finally have time to myself.

254
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,900
I thought that.

255
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,750
I need to say goodbye to Hee Wan, at least.

256
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,660
She'll be back soon.

257
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:25,170
So? What if she hates you after hearing you out?

258
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,970
Will she suffer less?

259
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,530
- Kim Ram Woo. 
 - You think she'd feel better

260
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:31,780
because she can blame you?

261
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:35,270
That's what you think. You're being selfish.

262
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,820
Why try to make both of you suffer?

263
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,770
You know that's not my intention.

264
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:44,250
It's what I've been meaning to do.

265
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,940
Hey.

266
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,330
Can't you forget the past and move on?

267
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,740
It's not the past for me.

268
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,400
Only you think that.

269
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,750
Everyone else moves on.

270
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,200
No matter how painful their past was,

271
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,860
they manage to live as time passes.

272
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,670
She must be living her life, too.

273
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,240
So, you should live your life—

274
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,700
My life ends in two days.

275
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,570
That's why I need to do this.

276
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,900
She's important to me, too.

277
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,970
Why don't you understand that?

278
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,730
It's the only thing I want to do.

279
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:24,060
This would make me feel better.

280
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,540
Whatever.

281
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Don't come, then.

282
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,460
Hey!

283
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:46,270
It's neither your nor her fault.

284
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:49,580
Why don't you see that?

285
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,020
How much longer will you be like this?

286
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,830
How long will you do this?

287
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,840
Why...

288
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,090
Why can't you move forward?

289
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:04,500
I...

290
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:09,300
I, the Grim Reaper, am here to take you. Why?

291
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,700
Why are you ready to leave as if you've been waiting?

292
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,380
Why?

293
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,810
From the moment you met me and until now...

294
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:22,160
Why?

295
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,920
Why don't you ask me to spare you once?

296
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,410
 A week, did you say? 

297
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,890
 Yes. 

298
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,110
 Let's say I'll actually die. 

299
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:39,320
 Why are you the one who's telling me that? 

300
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,290
 it's like the "Phone-a-Friend" lifeline. 

301
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,920
 Leave, then. I don't need you. 

302
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,290
 Come back when I die. 

303
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:28,670
 You ended up coming. 

304
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:31,570
I don't know why you decided,

305
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:33,780
but think carefully.

306
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,780
Out of sight, out of mind, they say.

307
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,670
The foolish people out there

308
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,780
don't know how precious life is.

309
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,670
They just waste it away.

310
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,400
You know that, right?

311
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,880
Each day they waste away is so precious.

312
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,690
Is there anything you can do about it?

313
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,210
There isn't.

314
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:01,140
It's not a privilege. It's a punishment.

315
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,100
You've done this for a long time, right?

316
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,470
Yes.

317
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,480
How is it?

318
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,860
Which part do you find most difficult?

319
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:18,470
 Father! Father! 

320
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,160
Dad!

321
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,100
Died at 7:30 p.m. on April 10, 2025.

322
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,820
Kim Doo Ho... Kim—

323
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:30,450
I managed to survive last night.

324
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:32,020
I...

325
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,310
How many times did I tell you?

326
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,020
- I won't leave! I won't leave! 
 - Help!

327
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,440
Mr. Go!

328
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,550
What did you eat that made you run so fast?

329
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,230
- My grandson. 
 - I'm not your grandson.

330
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,810
- My puppy. My puppy. 
 - Hold on.

331
00:18:44,810 --> 00:18:46,200
My sweet baby.

332
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,260
July, 2017...

333
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,570
My sweet baby!

334
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,030
Hold on, ma'am.

335
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,570
Let's see.

336
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:58,160
What can I give you? What can I...

337
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,170
Let's go get snacks.

338
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:11,180
Let's go. Let's go get snacks.

339
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,910
- I'll get you some. 
 - Hold on, ma'am.

340
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,940
Let's hurry. Let's hurry.

341
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,080
She lives around here.

342
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,950
   

343
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:26,760
♫  And all your troubles away  ♫

344
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,580
♫  Every night, I lay my head on pillow, as cold as stone  ♫

345
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,400
Yes!

346
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,350
Im Jeong Taek. Im Jeong Taek. Im Jeong Taek.

347
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:59,660
This is so serious...

348
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,670
Hey, guys!

349
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,030
An innocent-faced schemer and an irritable, cunning woman.

350
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:08,840
And a love triangle with the cat-eyed sweet man.

351
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,550
Your taste hasn't changed.

352
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,700
It's still nice to see.

353
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,780
I wish Jeong Hee Wan was like that, too.

354
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,560
   

355
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,720
Let's drink and die!

356
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Pour! Drink!

357
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,250
I'll drink it and die!

358
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,060
Drink and die!

359
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,310
Stop talking about dying!

360
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,350
   

361
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,080
Hello.

362
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,390
Hey, have you heard from Hee Wan?

363
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,000
No. It's your third time asking.

364
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,040
Why is she so hard to reach?

365
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,630
Sunbae, why do you care about her so much?

366
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:52,630
I don't know.

367
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,720
She makes me a bit uncomfortable.

368
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:58,180
She always looks sad, too.

369
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,130
She must have a reason.

370
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,640
   

371
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,080
   

372
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,330
   

373
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,350
   

374
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,990
   

375
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,960
   

376
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,160
Wow, I'm so excited!

377
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,250
Let's go without them.

378
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,310
 Let's go, guys. 

379
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,290
 - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. 
 - Here we go. 

380
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:34,630
Let's go.

381
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,830
Gosh, what the heck!

382
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,250
You could call this a trip, too.

383
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,320
Shall we?

384
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:02,390
   

385
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,090
Have a good time with her.

386
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,150
How about you?

387
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,980
What if you start fighting, yanking on your hair?

388
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,000
I won't know whose side to choose.

389
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,480
I'll just stay here.

390
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,560
But still.

391
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,470
I might bother you if I were there.

392
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,040
I'll just get some fresh air here.

393
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,970
It reminds me of my first job.

394
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:39,080
It takes me back.

395
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,380
I can see her some other time.

396
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,530
I'm okay.

397
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,400
I'll be right back.

398
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:59,230
   

399
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:07,480
   

400
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,890
Gong, as in "embrace." Woo, as in "hill"?

401
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,470
 The painting moves depending on the light. 

402
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:22,590
 It looks like it's swimming. Isn't it beautiful? 

403
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:25,800
This is our new work at the gallery.

404
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,900
It uses the coiling technique in pottery.

405
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:32,490
It means piling rolled-up clay layer by layer.

406
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:36,400
But here, it uses yarn to make it voluminous.

407
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,360
This artist was visually impaired since birth.

408
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,570
They used hands instead of eyes to paint this.

409
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,150
But it doesn't mean you can touch the work.

410
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,860
You must've waited a long time.

411
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,770
You must've been surprised to see me.

412
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,660
I couldn't believe my eyes.

413
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:30,050
This isn't a coincidence, right?

414
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,480
Well...

415
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,620
It's a small gallery and a studio.

416
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,250
My lodging is in the back, too.

417
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,910
Have you been living here?

418
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,490
Yes.

419
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:48,400
I got a job through a connection.

420
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,560
I'm a curator, docent, and building manager.

421
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,980
It's a small gallery, but there's a lot to do.

422
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,760
Maybe I got a bad deal.

423
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,300
You look happy.

424
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:03,670
You suit this place.

425
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,800
Who littered again?

426
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:13,850
Have you been doing well?

427
00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:16,010
When did you grow up so much?

428
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:18,390
You're an adult now.

429
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:24,280
I basically ran away then.

430
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:28,130
I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye.

431
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,880
I wasn't in the right mind.

432
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,630
You shouldn't apologize to me.

433
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,890
What?

434
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,330
To be honest...

435
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:46,040
Well...

436
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,880
Hold on, Hee Wan.

437
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,140
Who's smoking over there?

438
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,390
I told you not to smoke here, didn't I?

439
00:26:52,390 --> 00:26:54,280
Okay, I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

440
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:57,360
Why is this lady's voice so loud?

441
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,580
These men are no good.

442
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:02,380
I'll report you this time.

443
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,110
You've been trespassing for three days.

444
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,760
Gosh, seriously. Geez.

445
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,930
Shall we go?

446
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,550
Right, I need to give you something.

447
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:22,150
Ms. Kim.

448
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,080
It was all my fault.

449
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,780
Well...

450
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,920
What happened to Ram Woo...

451
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,030
Only he couldn't come back that day. That was my fault.

452
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:52,770
I-I actually won that under my name.

453
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:55,220
I should've been there instead.

454
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:58,070
But I sent Ram Woo there.

455
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:00,510
He wouldn't have been there if it wasn't for me.

456
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:03,590
It was all my fault.

457
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:07,590
You were struggling so much, but I...

458
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,410
I couldn't tell you and ran away.

459
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,600
You could've been hurting forever,

460
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,240
but I played ignorant and...

461
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,220
I see.

462
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,630
Thank you for telling me, Hee Wan.

463
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:35,460
To be honest, I was assuming that.

464
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:42,770
But I didn't know you'd still be thinking about it.

465
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:47,380
You must've been hurting so much.

466
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,590
It must've been so hard for you.

467
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,990
But how could that be your fault?

468
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,080
Don't think that anymore.

469
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,270
I'm sorry.

470
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,190
I'm sorry.

471
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:42,250
I haven't had a cake in ages.

472
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,840
I actually saved a cake

473
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,680
for Ram Woo from the opening party.

474
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,960
I couldn't even look at cakes since then.

475
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,280
But someone got it for me and I forced myself to eat it.

476
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,790
And it was so delicious.

477
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,750
I couldn't believe how I'd been living without it.

478
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,890
I felt so robbed.

479
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:09,330
I don't even remember how I've lived up until then.

480
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,320
I've been angry and refused to let anyone in.

481
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,580
I just hated everyone.

482
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:19,190
I hated myself more than anyone.

483
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,740
But I realized

484
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,530
I was more focused on hating myself than thinking about Ram Woo.

485
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:30,650
While living here and making art again,

486
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,640
I finally realized.

487
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,610
What I need to do is long for him,

488
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:39,340
not to blame someone.

489
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:45,360
Anyway, I no longer blame myself or anyone else.

490
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,830
So, Hee Wan, you too, should do that.

491
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,960
I just miss him now.

492
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,030
He worried about me too much.

493
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:03,810
I'm actually so strong like this.

494
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:06,530
I hope he realizes that.

495
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,040
Just one moment, Ms. Kim.

496
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,540
Wait here a moment.

497
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,460
Where are you going?

498
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,290
Kim Ram Woo.

499
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,680
What? Hey.

500
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,990
Hey, come.

501
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,880
- What? 
 - Hurry, hurry.

502
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,700
Hey.

503
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,490
Hurry, hurry.

504
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,510
What?

505
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,500
Hey, hold on. What?

506
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,030
I definitely put it here.

507
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:36,160
♫  I had no love at that time  ♫

508
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:41,840
♫  The pieces of memories come back  ♫

509
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,880
Here it is.

510
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:53,140
♫  When such a night comes again  ♫

511
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,830
♫  The feelings I cannot get rid of inside me  ♫

512
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:11,350
♫  When the wind that was returning blows  ♫

513
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:19,170
♫  I close my eyes missing you  ♫

514
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:25,040
♫  My stars have gone away  ♫

515
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:30,700
♫  Oh, my love is far away  ♫

516
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:39,170
♫  Even if it disappears far away  ♫

517
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:42,940
♫  I couldn't leave behind  ♫

518
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,480
How warm.

519
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:53,110
♫  I'll let you go now  ♫

520
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,170
♫  Into eternity  ♫

521
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,360
Hi, Mom.

522
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:15,970
Hi.

523
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:21,900
♫  My stars have gone away  ♫

524
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,560
♫  Oh, my love is far away  ♫

525
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:35,790
♫  We were so bright and happy  ♫

526
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:45,020
♫  In our only time together  ♫

527
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:50,310
♫  I'll let you go now  ♫

528
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:55,780
♫  Into eternity  ♫

529
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,370
Why do people want to die

530
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:00,040
when everything's coming to life and it's not even winter?

531
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,220
Because everything is sparkly and beautiful?

532
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:07,150
Shouldn't that make you want to live more?

533
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:11,290
Everything looks rosy except for myself.

534
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,780
That makes it more painful.

535
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,150
What are you talking about?

536
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,820
We were saying there's too much work lately.

537
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:18,230
Isn't that...

538
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,680
because Mr. Park quit?

539
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,950
Since we need help?

540
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,800
I suppose.

541
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,150
But he didn't quit.

542
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,100
He flew away.

543
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,650
He flew away?

544
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,600
His daughter was sick, apparently.

545
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,300
I think he escaped to see her.

546
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,160
- What, then? 
 - He's gone.

547
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,290
What about his daughter, then?

548
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,400
She must've survived.

549
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,530
Although she might not last long.

550
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:47,300
Mr. Park went against the rules, and now...

551
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,250
He'd never see anyone again.

552
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:53,450
His daughter or anyone else.

553
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:57,410
If you go against the rules,

554
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:00,190
you disappear completely.

555
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:02,620
   

556
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,160
   

557
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,550
   

558
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,590
Hee Wan, what are you doing here?

559
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,400
Put this on.

560
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,540
The temperature drops at night here.

561
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,920
This is Ram Woo's coat.

562
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,610
He loved that coat so much.

563
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,000
But why...

564
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,570
He'd be happy if you wore it for him.

565
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,610
It's a little big, but...

566
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,320
Here.

567
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,370
Gosh, it suits you well.

568
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,580
You feel better now, right?

569
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,840
Thank you.

570
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,100
Ms. Kim.

571
00:36:57,290 --> 00:36:59,330
You have to take care of yourself, okay?

572
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,030
Even if...

573
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,330
I don't get to visit you.

574
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,920
You won't come back?

575
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:13,210
The path on the hill looks beautiful at night.

576
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,180
But it's too dark now.

577
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,550
The lights broke a long time ago.

578
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:26,710
They wouldn't turn on earlier.

579
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:28,470
It suddenly got so bright.

580
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:30,290
It's amazing!

581
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,030
How pretty.

582
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,640
And bright.

583
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,520
I know.

584
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,680
 What's this? 

585
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,420
 It's my bucket list. 

586
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:06,840
   

587
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,620
 It'll be over once we finish this. 

588
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,310
 I'll get out of your sight immediately, then. 

589
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:14,830
 Okay? 

590
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,330
Ms. Kim.

591
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,000
I'm sorry, but I need to leave.

592
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,720
Hee Wan.

593
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,860
Kim Ram Woo!

594
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,700
Kim Ram Woo!

595
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,380
Where are you, Kim Ram Woo?

596
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,390
Kim Ram Woo...

597
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,040
 Just 10 of them. Just 10. 

598
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,850
 You can do that for me. 

599
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:53,370
 Will you leave afterward, then? 

600
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:55,060
- Kim Ram Woo! 
  - Promise me. 

601
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,910
 - That you'll leave me after this.  
 - Kim Ram Woo!

602
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:59,330
 - That you'd never come back.  
 - Kim Ram Woo!

603
00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:00,630
 Tell me what you want to do. 

604
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,370
 I'll do everything with you. 

605
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,300
 - I have one. Not seeing your face after your list ends. 
 - No... 

606
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,400
 Gosh, don't worry. Don't worry. 

607
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,340
 I can only be with you for a few days. 

608
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,760
 I'll leave even if you ask me not to. 

609
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,230
 And I won't come back even if you want me to. 

610
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,530
 I hate this. 

611
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,060
Kim Ram Woo!

612
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:22,660
Please. Stay with me a little longer. Please.

613
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,000
Kim Ram Woo. Kim Ram Woo.

614
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:31,500
Kim Ram Woo!

615
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:35,140
Ram Woo.

616
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,140
Hey.

617
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,860
Did something happen?

618
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:08,020
♫  A day wrapped in dusk and crimson light  ♫

619
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:12,230
♫  When sadness brushes away  ♫

620
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:17,450
♫  Your face returns  ♫

621
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:19,510
♫  If you  ♫

622
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,010
♫  When the dark moon rises  ♫

623
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:28,320
♫  A star begins to shine  ♫

624
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,940
I lived a messy life after you left like that.

625
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:40,760
It felt like only I was stuck in time.

626
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,350
I couldn't move backward or forward.

627
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:46,220
Everyone else was moving forward,

628
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:48,890
but only I was stuck.

629
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:53,240
And no one understood me. That was so hard.

630
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:57,660
I was hoping I could just

631
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,960
die easily and quietly.

632
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:06,660
But after spending a week with you,

633
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:10,370
I feel like time is finally flowing for me again.

634
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:13,470
While I'm with you, for the first time,

635
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:16,940
I don't want the day to end.

636
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:22,940
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

637
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,610
But we only have a day left now, right?

638
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,340
Is that true?

639
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,560
Will all of this end tomorrow?

640
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:43,490
♫  If I could turn back the tangled end of our story  ♫

641
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:46,170
♫  If you  ♫

642
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,220
Are you really here to take me?

643
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:57,220
 Have you visited anyone? 

644
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,820
Your family or friends?

645
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,810
Yes. Just once.

646
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,580
Just once?

647
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:07,030
You haven't seen anyone since then?

648
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,430
I don't do it. It's too much to handle.

649
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,710
I hope they're doing well.

650
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,720
It's better to just hope they're doing well.

651
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,520
What if I visited them

652
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,530
and they were doing terribly?

653
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,610
But there's nothing you can do.

654
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:25,700
Then, you'd wish you didn't find out.

655
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:30,150
If so, what was it like then?

656
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,790
I forgot.

657
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,110
   

658
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,880
