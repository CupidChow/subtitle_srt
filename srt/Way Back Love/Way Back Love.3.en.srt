172

No.

181

00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:10,363
To see it all together.

189
00:11:11,263 --> 00:11:13,733
It'd be nice to see it alone just between us.

190
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:22,702
I mean...

191
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:23,843
Well...

192
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:27,212
- Two. The two of us... - Yes.

193
00:11:27,213 --> 00:11:30,212
- So... - Because we're alone right now.

194
00:11:30,213 --> 00:11:31,842
There are also Hong Seok and Tae Gyeong.

195
00:11:31,843 --> 00:11:34,713
- So in pairs. - In pairs.

196
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:36,682
- That's what I mean. - In pairs.

197
00:11:36,683 --> 00:11:37,683
In pairs.

198
00:11:38,023 --> 00:11:40,792
The new pork cutlet place is really busy.

199
00:11:40,793 --> 00:11:42,522
- It took so long. - Ms. Kim.

200
00:11:42,523 --> 00:11:43,562
I'm not hungry.

201
00:11:43,563 --> 00:11:45,863
I'll see you tomorrow. Enjoy.

202
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,333
But...

203
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,933
didn't she say she was hungry every five minutes?

204
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:10,882
Is he crazy? How can he say...

205
00:12:10,883 --> 00:12:12,653
something like that so easily?

206
00:12:17,893 --> 00:12:19,493
(To Kim Ram Woo)

207
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,233
(Kim Ram Woo)

208
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:26,603
No. This isn't right.

209
00:12:31,873 --> 00:12:34,212
(To tell you what's on my mind...)

210
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:36,413
(Now you have to live with that name...)

211
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:52,692
What are you looking at?

212
00:12:52,693 --> 00:12:54,793
It's amazing to see you attending university.

213
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:57,233
What's so amazing about it?

214
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,863
Only you...

215
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,703
look amazingly bored.

216
00:13:06,343 --> 00:13:08,472
Is this common for the last semester?

217
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:10,642
Because you did everything you wanted?

218
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:12,913
What do I want to do?

219
00:13:13,413 --> 00:13:15,152
You always said it.

220
00:13:15,153 --> 00:13:16,382
When you get into a university, you'll go on a blind date,

221
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:17,582
make a boyfriend,

222
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,752
join a club, and drink all night long.

223
00:13:19,753 --> 00:13:21,122
Go on a club retreat.

224
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,652
And that you'd get a scholarship,

225
00:13:22,653 --> 00:13:24,392
become an exchange student, and graduate early...

226
00:13:24,393 --> 00:13:27,433
You have an annoyingly great memory.

227
00:13:28,463 --> 00:13:29,732
So which club did you join?

228
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,163
- I didn't join any. - No club retreat?

229
00:13:31,563 --> 00:13:33,773
- Dating someone at your school? - Stop asking questions.

230
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:53,053
What else do you want to know?

231
00:13:53,253 --> 00:13:54,493
What else?

232
00:13:56,493 --> 00:13:57,693
My goodness.

233
00:13:58,623 --> 00:14:00,122
How come you're so boring?

234
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:01,892
What happened to you, Ram Woo?

235
00:14:01,893 --> 00:14:03,393
I can't believe this.

236
00:14:03,703 --> 00:14:06,502
Why did you bring me to school saying it's your bucket list?

237
00:14:06,503 --> 00:14:07,733
What do you want?

238
00:14:08,703 --> 00:14:09,932
It's for your sake.

239
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,442
I suppose you have things to arrange.

240
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:12,803
You're not going to come back again.

241
00:14:13,003 --> 00:14:14,373
I have nothing left here.

242
00:14:15,043 --> 00:14:17,242
You went to this school for four years,

243
00:14:17,243 --> 00:14:18,982
and you have no one to say goodbye?

244
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,512
You must have classmates, senior students, younger students,

245
00:14:20,513 --> 00:14:22,513
- professors... - No, no one!

246
00:14:23,923 --> 00:14:26,022
- Gosh. - Oh, my goodness!

247
00:14:26,023 --> 00:14:27,422
- Are you okay? - Oh, my.

248
00:14:27,423 --> 00:14:29,453
- Oh, goodness. - Ram Woo, are you all right?

249
00:14:29,723 --> 00:14:30,893
Are you okay?

250
00:14:31,323 --> 00:14:32,393
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:33,793 --> 00:14:34,863
Oh, my.

252
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,393
Are you all right? Sorry.

253
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:39,303
Excuse me.

254
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,873
We once took a class together.

255
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:44,073
What was your name?

256
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,313
Me?

257
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:48,673
I'm Jung Hee Wan.

258
00:14:49,713 --> 00:14:51,713
- Right, Hee Wan. - Yes.

259
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:53,853
- Hee Wan. - Yes.

260
00:14:54,783 --> 00:14:56,253
- We're in the same major. - Are we?

261
00:14:57,223 --> 00:14:59,753
You know at least one person at your school.

262
00:15:00,023 --> 00:15:01,552
- No, I can do it. - Okay.

263
00:15:01,553 --> 00:15:03,353
- I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.

264
00:15:03,553 --> 00:15:05,293
Are you sure you can do this?

265
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:07,033
Be careful.

266
00:15:07,063 --> 00:15:08,293
Goodness.

267
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:10,733
- Gosh, really. - Oh, my.

268
00:15:11,763 --> 00:15:12,833
I'm totally fine.

269
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,373
I don't think so.

270
00:15:14,473 --> 00:15:16,103
Goodness.

271
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:20,343
They're not here yet?

272
00:15:20,513 --> 00:15:21,713
- Here. - Okay.

273
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:22,913
It's the students' room.

274
00:15:22,914 --> 00:15:24,413
- Shall I leave this here? - Yes.

275
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:26,842
Okay.

276
00:15:26,843 --> 00:15:28,153
This is amazing.

277
00:15:28,453 --> 00:15:29,913
This place is great.

278
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:31,982
Hee Wan, are you leaving now?

279
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,182
Yes, I got to go.

280
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,722
All these things were in your place, right?

281
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:36,152
Wait. I'll give you something to drink.

282
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:38,223
No, how about we go out for a meal?

283
00:15:38,793 --> 00:15:40,222
Two of us?

284
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:41,293
Yes, two of us.

285
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,902
I see. You don't want to have a meal with me.

286
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,862
No, it's not like that. I have to go now.

287
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,773
I understand.

288
00:15:49,773 --> 00:15:51,503
We once took a class together.

289
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,313
Do you at least know her name?

290
00:15:55,113 --> 00:15:56,673
My name is Ko Yeong Hyeon.

291
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,113
I entered school two years earlier than you.

292
00:15:59,213 --> 00:16:00,353
I guess you don't remember.

293
00:16:00,453 --> 00:16:03,282
I'm sorry. I'm all over the place now.

294
00:16:03,283 --> 00:16:05,122
You were in the same class with her,

295
00:16:05,123 --> 00:16:06,653
and you don't recognize a senior student of your major?

296
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,052
How can you be so indifferent?

297
00:16:08,053 --> 00:16:10,992
You don't come to our department activities at all, so no wonder.

298
00:16:10,993 --> 00:16:12,623
I'm not blaming you.

299
00:16:15,193 --> 00:16:18,103
I'm in a rush, so...

300
00:16:18,303 --> 00:16:19,662
If you win this Sticky Sticks,

301
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,532
you can get an Ipad Pro!

302
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:24,343
Other students are coming, so say hello to them. It's been a while.

303
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,973
Well...

304
00:16:27,443 --> 00:16:28,972
I have a class.

305
00:16:28,973 --> 00:16:30,843
- What? A class? - Yes.

306
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:32,643
You said you had no class today.

307
00:16:33,143 --> 00:16:34,213
Come and look at this.

308
00:16:34,453 --> 00:16:35,483
Come here.

309
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:38,152
This is called Sticky Sticks.

310
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:40,422
It's the most fun board game ever.

311
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:41,953
I guess all the classes are cancelled today...

312
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:43,793
because of the festival.

313
00:16:44,763 --> 00:16:45,763
Well,

314
00:16:47,233 --> 00:16:49,162
- that's... - She's a senior student.

315
00:16:49,163 --> 00:16:50,332
That kind of lie won't work here.

316
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,102
Now, you should look at this.

317
00:16:52,103 --> 00:16:54,273
- In the middle of this... - The other students...

318
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,172
prepared that.

319
00:16:56,173 --> 00:16:57,303
Take a look.

320
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,972
We allocated quite a budget for the prizes this time.

321
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:01,373
The second place winner gets a Sony headset.

322
00:17:01,543 --> 00:17:02,613
Come on.

323
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,013
Come on?

324
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,952
- No. - I see.

325
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:10,312
- You want to know about prizes. - That's right.

326
00:17:10,313 --> 00:17:11,722
We have a tablet PC,

327
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:14,393
- a headset, a smart watch... - I need to look a little bit more.

328
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:16,853
This is amazing.

329
00:17:17,193 --> 00:17:18,323
Oh, my!

330
00:17:33,043 --> 00:17:34,773
- Are you okay? - Are you all right?

331
00:17:35,113 --> 00:17:36,213
- Yes. - Did you see what we did?

332
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:38,782
- Ours look great. - No one can beat us.

333
00:17:38,783 --> 00:17:39,982
We did the greatest job.

334
00:17:39,983 --> 00:17:41,183
- It's amazing. - We're the best.

335
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,353
I didn't do this.

336
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,723
Me neither.

337
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:55,933
It might get on your skirt.

338
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,602
Yeong Hyeon, you can clean that one first.

339
00:17:58,603 --> 00:17:59,933
- I'll do it. - It's fine.

340
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,233
Go clean that up.

341
00:18:02,903 --> 00:18:04,502
I'm really sorry.

342
00:18:04,503 --> 00:18:06,272
We purchased drinks with all the money left.

343
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:07,342
What can we do now?

344
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:09,442
We came up with a nice design this year, so we almost hit a jackpot.

345
00:18:09,443 --> 00:18:11,613
You left the paint here? I can't believe this.

346
00:18:11,713 --> 00:18:13,043
I feel so sorry.

347
00:18:14,413 --> 00:18:17,113
I'll come up with a plan, so...

348
00:18:17,223 --> 00:18:19,482
You need to go to the meeting now.

349
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:20,493
The meeting?

350
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:23,823
By the way, why is she here all of a sudden?

351
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,562
She never had an interest in school activities.

352
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,792
You should tell her to help us.

353
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:29,192
Hee Wan has a class today.

354
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,233
I'll finish it.

355
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:33,263
It looks like the paint is getting removed.

356
00:18:44,713 --> 00:18:45,782
Hee Wan.

357
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,313
This is the menu, right?

358
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:49,912
Is this the menu?

359
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,053
Yes, it is.

360
00:18:53,023 --> 00:18:54,193
He says it is.

361
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:00,123
What are you doing?

362
00:19:01,293 --> 00:19:03,062
What is she doing?

363
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:04,663
What?

364
00:19:07,503 --> 00:19:08,573
Gosh.

365
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:11,042
It looks better than before.

366
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:12,343
- It's nice. - Right.

367
00:19:15,773 --> 00:19:17,542
I think you should move it to your right.

368
00:19:17,543 --> 00:19:18,982
To the middle.

369
00:19:18,983 --> 00:19:20,682
- To the middle. - No, to your right.

370
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:21,752
I knew it.

371
00:19:21,753 --> 00:19:24,252
What we did looks better than how it was before.

372
00:19:24,253 --> 00:19:25,483
Yes, right there.

373
00:19:25,683 --> 00:19:27,323
- We? - Just a bit further.

374
00:19:27,493 --> 00:19:30,023
- Yes, okay. - Hee Wan saved everything.

375
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:32,592
It's nicely done.

376
00:19:32,593 --> 00:19:34,863
- Let's give her a hand. - No, it's nothing.

377
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:37,962
Is your graduation project on this kind of work?

378
00:19:37,963 --> 00:19:39,763
You were passionate in the typography class, right?

379
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:42,532
I don't have a specific plan.

380
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:44,343
Then how can you graduate?

381
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,442
Are you going to be a legendary old school, without graduation?

382
00:19:46,443 --> 00:19:48,213
- Like Yeong Hyeon? - Come on.

383
00:19:48,713 --> 00:19:51,583
Well, I...

384
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:53,983
guess I'll have a situation.

385
00:19:58,983 --> 00:20:00,053
Excuse me.

386
00:20:00,753 --> 00:20:01,822
Hi.

387
00:20:01,823 --> 00:20:03,653
- We're History majors. - I see.

388
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:06,492
Can we ask you for a favor?

389
00:20:06,493 --> 00:20:08,063
- What do you mean? - That one.

390
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:09,893
That one over there.

391
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:11,562
(Design Your Palate)

392
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:12,603
Oh, that?

393
00:20:13,263 --> 00:20:15,772
We barely got ours done in time.

394
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,903
Please. Just this once.

395
00:20:18,443 --> 00:20:19,503
Please?

396
00:20:20,843 --> 00:20:21,973
Help us out.

397
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:26,443
She's awesome.

398
00:20:26,613 --> 00:20:28,182
(History Inn, Donghak Udon 5 dollars)

399
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:29,753
(Buttered Squid 12 dollars)

400
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:35,223
Hee Wan.

401
00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:37,763
Philosophy wants a poster done too.

402
00:20:38,493 --> 00:20:39,792
- Eat as you work. - Philosophy?

403
00:20:39,793 --> 00:20:40,833
Yes.

404
00:20:41,393 --> 00:20:43,033
Semiconductor Engineering wants one too.

405
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:45,133
For real?

406
00:20:45,903 --> 00:20:48,273
We might make more selling posters.

407
00:21:11,623 --> 00:21:13,692
Have you been to Mi Yeon's?

408
00:21:13,693 --> 00:21:14,993
It's by the back gate.

409
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:17,863
No. Is it a famous place?

410
00:21:18,033 --> 00:21:19,802
- Are you serious? - Tell her about it.

411
00:21:19,803 --> 00:21:21,503
Their tteokbokki is the best.

412
00:21:21,773 --> 00:21:23,773
- Is it really? - What about Spotted Deer?

413
00:21:24,503 --> 00:21:26,043
Spotted Deer? What's that?

414
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:27,203
No way.

415
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:30,013
They sell gamjatang.

416
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:32,482
You came to campus for nothing.

417
00:21:32,483 --> 00:21:33,483
Gamjatang?

418
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,452
Hey, take notes.

419
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,352
What's the place called?

420
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:38,723
We'll go next time.

421
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:41,722
- Let's drink. - Come on.

422
00:21:41,723 --> 00:21:42,823
All together now.

423
00:21:45,123 --> 00:21:46,123
My gosh.

424
00:21:46,124 --> 00:21:48,192
- Hey. - Let's drink some more.

425
00:21:48,193 --> 00:21:50,593
Aren't you glad I got up to no good?

426
00:21:51,063 --> 00:21:52,203
It's a hit.

427
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:55,172
You should attend these events.

428
00:21:55,173 --> 00:21:56,433
Why are you always so busy?

429
00:21:57,973 --> 00:21:59,503
I wasn't busy.

430
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:03,243
(Daedong Festival)

431
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:10,753
I can't stand having fun on my own.

432
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:21,393
Hee Wan.

433
00:22:22,733 --> 00:22:24,233
Tell me if you ever need help.

434
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,333
- With your graduation exhibition. - What?

435
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:28,333
Don't feel any pressure.

436
00:22:28,803 --> 00:22:31,343
I think I'd like it if someone were to help me.

437
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:33,473
We can help each other.

438
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,343
No way.

439
00:22:41,553 --> 00:22:42,853
Darn it.

440
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:45,523
You're so sneaky.

441
00:22:45,753 --> 00:22:48,253
- This stupid game... - Train some more, kiddo.

442
00:22:48,423 --> 00:22:50,122
I'm good enough.

443
00:22:50,123 --> 00:22:51,422
The game's weird.

444
00:22:51,423 --> 00:22:52,893
- No, it's not. - Let's pose.

445
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,463
We got it.

446
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:00,503
What's he trying to do?

447
00:23:02,903 --> 00:23:04,002
Who's next?

448
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:05,073
Look ahead.

449
00:23:05,773 --> 00:23:07,272
- One more to go. - What will you do?

450
00:23:07,273 --> 00:23:08,273
Climb up.

451
00:23:08,274 --> 00:23:09,313
My gosh.

452
00:23:14,813 --> 00:23:16,052
What the heck were you doing?

453
00:23:16,053 --> 00:23:17,582
- Hey. - Were you yawning?

454
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,953
Darn it!

455
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:20,723
The hamburger...

456
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:23,722
We'll get a table.

457
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:25,122
You two get the snacks.

458
00:23:25,123 --> 00:23:27,292
Okay. Ice cream, yes or no?

459
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:28,293
Yes.

460
00:23:28,294 --> 00:23:30,632
Tae Gyeong wants chocolate and green tea.

461
00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,262
- Hee Wan wants Okdongja, right? - Right.

462
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:34,033
- You're pretty useful. - Thanks a lot.

463
00:23:35,633 --> 00:23:36,633
Gosh.

464
00:23:40,573 --> 00:23:41,613
You're trying so hard.

465
00:23:41,673 --> 00:23:43,343
Do you think I'm almost there?

466
00:23:44,613 --> 00:23:45,843
I don't know about that.

467
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:47,852
You two seemed to get along...

468
00:23:47,853 --> 00:23:49,213
when we took the photos.

469
00:23:49,983 --> 00:23:51,153
You noticed it?

470
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:55,023
Hey, take a look.

471
00:23:55,553 --> 00:23:58,223
I tried to get a photo of me and her.

472
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:01,433
Cooperate, will you? Help a brother out.

473
00:24:02,093 --> 00:24:03,333
Don't we look good?

474
00:24:04,663 --> 00:24:06,762
You have a crush on Hee Wan?

475
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:07,973
Yes. Wait.

476
00:24:08,603 --> 00:24:09,633
Who else?

477
00:24:10,943 --> 00:24:12,103
You're weird.

478
00:24:16,173 --> 00:24:17,883
We need to get some sparklers.

479
00:24:18,083 --> 00:24:20,743
Hee Wan wanted to see fireworks.

480
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:33,623
Hey!

481
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:35,292
- Let's go! - Okay!

482
00:24:35,293 --> 00:24:37,093
(Internet Cafe)

483
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:42,573
(Internet Cafe)

484
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:57,822
(Board games! More fun than video games!)

485
00:24:57,823 --> 00:24:59,382
(The number one board game cafe.)

486
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:00,553
Play with this.

487
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,923
- What? - This one.

488
00:25:04,153 --> 00:25:05,423
No, not that one.

489
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:07,933
This one.

490
00:25:15,603 --> 00:25:17,203
- I'm done. - No, wait.

491
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:19,972
Why are you taking cards for free?

492
00:25:19,973 --> 00:25:22,143
You don't seem to get the rules.

493
00:25:22,243 --> 00:25:24,612
The more tiles you collect, the bigger the discount.

494
00:25:24,613 --> 00:25:27,383
Earlier on, I bought the cards because I could afford to.

495
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,413
Now I'm taking as many as my points allow me to.

496
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:30,883
I don't get it.

497
00:25:31,223 --> 00:25:33,152
What kind of game is so complicated?

498
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:35,253
This game is for kids ten and above.

499
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:39,163
Wait.

500
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:42,193
I'm trying to focus and understand.

501
00:25:44,263 --> 00:25:45,263
(Mom)

502
00:25:45,264 --> 00:25:47,903
- Let's go home. - No, wait.

503
00:25:49,603 --> 00:25:51,443
Let's play just one more round.

504
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:04,853
Come on.

505
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:06,852
Pass more often.

506
00:26:06,853 --> 00:26:07,953
Hey, Kim Ram Woo!

507
00:26:08,923 --> 00:26:10,093
What are you doing later?

508
00:26:12,293 --> 00:26:14,063
- What's up with him? - Let's play it again!

509
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:15,593
I owe you a loss!

510
00:26:15,863 --> 00:26:16,863
Over here.

511
00:26:16,864 --> 00:26:17,963
What just happened?

512
00:26:18,963 --> 00:26:20,203
My island...

513
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,373
No. But I...

514
00:26:28,173 --> 00:26:29,973
I think you're too worked up.

515
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:31,942
We're playing for fun. Try to smile.

516
00:26:31,943 --> 00:26:33,413
I am smiling.

517
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:36,253
But I'm not playing for fun. I'm playing to win.

518
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,522
I'm playing this when I should be...

519
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:40,122
playing with friends.

520
00:26:40,123 --> 00:26:41,793
You keep acting like you have lots of friends.

521
00:26:42,823 --> 00:26:45,163
Aren't I your only friend?

522
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:48,792
(Increased pulse despite being stationary)

523
00:26:48,793 --> 00:26:51,702
I took Coco Island first, so you can't take it from me.

524
00:26:51,703 --> 00:26:53,103
What did you just do?

525
00:26:54,133 --> 00:26:56,232
- I was... - The darn rules...

526
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,273
I was...

527
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:02,272
- Hey, old lady. - What?

528
00:27:02,273 --> 00:27:03,273
What are you doing later?

529
00:27:03,543 --> 00:27:04,912
Do you want to hang out with Ram Woo?

530
00:27:04,913 --> 00:27:05,983
- What? - Come on.

531
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,853
- Hey! - My gosh.

532
00:27:12,823 --> 00:27:13,883
Hey!

533
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:16,093
- Yes! - You startled me!

534
00:27:17,153 --> 00:27:18,493
- No. - Come on.

535
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,333
Here's what you can do.

536
00:27:25,334 --> 00:27:26,463
- Just push it up. - Push it up?

537
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,003
Now that's how you do fireworks.

538
00:27:28,303 --> 00:27:30,103
- No. The other one. - Hey.

539
00:27:31,203 --> 00:27:32,243
Hey.

540
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:38,513
My gosh. Let's go.

541
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:06,602
- Where? - Did you not see that?

542
00:28:06,603 --> 00:28:08,643
It just flew down from there.

543
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:19,583
Why are you home so early?

544
00:28:19,853 --> 00:28:21,453
I thought you were hanging out with your friends.

545
00:28:23,593 --> 00:28:24,623
I did.

546
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,423
Did you eat?

547
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,863
- Yes, I did. - Okay. I see.

548
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,703
Are we going to move again?

549
00:28:42,113 --> 00:28:43,113
What?

550
00:28:43,613 --> 00:28:45,713
Where are we going this time? Somewhere far?

551
00:28:46,313 --> 00:28:48,212
No. We're not moving.

552
00:28:48,213 --> 00:28:49,913
Why would you think that?

553
00:28:51,253 --> 00:28:52,323
You know,

554
00:28:52,883 --> 00:28:54,493
I was hoping we'd stop moving around now.

555
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:56,993
I like my school...

556
00:28:57,423 --> 00:28:59,263
although I'll graduate pretty soon.

557
00:28:59,723 --> 00:29:02,593
We're not going to move again. Don't you worry about that.

558
00:29:03,763 --> 00:29:06,102
I like your new friends too.

559
00:29:06,103 --> 00:29:07,532
Hong Seok and Hee Wan.

560
00:29:07,533 --> 00:29:08,773
(Waiver of Rights)

561
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:12,403
Ta-da. Check this out.

562
00:29:13,043 --> 00:29:15,673
It was on sale, so this is the price I paid.

563
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:21,083
I went out to buy groceries and saw this nice coat for you.

564
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:24,523
And guess what? I ran into Hee Wan's father at the shop.

565
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:25,883
Isn't that something?

566
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:27,623
This looks great on you.

567
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:31,523
- My gosh, look at them. - Oh, my.

568
00:29:31,623 --> 00:29:32,863
Are they matching coats?

569
00:29:33,823 --> 00:29:36,533
- Ram Woo and Hee Wan, sitting... - Look. Aren't they the same coats?

570
00:29:37,533 --> 00:29:39,332
- I'm jealous! - No, it's nothing like that.

571
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:41,033
My father bought this for me.

572
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:44,203
Besides, we're not the only ones who wear coats like this to school.

573
00:29:45,343 --> 00:29:48,273
- Come on. - Come on. Something is up.

574
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:50,173
- Which brand is it? - Don't be shy.

575
00:29:50,873 --> 00:29:51,912
- Hey. - Come on.

576
00:29:51,913 --> 00:29:54,442
Ram Woo! I'm taking your gym clothes.

577
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:56,182
I told you Ram Woo and Hee Wan were dating.

578
00:29:56,183 --> 00:29:57,353
Hey, just make it public.

579
00:29:57,413 --> 00:29:59,622
If you're not dating, you can start today!

580
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:00,982
- Did you see that? - Right on!

581
00:30:00,983 --> 00:30:02,053
- Date each other! - Come on.

582
00:30:02,293 --> 00:30:04,422
- We're not dating. - Date each other!

583
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:06,293
- What's gotten into you all? - Date each other!

584
00:30:06,623 --> 00:30:07,992
- Date each other! - Date each other!

585
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:09,893
- We're not dating. - Date each other!

586
00:30:09,993 --> 00:30:11,903
- We're just friends. - Date each other!

587
00:30:12,433 --> 00:30:13,763
- Date each other! - Date each other!

588
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:15,773
- Date each other! - Date each other!

589
00:30:16,173 --> 00:30:17,603
- Date each other. - Date each other.

590
00:30:17,903 --> 00:30:18,943
Hold her hand.

591
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:22,443
What's he doing?

592
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:26,213
I told you it was a bad idea.

593
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,053
I said no.

594
00:30:29,353 --> 00:30:30,353
Happy now?

595
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:34,953
There's no gym class today.

596
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:44,193
- They didn't make a good couple. - Right.

597
00:30:47,903 --> 00:30:50,533
- Aren't you hungry? - I'm starving.

598
00:31:06,923 --> 00:31:07,923
Have you seen...

599
00:31:08,653 --> 00:31:09,953
Kim Ram Woo?

600
00:31:11,423 --> 00:31:13,123
Your friend took her.

601
00:31:18,263 --> 00:31:19,833
Hey, Hee Wan.

602
00:31:20,563 --> 00:31:23,873
So the comic book I'm reading lately is all about court intrigue.

603
00:31:24,003 --> 00:31:26,572
This sweet and innocent chief knight who turns out...

604
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:27,902
to be a beast is the main character.

605
00:31:27,903 --> 00:31:31,282
He missed his window to make a blood oath to the princess.

606
00:31:31,283 --> 00:31:32,782
So he's about to lose the princess...

607
00:31:32,783 --> 00:31:34,282
to the evil black-haired king for good.

608
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,512
Because of that, the knight was devastated and started...

609
00:31:36,513 --> 00:31:38,653
Wait. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

610
00:31:40,123 --> 00:31:42,123
- I need to get going. - So listen.

611
00:31:44,053 --> 00:31:46,163
If you lose her like this, you're going to be sorry.

612
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:48,893
Because we're shipping you two.

613
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:50,833
Right.

614
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:53,563
Then what must I do?

615
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,433
- What do you mean? Do what? - Well,

616
00:31:57,203 --> 00:31:59,673
I want to know what I can do to win her over.

617
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:03,273
You can just simply talk to her.

618
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:05,443
What?

619
00:32:09,053 --> 00:32:10,653
"I like you, Hee Wan."

620
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,223
Make sure to gaze into her eyes.

621
00:32:15,553 --> 00:32:17,793
After you tell her you like her, you say her name then.

622
00:32:17,993 --> 00:32:19,723
- Put the coat on her too. - Yes.

623
00:32:26,063 --> 00:32:27,132
- Chief Knight. - Chief Knight.

624
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,673
- Yes? - You got this.

625
00:32:37,313 --> 00:32:38,983
Like this? Did I get it right?

626
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:40,913
Could you do that one more time?

627
00:32:41,113 --> 00:32:42,253
I'll keep doing that.

628
00:32:43,513 --> 00:32:45,152
- Like this? - Wait. Do it one more time.

629
00:32:45,153 --> 00:32:46,253
I'm sorry. Do it one more time.

630
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:48,853
Like this?

631
00:32:49,523 --> 00:32:50,953
- I don't know. - What do you want to eat?

632
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:53,263
- I'm not going to eat. - I'm full.

633
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:01,532
My gosh. Well, could you splash it like this?

634
00:33:01,533 --> 00:33:03,902
- Splash it. Do it more gently. - Like this? This way?

635
00:33:03,903 --> 00:33:06,672
- Great. This is it. - Come on.

636
00:33:06,673 --> 00:33:08,343
I can't seem to get this right today.

637
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,113
Let me see.

638
00:33:12,943 --> 00:33:15,152
Are you kidding me? This looks amazing.

639
00:33:15,153 --> 00:33:16,582
How could you make it look better than this?

640
00:33:16,583 --> 00:33:17,982
You'll be a shoo-in.

641
00:33:17,983 --> 00:33:19,383
No.

642
00:33:19,753 --> 00:33:22,593
How am I going to get into college with this?

643
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:24,892
You're so lucky.

644
00:33:24,893 --> 00:33:26,493
You can keep doing what you're good at.

645
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:29,733
What am I good at?

646
00:33:29,863 --> 00:33:30,933
Swimming.

647
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,062
I quit swimming a long time ago.

648
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,873
What? Really?

649
00:33:35,873 --> 00:33:37,132
Why? You were...

650
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,103
pretty famous as the Seal of Yiyeon Middle School.

651
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:43,873
But I guess you didn't hear that my forte is false starts.

652
00:33:47,213 --> 00:33:48,383
You see...

653
00:33:49,553 --> 00:33:51,352
I want to make a new record...

654
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:52,722
but feel impatient.

655
00:33:52,723 --> 00:33:54,553
That leads to false starts.

656
00:33:54,683 --> 00:33:56,292
The more that happens, the worse my records get.

657
00:33:56,293 --> 00:33:58,862
And while preparing for physical education college,

658
00:33:58,863 --> 00:34:00,523
I stopped to clear my head.

659
00:34:01,563 --> 00:34:02,592
I see.

660
00:34:02,593 --> 00:34:03,863
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

661
00:34:05,233 --> 00:34:07,063
Why would you apologize?

662
00:34:08,133 --> 00:34:09,633
Forget it.

663
00:34:11,843 --> 00:34:13,703
Being here after so long, I get it now.

664
00:34:15,073 --> 00:34:17,413
I love the smell of the swimming pool.

665
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:22,053
As I thought, people must follow their hearts and do what they like.

666
00:34:23,713 --> 00:34:24,753
Right?

667
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:27,823
Hey. By the way,

668
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:30,353
Jung Hee Wan isn't coming, is he?

669
00:34:32,593 --> 00:34:34,593
No. I only called for you and not him.

670
00:34:35,693 --> 00:34:36,693
I see.

671
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:40,203
How did you know I find you awkward?

672
00:34:40,433 --> 00:34:42,733
I thought Jung Hee Wan told you.

673
00:34:46,343 --> 00:34:49,873
I might get a tattoo related to swimming.

674
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:51,983
Can't you draw me one?

675
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:53,783
- A tattoo? - Yes.

676
00:34:53,913 --> 00:34:56,852
You must think carefully about it. It'll last forever.

677
00:34:56,853 --> 00:34:59,623
Then draw me one that I'll like forever.

678
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:00,723
Are you not confident?

679
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:02,523
- What's with you? - Come on.

680
00:35:03,053 --> 00:35:04,123
Hurry.

681
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:06,463
- A tattoo? - Yes.

682
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:12,403
What is there that's related to swimming?

683
00:35:13,103 --> 00:35:14,973
- A tube? - A tube.

684
00:35:15,133 --> 00:35:17,703
How about a seal if you were famous as one?

685
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:19,242
What if you're a seal because of your looks...

686
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:20,372
and not your swimming?

687
00:35:20,373 --> 00:35:22,542
- You look like a seal. - A seal.

688
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:24,243
- A seal... You little. - Keep going.

689
00:35:24,313 --> 00:35:26,482
- That's the worst. - Stop. Listen to me.

690
00:35:26,483 --> 00:35:28,312
- I'm sorry. - A seal?

691
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:29,582
Come on. Stop.

692
00:35:29,583 --> 00:35:31,682
I'm sorry, okay? Let's make peace.

693
00:35:31,683 --> 00:35:33,383
- Take this! - Hey!

694
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:36,192
- You started it. - All right.

695
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:38,152
- I'm a seal, okay? A seal. - Got it.

696
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:39,463
- I'm a seal. - Hold on, Mr. Seal.

697
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:40,893
- Stop? - Yes.

698
00:35:40,993 --> 00:35:41,993
- Okay. - Good.

699
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:44,293
Take this!

700
00:35:45,063 --> 00:35:46,633
Are you crazy? Seriously!

701
00:35:46,833 --> 00:35:48,773
(Smoke-free zone within 10m)

702
00:35:58,843 --> 00:35:59,983
Really.

703
00:36:01,143 --> 00:36:02,483
Seriously.

704
00:36:02,813 --> 00:36:03,883
I'm all wet.

705
00:36:06,323 --> 00:36:07,582
By the way,

706
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,423
how did you get in here if you quit swimming?

707
00:36:09,693 --> 00:36:11,522
Can we stay here like it's ours?

708
00:36:11,523 --> 00:36:13,162
This has been my pool since kindergarten.

709
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:15,763
To the security guard, I'm like...

710
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:17,493
his third son.

711
00:36:19,433 --> 00:36:20,433
Wait.

712
00:36:20,663 --> 00:36:22,372
- Hello, sir. - Hello.

713
00:36:22,373 --> 00:36:23,603
It's been a while.

714
00:36:23,773 --> 00:36:25,443
You look younger now.

715
00:36:25,703 --> 00:36:27,103
You little...

716
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,943
When did you steal the key?

717
00:36:29,643 --> 00:36:30,772
- I'm sorry. - I'm sorry.

718
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:32,243
I took it when I quit.

719
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:34,283
I only used it this once.

720
00:36:34,413 --> 00:36:35,612
You punks.

721
00:36:35,613 --> 00:36:37,313
You there. Which school are you from?

722
00:36:38,523 --> 00:36:40,352
- I... - We attend the same school.

723
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:41,383
What?

724
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:42,853
Is she your girlfriend?

725
00:36:44,023 --> 00:36:45,193
No.

726
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:47,593
But I do have a crush on her.

727
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:50,663
Is that why?

728
00:36:50,963 --> 00:36:54,163
You brought her to earn brownie points, right?

729
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,233
(Smoke-free zone within 10m)

730
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:38,043
That's Hong Seok's hoodie.

731
00:37:38,413 --> 00:37:40,913
Yes. He gave it to me to wear.

732
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:46,053
That's mine, right? I'll take it.

733
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:47,783
But...

734
00:37:55,933 --> 00:37:57,193
- You know... - Kim Ram Woo...

735
00:38:05,103 --> 00:38:07,543
You hung out with me because of Hong Seok, right?

736
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:09,413
What?

737
00:38:13,883 --> 00:38:15,913
It's nothing. I'm going home first.

738
00:38:42,243 --> 00:38:43,972
Here. Let's eat.

739
00:38:43,973 --> 00:38:45,242
- Gosh. - Nice.

740
00:38:45,243 --> 00:38:46,512
It looks good.

741
00:38:46,513 --> 00:38:48,913
- Corn cheese? - Look at the corn cheese.

742
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:51,383
Hee Wan. Wear this.

743
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,283
What? I'm fine.

744
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:56,222
I served in the Cheorwon Cheongsong Unit.

745
00:38:56,223 --> 00:38:57,292
I rarely get cold.

746
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,323
- But I'm really okay. - No, wear it.

747
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,733
Well, thank you.

748
00:39:02,963 --> 00:39:03,993
Ram Woo.

749
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:06,303
I like this dependable guy.

750
00:39:09,773 --> 00:39:11,033
He's so cute.

751
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:14,373
What are you doing?

752
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,873
- Sorry? - No, I'm not talking to you.

753
00:39:20,413 --> 00:39:22,983
Hey, Seung Ho. Are you cold? Your lips are blue.

754
00:39:24,083 --> 00:39:25,482
- No. - Take it back.

755
00:39:25,483 --> 00:39:27,782
I'm okay. I really am.

756
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,823
Let me go buy some heat packs.

757
00:39:29,853 --> 00:39:31,722
No, I'm sorry.

758
00:39:31,723 --> 00:39:33,123
But... Hey...

759
00:39:33,323 --> 00:39:35,332
Get us some more snacks on your way back.

760
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,733
Some spicy snacks too.

761
00:39:37,493 --> 00:39:38,632
I'm all embarrassed.

762
00:39:38,633 --> 00:39:40,303
Don't you have a boyfriend, Hee Wan?

763
00:39:41,263 --> 00:39:43,473
The guy who dropped by our school every day.

764
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:46,703
- A boyfriend? - Wasn't he handsome?

765
00:39:46,903 --> 00:39:48,672
- No. - And he's handsome?

766
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:50,173
- No. - Did you two break up?

767
00:39:51,243 --> 00:39:53,643
He isn't my boyfriend. Just a...

768
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,152
How did you know?

769
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:56,283
Back then,

770
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:58,722
I thought the tattoo on his arm was cute...

771
00:39:58,723 --> 00:39:59,983
and asked where he got it done.

772
00:40:00,183 --> 00:40:01,682
He told me Hee Wan drew it.

773
00:40:01,683 --> 00:40:04,253
It was a tattoo of a unique animal.

774
00:40:04,393 --> 00:40:05,793
- What was it? - What was it again?

775
00:40:06,063 --> 00:40:07,563
- A dolphin. - No.

776
00:40:08,193 --> 00:40:09,993
- A stingray? - No.

777
00:40:10,793 --> 00:40:12,763
No.

778
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,402
- A seal. - A seal.

779
00:40:15,403 --> 00:40:17,602
- Is it Hong Seok? - No.

780
00:40:17,603 --> 00:40:19,142
- No? Was it not a seal? - No.

781
00:40:19,143 --> 00:40:20,302
- No. - He looked like a boyfriend.

782
00:40:20,303 --> 00:40:21,673
- No. - Hey.

783
00:40:21,743 --> 00:40:23,072
- Stop asking the same question. - No.

784
00:40:23,073 --> 00:40:24,342
- She said no. - But he looked like one.

785
00:40:24,343 --> 00:40:25,443
- No. - He's not, okay?

786
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:27,243
- You must feel shy. - No, I'm not.

787
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:29,813
- It's slippery. - Take care of it yourself.

788
00:40:34,753 --> 00:40:36,393
- Wait. - Look over here, Hee Wan.

789
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:42,693
Ram Woo. There are sparklers over there.

790
00:40:42,863 --> 00:40:44,062
No, wait.

791
00:40:44,063 --> 00:40:46,603
- Please take it. - Okay.

792
00:40:46,763 --> 00:40:48,533
No, but... Hold on.

793
00:40:49,473 --> 00:40:51,372
- We're the Astronomical Club. - Thank you.

794
00:40:51,373 --> 00:40:52,803
- Thank you. - Please take one.

795
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:54,902
- Thank you. - Hey, about Hong Seok...

796
00:40:54,903 --> 00:40:56,072
It's for free.

797
00:40:56,073 --> 00:40:57,742
- Here. - We're handing them out for free.

798
00:40:57,743 --> 00:40:59,082
- It's for free. - Can I have one?

799
00:40:59,083 --> 00:41:00,742
- Thank you. - Please take more.

800
00:41:00,743 --> 00:41:02,213
- Would you like two? - Yes.

801
00:41:02,513 --> 00:41:04,283
Let's go over there. He's got some.

802
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:06,852
Let's all count down together...

803
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:07,982
and light up the sparklers.

804
00:41:07,983 --> 00:41:09,222
- Okay. - Okay.

805
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:10,293
- Ten, - Nice.

806
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:12,193
- nine, eight, - nine, eight,

807
00:41:12,563 --> 00:41:15,593
- seven, six, five, - seven, six, five,

808
00:41:15,993 --> 00:41:17,633
- four, three, - four, three,

809
00:41:18,163 --> 00:41:19,763
- two, one. - two, one.

810
00:41:22,473 --> 00:41:23,903
How pretty.

811
00:41:24,873 --> 00:41:25,942
Move it around.

812
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:28,073
- Let's take a photo together. - This is nice.

813
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:30,642
Right now. Take it right now.

814
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:31,882
- Nice. - It's tough.

815
00:41:31,883 --> 00:41:33,883
- Right now. - Hold on.

816
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:46,193
Let's go drink some booze.

817
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:47,463
I'm sorry.

818
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:48,992
Hey.

819
00:41:48,993 --> 00:41:51,133
Apparently, Kim Ram Woo died because of Jung Hee Wan.

820
00:41:51,393 --> 00:41:53,233
- Because of the name? - Yes.

821
00:41:53,603 --> 00:41:55,702
Jung Hee Wan wanted to change names first.

822
00:41:55,703 --> 00:41:56,733
I know, right?

823
00:41:59,673 --> 00:42:00,903
What do you guys know?

824
00:42:03,513 --> 00:42:04,873
Do you know how Hee Wan feels?

825
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:07,283
Are you suffering as much as her?

826
00:42:08,513 --> 00:42:11,583
Stop running your mouth when you know nothing!

827
00:42:14,053 --> 00:42:15,153
No, she's right.

828
00:42:20,893 --> 00:42:22,593
Ram Woo died because of me.

829
00:42:32,773 --> 00:42:34,243
I should've died.

830
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,713
What's with you?

831
00:42:40,543 --> 00:42:42,113
What are you doing here?

832
00:42:44,883 --> 00:42:46,183
How is it any of your business?

833
00:42:47,323 --> 00:42:49,793
It's dangerous. Wouldn't you also get worried?

834
00:42:52,263 --> 00:42:53,293
"Worried?"

835
00:42:57,863 --> 00:42:59,663
Will worrying about me change anything?

836
00:43:00,833 --> 00:43:01,903
How was it?

837
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:04,002
Was college life, which you couldn't have...

838
00:43:04,003 --> 00:43:05,503
because of me, fun? Was it?

839
00:43:07,303 --> 00:43:09,112
What's the next one? What is it?

840
00:43:09,113 --> 00:43:10,113
- What... - Let's see.

841
00:43:10,114 --> 00:43:12,282
What is it? What should we do next?

842
00:43:12,283 --> 00:43:14,283
What's the next one? What should we do?

843
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:23,022
What's this out of the blue?

844
00:43:23,023 --> 00:43:24,323
It's not out of the blue.

845
00:43:26,293 --> 00:43:28,733
I've been like this for the past four years.

846
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,503
Why?

847
00:43:35,903 --> 00:43:39,303
I can't forgive myself since that night.

848
00:43:41,373 --> 00:43:43,712
But with you in front of my eyes,

849
00:43:43,713 --> 00:43:46,342
I feel foolish every moment,

850
00:43:46,343 --> 00:43:47,683
expecting you to be alive.

851
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,752
Why are you being nice and smiling like in the past,

852
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,383
as if you didn't die because of me?

853
00:43:53,723 --> 00:43:56,153
What on earth do you want to do with me?

854
00:43:57,993 --> 00:44:00,393
- Ram Woo. - Please don't call me by that name.

855
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,293
Please.

856
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,343
Just call me by my name.

857
00:44:19,183 --> 00:44:21,613
Say my real name, and I die. Right?

858
00:44:22,953 --> 00:44:24,583
Mr. Lim Su Hyeon has passed away.

859
00:44:24,853 --> 00:44:26,983
Lim Su Hyeon.

860
00:44:28,153 --> 00:44:30,993
That's why you keep calling me by your name like in the past.

861
00:44:33,093 --> 00:44:35,292
I can't do this with you.

862
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:36,333
I quit.

863
00:44:38,963 --> 00:44:40,833
Stop pestering me. Just end it.

864
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:45,443
Unless it's your goal to pester me.

865
00:44:48,243 --> 00:44:49,473
Do you really want that?

866
00:44:55,313 --> 00:44:56,313
Yes.

867
00:45:00,353 --> 00:45:01,383
Jung Hee Wan.

868
00:45:22,003 --> 00:45:24,073
I like you, Hee Wan.

869
00:45:31,983 --> 00:45:33,623
I liked you a lot.

870
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,223
And I still do.

871
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:39,663
I'm sorry...

872
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:42,733
for not saying it earlier.

873
00:45:49,433 --> 00:45:51,233
How can I possibly hate you?

874
00:45:56,473 --> 00:45:58,373
I came because I missed you.

875
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:01,843
I missed you so much.
