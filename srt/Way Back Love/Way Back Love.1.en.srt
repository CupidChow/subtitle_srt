00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:55,145
Hi.

12
00:01:55,885 --> 00:01:56,955
Long time no see.

13
00:01:57,355 --> 00:01:58,755
How are you, Kim Ram Woo?

14
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:03,355
It's Jung Hee Wan.

15
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:05,655
You haven't forgotten me, have you?

16
00:02:12,935 --> 00:02:14,365
Hey, don't.

17
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,135
Come on.

18
00:02:23,945 --> 00:02:25,475
Kim Ram Woo!

19
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,515
That hurt so bad.

Let's do another take.

25
00:03:08,685 --> 00:03:10,855
Hello. Sleep tight.

26
00:03:11,055 --> 00:03:12,225
- Hey. - Come on.

27
00:03:12,755 --> 00:03:14,365
Looking good.

28

Strike a pose.

29
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:23,505
Move.

30
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:26,805
What are you doing?

31
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:28,174
Don't.

33
00:03:29,305 --> 00:03:31,645
Are your names where you want them?

34
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:34,415
Let's do a real good job this time.

35
00:03:34,785 --> 00:03:36,315
- Okay. - Sure.

36
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:38,455
Excuse me.

(Kim Ram Woo)

38
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,625
Do we all have to take part?

39
00:03:45,855 --> 00:03:48,465
Or else there's no point and we need an even number.

40
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:59,974
That's so typical of smarty-pants Kim Ram Woo...

41
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:02,945
who just transferred and hasn't settled in yet.

42

- Kim... - I'm in.

52
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,404
The student teacher doesn't know our names yet.

53
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,675
I'm sure they'll fall for it.

54
00:04:32,835 --> 00:04:34,805
It's a new semester and you're not all familiar yet.

55
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,875
You can make friends as you swap names.

56
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:38,644
- Right? - It's an awesome idea.

57
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,445

- No way. - Hang on.

65
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:02,405
- No, not that way. - Seriously?

66
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,775
Where is it going?

67
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,274
- That's it. - Here it comes.

68

- It's about to land. - Look.

70
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:12,614

00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:13,745
with Kim Ram Woo.

Treat my name well for the day.

77
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:30,595
Don't you think this will be fun?

78
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:32,895
No.

79
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:35,865
Oh, well.

80
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:38,775
Put yours on.

81
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:41,405
You care about your health a great deal.

82

Maple Sap.

83
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,315
Why have you aged so much after just one period?

84
00:05:50,585 --> 00:05:53,525
I can't believe it's not lunchtime yet.

85
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,484
Wouldn't it be nice...

86
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,595
to make some friends in your own class?

87
00:05:57,695 --> 00:05:59,394
Do you have to visit one of six other classes...

88
00:05:59,395 --> 00:06:01,165
to find someone to play a board game with?

89
00:06:01,295 --> 00:06:03,535
You have no one but me to play with.

90
00:06:05,635 --> 00:06:07,435
I don't have to play board games.

91
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:09,135
I'm just hanging out with you.

92
00:06:09,605 --> 00:06:11,305
I mastered this game already.

93
00:06:11,575 --> 00:06:12,575
What?

94
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:16,205
No! Not Aloha Island!

95
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:20,315
Darn it. You cruel punk.

96
00:06:20,745 --> 00:06:22,214
- That's nonsense. - It's true.

97
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,854
Make another friend and throw this out.

98
00:06:23,855 --> 00:06:24,984
It stresses me out.

99
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,354
Why bother to make friends...

100
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:27,585
when our CSAT's next year?

101
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:28,885
And your hair...

102
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:32,254
- What? - Can we swap?

103
00:06:32,255 --> 00:06:33,895
We should dance in a circle.

104
00:06:34,065 --> 00:06:36,535
We're swapping names just for a day. It's not a big deal.

105
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:38,434
Who did you swap names with?

106
00:06:38,435 --> 00:06:39,465
A girl?

107
00:06:40,835 --> 00:06:41,865
Yes.

108
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,375
What is she like?

109
00:06:49,305 --> 00:06:50,645
She's...

110
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,585
feisty.

111
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:04,495
Eat up.

112
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:08,565
I need to get the new pastry too.

113
00:07:10,235 --> 00:07:11,964
(The tablecloth master's here)

114
00:07:11,965 --> 00:07:13,704
(Live stream)

115
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:16,575
I'll succeed this time.

116
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:18,474
- Here goes. - Okay.

117
00:07:18,475 --> 00:07:20,004
(Her name's Kim Ram Woo?)

118
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,674
I need to focus.

119
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,844
(She's pretty cute.)

120
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:23,944
- I'm ready. - Okay.

121

122
00:07:25,815 --> 00:07:27,784
(I watched since yesterday and she never succeeded.)

123
00:07:27,785 --> 00:07:29,214
What a loser.

(It's April Fools' Day?)

125
00:07:30,455 --> 00:07:31,455
I did it.

(Thermal directionality increases)

127
00:07:37,855 --> 00:07:39,155
Who's not here?

128
00:07:41,225 --> 00:07:42,425
- Kim Ram Woo. - Kim Ram Woo.

129
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:43,595
Kim Ram Woo.

130
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,565
Oh, the girl with menstrual cramps.

131
00:07:48,405 --> 00:07:49,535
I'm Kim Ram Woo.

132
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:51,475
I'm Kim Ram Woo.

133
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,005
I'm Kim Ram Woo.

134
00:07:54,275 --> 00:07:55,405
She's shameless.

135
00:07:56,615 --> 00:07:57,915
Let's go.

136
00:08:01,885 --> 00:08:03,214
- Do you smoke? - Let's see.

137
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:04,354
That punk.

138
00:08:04,355 --> 00:08:05,355
- Keep still. - Darn it.

139
00:08:05,356 --> 00:08:06,584
- It's okay. - Bear with it.

140
00:08:06,585 --> 00:08:08,385
- Hang in there. - Stay still.

141

143
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:31,075
- Darn it. - What the heck?

144
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,414
Hey, run. Run.

145
00:08:33,415 --> 00:08:34,444
Come on.

146
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:36,145
- Shoot. - Who's that?

147
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:37,515
- Do you know her? - No.

148
00:08:37,815 --> 00:08:40,985
(Kim Ram Woo)

149
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,595
No, buddy.

150
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:47,765
That's not what I asked.

151
00:08:48,965 --> 00:08:49,995
Is she pretty?

152
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:55,805
Objectively speaking, is she cute?

153
00:08:57,335 --> 00:08:58,634
- Not bad. - Not bad.

154
00:08:58,635 --> 00:08:59,945
I got better at it.

155
00:09:00,705 --> 00:09:02,145
- Hey. - What?

156
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,845
- Is this a challenge? - Yes.

157
00:09:04,015 --> 00:09:05,215
You're really cute.

158
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:07,185
- Eleventh grade? - Yes.

159
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,845
- What's your name? - Kim Ram Woo.

160
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,915
If she doesn't speak.

161
00:09:13,355 --> 00:09:14,425
Is she pretty?

162
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:17,955
Let's get back.

163
00:09:19,855 --> 00:09:20,925
Is she pretty?

164
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:24,234
- Over there. - That's her.

165
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:26,134
- The girl over there. - Right there.

166
00:09:26,135 --> 00:09:27,865
- No, keep still. - What for?

167
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:29,005
Kim Ram Woo!

168
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,005
You're pretty!

169
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:33,644
- What are you doing? - Ram Woo!

170
00:09:33,645 --> 00:09:34,774
Date me, Ram Woo!

171
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,644
- You'd look great! - Get together!

172
00:09:36,645 --> 00:09:38,214
- Say yes! - Go for it!

173
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:40,415
- Come on! - Say yes.

174
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,085
They'd look good together.

175
00:09:49,955 --> 00:09:51,725
What?

176
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:55,565
Here.

177
00:09:56,025 --> 00:09:57,765
What is this? What are you doing?

178
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,135
Boop.

179
00:10:00,365 --> 00:10:01,405
Hey.

180
00:10:02,565 --> 00:10:03,805
Hi, Hee Wan.

181
00:10:04,305 --> 00:10:06,004
(Jung Hee Wan)

182
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:08,175
- So... - What, Hee Wan?

183
00:10:10,645 --> 00:10:11,675
Well...

184
00:10:12,745 --> 00:10:14,615
We swapped names.

185
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:17,555
It was to prank our student teacher.

186
00:10:17,715 --> 00:10:18,715
Yes.

187
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:21,025
So...

188
00:10:22,385 --> 00:10:25,694
do you have to keep it up when the student teacher's not...

189
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:26,695
I see.

190
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:29,425
He wants you to come down a notch.

191
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,705
No.

192
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:37,005
I mean, I don't see why you should be so enthusiastic.

193
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:38,235
Me?

194
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,244
I got asked for my name...

195
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:42,105
and I gave yours just a few times.

196
00:10:43,545 --> 00:10:45,775
Hey. Who is Kim Ram Woo?

197
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,285
- Me. - Me.

198
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:49,685
Which of you is Kim Ram Woo?

199
00:10:49,845 --> 00:10:50,955
- Me. - Me.

200
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,085
It's me. What is it?

201
00:10:56,585 --> 00:10:57,724
Some Jungil High kids...

202
00:10:57,725 --> 00:10:59,725
are at the gate and want to talk to you.

203
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,525
Is it another love confession?

204
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:05,895
Come on. On your knees.

205
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:07,705
- Shoot. - Darn it.

206
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,335
You're to come out right now.

207
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,105
They want to kill you.

208
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,605
Oh, no.

209
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:17,075
Are you sure...

210
00:11:17,445 --> 00:11:19,615
they asked for Kim Ram Woo?

211
00:11:23,045 --> 00:11:25,955
(Kim Ram Woo)

212
00:11:28,985 --> 00:11:30,725
What on earth did you do?

213
00:11:31,355 --> 00:11:34,224
They threatened public safety...

214
00:11:34,225 --> 00:11:35,864
and order first,

215
00:11:35,865 --> 00:11:38,634
so I gave the best advice a student could.

216
00:11:38,635 --> 00:11:41,005
She did resort to a foolish tactic.

217
00:11:43,165 --> 00:11:44,805
Let's just tell our teacher.

218
00:11:45,405 --> 00:11:46,435
Wait.

219
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:48,475
Let's think first.

220
00:11:48,575 --> 00:11:50,714
No, I don't think...

221
00:11:50,715 --> 00:11:51,845
- you should get more involved... - Wait.

222
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:55,285
Since I created this mess, I'll take care of it.

223
00:11:55,545 --> 00:11:57,554
But they have us outnumbered, right?

224
00:11:57,555 --> 00:11:59,614
We can't afford to look weak in comparison.

225
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,425
That means we'll have to take action.

226
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,224
Could I ask you guys...

227
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:05,195
to do a small favour and cooperate with me?

228
00:12:05,795 --> 00:12:07,895

Yes. That's me.

233
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:24,515
Good grief. This is ridiculous. I can't even get mad at a girl.

234
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,685
Hey, how are you going to fix this?

235
00:12:27,785 --> 00:12:29,414
It's a super fancy designer jacket.

236
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,714
I bought this new jacket yesterday.

237
00:12:30,715 --> 00:12:31,785
It's super new.

238
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:34,554
What do you think? Put it in a washing machine and clean it.

239
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,925
Must I tell you what to do?

240
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:44,295
Hey, who do you think you are? Some hotshot?

241
00:12:44,595 --> 00:12:46,065
Why are you so arrogant?

242
00:12:46,095 --> 00:12:47,105
Me?

243
00:12:48,365 --> 00:12:49,765
Are you curious about me?

244
00:12:54,545 --> 00:12:56,975
- What is this? You want to do this? - Come on. What?

245
00:12:57,915 --> 00:12:59,174
- Yes, let's have a go at it. - What is this?

246
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,484
- You little... - Hey.

247
00:13:00,485 --> 00:13:01,985
I'll take care of them. Back down.

248
00:13:03,385 --> 00:13:04,385

They're hilarious.

253
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:34,715
Hey, does your mother know that you're all tatted up?

254
00:13:35,085 --> 00:13:36,114
Probably not.

255
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,615
She's dead.

256
00:13:37,815 --> 00:13:39,314

257
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:40,724
- You crossed the line there. - Come on.

00:13:40,725 --> 00:13:42,324
Hey, this feels wrong.

259
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:44,625
What? I'm not allowed to trash talk when we're about to fight?

260
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,494
That's how fights go, you know?

261
00:13:46,495 --> 00:13:48,024
You're supposed to insult the parents.

262
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:50,694
No. I don't think it's cool to insult her parents.

263
00:13:50,695 --> 00:13:52,035
- My dad is gone too. - Right.

264
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,735

265
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:55,205
- Goodness. - Darn it.

266
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,405
Oh, no.

267
00:13:56,805 --> 00:13:58,405

268
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:00,575
Let's just go.

- Hey, what's their deal? - Let's go.

270
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:04,974
I think they're just some crazy kids.

271
00:14:04,975 --> 00:14:07,045
Let's get them to wash the jacket.

272
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:12,885
Hey, this is a cashmere jacket. You must use wool wash detergent.

273
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:16,354
Wait. Do you even know what wool wash detergent is?

274
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,595
Look how they're dressed. You think they'd know what it is?

Yes. I...

277
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:26,094
Hee Wan only uses cucumber soap.

278
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,564
- Cucumber soap? - If you don't mind that soap,

279
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:28,634
we'll wash it for you.

280
00:14:28,635 --> 00:14:31,134
Darn it. Who uses those cheap bars of soap these days?

281
00:14:31,135 --> 00:14:32,735
Hey, let's just go. Okay?

282
00:14:32,935 --> 00:14:35,074
It was a big decision for you to buy this jacket.

283
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:36,504
Darn it. He uses cucumber soap.

284
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:38,244
- Then what should I do? - No, not the cucumber soap.

285
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,245
- I'll wash it for you. - Kids!

286

305
00:16:38,895 --> 00:16:39,895
- Gosh. - You don't want to protect nature?

00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:35,245
- You should go to the hospital. - I'm all right.

369
00:20:09,905 --> 00:20:11,174
Lee Hyo Ri of Punglim-dong?

370
00:20:11,175 --> 00:20:13,414
You're Margot Robbie of Punglim-dong?

371
00:20:13,415 --> 00:20:15,585
You live here? I live just down the street.

372
00:20:16,045 --> 00:20:17,485
This is fascinating, right?

373
00:20:18,115 --> 00:20:19,284
No. Well,

374
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:21,754
don't a lot of students from our school live here?

375
00:20:21,755 --> 00:20:23,054
I mean that...

376
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,754
it's fascinating that Lee Hyo Ri and Margot Robbie live...

377
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:27,665
in the same building of the same neighbourhood.

378
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:29,265
Hey, check the stuff.

379
00:20:31,035 --> 00:20:32,865
Now? Here?

380
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:34,265
Of course.

381
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:35,764
There's no refund later.

382
00:20:35,765 --> 00:20:36,835
Really?

383
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,004
You're a bold guy.

384
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,574
Well, it said in the post that...

385
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,345
you were too shy to wear it, and that's why you were selling it.

386
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:46,474
If you want me to check the never-worn Japanese lace bra...

387
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:48,115
in front of you, I should do it.

388
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,915
- Gosh, hey. Wait. What's this? - My gosh.

389
00:20:56,985 --> 00:20:58,824
Hey, it was my mother's account.

390
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,294
She said she had to sell something.

391
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:01,624
But she fell asleep. That's why I'm here.

392
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,725
I really didn't know what it was.

393
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:04,334
But you should check it.

394
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:05,335
What if there's a defect like you said?

395
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:06,964
No. Check it when you get home.

396
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,105
Don't take it out here.

397
00:21:08,605 --> 00:21:09,964
If there's something wrong with it, I'll give you a refund.

398
00:21:09,965 --> 00:21:12,005
No. I'm sure my mother will give you a refund.

399

(Cocoball)

400
00:21:15,475 --> 00:21:16,604
My gosh.

401
00:21:16,605 --> 00:21:18,815
Are you all right? Do you need a hand with that?

402
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,885
Hey.

403
00:21:21,145 --> 00:21:23,584
I really came out here on an errand from my mom.

404
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:24,685
I'm not a pervert.

405
00:21:25,255 --> 00:21:27,454
Gosh, this doesn't make you a pervert.

406
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:29,424
It's okay. I respect your preferences.

407
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:31,324
So is this your taste?

408
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:32,325
My gosh.

409
00:21:32,326 --> 00:21:34,394
Please put that away.

410
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:35,395
I'm really fine.

411
00:21:35,396 --> 00:21:37,325
No. I'm not fine with that.

412
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,135
Don't forget. It was an errand from my mother.

413
00:21:40,635 --> 00:21:42,865
Don't start any weird rumours at school. Okay?

414
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,305
Don't do it.

415
00:21:44,975 --> 00:21:46,205
Hey, you're not going to take the money?

416
00:21:46,335 --> 00:21:47,775
I don't need it. You just keep it!

417
00:21:54,185 --> 00:21:55,245
Mom!

418
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:03,825
I told you...

419
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:07,095
My gosh. Come on.

420
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:12,465
Mom, sleep in your room.

421
00:22:12,965 --> 00:22:14,705
And wash up before you go to sleep.

422
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:20,705
What are you doing?

423
00:22:21,445 --> 00:22:24,344
What are you doing? I'm back.

424
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:26,315
- I'm back. - Hey.

425
00:22:26,475 --> 00:22:28,145
- Move over. - Come on.

426
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:30,084
What? Did you get it for free?

427
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:31,085
No.

428
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,654
Then why do you look so happy after the transaction?

429
00:22:33,655 --> 00:22:35,454
You don't have to know.

433
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:41,425

It's not for you.

440
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,205
Hey, you don't have to know.

441
00:23:24,435 --> 00:23:26,004
- I bet you're curious. - I can see what's inside.

442
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,275
- As if. You can't see anything. - I can.

Happy birthday to dear Tae Gyeong Happy birthday to you

448
00:24:14,755 --> 00:24:16,084
Wait. Make a wish first.

449
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:17,385
I...

450
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:20,554
- Yes. - Happy birthday.

451

- Guess what? - So...

Drum rolls.

457

No.

459

My goodness.

461
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:46,455
It's cute.

462
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:48,925
I love it.

463
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:50,855
It looks good on you.

464
00:24:53,455 --> 00:24:56,495
What is this? It's gross.

465
00:24:58,265 --> 00:24:59,265
Yes.

466
00:25:00,865 --> 00:25:02,235
Are you okay?

467
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:06,405
Buddy, I'm glad you're glamorous.

468
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:08,105
You saved my face.

469
00:25:08,205 --> 00:25:10,104
What are you talking about? Where did you get this?

470
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:11,745
What are you doing?

471
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,415
Big enough?

472
00:25:14,545 --> 00:25:17,085
- You're so happy. - I didn't know Tae Gyeong...

473
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,055
- had such a taste. - Here.

474
00:25:20,255 --> 00:25:21,525
What's the cake for?

475
00:25:21,685 --> 00:25:23,385
Maybe it's her birthday.

476
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:24,495
I see.

477
00:25:24,995 --> 00:25:25,995
Hey.

478
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:29,265
If you knew, you should've told me.

479
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:33,394
Why do you need to know Tae Gyeong's birthday?

480
00:25:33,395 --> 00:25:36,005
It could've been my chance to get to know her.

481
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:38,805
You need to come up with an excuse.

482
00:25:39,535 --> 00:25:40,834
Tell her that you have this friend Hong Seok,

483
00:25:40,835 --> 00:25:42,904
and he's the only person who hangs out with you.

484
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:45,444
He's a rare guy who's kind, reliable,

485
00:25:45,445 --> 00:25:47,075
and trustworthy.

486
00:25:47,645 --> 00:25:48,884
And that we should go to a coin karaoke together one day.

487
00:25:48,885 --> 00:25:50,085
What do you say?

488
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:54,555
You can also use it as a hair band.

489
00:25:57,185 --> 00:25:59,225
- It looks good on you. - Buddy.

490
00:26:00,095 --> 00:26:02,165
You know what they say about birds of a feather flock together?

491
00:26:02,325 --> 00:26:03,395
What?

492
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,694
I don't know much about Tae Gyeong,

493
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,805
but friends are alike.

494
00:26:07,865 --> 00:26:10,705
I think you need to think carefully.

495
00:26:12,435 --> 00:26:14,975
Is that why neither of us has a girlfriend?

496
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:21,785
Hey, the teacher's coming.

497
00:26:23,345 --> 00:26:24,455
Bye.

498
00:26:25,715 --> 00:26:26,715
Gosh.

499
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:28,954
I'm sure there are people in this class...

500
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,955
who DM or chat with strangers online.

501
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:34,054
Rumour has it that people trade...

502
00:26:34,055 --> 00:26:35,594
alcohol, cigarettes, and even drugs through social media.

503
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,365
- That's really dangerous. - Teacher.

504
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:40,835
I met a perv while making a second-hand deal.

505
00:26:40,935 --> 00:26:43,205
Did you? Me too.

506
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,904
- A few days ago... - She's right.

507
00:26:44,905 --> 00:26:46,005
No!

508
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:51,074
No. Ram Woo's right.

509
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:54,014
Don't give your information online.

510
00:26:54,015 --> 00:26:55,214
If you meet someone from online in person,

511
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:56,414
make sure to go with an adult.

512
00:26:56,415 --> 00:26:57,484
- Yes. - Yes.

513
00:26:57,485 --> 00:26:58,915
That's all for the day.

514
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:11,465
Look. Did I do something wrong?

515
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:13,835
I don't think so.

516
00:27:14,435 --> 00:27:15,735
What? Did you?

517
00:27:15,905 --> 00:27:17,205
No, I didn't.

518
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:20,635
But...

519
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:23,175
it feels like I'm getting threatened...

520
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:26,715
for what happened yesterday.

521
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:30,085
What are you talking about? That's not true.

522
00:27:30,445 --> 00:27:33,085
Hey. What do you take me for?

523
00:27:33,255 --> 00:27:34,985
Someone who's more than capable of doing that?

524
00:27:38,625 --> 00:27:41,995
Hey. Never mind.

525
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:43,265
Hey.

526
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:49,005
You know what? Every time you misunderstand me,

527
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,375
I feel skeptical.

528
00:27:55,705 --> 00:27:58,344
All right. Sorry for misunderstanding you.

529
00:27:58,345 --> 00:28:01,645
Can you not tell anyone about what happened yesterday?

530
00:28:02,315 --> 00:28:04,345
I'm begging you. Please?

531
00:28:07,355 --> 00:28:08,925
Can you do me a favour too?

532
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:18,335
What's that?

533
00:28:18,765 --> 00:28:20,534
Let's keep switching our names...

534
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:21,735
like we did on April Fools' Day.

535
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,805
You'll be Jung Hee Wan, and I'll be Kim Ram Woo.

536
00:28:24,435 --> 00:28:26,074
- What? - On April Fools' Day,

537
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:28,145
someone asked me out for the first time in my life.

538
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:29,604
What does that have to do...

539
00:28:29,605 --> 00:28:32,515
And we had a pop quiz in English. Do you know what I got?

540
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:34,784
Seventy.

541
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:36,845
I basically got everything I guessed correct.

542
00:28:37,585 --> 00:28:39,414
- Thank you. - I had tteokbokki with Tae Gyeong,

543
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:40,484
- and we got a free egg. - It's on the house.

544
00:28:40,485 --> 00:28:41,555
In fact, it was a double yolk.

545
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:43,785
Isn't that shocking?

546
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,594
What about it?

547
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:48,425
So I thought about it.

548
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:51,295
How did I hit the jackpot that day?

549
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:54,765
I think it was because we switched our names.

550
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,465
Your luck came to me.

551
00:28:57,265 --> 00:29:00,074
You know how important your name is for your fate?

552
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:02,744
You know that makes no sense?

553
00:29:02,745 --> 00:29:03,775
No.

554
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:06,644
Didn't you experience any changes after we switched our names?

555
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:07,715
Think carefully.

556
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:10,444
Kim Ram Woo, date me.

557
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:12,085
Kim Ram Woo, date me.

558
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:13,314
Who's Kim Ram Woo?

559
00:29:13,315 --> 00:29:15,324
You better come out, or you'll be dead.

560
00:29:15,325 --> 00:29:17,124
- You won't regret it. - No thanks.

561
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:18,155
No...

562
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:24,695
- A lot changed. - See?

563
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:26,795
One more shocking story.

564
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,364
My father went to read my fortune,

565
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:30,404
and the fortune-teller said because wood was missing in my life,

566
00:29:30,405 --> 00:29:33,135
I'd never get to date anyone or hit it big.

567
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:36,375
Then your name got me lucky that day.

568
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:38,175
It's a perfect name for me.

569
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:41,985
But you know there's no wood in my name.

570
00:29:42,445 --> 00:29:44,715
My name is Ram Woo.

571
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:48,455
Right. Is your name based on Chinese characters or Korean?

572
00:29:49,685 --> 00:29:50,985
Ram as in have, and Woo as in a hill.

573
00:29:52,525 --> 00:29:53,755
No way.

574
00:29:54,295 --> 00:29:56,224
- What? - What could be on a hill?

575
00:29:56,225 --> 00:29:58,595
A pine tree on Mount Nam. It's a tree on a hill.

576
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:01,065
I'm getting goosebumps.

577
00:30:02,165 --> 00:30:03,165
Want to see?

578
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:05,005
Hey.

579
00:30:05,275 --> 00:30:07,945
If you're getting goosebumps, you're just cold.

580
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:11,314
Besides, even if we swap our names,

581
00:30:11,315 --> 00:30:12,545
that's not how it works.

582
00:30:14,715 --> 00:30:15,845
No?

583
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:24,525
Jung Hee Wan.

584
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:26,195
- Jung Hee Wan. - My goodness.

585
00:30:26,655 --> 00:30:28,095
I kept calling you. Why didn't you answer me?

586
00:30:29,525 --> 00:30:30,525
What?

587
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:31,935
I'm Kim Ram Woo.

588
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:35,065
Kim Ram Woo, the teacher wants to see you in his office.

589
00:30:35,435 --> 00:30:36,505
- Why? - Why?

590
00:30:37,535 --> 00:30:39,205
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

591
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:40,835
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

592
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:42,145
- What? - What?

593
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:44,615
Shall we?

594
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:48,245
- Let's go. - But...

595
00:30:48,285 --> 00:30:49,285
Next. Kim Ram Woo.

596
00:30:49,286 --> 00:30:50,915
That's me. I'm Kim Ram Woo.

597
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:53,955
Lee Do Hyeon.

598
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:56,585
- Good job. - Yes.

599
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:01,665
Next.

600
00:31:03,995 --> 00:31:05,935
I'm a fan of "Call Me By Your Name" too.

601
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:07,465
That's not it.

602
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,305
Jung Hee Wan's insisting it.

603
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:18,015
That novel was pretty good though.

604
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:20,145
- Right? - Yes.

605
00:31:20,815 --> 00:31:23,484
- The male lead... - Yes.

606
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:25,214
- The story's pretty good too. - Yes.

607
00:31:25,215 --> 00:31:27,485
If you want more, we'll recommend it to you.

608
00:31:27,555 --> 00:31:29,285
- No, it's good. - No, it's fine.

609
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:30,655
No, I'm fine too.

610
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,854
Kim Ram Woo who's being called Jung Hee Wan,

611
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:34,965
wake up Jung Hee Wan who's arguing to be Kim Ram Woo.

612
00:31:44,835 --> 00:31:46,134
(Grade 11 Math Exam)

613
00:31:46,135 --> 00:31:48,875
(Grade 11 Class 1 Number 5, Jung Hee Wan)

614
00:31:54,915 --> 00:31:55,915
Sorry.

615
00:32:01,255 --> 00:32:03,125
This is important. It'll be on the exam.

616
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:05,155
Hey, wake Kim Ram Woo up.

617
00:32:05,955 --> 00:32:08,525
In "The Phenomenology of Spirit," by Hegel,

618
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,935
the term the struggle for recognition appears.

619
00:32:13,435 --> 00:32:14,565
The struggle for recognition.

620
00:32:14,735 --> 00:32:16,104
It's so crispy, you know?

621
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:18,604
- Jung Hee Wan, to the office. - They even make the butter.

622
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:20,634
- Yes. - It's rich.

623
00:32:20,635 --> 00:32:22,745
I know. It's amazing.

624
00:32:22,845 --> 00:32:24,474
Jung Hee Wan, the teacher wants you to collect everyone's homework...

625
00:32:24,475 --> 00:32:25,475
and bring it to him.

626
00:32:25,645 --> 00:32:26,645
Okay.

627
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:30,585
Why is everyone calling you Jung Hee Wan?

628
00:32:32,355 --> 00:32:33,785
Because I couldn't avoid it.

629
00:32:33,855 --> 00:32:36,385
I can't enjoy it, but I decided to accept it.

630
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:39,595
You're an attention seeker.

631

00:32:44,065 --> 00:32:46,134
He is Ram Woo's father,

633
00:32:46,135 --> 00:32:47,864
and she is Hee Wan's mother.

634
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,005
Say hello.

635
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:52,305
Wait. Never mind.

636
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:54,204
He is Hee Wan's father,

637
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,605
and she is Ram Woo's mother.

638
00:32:57,175 --> 00:33:00,245
Nice to meet you. I'm Hee Wan's father.

639
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:01,884
I'm Ram Woo's mother.

640
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:04,045
So Hee Wan stole...

641
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,985
Nam-woo's name?

642
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:11,185
- I didn't steal it. It was... - Be quiet.

643
00:33:11,695 --> 00:33:13,825
Anyway, say you're sorry.

644
00:33:13,955 --> 00:33:15,465
Apologize to Ram Woo too.

645
00:33:17,425 --> 00:33:18,665
I'm sorry.

646
00:33:19,595 --> 00:33:20,665
Sorry.

647
00:33:20,765 --> 00:33:22,464
- Oh, no. - No.

648
00:33:22,465 --> 00:33:24,404
Don't be.

649
00:33:24,405 --> 00:33:26,675
Kids can be playful.

650
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,305
I didn't know...

651
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,975
Ram Woo had a friend he joked with until now.

652
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:35,315
Anyway, I'm sorry.

653
00:33:35,415 --> 00:33:36,514
No, Mr. Jung.

654
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:39,554
I didn't call you to blame anyone today.

655
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:41,724
No. I will make sure this never happens again...

656
00:33:41,725 --> 00:33:44,225
Let's read this first before we talk.

657
00:33:45,195 --> 00:33:46,294
("Eunsung High School Angel Saves Old Lady in Rain")

658
00:33:46,295 --> 00:33:48,525
The lady Ram Woo saved...

659
00:33:48,625 --> 00:33:50,965
was grateful enough to donate all her fortune to school.

660
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:53,765
So we were able to provide scholarships,

661
00:33:54,295 --> 00:33:57,305
and Hee Wan with outstanding grades got to receive a scholarship.

662
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,575
Hee Want didn't get into trouble,

663
00:33:59,975 --> 00:34:01,335
but she's receiving a scholarship?

664
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:05,775
I'm sorry. It's not Hee Wan. It's Ram Woo.

665
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:12,554
- I knew it. - Mom.

666
00:34:12,555 --> 00:34:14,384
Dad, what did you expect?

667
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,324
But Hee Wan will get an award...

668
00:34:17,325 --> 00:34:19,425
from the school board for helping the lady.

669
00:34:20,095 --> 00:34:21,724
There was confusion,

670
00:34:21,725 --> 00:34:24,695
but they both have good news. You should compliment them.

671
00:34:24,865 --> 00:34:27,195
- Oh, dear. - Thank you.

672
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,405
Let's dine out.

673
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:33,205
Are you exhausted because you were summoned to school?

674
00:34:33,735 --> 00:34:36,705
No, I want to dine out because I'm happy.

675
00:34:37,305 --> 00:34:38,345
Why are you happy?

676
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:39,815
That I'm getting a scholarship?

677
00:34:39,915 --> 00:34:41,444
Not just that.

678
00:34:41,445 --> 00:34:44,114
I was excited when I first got the call.

679
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:47,154
Your teacher called and said I needed to come.

680
00:34:47,155 --> 00:34:49,724
You didn't have any friends because we moved a lot.

681
00:34:49,725 --> 00:34:51,224
When I heard you got into trouble with your friend,

682
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:53,195
my heart began racing.

683
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:55,664
What are you talking about?

684
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:58,095
I'm getting a good feeling since April.

685
00:34:58,635 --> 00:35:00,165
I think everything will turn out well.

686
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,005
So I will...

687
00:35:11,475 --> 00:35:12,975
We're going this way.

688
00:35:13,015 --> 00:35:14,745
We live this way.

689
00:35:15,985 --> 00:35:18,355
- We live in the same apartment. - We live in the same apartment.

690
00:35:18,415 --> 00:35:19,655
Oh, the same apartment...

691
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:21,755
We're neighbours.

692
00:35:22,025 --> 00:35:24,825
I see. Nice.

693
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:26,755
- Bye. - Bye.

694
00:35:27,155 --> 00:35:29,225
- Bye. - Bye.

695
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:34,795
Let's go.

696
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:36,065
By the way,

697
00:35:36,605 --> 00:35:38,905
Aren't you naturally walking home?

698
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,705
What about study hall?

699
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:43,204
Come on. You and I should...

700
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:45,275
also spend some quality time together.

701
00:35:45,815 --> 00:35:47,314
Look. Isn't that a nice sight?

702
00:35:47,315 --> 00:35:48,844
Let's act like we're close.

703
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:50,045
We can't lose to them.

704
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:51,954
Let's go.

705
00:35:51,955 --> 00:35:53,584
- It feels awkward. - Not true.

706
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:56,355
Let's go, Dad. I'm hungry.

707
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,395
- It must be closed. - Right?

708
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:04,165
What?

709
00:36:05,365 --> 00:36:08,035
We wanted to have dinner before going home, but it's closed.

710
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:09,905
It's open. Do eat here before you go.

711
00:36:10,165 --> 00:36:13,005
They have the best fried tomatoes and eggs.

712
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:16,205
- You must be a regular. - No.

713
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:18,915
I'm just good at making it.

714
00:36:22,315 --> 00:36:23,315
- I see. - I see.

715
00:36:23,316 --> 00:36:26,114

716
00:36:26,115 --> 00:36:27,685

717
00:36:46,505 --> 00:36:47,535
Hey.

718
00:36:49,645 --> 00:36:50,645
Thanks.

719
00:36:52,415 --> 00:36:53,445
About what?

720
00:36:56,085 --> 00:36:57,445
The scholarship...

721
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:01,985
And you know.

722
00:37:10,665 --> 00:37:11,695
Here.

723
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:13,835
Enjoy. Dig in, okay?

724
00:37:14,835 --> 00:37:16,764
Tell me if you want anything else.

725
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,335
It doesn't have to be from the menu.

726
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:20,335
Thank you for the meal.

727
00:37:22,745 --> 00:37:25,615
I should be treating you, not being treated to.

728
00:37:26,275 --> 00:37:27,514
He's my daughter's dear friend.

729
00:37:27,515 --> 00:37:28,785
I should treat you two.

730
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:36,955
It's really good.

731
00:37:37,955 --> 00:37:39,994
How long have you been running this place?

732
00:37:39,995 --> 00:37:41,825
We're natives here.

733
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:44,525
Hee Wan and I have been living here since she was little.

734
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:48,195
And if you have any questions regarding this town,

735
00:37:48,735 --> 00:37:50,135
call me anytime.

736
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:52,935
I know this town like the back of my hand.

737
00:37:53,135 --> 00:37:54,174
I'm sorry.

738
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:55,805
I take after my dad's nosiness.

739
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:57,774
I see.

740
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,175
You're easygoing, just like your father.

741
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:04,745
I'm glad we moved to this town.

742
00:38:05,015 --> 00:38:07,485
There's a must-eat place near our house.

743
00:38:08,385 --> 00:38:12,355
And Ram Woo now has a bright friend like Hee Wan.

744
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:16,524
I consider it a great honour...

745
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:19,465
to have met Punglim-dong Lee Hyo Ri in person.

746
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:20,735
What?

747
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:22,935
Oh, my.

748
00:38:23,765 --> 00:38:25,535
- Are you okay? - Try some of this, Mom.

749
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,504
Doesn't it look really good?

750
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:28,875
Try some. Come on.

751
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,915
Shall I? Let me try.

752
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:34,344
By the way, Ram Woo and Hee Wan.

753
00:38:34,345 --> 00:38:37,315
Why did you two swap names?

754
00:38:37,385 --> 00:38:39,515
Exactly. I wanted to ask that too.

755
00:38:48,495 --> 00:38:50,295
But I was curious too.

756
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,235
Why did you do it?

757
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:53,894
Kim Nam Woo.

758
00:38:53,895 --> 00:38:56,104
Nam Woo? Ram Woo?

759
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:57,605
What a hard name to pronounce.

760
00:38:58,605 --> 00:39:00,405
Well, it's fun. Isn't it?

761
00:39:00,635 --> 00:39:02,205
No. It's just confusing.

762
00:39:02,575 --> 00:39:04,305
You should be happy he hasn't sued you.

763
00:39:04,605 --> 00:39:06,015
Hey. What do you think?

764
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:07,975
Do you think it'll fit us?

765
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:12,785
What am I supposed to say when you keep munching on snacks?

766
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:16,085
What's with the nonstop amount of sweet stuff?

767
00:39:16,355 --> 00:39:18,895
I can't help it. People keep giving them to me.

768
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,695
What's interesting is that I'm popular among girls these days.

769
00:39:23,265 --> 00:39:24,265
What?

770
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,165
Do girls find me attractive?

771
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:29,535
Isn't that for Kim Ram Woo and not you?

772
00:39:30,365 --> 00:39:31,664
- What? - That chocolate.

773
00:39:31,665 --> 00:39:33,275
Wasn't it left in your locker?

774
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:35,945
And that sweet corn from last time.

775
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:38,875
Yes, I found them in my locker.

776
00:39:39,615 --> 00:39:42,115
Gosh. Not bad, Kim Ram Woo.

777
00:39:42,185 --> 00:39:44,215
- What about it? - I meant the real Kim Ram Woo.

778
00:39:44,485 --> 00:39:47,115
I thought he was a naive guy. But he's quite popular.

779
00:39:47,355 --> 00:39:49,625
To be gifted sweet corns in early spring?

780
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:51,255
- That's love. - Goodness.

781
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:53,055
Popular, my foot.

782
00:39:54,255 --> 00:39:56,294
Wait. What's this? Are you jealous?

783
00:39:56,295 --> 00:39:58,494
- No way. - Something's fishy.

784
00:39:58,495 --> 00:39:59,894
You used his name...

785
00:39:59,895 --> 00:40:02,205
and kept dragging him into things.

786
00:40:02,705 --> 00:40:04,005
Do you have a crush on Kim Ram Woo?

787
00:40:05,735 --> 00:40:06,805
Tae Gyeong.

788
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:09,704
Such delusion is an illness.

789
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:11,275
You should see a doctor.

790
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:14,675
All right.

791
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,985
Let's destroy the proof by finishing it quickly.

792
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:33,195
Was it fun?

793
00:40:33,995 --> 00:40:35,665
- No. - No.

794
00:40:36,835 --> 00:40:39,735
This is one of my favourite poems.

795
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,545
Poet Hwang Ji U...

796
00:40:43,345 --> 00:40:45,045
wrote it after watching this movie.

797
00:40:46,075 --> 00:40:47,275
Who wants to read it out loud?

798
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:49,185
No one, right?

799
00:40:50,545 --> 00:40:54,355
Then, our class's model student, Jung Hee Wan.

800
00:41:02,595 --> 00:41:05,935
"Pushing your bicycle, bringing news from the outside,"

801
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:07,635
"and wiping your forehead."

802
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:09,935
"What a shabby Hermes."

803
00:41:10,505 --> 00:41:13,105
"When I asked you about the beauty of this island,"

804
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:17,105
"you answered with the name of your beloved."

805
00:41:18,975 --> 00:41:23,045
"When I left the island and completely forgot about you,"

806
00:41:23,545 --> 00:41:26,254
"you held a microphone to the night sky..."

807
00:41:26,255 --> 00:41:27,315
"and recorded the stars."

808
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:41,195
"Did you want to tell your moving love to the stars?"

809
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:44,365
"You leaving that island for good."

810
00:41:44,865 --> 00:41:45,935
What?

811
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,575
Darn it. That little...

812
00:41:54,575 --> 00:41:56,115
Seriously.

813
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:09,164
The Five-grain Cocoball is up on the second-hand marketplace.

814
00:42:09,165 --> 00:42:10,165
Aren't you buying it?

815
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:11,725
Weren't you craving it like crazy?

816
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:13,135
It has super high calories.

817
00:42:13,235 --> 00:42:16,604
Someone in our apartment is selling it for cheap...

818
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:19,035
after ordering not 1 but 11 boxes by mistake.

819
00:42:19,205 --> 00:42:20,535
I already sent them a message.

820
00:42:21,075 --> 00:42:22,344
What? Let me see.

821
00:42:22,345 --> 00:42:23,475
- Should I cancel it? - No, wait.

822
00:42:26,275 --> 00:42:27,415
Where are you meeting them?

823
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:29,785
At the recycling center in ten minutes.

824
00:42:37,585 --> 00:42:38,655
What?

825
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:41,154
My lips are chapped due to the dry air.

826
00:42:41,155 --> 00:42:42,495
I didn't say a thing.

827
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:46,034
It's 9pm on a weekday,

828
00:42:46,035 --> 00:42:48,365
you take a shower, watch a drama, and go to sleep.

829
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:50,235
But to do your hair?

830
00:42:52,635 --> 00:42:55,105
- Unbelievable. - Get out of my room.

831
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:57,044
Go hang out in your room.

832
00:42:57,045 --> 00:42:59,344
- What is it? Tell me. - Get out.

833
00:42:59,345 --> 00:43:01,245
Go have fun in your room. Go!

834
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:08,755
It's not dry yet.

835
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:24,365
For real? Darn it.

836
00:43:24,505 --> 00:43:27,105
"The beautiful things of this island that you numbered."

837
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:31,074
"The last number, your father's sad sea,"

838
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,275
"long shot, long take,"

839
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:36,815
"until the casting credits all came up,"

840
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,515
"I sat in the chair with my head buried."

841
00:43:40,815 --> 00:43:41,855
Excuse me.

842
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:45,925
Are you the buyer?

843
00:43:51,865 --> 00:43:53,095
(Five-grain Cocoball)

844
00:43:56,705 --> 00:43:58,065
"Thinking I might..."

845
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:00,905
"also be an assailant of some remorse,"

846
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,775
"I walked for a long time..."

847
00:44:03,445 --> 00:44:05,545
"with no destination, even after leaving the movie theater."

848
00:44:07,045 --> 00:44:08,075
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

849
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,415
Hey.

850
00:44:15,985 --> 00:44:17,385
Why is your dress wet?

851
00:44:19,225 --> 00:44:20,225
It just...

852
00:44:22,695 --> 00:44:25,165
- This is blood right here. - Yes, it's blood.

853
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:27,465
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine.

854
00:44:35,235 --> 00:44:37,875
"Whistling the loneliest whistle in the world,"

855
00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:41,415
"the train leaving Sinchon Station has gone to Munsan."

856
00:44:42,145 --> 00:44:45,145
"And I wanted to stand by a sea for a long time."

857
00:44:46,255 --> 00:44:48,014
(What a shabby Hermes.)

858
00:44:48,015 --> 00:44:49,925
(When I asked you about the beauty...)

859
00:44:56,565 --> 00:45:04,035
(Kim Ram Woo)

860
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:19,985
Let's open the windows.

861
00:45:25,325 --> 00:45:26,525
What's going on?

862
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:28,555
The room needs airing out.

863
00:45:29,765 --> 00:45:31,465
The air in here is stuffy.

864
00:45:31,825 --> 00:45:33,595
That's not what I'm asking.

865
00:45:35,435 --> 00:45:36,535
Have you been well?

866
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:45,375
Did you not miss me until now?

867
00:45:45,845 --> 00:45:47,215
How long has it been?

868
00:45:48,715 --> 00:45:50,344
We promised to meet on graduation day but couldn't.

869
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:51,415
So, has it been four years?

870
00:45:52,155 --> 00:45:54,585
It turns out that today is April Fool's Day.

871
00:45:57,555 --> 00:46:00,495
We have a lot to say when it comes to April Fool's Day.

872
00:46:00,955 --> 00:46:02,125
Right, Kim Ram Woo?

873
00:46:07,395 --> 00:46:08,435
"A lot to say?"

874
00:46:11,065 --> 00:46:12,405
We absolutely do.

875
00:46:31,785 --> 00:46:33,195
But you died.

876
00:46:37,665 --> 00:46:38,695
Four years ago.
