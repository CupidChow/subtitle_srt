Hi.

12
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,240
Long time no see.

13
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,680
How have you been, Kim Ram Woo?

14
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:07,840
It's me, Jeong Hee Wan.

15
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,630
You didn't forget about me, did you?

Hey!

20
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:29,620
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

21
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,690
It really hurts.

22
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,400
 This is just to make things clear. 

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,690
 He's Kim Ram Woo and I'm Jeong Hee Wan. 

24
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,990
 I'll tell you why I'm so shocked to see him later. 

25
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,350
 We ended up switching names because... 

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,400
 This is actually a long story too. 

27
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,900
 So... 

28
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:55,510
♫  I'm here to stay  ♫

♫  never letting you go  ♫

32
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,130
 Restroom. 
   

33
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,650
 I think we're done writing it. 

34
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,640
 Hi. Good night. 

35
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,650
 Compared to other classes, our April Fool's Day prank 

36
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,260
 was pretty trivial. 

37
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,020
You wrote your names in spots you wanted, right?

38
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,730
Let's do it very strictly this time. 
    

39
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,420
 Okay. 

40
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,370
Excuse me.

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,810
Does everyone need to participate?

42
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,540
It'd be meaningless otherwise.

43
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,800
We need the numbers to even out, too.

44
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,740
I knew it.

45
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,850
That's so Kim Ram Woo, the top student

46
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,930
who can't adjust since transferring.

47
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,210
Kim Ram Woo.

48
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,240
 Kim Ram Woo. 

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,080
 Kim Ram Woo. 

50
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:20,500
 Kim Ram Woo. 

51
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,070
 Kim Ram Woo. 

52
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:27,320
Okay.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,010
I'll do it.

54
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,050
 Kim Ram Woo. 

55
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,190
No, I'll do it. I'll do it.

56
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,330
The student teacher hasn't learned our names yet.

57
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm sure we can fool her.

58
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,910
It's a new semester so you don't know many of your classmates, right?

59
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,450
Switching names would bring us closer.

60
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,620
- I love that. 
 - Daebak. I love it.

61
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,530
- Right. 
 - I love it.

62
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,200
Okay, guys.

63
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,300
Let's do this.

64
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,210
 Let's go! 

65
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,050
 ­  

66
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,490
 Next is Jeong Hee Wan. 

67
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,120
Speed up!

68
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,610
- No, move to the side! 
 - But then it will...

69
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,300
We're doomed! Oh?

70
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,160
It's going back!

71
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,900
For Jeong Hee Wan, it's Kim Ram Woo. 
    

72
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,060
- Next is Lee Hye Rin. 
  - Next. 

73
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,690
   

74
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,960
Here.

75
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,110
My name is in your care for a day.

76
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:35,960
This is going to be so much fun, right?

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,630
No.

78
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,990
Put it on.

79
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,110
You worry about your health a lot. 
    

80
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,040
Gorosoe?

81
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,470
Why have you aged after just one period?

82
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:57,900
I can't believe it's not past lunchtime yet.

83
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,630
It's a good chance to make friends in the class.

84
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,250
Do I have to come here to play a board game

85
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,260
every break from my classroom?

86
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:08,740
You have no one else to play board games with but me.

87
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,630
I don't have to play board games.

88
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,610
I'm just entertaining you.

89
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,640
I mastered this game.

90
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,230
What?

91
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:21,100
No! My Aloha Island.

92
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,650
Darn. Cruel jerk.

93
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,110
- Does that make sense? 
 - It's true.

94
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,820
Hurry up and make friends so I can throw this out.

95
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,010
Gosh, it's so stressful.

96
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,290
Why would I make friends?

97
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,590
The college entrance exam is next year.

98
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,960
And your wig...

99
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,940
Do Ganggangsullae... 
  (T/N: Korean folk dance) 

100
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,820
What a fuss over switching names for a day.

101
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,320
Who did you switch names with?

102
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,060
Is it a girl?

103
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,610
Yes.

104
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,130
What's she like?

105
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,740
Well, she's just...

106
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,150
She's a healthy kid.

107
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:02,030
 She's a good runner and... 

108
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,240
I need to try the new bun.

109
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,210
 She's a good eater. 

110
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:17,780
   
   

111
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,160
 I'll make sure to succeed this time. 

112
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,920
 Here I go! 

113
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,710
 I can do it. Focus. Focus. 

114
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,110
 - Here I go. 
 - Okay. 

115
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,260
 Here I go! 

116
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:34,320
 She knows how to have fun. 

117
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,850
 Success. 

118
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,260
Whose empty seat is that?

119
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:47,480
- It's Kim Ram Woo's. 
 - Kim Ram Woo's.

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,790
She went to the infirmary because of menstrual cramps—

121
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,490
I'm Kim Ram Woo.

122
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,330
Kim Ram Woo.

123
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm Kim Ram Woo.

124
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,330
And she's shameless.

125
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,190
- Do you smoke? 
 - I don't.

126
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,840
Those street thugs...

127
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,810
- It's okay. It's okay. 
 - Stand up straight.

128
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,900
   

129
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,410
- Darn. 
 - What the heck?

130
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,820
Hey, hey! Run, run, run!

131
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,440
- Darn! 
 - Run, run!

132
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,260
What a crazy—

133
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,840
   

134
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,150
 She keeps herself busy. 

135
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:50,390
No, buddy.

136
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,970
I'm not asking that.

137
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:54,650
Is she pretty?

138
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,700
Objectively, is she considered cute?

139
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,700
- Go! 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

140
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,730
I think I'm getting better.

141
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,330
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

142
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:07,470
Are you doing a viral challenge?

143
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,090
- Yes. 
 - You're so cute.

144
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,840
- Are you in 1st grade? 
 - Yes.

145
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,880
What's your name?

146
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,710
I'm Kim Ram Woo.

147
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,810
As long as she doesn't talk.

148
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,050
Is she pretty?

149
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,890
Let's go.

150
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,610
Is she pretty?

151
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,320
 Hey! 

152
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,670
Over there. Over there.

153
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,900
There she is.

154
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,740
Kim Ram Woo!

155
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,720
You're pretty!

156
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,370
 Date him! Date him! 

157
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,660
Kim Ram Woo, go out with me!

158
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:40,500
 So pretty! 

159
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,060
 What a nice couple! 

160
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,690
 Date him! 

161
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,080
- They make a nice couple. 
 - So pretty!

162
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,950
Here I go.

163
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,060
What's this? What are you doing?

164
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,240
Boop, boop.

165
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,960
Hey.

166
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,550
Oh? Hi, Jeong Hee Wan.

167
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,980
The thing is...

168
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,030
What is it, Jeong Hee Wan?

169
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,640
Well...

170
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,970
Us switching names...

171
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,660
We're just trying to prank the student teacher.

172
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,380
Right.

173
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:25,740
But...

174
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,400
do we have to do it when she's not around—

175
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,540
He's saying you're overdoing it.

176
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,790
Well, no, no.

177
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,070
I just wonder if you need to get into it so much.

178
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,550
I did?

179
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,120
People just asked my name.

180
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,880
So, I said it was "Kim Ram Woo" a few times.

181
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,560
Hey.

182
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,210
Who's Kim Ram Woo?

183
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,110
- Me. 
 - That's me.

184
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,740
What? Who's Kim Ram Woo?

185
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,860
- I am. 
 - I am. I am.

186
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,330
No, what is it?

187
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,950
Some Jeongil High kids are waiting at the entrance to talk to you.

188
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:07,530
Wow, is it another love confession?

189
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,920
Hey, kneel.

190
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,820
 They said you'd better come quickly. 

191
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,770
That they'd kill you.

192
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:24,550
Are you sure they want K-Kim Ram Woo?

193
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,980
   

194
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,190
 What did you do, exactly? 

195
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,170
They disrupted public order first

196
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,800
and threatened public safety.

197
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,300
So, I gave them the best advice I could as a student.

198
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,350
It wasn't the smartest approach, I admit.

199
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,270
Let's just tell our teacher.

200
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,250
Hey, hold on.

201
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,400
Let me think first.

202
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,030
No, I don't think you should do anything more—

203
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,520
Hold on.

204
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Since it was my doing, I'll take responsibility.

205
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,460
But they outnumber us.

206
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,500
We can't let them overpower us.

207
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,790
So, we need to take some measures.

208
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:09,630
Could I ask you guys to cooperate a bit?

209
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,020
Cooperate how?

210
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:16,950
What's your favorite animal?

211
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,900
   

212
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:24,780
Are you Kim Ram Woo?

213
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,070
Yes, that's me.

214
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:29,050
This is too silly to get angry about.

215
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,780
Hey, what will you do about this?

216
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,440
This is luxury brand stuff, okay?

217
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,600
A new product I bought yesterday.

218
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,260
It's brand new.

219
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,430
What else is there to do? Put it in the washer.

220
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,090
Do I have to teach you everything?

221
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,750
Hey, you think you're somebody?

222
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,060
What? What makes you so confident?

223
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,720
Me?

224
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,770
Are you curious who I am?

225
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,880
What? Darn it. You want to duke it out?

226
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,280
Let's fight.

227
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,650
- This little... 
 - Hey, hey. Let me. Let me.

228
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,030
What's this?

229
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,510
   

230
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,280
Gosh.

231
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,070
Darn, she drew a tiger.

232
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:33,370
Are you from an endangered animal protection group?

233
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,720
They're really funny.

234
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:39,010
Does your mom know you doodle on your body?

235
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,350
Probably not. She's in heaven.

236
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:45,080
You went too far this time.

237
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,280
 This seems wrong. 

238
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,710
Can't you say that when you're fighting?

239
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,320
Don't people usually talk like this?

240
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,770
"What do your mom and dad do?"

241
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:54,670
No, no, no. You can't drag the parents in.

242
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:56,970
I don't have a dad either.

243
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,790
Aigoo.

244
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,300
Aigoo, really?

245
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,280
Let's go.

246
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,510
What's with them?

247
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,880
I think they're just crazy.

248
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,970
Just tell them to wash the sweater.

249
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,730
This is cashmere. You need to use a wool shampoo.

250
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,240
Do you even know what that is?

251
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,590
Look at them. You think they'd know?

252
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,270
Hey, Jeong Hee Wan.

253
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:26,540
Do you know what a wool shampoo is?

254
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,670
Yes, I can—

255
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,470
Hee Wan only uses the Cucumber Soap.

256
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,600
We'll use that if you're okay with it.

257
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,890
Who uses Cucumber soaps these days?

258
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,740
Hey, hey. Let's just go.

259
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,890
This wasn't an easy purchase for you.

260
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,050
- But they want to use the Cucumber Soap on it. 
 - Then what...

261
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:42,420
- What do you want me to do? 
 - No, not Cucumber soap. I'll wash it for—

262
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,060
 - Students.  
 - Yes?

263
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,720
Are you the ones who always smoke here?

264
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,020
- No. 
 - Let's go.

265
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,080
We're screwed. Let's run. Run!

266
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,760
Run!

267
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,680
Let's go study!

268
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,130
Where do we go? Darn!

269
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,910
Go.

270
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:13,500
 Anyway, I've never met anyone like her. 

271
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,000
It's over.

272
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,330
April Fools' Day is over.

273
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,190
   

274
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,810
   

275
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,460
You put in so much effort this year, too.

276
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,810
But doesn't doing things like this

277
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,620
leave nothing but an embarrassing past?

278
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,110
I think it's more than that.

279
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:31,140
 Anyway, that April Fools' Day had a lasting effect. 

280
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,110
Hey, roll it up more.

281
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,200
Hey, what? You...

282
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,510
It's so cool.

283
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,800
- Just once. 
 - Hold on, Hong Seok.

284
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,060
- Show me. It looks great. 
 - No...

285
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,700
- It's for the environment. 
 - Geez.

286
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,030
Let me post it on Instagram.

287
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,400
No, Hong Seok...

288
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,770
I'll show you later...

289
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,490
Let me post it.

290
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:54,000
Hey, I...

291
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,970
I can let you borrow this if you want.

292
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,990
But why?

293
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,900
I didn't know... 
    

294
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,020
we shared the same taste.

295
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,230
I thought you were just a bookworm.

296
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,930
W-What do you mean?

297
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,480
   

298
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,970
   

299
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:19,250
   

300
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,610
   

301
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,970
   

302
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:27,650
"I Wanted to Be Your Bed for a Night,

303
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:29,840
but It Became Two Nights."

304
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,900
"Being Trained by the Obsessive Type?"

305
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,240
Requested by Kim Ram Woo!

306
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,440
Shut up!

307
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,100
No, no. And try this if you like true soulmate stories.

308
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,390
The black-haired character is really amazing.

309
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,630
How about the real hardcore stuff?

310
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,080
I like "A Private's Dirty Letters."

311
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,170
Requested by Kim Ram Woo.

312
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:46,740
- "A Private's Dirty Letters" is a masterpiece. 
 - No, no.

313
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,720
- Listen to me. 
 - In this, do you like blonde or black hair?

314
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,510
 Since April Fools' Day, Kim Ram Woo 

315
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:53,240
 made friends and became cheerful. 

316
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,490
 You could say I pulled him out of darkness. 

317
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,060
 At least I thought so then. 

318
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,120
Are you okay?

319
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,910
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

320
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:06,170
   

321
00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:25,070
   

322
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,440
   

323
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,190
Typography class was canceled for April Fools' Day.

324
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,250
The notice was sent to the department group chat.

325
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,490
I suppose you missed it.

326
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,230
What's your name? I'll count today's attendance if you skip later.

327
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,650
You still came to class.

328
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,880
I'm Jeong Hee Wan.

329
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,860
Jeong Hee Wan.

330
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,260
A senior who enrolled in 2020, right?

331
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,880
- Yes. 
 - You're the only one who didn't

332
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,260
request the yearbook photoshoot.

333
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,230
Did you forget to do that, too?

334
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,020
You know the deadline is this week, right?

335
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,290
Request it if you can.

336
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:06,000
It's a once-in-a-lifetime memory.

337
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,960
Request it.

338
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,590
- Hey, come fast. Hurry up! 
 - I'm coming.

339
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,840
- I can't. 
 - I'm so hungry.

340
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,930
Why?

341
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,890
I said, okay.

342
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:35,490
Are you okay?

343
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,620
Are you okay?

344
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,800
You need to go to a hospital.

345
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,880
I'm okay.

346
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:15,120
Lee Hyori of Pungrim-dong?

347
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,420
You're Margot Robbie of Pungrim-dong?

348
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,710
Do you live here?

349
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,090
I live over there.

350
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:22,100
This is crazy, isn't it?

351
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:25,790
No. Doesn't almost everyone from our school live here?

352
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,960
I'm saying...

353
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,590
it's crazy that Lee Hyori and

354
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,830
Margot Robbie live in the same apartment complex.

355
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:34,140
Check the stuff.

356
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,130
Right now? Here?

357
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,490
Yes.

358
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,770
There's no refund later.

359
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,390
Really?

360
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,900
How daring.

361
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:47,750
You said you're selling it because you're too shy to wear it.

362
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,270
You want me to check the unworn lace bra, 
    

363
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,900
made in Japan, right in front of you.

364
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,610
Hey, hey, hey!

365
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,890
Hold on. Why is this...

366
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,800
Well, my mom...

367
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,720
My mom was selling it, but she fell asleep.

368
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,870
So, I came instead. I didn't know what it was.

369
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:09,260
You should check. What if it's damaged, as you said?

370
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,850
Have a look at it at home.

371
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,520
Don't take it out now.

372
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,420
I'll give you a refund if it's damaged.

373
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:17,260
I mean, my mom will refund you.

374
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,170
Gosh, gosh. Are you okay?

375
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:22,950
Well, do you need help?

376
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,080
Well, I...

377
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,630
I'm really running an errand for my mom.

378
00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:29,110
I'm not a pervert.

379
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,480
This doesn't make you a pervert.

380
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,380
It's okay. I respect your taste.

381
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,300
Your tastes... This...

382
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,150
Geez. Please put that away.

383
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,310
It really doesn't bother me.

384
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,590
Well, it bothers me.

385
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:44,800
I made it clear I'm on an errand for my mom.

386
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,080
Don't say anything weird at school.

387
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,830
You can't do that, okay?

388
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,140
Hey, don't you want money?

389
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,760
Forget about it. Just keep it.

390
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,350
Gosh, Mom.

391
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,640
Because of that...

392
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,070
Geez...

393
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,900
Sleep inside, Mom.

394
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:19,720
You need to take a shower first.

395
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,330
What are you doing?

396
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:28,210
What are you doing? Your sister is here.

397
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,320
Your sister is here.

398
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,070
- Move, move, move. 
 - Seriously.

399
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,990
Did you get that for free?

400
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,160
No.

401
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,450
Why are you that happy about buying stuff?

402
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,250
It's just something.

403
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,440
   

404
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,770
   

405
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,870
   

406
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:46,430
"Thank you for the cool transaction."

407
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,710
   

408
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,910
   

409
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,590
   

410
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:07,760
   

411
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,920
   

412
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,150
Don't be ridiculous.

413
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,010
It's not for you.

414
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,000
- Are you curious? 
 - No, I can see it all.

415
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,100
You can't see it. You can't.

416
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,980
   

417
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:15,360
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

418
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,800
♪  Happy birthday, dear Tae Kyung  ♪

419
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,670
♪  Happy birthday to you  ♪

420
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,760
Hold on. Make a wish.

421
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,310
Okay.

422
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,550
 - Oh, yes. 
 - It's ready. 

423
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,020
 - Here's the gift. 
 - What's that? 

424
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,110
Here. Ta-da!

425
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:29,410
It's from a pharmacy?

426
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:30,950
What? What?

427
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:32,370
What could it be?

428
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,340
And then drum roll...

429
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,290
Drum roll...

430
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,710
Oh?

431
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,780
Here.

432
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,380
 Aigoo. 

433
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,020
 Hey. 

434
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,530
I love this so much.

435
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,860
It suits you so well.

436
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,410
What's this? What a silly gift.

437
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,920
Wow.

438
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,550
Do I look okay? Do I?

439
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,890
Buddy,

440
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm so glad you're curvy.

441
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,170
You saved my face.

442
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,600
Come on. Where did you get this?

443
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,590
- Wow, sheer. 
 - What are you doing?

444
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:23,360
Tae Kyung has a unique taste, doesn't she?

445
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,630
What's the cake for?

446
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,450
I guess it's her birthday.

447
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,010
I see.

448
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,300
Hey.

449
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:34,300
You should've told me sooner if you had such useful info.

450
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,270
Why do you need to know her birthday?

451
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,540
I could've used her birthday party as an excuse to get close to her.

452
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,340
You need to do the groundwork for me.

453
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,840
Say, "His name is Hong Seok. He's my only friend."

454
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:49,340
"He's sweet, trustworthy, and dependable."

455
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,510
"He's a rare breed."

456
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,380
"Let's all go to karaoke sometime."

457
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,110
What do you say?

458
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:59,620
It can double as a headband like this.

459
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,400
By the way, buddy...

460
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,310
They say, "Birds of a feather flock together."

461
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,500
What?

462
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,580
I don't know Tae Kyung well,

463
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,800
but they say friends grow similar.

464
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,760
I think you should consider this carefully.

465
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,940
Is that why neither of us have girlfriends?

466
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,400
- Do it like this. 
 - No, not that...

467
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,030
I'm leaving.

468
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,580
And some of you exchange DMs and chats with

469
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:35,920
strangers on social media, right?

470
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,930
People exchange alcohol, cigarettes,

471
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,490
and even drugs on these apps these days.

472
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,570
It's really dangerous.

473
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,790
Sir, I met a pervert buying a used product online.

474
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,190
You, too? I did, too.

475
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,750
- A few days ago, I— 
 - She's right...

476
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,820
No!

477
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:55,070
"No" is right. Ram Woo is right.

478
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,780
Don't share personal info online.

479
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,250
Go with an adult if you're meeting someone offline.

480
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,400
 Okay. 

481
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,870
That's it for today.

482
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:13,470
Hey...

483
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:16,650
have I done something wrong to you, by chance?

484
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:18,350
I don't think so.

485
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,910
Why? Have you?

486
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:22,210
What? No, I haven't.

487
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,420
But...

488
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:28,030
because of what happened last night,

489
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,480
I strangely feel like I'm being threatened.

490
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,270
What are you talking about?

491
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,320
I wasn't doing that.

492
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,200
Hey, what kind of person do you think I am?

493
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,130
Someone who's capable of it?

494
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:47,050
Hey, it's okay if you weren't.

495
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:54,040
Whenever someone gets me wrong like this,

496
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,580
I feel disillusioned with life.

497
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,240
Fine. I'm sorry I misunderstood.

498
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,260
I'd like you to keep what happened yesterday a secret.

499
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,340
I beg you, okay?

500
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,040
Do me a favor, too, then.

501
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,770
What is it?

502
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:24,460
Let's keep switching names.

503
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,830
Like we did for April Fools' Day.

504
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,410
You're Jeong Hee Wan and I'm Kim Ram Woo.

505
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,010
- What? 
 - On April Fools' Day,

506
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:32,350
I received a love confession for the first time.

507
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,540
What does that have to do with—

508
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,250
And we had an English quiz that day.

509
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,520
Do you know what score I got?

510
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,770
 70 points. 

511
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:41,460
That means all of my guesses were correct.

512
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,300
- I went to a tteokbokki shop with Tae Kyung 
  - Thank you! 

513
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,730
- and we got an egg for free. 
  - It's complimentary. 

514
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,200
It had two yolks, even.

515
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,560
Doesn't that give you the chills?

516
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,540
But what about it?

517
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,650
So, I've been thinking about it.

518
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:55,460
Why did I reach my peak that day?

519
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,710
I think it's because I switched names with you.

520
00:28:58,710 --> 00:29:01,180
It was like your luck came to me.

521
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,040
You know how your name affects your fate, right?

522
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,590
You know this is ridiculous, right?

523
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,920
No.

524
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,520
Did anything change for you since we switched names?

525
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,640
Think carefully.

526
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,300
 Kim Ram Woo, go out with me! 

527
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,300
 Who's Kim Ram Woo? 
   

528
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,590
 They said you'd better come quickly. 

529
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,400
 - They said they'd kill you. 
 - You won't regret it. 

530
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,720
 I'm okay, I said. 

531
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,830
- A lot has changed. 
 - Exactly.

532
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,770
Here's another thing that gave me chills.

533
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,160
My dad checked my fortune.

534
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,230
The fortuneteller said I don't have a tree,

535
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:37,300
so I have poor luck in love and career.

536
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,290
But your name changed my luck that day.

537
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:43,400
It means the name was perfect for me.

538
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,360
But you know my name is "Ram Woo,"

539
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:49,000
not "Namoo," right? 
  (T/N: Namoo means "tree") 

540
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:53,520
Is your name in Chinese characters or Hangeul? 
  (T/N: Korean alphabet) 

541
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,490
It's Ram as in "own" and Woo as in "hill."

542
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,210
I got the chills.

543
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:00,170
- Why? 
 - What could be on the hill?

544
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,690
The pine tree on Namsan. A tree on a hill.

545
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:06,170
I really got the chills.

546
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,920
Do you want to see it?

547
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,140
Hey.

548
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:12,130
Aren't you just cold if you keep getting chills?

549
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:17,640
And we can't just switch our names like that.

550
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,530
Can't we?

551
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:26,770
 Jeong Hee Wan! 

552
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,550
Jeong Hee Wan!

553
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,550
- Hey, Jeong Hee Wan! 
 - You scared me.

554
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:33,430
I kept calling you. Why didn't you answer?

555
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:34,740
What?

556
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,970
It's me, Kim Ram Woo.

557
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:39,380
Kim Ram Woo, they want you at the teachers' office.

558
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,470
- Why? 
 - Why?

559
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,630
- What? 
 - What?

560
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,990
- What? 
 - What?

561
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:46,620
What?

562
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,420
Should I, then?

563
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,220
- Let's go. 
 - Hey...

564
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,180
Next is Kim Ram Woo.

565
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:55,970
Yes, I'm Kim Ram Woo!

566
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,000
Lee Do Hyeon.

567
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,610
- Min Shi Ah. 
 - Yes.

568
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,420
Next.

569
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,890
I like "Call Me By Your Name," too.

570
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:12,540
It's not like that!

571
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,430
Jeong Hee Wan alone is insisting on this.

572
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:22,530
By the way, that novel was interesting.

573
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,750
- Right? 
 - Yes.

574
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:27,280
- The male lead and... 
 - Yes, yes.

575
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,170
- The story was good too. 
 - Yes, yes. That's right.

576
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,490
I can give you more recommendations.

577
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,580
- No, it's okay. 
 - No, I don't mind.

578
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,590
No, it's okay.

579
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:36,860
Kim Ram Woo, who's being called "Jeong Hee Wan."

580
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,110
Wake up, Jeong Hee Wan, who insists she's Kim Ram Woo.

581
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,790
   

582
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:52,940
   

583
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:00,750
I'm sorry.

584
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:07,760
This is important. It will be on the test.

585
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,730
Wake up, Kim Ram Woo.

586
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,120
In Hegel's "The Phenomenology of Spirit,"

587
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,350
it mentions "the struggle for recognition."

588
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,610
The struggle for recognition.

589
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:20,010
It's so crunchy, you know?

590
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:22,580
- Jeong Hee Wan, to the teachers' office. 
 - They made it like that.

591
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,520
Exactly.

592
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,690
Seriously. It's like...

593
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,560
Jeong Hee Wan, the teacher says to collect assignments.

594
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,350
Okay.

595
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:35,620
How did you become Jeong Hee Wan?

596
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,740
It couldn't be avoided.

597
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:41,450
I can't enjoy it, but I decided to accept it.

598
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,990
You're kind of an attention seeker.

599
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:47,960
   

600
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,100
This is Ram Woo's father.

601
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,780
This is Hee Wan's mother.

602
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,850
Say hello.

603
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,540
No, no.

604
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:58,160
This is Hee Wan's father.

605
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,480
And this is Ram Woo's mother.

606
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,380
Nice to meet you, I'm Hee Wan's dad.

607
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,800
I'm Ram Woo's mom.

608
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,210
So, Hee Wan has been

609
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:12,490
stealing Ram Woo's name, using it everywhere, right?

610
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,240
I'm not stealing. It was consensual—

611
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,660
Be quiet!

612
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,870
Apologize to her regardless.

613
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:20,310
Apologize to Ram Woo, too.

614
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,570
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,660
Sorry.

616
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,330
- No, no. 
 - No, not at all.

617
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:31,310
The kids were just goofing around.

618
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:36,410
I didn't know he had a friend he goofs around with.

619
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,380
Anyway, I'm very sorry.

620
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,440
No, no, Mr. Jeong.

621
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,320
I didn't invite you to criticize anyone—

622
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,620
No, Teacher. This will never happen again.

623
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:49,210
Let's have a look at this first.

624
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,220
   

625
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,480
Thankfully, the old lady Ram Woo helped

626
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,750
donated her life's savings to our school.

627
00:33:55,750 --> 00:33:58,230
So, we have a new scholarship

628
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,810
and it will go to Hee Wan who has outstanding grades.

629
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:03,830
Hee Wan didn't cause trouble?

630
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,480
She's getting a scholarship?

631
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,590
No, I'm sorry.

632
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,760
Ram Woo is getting it, not Hee Wan.

633
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,720
Of course.

634
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,320
- And I thought... 
 - What did you expect, Dad?

635
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,260
Hee Wan also helped the old lady.

636
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,030
She will be awarded a certificate by the Ministry of Education.

637
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,640
There was a bit of confusion,

638
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,500
but it's good for both of them.

639
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,630
They need to be praised.

640
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,220
Thank you.

641
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,850
Let's eat out for dinner.

642
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,660
You must be tired from being called to the teachers' office because of me.

643
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,160
Not at all. I want to eat out because I'm in a good mood.

644
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,540
What are you happy about?

645
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,740
That I'm getting a scholarship?

646
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,330
I'm happy about that, too,

647
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:48,080
but I got excited when I got the call.

648
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,120
I got a call from the school and they told me I'd have to come.

649
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,640
You never had a friend since we always moved,

650
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,270
but they said you caused trouble with a friend.

651
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,000
The thrill made my heart race.

652
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,570
Don't be silly.

653
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,480
I've been feeling good since April.

654
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,140
I feel like everything will go well.

655
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:13,050
Don't worry. I will do this...

656
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,020
We're going this way.

657
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,890
Our house is this way.

658
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,370
- We live in the same apartment complex. 
 - We live in the same apartment complex.

659
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,490
Same apartment...

660
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,930
We're neighbors, then.

661
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,920
Oh, I see.

662
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,570
What a pleasant surprise.

663
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,550
Okay, then.

664
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:38,940
Let's go.

665
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,510
By the way,

666
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,450
you're heading home so naturally.

667
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,670
Don't you have a night study session?

668
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,440
Come on.

669
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,660
We should spend some father-daughter time. It's been so long.

670
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,260
Look how sweet that is.

671
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,710
Pretend we're close, too.

672
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,500
Don't let them beat us.

673
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,870
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

674
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,510
- It's too awkward. 
 - No, no, no.

675
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,660
Let's go, Father.

676
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,640
I'm hungry.

677
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,490
- It looks like they're closed. 
 - I guess so.

678
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,090
We were going to have dinner, but they're closed.

679
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,080
They're open. You should eat and go.

680
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,910
Their tomato egg stir-fry is amazing.

681
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,490
You must be a regular.

682
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,290
No.

683
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,770
It's my specialty.

684
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,730
   

685
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,110
Hey.

686
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,450
Thank you.

687
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,140
About what?

688
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,550
The scholarship and...

689
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,200
You know...

690
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,750
Here. Help yourselves.

691
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:18,760
Eat all you want.

692
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,610
Tell me if you want anything more.

693
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,250
You can ask for anything off-menu, too.

694
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,430
Thank you for the meal.

695
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,870
I should be treating you, but here I am receiving a meal instead.

696
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,440
He's my precious daughter's friend.

697
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,910
I should be treating you.

698
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,540
Gosh, it's delicious.

699
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,800
How long have you been doing business here?

700
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,930
We've been here forever.

701
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,610
I've lived here since she was a kid.

702
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,690
If you have questions about the neighborhood,

703
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:54,530
call me anytime. 
    

704
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,970
I know everything about this neighborhood.

705
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,020
I'm sorry.

706
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,600
I got my nosiness from him.

707
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,790
I see.

708
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:05,320
You're outgoing, just like your father.

709
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,920
I'm so glad we decided to move here.

710
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,360
There's an amazing restaurant near home

711
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,310
and Ram Woo has a bubbly friend like Hee Wan.

712
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:21,700
I'm also honored to be meeting Lee Hyori

713
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,560
of Pungrim-dong, as well.

714
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,500
What?

715
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,170
Gosh, gosh. Are you okay?

716
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,740
Mom, try this. This one.

717
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,530
It's so tasty, isn't it?

718
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,370
Try it. Go on.

719
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,630
Should I?

720
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,650
Let's try it.

721
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,220
But Ram Woo and Hee Wan,

722
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,060
why did you decide to switch names, anyway?

723
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,690
I was curious about that, too.

724
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:54,850
 I was curious about that, too. 

725
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,800
Why are you doing that?

726
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,810
Kim Namoo.

727
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,040
Namoo? Ram Woo?

728
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,510
It's hard to pronounce, too.

729
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:04,540
It's just fun, you know.

730
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,490
It's not fun. It's just confusing.

731
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:08,530
I'm glad you haven't been sued yet.

732
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,310
Hey, how's this one?

733
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,010
- Do you think it'd fit me? 
 - That one?

734
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,700
You keep eating while talking. Come on.

735
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,270
Why are you eating so many sweets lately?

736
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,460
I can't just throw away the gifts.

737
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,150
Strangely, girls have been attracted to me lately.

738
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,190
What?

739
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:31,470
Am I the type that attracts girls?

740
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:34,270
They must be for Kim Ram Woo, not you.

741
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,600
- What? 
 - The chocolate you're eating.

742
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:38,450
Didn't someone leave it in the locker?

743
00:39:38,450 --> 00:39:40,800
The sweet corn last time too, right?

744
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,450
Yes, they were in the locker.

745
00:39:43,450 --> 00:39:46,130
Kim Ram Woo is pretty popular.

746
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,410
- So? 
 - Not you. The real Kim Ram Woo.

747
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:51,210
I thought he was shy, but he must be popular.

748
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,570
Someone got him sweet corn in early spring?

749
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:55,340
- That's love. 
 - Come on.

750
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:58,100
He's not popular at all.

751
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,190
Hey, what? Are you jealous?

752
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,350
What are you saying?

753
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:02,430
You're acting strange.

754
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,760
You switched names to insert yourself, too.

755
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,000
Do you like Kim Ram Woo?

756
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,060
Tae Kyung,

757
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,690
being that delusional means you're ill.

758
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,280
You need to see a doctor.

759
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,730
Okay.

760
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,110
Let's eat quickly to remove evidence.

761
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,900
Did you enjoy it?

762
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,680
 No. 

763
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,620
This is a poem I love very dearly.

764
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:47,240
Poet Hwang Ji Woo

765
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,950
wrote it after watching this film.

766
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,890
Could someone read it for us?

767
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,390
No one wants to, I'm sure.

768
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:57,650
How about the model student of our class,

769
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,610
Jeong Hee Wan?

770
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:10,180
You brought news by pushing your bicycle.

771
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:12,030
You're wiping your forehead.

772
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:14,370
What a shabby Hermes you are.

773
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:17,830
I told you to describe the beauty of this island.

774
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:22,220
 But you said the name of the one you love. 

775
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:27,470
When I forgot about you after I left the island,

776
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:32,330
you recorded the sound of stars using a mic.

777
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:46,070
 Did you want the stars to hear your beating heart? 

778
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,730
 You left the island because... 

779
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,750
Gosh! Geez!

780
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,640
Geez, seriously.

781
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:01,020
Shit.

782
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,210
Cocoa Ball is on Carrot. Don't you want it?

783
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:15,700
You've been talking about it lately.

784
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,100
It has too many calories.

785
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,530
Someone accidentally ordered 11 boxes

786
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:23,110
instead of one. They're selling it cheap.

787
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,960
So, I messaged them.

788
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,270
What? Let me see.

789
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,490
- Should I cancel it? 
 - Let me see.

790
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,460
Where are you meeting them?

791
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,980
At the recycling area in 10 minutes. 
    

792
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:43,060
What?

793
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,120
My lips are dry because it's dry in here.

794
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,260
I didn't say anything.

795
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,030
It's 9 p.m. on a weekday.

796
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:53,080
You should shower, watch a drama, and go to bed.

797
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,260
You're using an iron?

798
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,760
Wow, I can't believe this.

799
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,370
Hey, get out. Come on.

800
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,490
- Get out. Hang out in your room. 
 - What is it?

801
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:03,430
Get out. Get out. Get out. Get out.

802
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:06,370
Hang out in your room. Get out! Get out!

803
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,960
Shit. It's not dry.

804
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,400
Seriously. Shit.

805
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,230
 Your list of beautiful things on this island. 

806
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,530
 Your father's ocean of sorrow 

807
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,970
 is the last on the list. 

808
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,130
 We see it with a wide shot and a long take. 

809
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:42,030
 Until the end credits finished rolling, 

810
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:44,740
 I was sitting on the chair with my head down. 

811
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,540
 Excuse me. 

812
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,830
Are you the buyer?

813
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,090
   

814
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:02,290
 Certain remorse 

815
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,290
makes me wonder if I'm a perpetrator, too.

816
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,300
After I left the cinema,

817
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,280
I kept walking aimlessly.

818
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,210
 Hey, Kim Ram Woo. 

819
00:44:16,330 --> 00:44:18,280
Hey.

820
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,730
Why is your dress all wet?

821
00:44:21,730 --> 00:44:25,020
Well, I...

822
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,750
Hey, this is blood.

823
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,330
Yes, I bled.

824
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,320
Are you okay?

825
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,660
Yes, I'm okay.

826
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:35,640
♫  It feels like you're coming to me by chance  ♫

827
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:39,210
♫  I can smell the scent of spring  ♫ 
 ♫  It seems you're coming along with it  ♫

828
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:42,470
Whistling the loneliest tune in the world,

829
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:46,070
the train that left Sinchon Station headed to Munsan.

830
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:50,150
I wanted to stand on a beach for a long time, too.

831
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,650
   

832
00:44:53,650 --> 00:44:59,430
♫  I remember the springs of days gone by  ♫

833
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:04,120
    
 ♫  In the whirlwind of time rushing past  ♫

834
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,910
♫  You suddenly appear again  ♫

835
00:45:06,910 --> 00:45:12,970
♫  Your scent that woke me now makes my heart flutter  ♫

837
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,960
You should open the windows.

838
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:30,670
What's all this suddenly?

839
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:33,630
I need to air the room out.

840
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,790
It feels a bit stuffy in here.

841
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:38,620
No, that's not what I'm asking.

842
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,520
Have you been well?

843
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,850
 Spring is the hardest. 

844
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:49,740
Didn't you miss me all this time?

845
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,470
How many years has it been?

846
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,250
We didn't get to meet on graduation day.

847
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,060
Has it been four years, then?

848
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:59,270
I noticed it was April Fools' Day today.

849
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,610
 April is the worst of the worst. 

850
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:04,920
We have so much to talk about April Fools' Day.

851
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,230
Right, Kim Ram Woo?

852
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,630
 Let me clarify once more just in case. 

853
00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:11,360
 He is Kim Ram Woo and I'm Jeong Hee Wan. 

854
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,960
Much to talk about?

855
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,060
We do have much to talk about.

856
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,050
 What should I say first to this jerk 

857
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,320
 who suddenly appeared? 

858
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,980
 That I'm happy to see him? 

859
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:26,370
 Ask how has he been? 

860
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,710
 Tell him I once liked him very much? 

861
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:34,510
 Or that my big toe still aches when it rains? 

862
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:35,800
 If not that... 

863
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,300
But you died.

864
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,490
Four years ago.

865
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:50,090
♫  Take my hand  ♫

866
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:54,520
♫  I'm here to stay  ♫

867
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,830
♫  I'll circle your path  ♫

868
00:46:59,830 --> 00:47:05,660
♫  Never letting you go  ♫

869
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:08,060
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

870
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,250
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

871
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,700
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

872
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,280
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

873
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:29,950
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫
