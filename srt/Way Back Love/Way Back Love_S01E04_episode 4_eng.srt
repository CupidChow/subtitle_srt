8
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,770
I can't...

9
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,470
forgive myself since that night.

10
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,130
But since you're in front of me right now,

11
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,310
I keep thinking you're actually alive.

12
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,260
I feel so pathetic for thinking that.

13
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,450
The memories from the past are hard enough,

14
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,610
so I can't do this with you.

15
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,410
I want to stop.

16
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,420
- Ram Woo. 
 - Please stop calling me that!

17
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,720
 Jeong Hee Wan! He's in there... 

18
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,390
 You can't go in. 

19
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,120
 My friend is still in there. 

20
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,380
 Move quickly! 

21
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,770
 Jeong Hee Wan! 

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,270
 Jeong Hee Wan! 

23
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,280
 He's still in there... 

24
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,040
 Ram Woo! 

25
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:02,820
 Jeong Hee Wan! Jeong Hee Wan! 

26
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,070
   

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,810
You want to draw posters when you're hardly even here?

28
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:30,060
You need to change it up each season

29
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,890
so the customers know we care about the interior.

30
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,770
Why are you making one

31
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,610
for each season and even for Christmas now?

32
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,870
Well, because...

33
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,470
it's easy to do all of it at once.

34
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,480
How's the business? Going well?

35
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,420
Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't.

36
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,050
How about you?

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,100
How are you doing in Seoul?

38
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,770
I'm fine.

39
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,750
You call all the time. Why do you ask?

40
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:59,830
You never answer calls in time.

41
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:03,370
You answer maybe one out of every 20.

42
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,610
So... why did you start drinking again?

43
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,840
Can't you sleep? Do you still have strange dreams?

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,110
It's not like that.

45
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,760
I was drinking while hanging out with school friends.

46
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,640
Really?

47
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,400
Which school friend? Do I know any of them?

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,540
How would you know?

49
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,750
Seriously...

50
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,930
I got scallions.

51
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,860
You're back.

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,870
You have to go to work without eating because of me.

53
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,180
Work?

54
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,020
- What work? 
 - She has a job.

55
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,490
She's saving up with friends to go

56
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,990
freediving or whatever in Cebu.

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,310
I told you not to tell her.

58
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:43,510
I already got the plane tickets.

59
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,280
I'll go now.

60
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,890
Hey.

61
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,100
- What? 
 - It's dangerous.

62
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
- Cancel it. 
 - What do you want me to do?

63
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,380
Do nothing?

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:57,750
Should I stop seeing friends and stay in my room like you,

65
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,030
- staring at the ceiling all depressed? 
 - What?

66
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,330
Come on, Hee Joo. Go.

67
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,560
I don't want to.

68
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,730
Yes, I can get into an accident on a trip.

69
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:09,390
I might die from it.

70
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,030
But is that the only way you die?

71
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:13,760
I could get hit by a car as I leave here,

72
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,290
or something could fall on me and kill me.

73
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:18,940
People can even die while drinking water.

74
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,830
I could die anytime. I'll do whatever I want,

75
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,950
so you should finally start living, too.

76
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:28,320
Ignore her, Hee Wan.

77
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,370
Hee Wan.

78
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,660
- Excuse me. 
 - You scared me.

79
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,400
I've been watching you from back there.

80
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,060
You look so sad.

81
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,780
People tell you that often, right?

82
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,510
Goodness, the negative energy is...

83
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,540
pushing you right here.

84
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,040
Your shoulders and the corners of your lips droop,

85
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,450
and it makes you look ugly, right?

86
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,940
I know a good place. Come with me.

87
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,210
Excuse me.

88
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,400
Because of what happened last time and everything,

89
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,180
I was going to ignore you,

90
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,210
but it's too upsetting just to pass by.

91
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,440
You look so sad right now.

92
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,730
Your energy feels off.

93
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:29,760
You hear that often, don't you?

94
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,310
I know what people like you need.

95
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,940
I know an amazing place nearby.

96
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,970
Let's go.

97
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,420
Where are we going?

98
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,850
Let's go.

99
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,750
Where are we going?

100
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,270
Come here. Just trust me.

101
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,320
Let's go.

102
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,860
There's a place I know.

103
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,020
It's really nice there.

104
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,950
You'd increase your energy level like this.

105
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,940
Is it locked?

106
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,800
Hey, it's open here.

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,580
Really?

108
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,890
What are you doing? Hurry!

109
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:57,790
What do you think?

110
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,380
Only Tae Kyung and I know this spot.

111
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,350
But...

112
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:13,340
it must say "Do not enter" for a reason.

113
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,410
Maybe there's a ghost here

114
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,450
or they found carcinogenic substances.

115
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,120
I'm not good at stuff like this.

116
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,370
Just do it. You don't have to be good.

117
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,040
Just paint like this without thinking.

118
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:43,810
Brush, brush, brush.

119
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:45,740
Brush, brush, brush.

120
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,350
You know,

121
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,960
we have a guest at home once in a while.

122
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,650
Guest?

123
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:06,790
Is that not the right word?

124
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,030
Well, I'm not exactly happy to see her.

125
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:13,900
She's my so-called dad's wife.

126
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,150
I'm not sure what to call her.

127
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,830
Anyway, she...

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,770
often leaves money at our house.

129
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,390
She's probably

130
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:32,990
paying us so I live like I don't exist.

131
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,960
But I was always curious.

132
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,570
Why does this so-called father never come?

133
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,620
Isn't he curious about me?

134
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,360
Do you want to see him?

135
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,710
I'm not sure.

136
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,160
I don't really know how I feel either.

137
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,990
I've been thinking about this since I was little,

138
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,210
but I still don't know.

139
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:12,010
I'm like that too.

140
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:17,980
My mom passed away when I was four.

141
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,950
The day I started elementary school,

142
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,330
my dad was crying alone among smiling people.

143
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,800
So I asked him why he was crying.

144
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,150
He said, "Mom really wanted to come here."

145
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,080
He cried because he missed her so much.

146
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,930
I was too young

147
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:43,300
and didn't remember much of her,

148
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,850
but I cried with him

149
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,200
and said I missed her.

150
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,590
Honestly, I still don't know if I truly miss her

151
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,980
or if I'm supposed to miss her.

152
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,890
You're splattering, I said.

153
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,050
Stop it.

154
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,690
Be careful.

155
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,310
Can't you stamp?

156
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:34,700
- Stamp? 
 - Yes, stamp.

157
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,940
Could you do it over there?

158
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,040
Could you do it over there?

159
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,700
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

160
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,000
It's like the night sky.

161
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,900
I know.

162
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,740
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

163
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,130
A shooting star.

164
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:14,300
This makes it a shooting star.

165
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,500
If you do this,

166
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,310
it's like Saturn.

167
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,560
What?

168
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,840
You came.

169
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,910
What is Jeong Hee Wan doing here?

170
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,050
He was feeling lost in front of his house,

171
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,850
so I lifted his mood.

172
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:49,430
This is our secret spot, though.

173
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:51,790
You did that without telling me?

174
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:53,370
Oh, right.

175
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:57,030
Why don't you answer my message?

176
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,390
- We need to make a reservation... 
 - Right, this weekend.

177
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:01,830
Goodness, I forgot.

178
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,030
I'm checking out a place with Dad in Seoul. Sorry.

179
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,300
Dad suddenly said he was free only that day.

180
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:13,930
Does our plan not mean anything?

181
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:15,670
Why would you say that?

182
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,070
I'm sorry.

183
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,370
I've been all over the place because of college. Seriously...

184
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,110
Okay.

185
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,940
You don't have to explain if you're busy.

186
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,060
You're busy hanging out with your new best friend anyway.

187
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,000
It was annoying always listening to you talk about college.

188
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,990
- Tae Kyung, it's not that—  
 - Annoyed?

189
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,100
That's going too far.

190
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,390
Looks like you two are connecting.

191
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,620
- Have fun, then. 
 - Hey.

192
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:53,690
How can you be like this? What's the deal?

193
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,960
Geez.

194
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,830
- Daebak. 
 - What?

195
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,170
It's still here.

196
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,180
How's Tae Kyung, by the way?

197
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,110
Tae Kyung?

198
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,700
Well...

199
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,350
I don't really know.

200
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:29,280
What do you mean? Did you fight again?

201
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,860
She's probably not in Korea.

202
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,110
How about Hong Seok, then?

203
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:39,540
We never kept in touch.

204
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,600
The only high school friend you have left

205
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,600
is this Grim Reaper? Isn't that too extreme?

206
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,900
 The door is open. 

207
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,530
I think...

208
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:57,240
I need to see Hong Seok.

209
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,600
I miss him.

210
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,120
I miss Hong Seok.

211
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,620
- So, I think I should meet him. 
 - What is he doing?

212
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,270
What are you doing?

213
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,120
Okay.

214
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,620
Let's see. Let's see. Let's see.

215
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:23,230
Where could Hong Seok be?

216
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,310
Here. 
    

217
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,210
I'll meet Hong Seok and...

218
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,840
   

219
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,160
Want to die?

220
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,210
Play a board game. I'll do that first.

221
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,060
Geez.

222
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:46,140
You're out of your mind.

223
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,130
He probably deleted my number.

224
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,830
No, he didn't. 
    

225
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,050
Hey...

226
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:01,000
 Hello? 

227
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,160
- Well... 
  - What's going on? 

228
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,730
 I'm working. 

229
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,450
 I'll hang up. 

230
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,880
Happy now?

231
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,090
I see.

232
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,550
Meet my friend, Lee Hong Seok.

233
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,970
Hey, you can't do that—

234
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,840
You can't worry about that right now.

235
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,800
What matters is

236
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,030
how you'll get out of here.

237
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:40,040
I'll open it if you agree to meet Hong Seok.

238
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,730
 Will you stay in there? 

239
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:46,530
Fine. Open it now.

240
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,070
   

241
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,000
   

242
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,770
   

243
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,900
Thank you.

244
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,370
Buddy, what matters is

245
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,260
we can't defend either of them.

246
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,870
That'd be like crossing a river forever.

247
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,960
I feel bad. I'm partly responsible for this.

248
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,250
I think...

249
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,050
we need to get away from school

250
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,000
since they fought here.

251
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,970
It sounds like you want to go on a trip.

252
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,730
- A graduation trip? 
 - Yes.

253
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,080
How about we all go together?

254
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,150
Hong Seok, too?

255
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,390
Yes. Tae Kyung is going as well.

256
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:41,010
Forget it. Go without me.

257
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:43,070
I'm sorry...

258
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,120
but I no longer want to do things with her.

259
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,530
I know.

260
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:52,410
This might be our last trip as a group.

261
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,720
"Our" trip?

262
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,390
What's the reason for this trip?

263
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,510
It's Mamidang.

264
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,720
Mamidang? You mean the bakery?

265
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,340
They're closing next week for a year.

266
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,980
What? Why?

267
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,750
It's that old man baker's...

268
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,630
sabbatical year.

269
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,040
There's no time, let's think about it.

270
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,720
Let's go.

271
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,220
I'll think about it.

272
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,120
It's too shiny.

273
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,570
Isn't it a trash bag?

274
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,900
What are you doing?

275
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,630
What are you doing? What are you wearing?

276
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:47,240
Doesn't this look expensive?

277
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:50,180
Hey, stop. Don't touch. What are you doing?

278
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,550
Let's go. It's time.

279
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,440
- Let's go, guys. 
 - Check it out.

280
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,200
This must be...

281
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,570
making you really sweaty.

282
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:01,770
It gets so hot in here.

283
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:09,490
Hold on. My phone. My phone...

284
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,450
Where did you put it?

285
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,020
Geez. Hey!

286
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,650
It's fish. It's fish. It's fish!

287
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,770
Where?

288
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:33,350
- Stay here! 
 - Over there. It's right there.

289
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,300
Wow, it's true!

290
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,830
Where? Where?

291
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,260
Where?

292
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,830
Gosh, the line is already so long.

293
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:52,690
Who insisted it was that way?

294
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:57,280
I'll go to the right. You go to the left.

295
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
Here's what you need to get.

296
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,360
The myeongran baguette, choco crumble, and cream cheese croquette.

297
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,530
But the cream cheese croquette is likely sold out.

298
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:06,330
You need to get the salt croissant instead. And...

299
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,460
- Won't you write it down? 
 - Won't you write it down?

300
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,510
I already know. They're so famous.

301
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,940
Sorry. Please say it again.

302
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:13,700
- Are you kidding? 
 - Are you kidding?

303
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,020
- Seriously. 
 - You're getting in the way. Get out.

304
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,510
Just carry our bags instead.

305
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,400
- Myeongranjeot. Myeongranjeot... 
 - Hold our bags.

306
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,930
- Leave, leave. 
 - Myeongran baguette. Myeongran baguette.

307
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:24,570
- Quiet. Just leave. Go. 
 - Myeongran...

308
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:27,100
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,680
This would make a great photo.

310
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,530
   

311
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:42,660
 I don't think I've ever seen one. 

312
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,210
 It'd be... 

313
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:49,690
 so romantic to see it together. 

314
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,300
   

315
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,350
   

316
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:07,150
 Congratulations on opening a studio! 

317
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,180
It's so nice.

318
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,860
It's way nicer than I expected.

319
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,400
I know.

320
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,220
- Hey. 
  - Mom, did a lot of people come? 

321
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,810
Yes, a lot of people came.

322
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:19,680
The thing is, it turns out there's a meteor shower festival nearby.

323
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,700
Really?

324
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,280
Yes.

325
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,880
So you know the opening party...

326
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,300
Are you ditching me for Hee Wan?

327
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,060
No, i-it's not that.

328
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,440
I'm just curious.

329
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,910
Two hundred meteors fall per hour.

330
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,190
Tell them to have fun all they want.

331
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,760
 Ram Woo, I saved cake for you. 

332
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,810
Come to the table.

333
00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:45,590
Yes, we can have another party.

334
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,770
Have fun.

335
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,710
 - Okay?  
 - Okay.

336
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,110
Hey.

337
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,340
♫  Everything's a glow  ♫

338
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,550
♫  Our eternal memories in time  ♫

339
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:10,000
♫  Everything's so bright and  ♫

340
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,710
♫  I know, oh oh oh  ♫

341
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,320
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

342
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,130
   

343
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,800
   

344
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,770
Did it work? I think it did.

345
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,920
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

346
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,830
♫  My, my  ♫

347
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:35,600
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

348
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,900
This one.

349
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,910
Sorry.

350
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,570
I guess I was serious about it.

351
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:07,620
I thought we'd always be together,

352
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,460
but I'm the only one not going to college.

353
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,330
Thinking of being left behind

354
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,810
made me feel helpless.

355
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,290
I'm serious, too.

356
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,320
So...

357
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,420
whatever we do in the future,

358
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,380
we'll stay together.

359
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,780
We come as a set.

360
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:35,540
Do you mean it?

361
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,230
   

362
00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:42,600
   

363
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,930
If you write a letter,

364
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,800
we'll mail it when the next shower comes.

365
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:50,480
- No, I'm okay. 
 - No need to pay for postage.

366
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:56,780
- Who is it? 
 - My mom.

367
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,920
Why won't you answer?

368
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,440
I don't know. She wants me to retake the exam.

369
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,840
Coming this far is the best I can do.

370
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,170
I'm satisfied with it.

371
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,140
I don't need to go to a good college.

372
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,950
I can be satisfied and have a fun life,

373
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:13,530
even if no one believes me.

374
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,690
What's your address?

375
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,890
I'll write one.

376
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,100
Thank you.

377
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,870
Are you writing me? Why?

378
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,760
Because I want to.

379
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,420
Why are you making my heart flutter?

380
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,740
Just tell me your address.

381
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,110
But you have something more important to tell me.

382
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,250
What?

383
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:40,610
The stars. Include the stars.

384
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,180
The stars...

385
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,190
You're right. I like Kim Ram Woo...

386
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:54,800
I mean, Jeong Hee Wan.

387
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,060
When were you planning to tell me?

388
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,890
Since when did you know?

389
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,650
Me?

390
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,910
After I confessed my love to her

391
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,320
and got rejected brutally.

392
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,940
But I noticed today that

393
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,890
Hee Wan is always looking at you,

394
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:15,420
and you're always looking at her.

395
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,110
Maybe I noticed it, too.

396
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:20,290
Is that why I wanted to ignore it even more?

397
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:22,520
Anyway, I'm trying to tell you

398
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,340
not to worry about me and do what you want,

399
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,570
but don't expect me to cheer for you.

400
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,870
Don't get too comfortable, either.

401
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,770
I really don't have anything to say to Hong Seok.

402
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:47,770
- What should I do? 
 - I have a lot to catch up on with him.

403
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:50,540
You can tell him for me.

404
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,120
He saw you.

405
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
Hi.

406
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,170
Gosh, it's so awkward.

407
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,200
What's with you two?

408
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,810
What? Why...

409
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:18,000
What's wrong?

410
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,540
Hey, what are you doing?

411
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,220
He's doing nothing right now.

412
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:27,610
You act so busy.

413
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:30,260
Can I ask why you came?

414
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,200
I need to get going soon.

415
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:35,370
- Well... 
 - Wow, he's acting so tough.

416
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,770
I came because...

417
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:42,360
well... I have something to tell you.

418
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,310
What I want to say is...

419
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,990
I have something to tell you, but the thing is...

420
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:52,500
Do you show your left profile

421
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,800
- because that's your flattering side— 
 - What?

422
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:00,340
Well, no...

423
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,040
Do you still think your feet smell is addictive?

424
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,500
Stop it.

425
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,260
What?

426
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,900
I'm not talking about your feet.

427
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,840
I have a lot on my mind,

428
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,800
so I'll stop thinking.

429
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,230
Okay. Just ask him about your relationship.

430
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,300
You've been well, right?

431
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,700
Did you return from the military safely?

432
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,050
He did.

433
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:37,250
Are you working here now?

434
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:40,720
Hey... 
    

435
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,600
What book is that? Are you studying?

436
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,840
I'm just preparing for an exam.

437
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,230
Wow, you're taking an exam?

438
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,860
An exam? What exam?

439
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,160
I'm sorry,

440
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:58,260
but I'm not sure what you're trying to do.

441
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,940
Honestly, I'm baffled and dumbfounded.

442
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:03,020
Being with you like this is uncomfortable for me.

443
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,240
You have nothing else to say, right?

444
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,630
- Well... 
 - Please leave, Hee Wan.

445
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,960
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

446
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,770
Kim Ram Woo.

447
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:23,750
What's wrong with him?

448
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,620
I'm sorry, but you do this alone.

449
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,790
You can. He's your friend, not mine.

450
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,100
Hey, hold on. Please?

451
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:35,130
Forget about me. How about you?

452
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,280
Is this okay with you?

453
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,460
Don't you have anything to say to him?

454
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,230
I'll leave the room if you can't talk because of me.

455
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:41,780
What's the point now?

456
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,150
You're doing this for a reason.

457
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,780
Could this be your last moment with him? Is that okay?

458
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,480
Jeong Hee Wan.

459
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,650
The board game. Did you touch it?

460
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,740
What?

461
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,590
Well...

462
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,840
- the thing is... 
 - Be honest.

463
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,080
Why did you come?

464
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,230
What do you mean?

465
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:09,910
Is it because of Ram Woo?

466
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,720
Is it Kim Ram Woo again?

467
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,470
- Hee Wan! 
 - Kim Ram Woo!

468
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,780
Are you okay?

469
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,530
- Sit comfortably. 
 - What can I do?

470
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:46,690
Breathe slowly. It's okay, it's okay.

471
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:48,970
Hand me a bag. A bag!

472
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,540
It's nothing. It's not a big deal.

473
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,210
Here.

474
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:55,390
Are you okay?

475
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:56,950
Breathe slowly.

476
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:00,110
Here's the bag. Breathe in it.

477
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,830
It's not a big deal. It's okay.

478
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,080
It's okay.

479
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,670
Take your time. Take your time.

480
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,720
It's okay. Two...

481
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,600
One...

482
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,240
two...

483
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:21,640
She's okay now. Thank you.

484
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,400
It's not coming anymore.

485
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,700
- What? 
 - The ambulance isn't coming.

486
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,570
Be careful.

487
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,720
How embarrassing...

488
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,310
I suddenly showed up and did this. I'm sorry.

489
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,170
It's okay.

490
00:29:57,170 --> 00:30:01,480
I'm sorry I suddenly cornered you like that.

491
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:04,050
Should we walk a bit?

492
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,010
I just...

493
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,880
can't seem to do it.

494
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,610
Pretending nothing happened.

495
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,610
I'm different from you,

496
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:23,750
and considering what I did,

497
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,880
I guess I couldn't accept it.

498
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,490
How did everyone get okay so quickly?

499
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:37,150
To be honest, I was jealous of you too.

500
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,080
You were jealous.

501
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:53,700
You know, I didn't want to say this,

502
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,030
- but why do you think only you suffer? 
 - What?

503
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,030
I really didn't want to answer when you called earlier.

504
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,510
I was afraid something happened again.

505
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,680
You know how that feels.

506
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,280
We imagine the worst when we hear about an accident in the news,

507
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:11,280
afraid it's someone we know.

508
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,810
You know, too.

509
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:18,650
But why do you... think only you feel that way?

510
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:20,490
Whenever you suffer because of Ram Woo,

511
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:23,950
I change the subject as if it isn't a big deal.

512
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,570
Do you think that was easy?

513
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,930
Do you think I meant to?

514
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:37,210
Asking you to stop talking about Kim Ram Woo...

515
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:39,540
Have you ever imagined

516
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,870
how I must have felt saying that,

517
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,860
even once?

518
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,770
I was there too, Hee Wan.

519
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:03,040
We're watching the shooting stars together.

520
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:12,060
- You're hungry, right? 
  - Oh, yes! 

521
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:14,430
It's food. Thanks.

522
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,190
There's a countdown at 8 o'clock.

523
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,450
Really?

524
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,970
- Wow, I think I saw one. 
 - Where?

525
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,190
- Where? Where? 
 - There.

526
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,380
- Where? 
 - Over there.

527
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,330
Where? Where?

528
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,750
   

529
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,400
It disappeared.

530
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,890
It's crunchy. This one is tasty.

531
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:33,610
What is it? Where did you get it?

532
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:35,590
It's so tasty.

533
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,240
Hello?

534
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,210
Yes, this is Jeong Hee Wan.

535
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,650
We need to keep watching, you never know.

536
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,640
Really?

537
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,960
   

538
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,890
   

539
00:32:55,830 --> 00:33:00,540
   

540
00:33:05,670 --> 00:33:07,460
What?

541
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,640
Where are we going?

542
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,450
It's starting soon.

543
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,590
Congratulations, Jeong Hee Wan.

544
00:33:16,590 --> 00:33:18,140
You know the observatory event?

545
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:20,320
I won. I just got a call.

546
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,300
Wow, that's...

547
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,070
Why are you congratulating me, then?

548
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:27,880
You said you've never seen a shooting star.

549
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,450
It's my gift to you.

550
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:33,800
It's your last chance to be called Jeong Hee Wan.

551
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,470
You know,

552
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:39,690
I got into my dream college

553
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,900
and I made up with Tae Kyung.

554
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:45,150
I'm on a trip with my favorite friends, too.

555
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,230
I achieved everything possible,

556
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,810
so I'm extremely happy right now.

557
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,820
And...

558
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:56,220
I...

559
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,300
I want you to be happy today

560
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,050
because you are Kim Ram Woo, who is also called Jeong Hee Wan.

561
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:13,770
Want to come with me?

562
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,790
Come with me. I need to tell you something.

563
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,610
- Tell me something? 
 - Yes.

564
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,450
I want to tell you today.

565
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:30,010
It's okay. Go without me this time.

566
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,700
Here. Read it on the way, okay?

567
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:35,520
Read it alone, so...

568
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,570
You'll be watching the stars at the observatory later.

569
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,020
Read it then, okay?

570
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:43,890
You'd be in a good mood then. Read then.

571
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,360
Bye.

572
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,090
Kim Ram Woo.

573
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:03,830
Switching names with you was so troublesome,

574
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:07,600
but it was the most fun thing I did in high school.

575
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,260
Later,

576
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,980
do you want to sit together when we go home?

577
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,440
Okay.

578
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:30,600
Okay.

579
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,430
♫  It feels like you're coming to me by chance  ♫

580
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,520
♫  I can smell the scent of spring  ♫

581
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,900
♫  It seems you're coming along with it  ♫

582
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:55,110
♫  From far away, your scent drifts in  ♫

583
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,620
Hello. What's your name?

584
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,790
Jeong Hee Wan.

585
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,830
Confirmed.

586
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:03,380
Hello. What's your name?

587
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:09,040
♫  I remember the springs of days gone by  ♫

588
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,370
♫  In the whirlwind of time rushing past  ♫

589
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,600
- Why are you coming alone? 
 - You look so happy.

590
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,770
I'm not. I'm not.

591
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,640
♫  I drag my tired body and cross this street  ♫

592
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,990
 To Kim Ram Woo who's called Jung Hee Wan. 

593
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:33,790
 You know I'm good at writing letters at least. 

594
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,550
 But it's taking me forever to write this one. 

595
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:42,790
 Because I'm writing as sincerely as possible. 

596
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,150
 I have a confession to make. 

597
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,710
 I hate my name. 

598
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:49,540
 It's too ordinary. 

599
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,130
 But Kim Ram Woo, 

600
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,180
 your name feels different each time I say it. 

601
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,730
 And I like my ordinary name now, too. 

602
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,630
 Because you took on that name. 

603
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:06,140
 What more can I say than that? 

604
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,890
 Kim Ram Woo, 

605
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,700
 I like you very much. 

606
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,150
 I'm not sure since when. 

607
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:17,410
 I wonder if you know. 

608
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:22,920
 I'm curious how you feel. 

609
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,790
 What do you think of me? 

610
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:29,300
Gosh, so bright.

611
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,920
 Breaking news. 

612
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,080
 At the Byeolmaru Campsite's 

613
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,780
 observatory in Jinsung-gun, 

614
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,910
 - a gas explosion occurred.  
 - Isn't it so nice?

615
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:51,160
 - Let's visit the scene. 
 - Breaking news. 

616
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,530
 I'm at the gas explosion site 

617
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:54,940
 at the Byeolmaru Campsite observatory. 

618
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:58,050
 There were two explosions about 40 minutes ago. 

619
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,570
 The building caved in, and chaos ensued. 

620
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,420
 Follow closely! 

621
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:13,640
 We need more help at the scene. 

622
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,350
 It's dangerous. Step back! 

623
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,420
Just one second. Just one second.

624
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:26,970
 Move quickly! 

625
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:29,810
 Are you okay? Are you okay? 

626
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,140
Jeong Hee Wan! Jeong Hee Wan!

627
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:36,830
Ram Woo! Ram Woo! Kim Ram Woo!

628
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,650
Ram Woo!

629
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,150
Ram Woo! Kim Ram Woo!

630
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,260
Jeong Hee Wan!

631
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,080
Ram Woo!

632
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,940
Ram Woo!

633
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:49,420
I need to go save him!

634
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,070
My friend is in there!

635
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,330
Ram Woo!

636
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,380
Jeong Hee Wan! Jeong Hee Wan!

637
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:56,950
Kim Ram Woo!

638
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:59,680
Jeong Hee Wan! Ram Woo!

639
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,850
 Kim Ram Woo! Jeong Hee Wan! 

640
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,930
You didn't like me.

641
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:13,020
You were with me because you missed Ram Woo.

642
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,890
I know that.

643
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:17,630
- Hong Seok— 
 - But I was serious.

644
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:20,550
I guess I wanted us to feel better together.

645
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,970
I thought you'd get better

646
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:29,970
if you pretended to feel better.

647
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,620
That's what I wanted to believe.

648
00:39:35,390 --> 00:39:38,770
Maybe that's why I changed the subject by looking happy.

649
00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:45,360
I still can't get used to the siren either.

650
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:48,670
That's why...

651
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,790
I want a job that doesn't require me to get used to it.

652
00:39:55,210 --> 00:39:58,600
I'm actually preparing for the firefighter exam.

653
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,580
Firefighter?

654
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:03,630
Whether it's the siren or whatever,

655
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:07,030
I'll just keep getting startled by it.

656
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,660
You're allowed to with that job.

657
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,290
I have to.

658
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,740
I guess I didn't want to admit it either.

659
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:22,250
That I'm actually hurting, too.

660
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,120
I also...

661
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:34,020
struggle with the fact that

662
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,650
I left Ram Woo there alone.

663
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:41,160
But I was hoping you'd ask me once, Hee Wan,

664
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,150
if I was okay...

665
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,910
and if I was having a hard time.

666
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:54,190
♫    ♫

667
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:01,760
♫    ♫

668
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,960
I thought you wanted to forget about him.

669
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:10,960
How could I forget him?

670
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,900
He was such a good friend.

671
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:26,030
♫  My stars have gone away  ♫

672
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:31,670
♫  Oh, my love is far away  ♫

673
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:40,190
♫  Even if it disappears far away  ♫

674
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,560
♫  I couldn't leave behind  ♫

675
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,380
Hong Seok.

676
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,000
I plan to forget everything and live a good life.

677
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I won't have time to call you, and I plan to live a totally happy life.

678
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:03,250
Don't feel sad about not hearing from me, and have a nice life.

679
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:08,450
And I'm sorry...

680
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,730
that I was mean to you.

681
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,240
I'm sorry I was so selfish

682
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:24,490
♫  My name is calling you ♫

683
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:26,950
Make sure not to skip meals.

684
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,590
Don't be on the news.

685
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:33,220
Okay, I won't be on the news.

686
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,430
I'm leaving.

687
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:42,230
♫  I'll let you go now  ♫

688

♫  We were so bright and happy  ♫

691
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:11,170
♫  In our only time together  ♫

692
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:16,430
♫  Our beautiful days  ♫

693
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,080
♫  Your name  ♫

694

♫  My stars have gone away  ♫

695
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:31,160
Do you expect too much just because people call you handsome?

696
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,140
You're not that handsome. You still look the same.

697
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,920
This is where we stopped.

698
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,400
We planned to continue after the trip.

699
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,140
I still feel angry about it.

700
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:42,910
I was about to win.

701
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:44,980
You agree, right?

702
00:43:47,590 --> 00:43:49,190
 Your fly is down. 

703
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,180
 It's been down since you were punching. 

704
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,310
Wherever you are and whatever you do,

705
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:58,190
have an amazingly fun life.

706
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,010

 Come with me. I need to tell you something. 

710
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,070
 Okay. 

711
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:31,600
 If I didn't let Ram Woo go alone then... 

712
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,090
 - Wow, I think I saw one. 
 - Where? Where? 

713
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,720
 - Over there. 
 - Really? Where? 

714
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,970
 Over there. Over there. 

715
00:44:39,970 --> 00:44:41,400
 Over there. 

716
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,890
 If I didn't answer because I didn't recognize the number... 

717
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,010
   

718
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:50,310
 If I weren't so silly and fell for 

719
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,640
 the pink night sky then... 

720
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:57,660
I'm home.

721
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,770
Hey, you're back. Sit.

722
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,890
This is great.

723
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,760
 If we didn't go on a trip... 

724
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:10,030
 Hey, Kim Ram Woo. 

725
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,160
♫  If you  ♫

726
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,400
 If I didn't like Kim Ram Woo... 

727
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:26,930
 If we didn't become friends at all... 

728
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,310
   

729
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:35,440
 If we didn't do the silly name switching... 

730
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,220
 If then... 

731
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,950
Jeong Hee Wan...

732
00:45:39,950 --> 00:45:41,550
