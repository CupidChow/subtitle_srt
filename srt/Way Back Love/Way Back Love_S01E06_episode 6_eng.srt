00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,330
All the stars are gone.

10
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,140
They were pretty.

11
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,220
They aren't.

12
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,400
What do you mean?

13
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,960
They aren't gone.

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,830
You don't see them because it's bright, but they're all there.

15
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,150
Try imagining it.

16
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,960
You can see them, right?

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,450
There's only one day left.

18
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,370
What's this?

19
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,780
I'll try everything I can.

20
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,650
"Discount Pilates. 250,000 won for 8 classes"?

21
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,640
Are you planning to die while doing Pilates?

22
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,060
   

23
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,450
It's my bucket list.

24
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,050
   

25
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,380
 I wasted most of the week, 

26
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,020
 but I have a day to say goodbye to this world. 
   

27
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:04,240
I'll give it a try before it's too late.

28
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,180
Saying goodbye.

29
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,510
Are you shopping to gift your father?

30
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,910
- Yes. 
 - If so,

31
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,890
a black one like this is nice and practical.

32
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:26,700
He must have a lot of weddings and funerals to attend at his age.

33
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:29,650
Would you like something brighter instead?

34
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,980
No, I'll take this.

35
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,020
Okay. I'll prepare it for you.

36
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,100
What would be good?

37
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,960
Well...

38
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,170
   

39
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,590
   

40
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:54,060
For people who are starting snorkeling or scuba,

41
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,660
I recommend short fins since they're easier

42
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,570
on your ankles when you do underwater kicks.

43
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:13,280
I must never cry.

44
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
You can do it, okay?

45
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,490
Good luck.

46
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,550
I'll be right back.

47
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,990
Dad!

48
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,260
Hee Joo, I'm back!

49
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,180
Ta-da! Look at this.

50
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,400
It's a surprise gift.

51
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,380
Don't worry. I got my time deposit.

52
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,480
I hear a lot of designers use this these days.

53
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,230
- Let's unbox. 
 - Hurry.

54
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,520
- No, no. Don't tear it open! Don't! 
 - Hurry, hurry.

55
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,960
Why not? Let's see what it looks like.

56
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,670
I hope you can get a refund.

57
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,650
I'm making you use the laptop I got you when

58
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:56,840
you started school. I felt bad about it.

59
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,490
But you're graduating soon. So, I'm being generous.

60
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,900
But I'm really okay.

61
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,010
What do you mean, you're okay?

62
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:06,290
I called you last time and you were crying.

63
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,280
So, I asked you why and you blamed it on the crappy laptop.

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,800
- You said you lost all of your homework. 
 - You believed that?

65
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,650
Hee Joo contributed all the money she earned from her part-time job, too.

66
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,360
- Thank her. 
 - It's okay.

67
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,990
I'll get it back when I graduate.

68
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,560
I have two years left.

69
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,530
Sign up for a time deposit if you haven't.

70
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:31,470
You really didn't have to buy this.

71
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,680
It suits you well.

72
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:37,160
Just a moment.

73
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,240
He's practicing saxophone these days.

74
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,140
To perform at our weddings.

75
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,810
- Weddings? 
 - Yes.

76
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,040
What are you thinking about?

77
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,300
A gift for my dad.

78
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,870
What could I have gotten him besides a suit?

79
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,950
I should've gotten his hair dyed.

80
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,180
I should've taken better care of him all along. Why do this now?

81
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,160
Come on.

82
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,300
Let's do the next one now. The next one.

83
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,410
Where's the flyer... Here it is.

84
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,210
 I've been looking up restaurants in Honolulu all night. 

85
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:55,470
I got no sleep.

86
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:58,980
I couldn't sleep because I was nervous.

87
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,580
Hey, the bus is here. Bye.

88
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,500
Hurry. What should we do?

89
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,940
"Pack lunch and go on a picnic."

90
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,490
"Spend all day at an amusement park."

91
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,000
"Eat nothing but gimbap all day."

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,010
You called me childish.

93
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:14,360
You're just like me, too.

94
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,820
Hey, isn't that a passport?

95
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,180
What?

96
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,610
   

97
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,060
   

98
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,070
   

99
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,370
What should we do?

100
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,490
- Should we split up and look for her? 
 - What?

101
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:47,370
I'll call you loudly if I find her.

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,950
Okay. I'll look over there.

103
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,530
What do we do?

104
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,450
Excuse me, you dropped this, right?

105
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:22,410
Thank you!

106
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,400
Thank you! Thank you!

107
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,970
- Thank you! 
 - It's nothing.

108
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:31,530
Thank you!

109
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,750
We can go now, right?

110
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,370
- Hey, I'm sorry. 
 - It's okay.

111
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,850
What should we eat?

112
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,580
I wonder what they're talking about.

113
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,840
Be well.

114
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,720
I'll miss you.

115
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,120
Don't be sad when I'm gone.

116
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,350
Don't skip meals.

117
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,120
I told you not to cry.

118
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,180
You think you won't find someone more handsome than me?

119
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,560
I suppose. It'd be too hard.

120
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,440
Can't we just go together?

121
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,620
You should stay here.

122
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,120
Stay here and save this world.

123
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,410
I don't want to.

124
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,030
I just need you.

125
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,550
A superhero shouldn't say something so irresponsible.

126
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,690
My superpower isn't enough.

127
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,110
I can't do it alone.

128
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,500
You can do it without me.

129
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,630
Remember, even if you don't see me,

130
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:48,570
we'll always be together.

131
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:53,040
Survive until the end...

132
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,860
and let's meet again.

133
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,560
Can I leave this world in your care now?

134
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,060
Yes.

135
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,690
You can count on me.

136
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:11,400
What would've happened to us if you didn't die?

137
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,920
Would we have become a cringe couple like them?

138
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,050
Or we could've gotten fed up and broken up.

139
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,370
We could've had a normal relationship, gone on normal dates,

140
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,540
fought for obvious reasons, made up,

141
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,940
gotten sick of each other and broken up.

142
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,290
We could've been a fleeting encounter.

143
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,410
Do you think...

144
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,650
we're still like this because time paused then?

145
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,920
We wouldn't have fought so much.

146
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,480
I probably would've tolerated you often.

147
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,910
Because I'm open-minded, thoughtful, and generous.

148
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:05,040
You're open-minded, generous, and old-fashioned.

149
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,650
Ridiculous.

150
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,570
It's better to be old-fashioned.

151
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,720
You would've given me such a hard time.

152
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,300
Geez, what's the point of talking?

153
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,830
We'll know once we try it.

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,990
"Going on a...

155
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:27,710
ordinary and cliché date with Kim Ram Woo."

156
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,110
We have less than a day left, right?

157
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:33,090
Let's see who gets sick of it first.

158
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:35,650
Okay.

159
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,140
Let's go.

160
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:40,110
What kind of date do you want to start with?

161
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:58,180
    
 ♫  It feels like you're coming to me by chance  ♫

162
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,890
The adult comic books are on another level.

163
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,910
Can't you read faster?

164
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,960
I want to read it soon, too.

165
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,470
What is it?

166
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,640
What? Is it over?

167
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,650
It ended with a cliffhanger.

168
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:19,550
Where's volume 11?

169
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:21,860
Wow. Gosh.

170
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,000
This world is filled with things I don't know yet.

171
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,860
This won't do.

172
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,930
Let's buy all these. Buy, buy, buy.

173
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,490
Let's go.

174
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,440
- Which one? 
 - The chocolate one.

175
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,030
Chocolate. Okay.

176
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,510
Catch it quickly. How cute. 
    

177
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,060
How cute. Catch this.

178
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,530
Catch this. You can't, right? You can't.

179
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,800
You can't. You can't.

180
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,300
Catch it. You can't. You can't.

181
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,070
Hurry and catch it. Come on.

182
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,890
- Ahjussi! 
 - Catch it. You can't.

183
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,870
- That's enough. Stop. 
 - Clumsy, so awkward.

184
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,570
Oh, my God. Okay.

185
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,790
Thank you. Enjoy.

186
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,800
Did you finish it?

187
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,310
I'll tell my boyfriend. He's a scary man.

188
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,940
   

189
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,530
Oh, I got it. 
    

190
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,710
"You're kind-hearted and not greedy.

191
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,390
You help people since you're compassionate."

192
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:13,500
"You're living an impractical life due to your compassion.

193
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,730
Stay away from luxury and vanity."

194
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,120
"Luxury and vanity"?

195
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,210
I knew it when you were buying your family gifts.

196
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:24,680
A good-looking, kind-hearted,

197
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,390
and a well-mannered spouse would be a good match for you.

198
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,440
That's so me, right?

199
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,930
No, no. Nothing is correct. Look.

200
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,140
Your longevity line is strong and clearly defined.

201
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,940
You'll be wealthy at an old age due to offsprings?

202
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,500
I don't think this is right.

203
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,060
   

204
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,530
♫  Don't hide it anymore  ♫

205
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,170
♫  Somehow now, you're standing right in front of me  ♫

206
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,070
♫  This gentle feeling, this flutter  ♫

207
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,740
The longevity line.

208
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,650
What? Hey, hey, hey, hey!

209
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,170
I made it longer.

210
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,610
I'll extend another one. The intelligence line.

211
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,010
Hey. Stop, stop.

212
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:05,930
- I'll do yours, too. 
 - Hold on. Hold on.

213
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:09,570
- What? 
 - One sec.

214
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,820
Geez. 
    

215
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,680
Is it that senior again?

216
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,040
Why does she keep calling me?

217
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,260
Answer it. It might be something urgent.

218
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:20,060
She keeps bringing up the graduation exhibition.

219
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,570
I said I can't do it.

220
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,730
Hello?

221
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:26,340
H-Hello? Hee Wan.

222
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,070
Jeong Hee Wan, where are you right now?

223
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,950
- I'm outside. 
 - Outside? Why?

224
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:31,530
Are you alone right now?

225
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,250
Is something going on?

226
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,070
Well, yes.

227
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,530
Y-Yes, there is.

228
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,330
There will be fireworks since it's the last day of the festival. 
    

229
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,130
Fireworks?

230
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:46,750
Yes, fireworks.

231
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,270
They use our tuition money for it.

232
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:51,050
Wouldn't it be a shame to miss it?

233
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,780
Well...

234
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,520
There's something I need to do.

235
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,830
I'll call you later.

236
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,280
 What are you doing, exactly? 

237
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,790
From when to when, where, and with whom?

238
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:02,190
Well, I need to hang up.

239
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,110
 Hee Wan, I'm sorry. I'm not angry. 

240
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,710
You haven't hung up, right?

241
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,720
The lineup today is no joke.

242
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,020
IVE is coming. IVE.

243
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,330
 You know IVE, right? "LOVE DIVE." 

244
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:14,170
 It's all the rage right now. 

245
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,340
 - You need to come now.  
 - I-I can't talk right now.

246
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,660
I'll call you back.

247
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,620
 Hee Wan, it's IVE. Hello? 

248
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,270
Gosh.

249
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,040
She seems kind of weird.

250
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:42,660
Geez, that Grim Reaper. Seriously...

251
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,820
 Kim Ram Woo, are you okay? 

252
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,130
 We took a class together once. 

253
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,530
 You know at least one person at school. 

254
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,080
 Let me. 

255
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,400
 Will you... Will you be okay? 

256
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,750
 - I can put it here, right? 
 - Yes, there. 

257
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,220
 Do you even know her name? 

258
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,840
 My name is Go Yeong Hyun. 

259
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,590
Gosh, I'm screwed.

260
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:23,120
That jerk.

261
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,990
What do I do?

262
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:48,970
You should've used nice salt.

263
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,690
Go away! Go!

264
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,520
Excuse me.

265
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,330
Excuse me, Sunbae!

266
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,310
Sunbae!

267
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,690
Sunbae.

268
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,890
Why is the weather so cold?

269
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,820
The weather will be cold throughout the festival period.

270
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,230
Yes, it's a spring-cold spell.

271
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,020
It's for the cherry blossoms.

272
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,380
I know.

273
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,880
Is it because it's colder than usual?

274
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,170
They're blossoming late.

275
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,990
I knew it.

276
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:23,100
You must see me. How?

277
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,530
It's none of your business.

278
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,230
Life must've been hard.

279
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,590
Yes. Because of jerks like you.

280
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:29,890
So, get lost.

281
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,120
Why should I get lost?

282
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,370
I end up learning too much about what I don't want to know.

283
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:38,270
So, leave.

284
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,190
Understood.

285
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,700
You were tossing salt and stuff.

286
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,320
I thought you wanted to talk to me.

287
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,910
Anyway, sorry for the trouble.

288
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,120
I'll get going now.

289
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,080
Is it because of Jeong Hee Wan?

290
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,170
I mean...

291
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:58,040
why are you hanging around her? Why?

292
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,660
Why do you think the Grim Reaper came?

293
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,520
   

294
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
   

295
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,570
Do you like fireworks?

296
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,290
It'd be nice to see them with someone.

297
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,320
W-What are you saying?

298
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,050
I wanted to see the fireworks together instead of shooting stars.

299
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,550
Anyway, think about who you'd see them with.

300
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:30,870
It'd be nice if you saw them with Hee Wan.

301
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,040
Hello.

302
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,590
Is work going well?

303
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,640
Thank you.

304
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,420
Ma'am, could you tell me where Jeong Hee Wan lives?

305
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:42,990
Jeong Hee Wan?

306
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:45,840
So, Jeong Hee Wan...

307
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,920
ordered supplies and disappeared with our money.

308
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,800
You're asking for her home address, Sunbae?

309
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,980
- Yes. 
 - Her personal info?

310
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:57,720
Right. In that case, could you just tell me

311
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,870
which direction? Is it East, West, North, South...

312
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,480
I don't think so.

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,680
And only she didn't take the yearbook photo.

314
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:08,000
She couldn't have put in an order for everyone.

315
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,550
Are you sure you aren't mistaken?

316
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,510
Hye Ran, this is urgent.

317
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,190
A person's life depends on it.

318
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:17,320
M-My life. My life depends on it.

319
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,240
You know I need to graduate.

320
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,140
Sunbaenim, you're trying so hard.

321
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:30,020
Stop the fireworks, at least, then.

322
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,910
Just don't do it, Hye Ran.

323
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,860
What about the fireworks?

324
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,280
They're already setting up for it.

325
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,820
They're setting up?

326
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,350
Yes.

327
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,250
Gosh, this is driving me nuts...

328
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,720
Seeing cherry blossoms.

329
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,490
Not happening since they didn't blossom.

330
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,910
A trip to Northern Europe.

331
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,680
There's no time and I don't have a passport, so no.

332
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:54,260
Contacting Tae Kyung. I couldn't do that either.

333
00:19:55,910 --> 00:19:58,870
I should've found out her contact information.

334
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,570
Hey,

335
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
did you see shooting stars that day?

336
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,330
At the festival?

337
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,890
I did.

338
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:19,700
How about you?

339
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,050
I did.

340
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:23,130
They were pretty, right?

341
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,770
Yes.

342
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,750
I wanted to see them together.

343
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,080
Thinking now, while I've been with you this week,

344
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,670
I haven't had that dream once.

345
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,890
What dream?

346
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,800
I often had dreams of you walking away when I last saw you

347
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,180
at the Meteor Shower Festival.

348
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,650
In my dreams, after I send you there,

349
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:55,120
I later realize something went wrong.

350
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,790
So, I call for you.

351
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,350
I tell you not to go. To wait.

352
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:04,800
I run and manage to catch you.

353
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,930
But the person who turns around isn't you.

354
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:12,490
That's why I felt so relieved there yesterday.

355
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,140
Because you were there without disappearing.

356
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,510
I see...

357
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,110
Is that why you kissed me?

358
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,870
By the way,

359
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,650
how do I disappear?

360
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,810
What?

361
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:51,270
How do you disappear this time?

362
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:56,520
Can we meet again?

363
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:14,820
But... I think your bag disappeared just now.

364
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,180
Hey!

365
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,720
Hey...

366
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,750
Hey, hey, hey!

367
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,330
Hey!

368
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,880
Gosh, seriously!

369
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,380
You're still a fast runner.

370
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:37,200
Stop right there, you two!

371
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,550
But why are we running?

372
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:42,790
Everything my dad gave me is in there!

373
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,910
You don't need any of that anymore.

374
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:48,190
Whatever! Hurry!

375
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:04,700
   

376
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:12,550
What's this?

377
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,320
What's this?

378
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,170
 I feel better. 

379
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:45,470
So, how do I die?

380
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,100
I guess I choose to.

381
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,330
Kim Ram Woo.

382
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,060
Kim Ram Woo.

383
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,560
I don't understand.

384
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,690
Why would I think of doing that?

385
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,210
Thinking now, I should've known earlier.

386
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:30,080
I'm not really sure how to feel about it.

387
00:24:32,230 --> 00:24:34,790
You already know.

388
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,540
You don't want to die.

389
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,620
That's enough.

390
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,670
Don't die...

391
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,140
and live.

392
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,960
Is that why you came?

393
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,940
Was the week-long vacation an excuse, too?

394
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,720
Did you come to stop me from dying?

395
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,100
It wasn't an excuse.

396
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,770
This is what I really wanted to do.

397
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,290
You came to save me?

398
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,330
After dying because of me back then?

399
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,060
I didn't die because of you. And—

400
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,870
What happens to you if I live?

401
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,320
Can we not see each other again?

402
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,280
Hey, look. The sun is setting.

403
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,190
Don't change the subject.

404
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,290
Hey,

405
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,550
you don't want to see the Grim Reaper again.

406
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,340
Stop joking and tell me.

407
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,810
Will we not see each other again?

408
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,910
No.

409
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,970
We won't.

410
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,800
I died and you're alive.

411
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,160
And you'll continue to live.

412
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:02,070
That's nonsense.

413
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,800
Ram Woo,

414
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,310
tell me you'll be well.

415
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,700
That you'll live well.

416
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,700
You told me that...

417
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,710
time finally seems to be flowing.

418
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,110
That's enough.

419
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,510
Don't forget that.

420
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:30,100
Keep that mindset.

421
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,980
No.

422
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:36,010
That's because you're here.

423
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:44,960
No.

424
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,720
You can do it without me, too.

425
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,040
We created this week together.

426
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,660
We even had an ordinary and cliché date today.

427
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,300
So, let me go now.

428
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,080
Stop talking nonsense.

429
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,830
Remember the people at the airport?

430
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,400
They were all full of hope.

431
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,440
I'd like you to live that way, too.

432
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:17,020
Full of hope. With a racing heart, wondering where you'd go next.

433
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:20,750
I'm not ready at all.

434
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,660
There are so many things I want to do with you.

435
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,640
You can do them from now on. I'll be watching.

436
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:28,270
I need to tell you so many things, too.

437
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,360
I'll be listening.

438
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:31,730
Kim Ram Woo.

439
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,030
Yes, Kim Ram Woo.

440
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:39,760
Don't forget.

441
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,150
Our time together... won't disappear.

442
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:49,240
It's all in you.

443
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,930
You...

444
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,310
You're Jeong Hee Wan and also Kim Ram Woo.

445
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:06,030
Please, please, please...

446
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,860
Please...

447
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,570
Please...

448
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,440
Please...

449
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,900
♫  I'm here to stay  ♫

450
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,210
♫  I'll circle your path  ♫

451
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:34,780
♫  Never letting you go  ♫

452
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,220
Kim Ram Woo.

453
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,990
Kim Ram Woo.

454
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,620
Jeong Hee Wan.

455
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,140
Okay!

456
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,310
Okay, I'll live. I'll live well.

457
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:04,980
Don't worry.

458
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:09,020
I'll live happily.

459
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,190
You're listening, right?

460
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,620
I'll live well. You're listening, right?

461
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,860
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,580
You're listening, right, Ram Woo?

463
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,420
I'm sorry.

464
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:29,620
I can't do this.

465
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:33,040
I can't live without you.

466
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:37,570
Don't go.

467
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,740
   

468
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,190
 Want to come with me? 

469
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,220
Come with me. I need to tell you something.

470
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,220
It's okay. Go without me this time.

471
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,940
Jeong Hee Wan. Jeong Hee Wan!

472
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,900
Jeong Hee Wan! Hold on.

473
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,500
Jeong Hee Wan! Jeong Hee Wan! No! Wait a moment!

474
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,800
Wait! Jeong Hee Wan!

475
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,260
Hold on! Jeong Hee Wan!

476
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,750
Done. Let's go see the show now.

477
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,460
When are the fireworks starting again?

478
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,150
The last performance is starting now.

479
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,420
It'd be around nine, probably. 
    

480
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,600
Sunbae, you're coming to the afterparty later, right?

481
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,840
I don't know. I'm busy now. Go.

482
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,120
I know you'll come.

483
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,680
Come to Railroad Bar by 10.

484
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,810
Everyone is paying 10,000 each.

485
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,750
Did you say "Railroad Bar" just now?

486
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:18,460
Yes, the one we go to all the time.

487
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,710
In front of the crosswalk.

488
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,860
 ­  

489
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,300
Right. There's a crosswalk there.

490
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,980
It must be near there.

491
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:52,950
Fireworks. Fireworks.

492
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:56,820
Fireworks. Fireworks...

493
00:32:57,790 --> 00:33:00,050
Railroad. Railroad. 
    

494
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,470
Geez. This is killing me. Gosh.

495
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:36,550
The cross. The cross.

496
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:22,470
 I couldn't do anything for you. 

497
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,710
 I couldn't say sorry 

498
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:28,870
 or ask for forgiveness. 

499
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:31,710
 You gave me everything, 

500
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,510
 but I let you go this time, too. 

501
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,830
No, Hee Wan.

502
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,170
 How do I live after letting you go? 

503
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:47,380
 I can't live without you while 

504
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,570
 remembering the past week. 

505
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,850
Hee Wan.

506
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,310
 I'm sorry. 

507
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:55,070
 I'm so sorry. 

508
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,770
 And thank you for everything. 

509
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,990
Jeong Hee Wan! Hee Wan!

510
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,910
H-Hee Wan. Hold on.

511
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,720
Hold on.

512
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,410
Hee Wan, no.

513
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,170
D-Don't do this.

514
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:24,590
C-Come down quickly.

515
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:29,440
It's dangerous up here.

516
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,490
Let's talk for a moment.

517
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,870
Come down and talk to me for a second.

518
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:38,440
- Pardon? 
 - What can I tell you

519
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,380
to c-change your mind?

520
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,180
Hee Wan, l-life isn't so easily...

521
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,480
Well...

522
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:54,570
But Hee Wan, to die...

523
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,030
To die, you need...

524
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:01,540
to be in excruciating pain.

525
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,580
I'm sure the Grim Reaper was, too.

526
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,160
What did you say just now?

527
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,410
Did you meet Ram Woo?

528
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,330
How did you... When did you meet him?

529
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,710
Calm down, Hee Wan.

530
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,740
He wants to see the fireworks with you.

531
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,730
Everything will be over if you die.

532
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:30,580
Your pain right now will disappear too.

533
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,720
That's true.

534
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,120
But Hee Wan, the things you experienced, remember,

535
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,700
the sense of longing, and the times you shared with others

536
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,770
will all be gone too.

537
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,560
Hee Wan.

538
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,670
Hee Wan.

539
00:36:55,670 --> 00:37:00,030
N-No, please don't do this.

540
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:02,040
Hee Wan, hold on.

541
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:06,370
Jeong Hee Wan. Jeong Hee Wan!

542
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:08,310
Jeong Hee Wan! Hold on.

543
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:11,590
Jeong Hee Wan! Jeong Hee Wan! No! Wait a moment!

544
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,260
Jeong Hee Wan!

545
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,680
Hold on! Jeong Hee Wan!

546
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:21,700
 Kim Ram Woo. 

547
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,250
Kim Ram Woo.

548
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,980
You have 30 seconds left.

549
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,940
Let's watch it together.

550
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:52,770
♫  The blue memories inevitably resurface  ♫

551
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:01,000
♫  When such a night comes again  ♫

552
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:08,730
♫  The feelings I cannot get rid of inside me  ♫

553
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:18,120
♫  When the wind that was returning blows  ♫

554
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:25,960
♫  I close my eyes missing you  ♫

555
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,630
♫  My stars have gone away  ♫

556
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,990
They're even prettier because we're together, right?

557
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,500
Yes, they're pretty.

558
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:46,000
♫  Even if it drifts far away  ♫

559
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:55,000
♫  I couldn't leave "us" behind  ♫

560
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,250
♫  I'll let you go now  ♫

561
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:07,160
♫  Into eternity  ♫

562
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,220
I told you.

563
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,240
You would've given me such a hard time.

564
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,000
Kim Ram Woo.

565
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Kim Ram Woo, who's both Jeong Hee Wan and Kim Ram Woo.

566
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm sorry.

567
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:40,160
That I lost you for the second time.

568
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,790
You didn't lose me.

569
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,420
You just won't be seeing me.

570
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:52,100
You must've wanted to live.

571
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,920
You didn't even have the choice.

572
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,530
But I couldn't save you even once.

573
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,200
I'm sorry, Ram Woo.

574
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,810
I'm so sorry,

575
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,690
Jeong Hee Wan.

576
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,190
You understand now, right?

577
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,270
Saving yourself...

578
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:15,420
is saving me.

579
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,110
I'll leave now.

580
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:25,440
Survive until the end and

581
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:28,220
we'll meet again.

582
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:34,260
Can I leave you in this world now?

583
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:36,720
You can count on me.

584
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:45,930
♫  Even if it drifts far away  ♫

585
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:53,920
♫  I couldn't leave "us" behind  ♫

586
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,550
Kim Ram Woo.

587
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,970
Kim Ram Woo.

588
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,510
Kim Ram Woo.

589
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,330
♫  Bye  ♫

590
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,600
Bye.

591
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,690
Bye.

592
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,950
Gosh, shouldn't I wear a shower cap?

593
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:16,370
It didn't get on you. Why would you use that?

594
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:19,070
   

595
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:23,520
   

596
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,030
So sleepy.

597
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:40,350
Geez.

598
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:48,220
Hey, I need to graduate, I said.

599
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:51,060
I can't do assignments in this weather.

600
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,670
I need to graduate, too.

601
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:55,120
You and I aren't the same.

602
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,800
You have to graduate in one go.

603
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,360
It'd be unbearable if you don't get it in one go.

604
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:03,160
I'm sure it'd hurt.

605
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,380
Hey.

606
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,360
Do you have no sense of hierarchy?

607
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:09,280
Seriously.

608
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,080
How pretty.

609
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,430
Spring is the hardest.

610
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:20,630
Everything is beautiful,

611
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,150
but only I'm like this.

612
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:27,710
But I'm not the only one, actually.

613
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,990
It might look like others can easily get over things,

614
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:33,630
but we all feel the same inside.

615
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,770
I think the Grim Reaper knew that.

616
00:43:40,770 --> 00:43:42,380
 Hey! 

617
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,580
Explain it clearly.

618
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,050
You're just the Grim Reaper. How do you know Hee Wan?

619
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:49,230
I think you'd hit it off with Kim Ram Woo.

620
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,760
What? K-Kim Ram Woo?

621
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,990
Who's Kim Ram Woo now?

622
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:57,180
So, why are you doing this to me? Of all people.

623
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:00,630
You seem to know what it's like to be left behind.

624
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,700
 Isn't that why you can't ignore Kim Ram Woo? 

625
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:10,750
So, please take good care of her.

626
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,500
But I'm still not used to being left behind.

627
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,050
Even when I think I'm okay,

628
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:23,090
I sometimes go back to that time.

629
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:27,170
If someone disappears from this world,

630
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,470
there'd be a hole this big.

631
00:44:30,470 --> 00:44:33,730
But your memories with them are still there.

632
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,660
You just live with the hole.

633
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,670
That's what it's like to lose someone.

634
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,760
The more you try not to forget, the more vivid it becomes.

635
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,530
It'd probably stay that way

636
00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:48,720
even after many springs come.

637
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:57,640
That's not too bad.

638
00:44:57,640 --> 00:45:00,750
- What? 
 - That hole.

639
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,110
You can just live embracing it.

640
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,440
Well... Keeping it in a drawer

641
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,470
and looking at it once in a while sounds okay.

642
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:24,330
Let me see. Here it is.

643
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,070
Here. I took it at the festival.

644
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:29,690
But you dropped it and left.

645
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:32,630
I finally get to give it to you.

646
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:41,768
 Kim Ram Woo, who's called Jeong Hee Wan. Hi, it's me. 

647
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,375
 How are you doing? 

648
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:50,279
 You've been appearing in my dreams a lot lately. 

649
00:45:51,975 --> 00:45:55,969
 Sometimes I wonder if your visit was all a dream. 

650
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,480
 But every time I do, traces of your presence come to me like gifts. 

651
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,721
 The sand in my shoes, 

652
00:46:07,708 --> 00:46:10,340
 pictures of us together. 

653
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:14,935
 The scribbles you left in my yearbook. 
   

654
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:20,247
 And there's a gift that came after your visit. 

655
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:23,640
Yes.

656
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,980
 There are early bird tickets for Incheon and Honolulu. 

657
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,040
- You'd better book it now. 
   - I finally got in touch with Tae Kyung. 

658
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:31,650
Hee Joo wanted to go freediving with me.

659
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:34,680
- We booked three months' worth yesterday. 
  - What about the flight? 

660
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,080
 You were supposed to come. 

661
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,180
Ta-da! I got a passport.

662
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,890
 You mean you didn't have one? Why? 

663
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,983
Are you bragging since you live in Hawaii?

664
00:46:41,983 --> 00:46:44,440
 I also have a new habit. 
   

665
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,300
 These days, I often ask people 
   

666
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,500
 how they're doing. 
   

667
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,110
♫  Since I'm a woman  ♫

668
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:56,300
♫  I wait another day  ♫

669
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,052
♫  You dummy, say it to me  ♫

670
00:46:58,052 --> 00:47:02,875
 Dad says he wants to make it to the top of the amateur saxophone competition. 

671
00:47:02,875 --> 00:47:06,556
 I'm going to learn freediving because Hee Joo insisted. 

672
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,917
 Hong Seok seems to have passed the exam. 

673
00:47:10,917 --> 00:47:17,270
 He's building his body for a calendar photo shoot as a muscular firefighter next month. 

674
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:19,280
   

675
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:25,701
 And the most important thing is my graduation exhibition, 

676
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:30,125
 but I couldn't think of what to do at all. 

677
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,658
 And you know what I found? 

678
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:35,190
   

679
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,442
   

680
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:39,975
 Your handwriting is fascinating no matter how many times I see it. 

681
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:47,335
 For instance, your "ng" character looks like a flat peach. 

682
00:47:47,335 --> 00:47:51,938
 And I can't tell if some of your vowels are consonants or not. 

683
00:47:53,110 --> 00:48:03,000

00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,060
Hee Wan.

686
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:20,610
Dad. Hee Joo.

687
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:23,310
- You came. 
 - Good work, my daughter.

688
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,660
- Congratulations, Unnie. 
 - You came.

689
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,530
- Is this it? 
 - It is.

690
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,450
- Beautiful handwriting. 
 - Is this your work, unnie?

691
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:30,950
It's mine.

692
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,870
To be honest,

693
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:34,260
yours is the best.

694
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:36,670
Don't say stuff like that.

695
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:38,550
Be quiet.

696
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:53,690
 The flowers or green leaves won't come back. 

697
00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:59,210
 There will be new flowers and green leaves. 

698
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:03,740
 There will be new warm days. 

699
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:06,260
 Nothing comes back 

700
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,930
 and nothing gets repeated. 

701
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,660
 Because everything is real.

708
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:49,640
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

709
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:54,030
Hey.

710
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:58,180
 Because everything really happened to you and me. 

711
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:06,590
 That would always be true as long as I remember. 

712
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,320
   

713
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:20,670
 I'll remember you. 

714
00:50:20,670 --> 00:50:24,490
 I'll continue living. 

715
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,320
 Because to us, loving myself 

716
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,820
 means loving you. 

717
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:38,810
♫  Take my hand  ♫

718
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:43,250
♫  I'm here to stay  ♫

719
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:48,700
♫  I'll circle your path  ♫

720
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,520
♫  Never letting you go  ♫

721
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,720
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

722
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,150
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

723
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:07,570
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

724
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,110
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫
