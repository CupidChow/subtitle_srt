 But you died. 

13
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:13,210
Four years ago.

14
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:14,690
Yes.

15
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,920
I came because I needed to tell you something.

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,600
Kim Ram Woo.

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,520
You'll die in a week.

18
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,520
What?

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,600
You'll die in 176 hours, 12 minutes, and 35 seconds.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,300
I'll die in a week?

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,600
Yes.

22
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,240
How do you know that?

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,820
Are you the Grim Reaper?

00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,350
Yes.

27
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,150
Excuse me, hold on.

28
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,750
- What? 
 - Please help.

29
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,890
There's a weird guy inside.

30
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,330
You should call the police.

31
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,850
I'm a delivery man.

32
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,580
Is he hiding in the bathroom?

33
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,260
No, he's right in front of us.

34
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,960
- W-Where? 
 - Here. This person.

35
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,900
What? What person?

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,130
He can't see me. Don't waste your time.

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,810
- Aigoo. He has a long life left. 
 - What's there?

38
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,030
Thanks for your hard work. You'll live long.

39
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,630
You can't hear that either?

40
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,580
Hear what?

41
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,240
- I'm so busy I'm dying. 
 - You won't die.

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,080
No, that's not it... I'm sorry.

43
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,270
Whatever. Whatever.

44
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,080
They think delivery men are a joke.

45
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,110
Hello? I'd like to talk to the doctor.

46
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,820
I'm Jeong Hee Wan.

47
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,130
I'm in a hurry right now.

48
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,240
The drug you prescribed to me.

49
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,750
Is hallucination one of the side effects?

50
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,870
It is, right?

51
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,550
You checked all the pills, right?

52
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:39,040
Yes, it usually takes a few hours to accept.

53
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,320
But you'll regret wasting time like this later.

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,230
You regret so many things after you die.

55
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,010
Let me give you a piece of advice.

56
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:54,670
♫  The Bodhisattva of Compassion  ♫

57
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,810
♫  When he meditated deeply  ♫

58
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,070
Excuse me.

59
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,520
Excuse me.

60
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,040
I...

61
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,910
have years of experience.

62
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,670
This is basically my work anthem now.

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,810
Have you come to your senses now?

64
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,220
Let's clean the house first, then.

65
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,860
Look at these side dishes.

66
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,630
You didn't even touch them.

67
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,960
Ahjussi and Hee Joo would be so upset

68
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,250
to see this after you die.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,480
What are you, really?

70
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,430
What? I'm Hee Wan.

71
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,740
Cut the crap.

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,160
I'll flip out if you call me that again.

73
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm Jeong Hee Wan and you're Kim Ram Woo.

74
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,200
I can't believe this. Hey.

75
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,920
You're the one who insisted on switching names.

76
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:51,340
Wow, the yearbook. 
    

77
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,240
They switched our names here.

78
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,530
We had to put stickers on each copy. Remember?

79
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,600
We had cleaning duty for a month as punishment.

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,140
Here it is.

81
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,250
It was so hard to stick these... 
    

82
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,620
   

83
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,330
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

84
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,560
I had salt, chicken blood,

85
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,670
and all sorts of stuff thrown at me.

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,160
But a fire extinguisher...

87
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,290
is a new one.

88
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,980
 Hey, Kim Ram Woo. 

89
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,640
- What? 
 - Do you know Bang Ji Soo?

90
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,040
- Who? 
 - Bang Ji Soo from 10th grade.

91
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,100
She's looking for you.

92
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,960
You know the hair treatment ad.

93
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,920
Well, my handwriting is not good.

94
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,940
I saw the letter you wrote for my friend.

95
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:04,310
You made it look so pretty.

96
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,630
The word must've spread all the way there.

97
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,990
Is it a love letter?

98
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:11,340
The pricing tiers are basic, premium,

99
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,940
special, and platinum.

100
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,200
I choose the platinum.

101
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,470
The platinum level is a bit pricy.

102
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,930
- It's okay. 
 - It's 30,000 won.

103
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,000
It's okay.

104
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,050
A week is enough, right?

105
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,470
I'm confessing my love in a week.

106
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,770
Our 100th day would be Christmas if we start dating then.

107
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,660
I guess it's not possible that he'd say no.

108
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:39,820
Well, no.

109
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,580
I brought the letter here.

110
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,210
"Your dizzying beauty."

111
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,220
"The heart-wrenching smile"?

112
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,890
Is there someone like this at our school?

113
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:53,410
"I don't normally approach people first,"

114
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,800
"but you, Oppa Ram Woo, are an exception"?

115
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,310
Yes.

116
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,470
It's Oppa Kim Ram Woo.

117
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,090
Not you, Unnie.

118
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,780
Oppa Kim Ram Woo, who's called Jeong Hee Wan.

119
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,930
Kim Ram Woo is the recipient of this letter?

120
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,170
The Kim Ram Woo I know?

121
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:11,270
Yes. Why?

122
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,210
Is that a problem?

123
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:16,600
No, not at all. No problem.

124
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,370
But would Ram Woo like this stuff?

125
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,110
I'm not really sure.

126
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,450
Would he not?

127
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,410
Instead of doing this,

128
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,560
should I just confess to his face?

129
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,310
No, no, no. The letter sounds good.

130
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,410
The letter would be perfect.

131
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,380
Writing is more expressive.

132
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,200
- I love it. 
 - Okay, then.

133
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,250
Here's the 30,000 won.

134
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,120
Hold on a second!

135
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,050
Yes, Unnie. What is it?

136
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,010
There are modern, classic,

137
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,950
petit, and lovely options.

138
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,040
What would you like?

139
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,420
Since you're closest to Oppa Ram Woo,

140
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,960
choose the theme he'd like the most.

141
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,630
Fighting!

142
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,140
Fighting...

143
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,660
Geez. 
    

144
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,570
"Your dizzying beauty"?

145
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,040
She couldn't sleep thinking about him?

146
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,730
Quit drinking coffee.

147
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,080
Darn.

148
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,050
Darn it!

149
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:34,080
Geez, so annoying!

150
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,390
   

151
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,250
Kim Ram Woo.

152
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,940
What's wrong? You look like a zombie.

153
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,380
What is it?

154
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,810
She's outside again.

155
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:58,370
Bang Ji Soo? Is it Bang Ji Soo?

156
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:01,060
Just write it however.

157
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,800
Hey, hey.

158
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,060
Tell her I'm sick.

159
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,430
No, say I'm in the bathroom.

160
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,700
No, no.

161
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,590
Tell her I didn't come to school today, okay?

162
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,600
I can cover myself like this.

163
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,390
I'm not at school today. Okay?

164
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,890
Please call Unnie for me.

165
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,630
She didn't come to school today.

166
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,200
She's at the teachers' office.

167
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,240
She's at the infirmary.

168
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,930
She got into a traffic accident.

169
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,390
She was hospitalized.

170
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,590
- Unnie. 
 - If I...

171
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,430
said she transferred, you won't believe it, right?

172
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,200
How long will you keep this up?

173
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
I feel sorry for you.

174
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,780
Just write it quickly and be done. What's this?

175
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,880
It's the platinum level.

176
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,640
But I can't come up with anything.

177
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,900
Don't you think Ji Soo is all about her hair?

178
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:11,720
No, does the hair look good because it's her?

179
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,150
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

180
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,100
Just confess your love to Jeong Hee Wan first.

181
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,370
What?

182
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,700
What are you talking about? You're crazy.

183
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,000
Stop dragging it.

184
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,200
Get it off your chest and get dumped quickly.

185
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,770
The bigger the heartbreak is,

186
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:28,430
the bigger the leap it brings to your life.

187
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:30,860
Why? Look how singers make masterpieces after a breakup.

188
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,380
Why are you being like this?

189
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,780
Spit out your words now. 
  (T/N: Don't jinx it) 

190
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,850
Spit them out.

191
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,760
 Unnie! 

192
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,650
- Hey, hey, hey. Finish the noodles. 
 - Go, go.

193
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,710
- Go, go, go! 
 - Unnie, Unnie!

194
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,560
- Go! 
 - Unnie, hold on. Unnie, Unnie!

195
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,560
- Hold on! Hold on! 
 - Go! Go!

196
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:15,600
She was right here.

197
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,630
 Hey, hey! 

198
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,320
What?

199
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:31,400
Geez! Seriously!

200
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:34,920
Unnie?

201
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,200
Unnie?

202
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,350
 - Gosh. 
 - What class is she from? 

203
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,640
 - Did she really jump? 
 - What do we do? 

204
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,310
Yes, this is Heewantang.

205
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,860
Suicide attempt?

206
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,880
Dad!

207
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,500
I can't believe this.

208
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,030
She looked so cheerful and carefree when we saw her then.

209
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:19,740
She still is totally carefree.

210
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,960
How could you say that?

211
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:25,870
I mean, she always does unbelievably weird things.

212
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,640
You're so uncaring sometimes.

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:35,640
If you're struggling too much,

214
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,560
you act bubbly so as not to let it show.

215
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,050
Did Kim Ram Woo attempt suicide?

216
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,330
Is she okay?

217
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:46,490
Did something happen to her?

218
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,900
I don't know either.

219
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,850
That's what I mean.

220
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,080
 Let me know if I can help with anything. 

221
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,190
She's gone crazy. Seriously.

222
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,120
I think she lost her mind.

223
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,630
 Everyone really thought you lost your mind. 

224
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,720
We were so worried.

225
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,880
But where are we going?

226
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,120
What do you mean by "we"?

227
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:26,700
Whatever. I shouldn't react.

228
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,060
- Just accept it as it is. 
 - Seriously.

229
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,110
You aren't crazy.

230
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:32,720
- I can't hear you. I can't hear you. 
 - I'm the Grim Reaper.

231
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,870
- I can't hear you! I can't hear you! 
 - Hey, hey. Look.

232
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:38,170
I can't hear you. No, no, no...

233
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,160
Welcome. 
    

234
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,320
One adult, please.

235
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,320
You're clever even at times like this.

236
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,940
 Hee Wan, do you still have that dream? 

237
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:12,560
 The dream where your friend dies. 

238
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,950
 Is the person you see right now 

239
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,010
 the person from your dream? 

240
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,880
Why are you so down after a bath?

241
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,410
Gosh, I feel refreshed for the first time in a while, too.

242
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,650
My body felt stiff,

243
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,470
but after the sauna, I feel alive.

244
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,630
"Feel alive"?

245
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:40,990
A weird thing for a dead person to say, right?

246
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,890
Let's say I'll actually die.

247
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,530
Why is it you, of all people, who's telling me that?

248
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:49,560
Well...

249
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:54,550
it's like calling in a favor from a friend.

250
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:57,000
- Let's just say it's like that. 
 - A favor?

251
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,590
Leave, then. I don't need you.

252
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,010
Come back when I die.

253
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,530
Hey, you can't just barge in...

254
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,030
- How long has it been? 
 - 18 every five minutes.

255
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,220
Administering it.

256
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,320
Assist.

257
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,890
No shock. Switch now.

258
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,210
It's a patient! Coming through!

259
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,510
Excuse me.

260
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,200
- Get him a GS operation room. 
 - Okay.

261
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,580
It's dropping. It's 40 now.

262
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,350
Doctor.

263
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:57,950
Let's stop.

264
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,030
Time of death, 4:55 p.m.

265
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,660
Mr. Im Soo Hyeon, you have passed away.

266
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,350
Born in the morning of October 12, 1991, between 11 am and 1 p.m.

267
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,100
Died at 5 p.m. on April 1, 2024.

268
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,130
Im Soo Hyeon. Im Soo Hyeon. Im Soo Hyeon.

269
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,710
Let's go.

270
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,480
 Does it finally feel real? 

271
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,880
You're sure, right?

272
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,580
Yes.

273
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,270
How do I die?

274
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:20,890
I can't tell you that.

275
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:23,320
A week, did you say?

276
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:25,920
Yes.

277
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,600
What do you want to do in the remaining week?

278
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,780
I'll go home and sleep.

279
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,160
What? Hey.

280
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,700
You're dying in a week. You want to sleep now?

281
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,470
What should I do, then?

282
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,570
Seriously.

283
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:57,380
Is there really nothing you want to do?

284
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,130
Someone you wanted to meet,

285
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:00,200
a place you wanted to go to,

286
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,050
food you wanted but was too expensive,

287
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,020
or something you like?

288
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:06,060
Like visiting the top bakeries in the country.

289
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,340
How about solving a difficult math problem?

290
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,180
Isn't that what you want to do?

291
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,010
There's something else I want to do.

292
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,570
"Riding a tandem bike"?

293
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,630
"Drinking beer while looking at a night view."

294
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,250
What's this?

295
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,010
It's my bucket list.

296
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,760
Isn't that something you do before you die?

297
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,970
I did die already.

298
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,730
Join me.

299
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,800
You need to hold it steadily in the front.

300
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,970
I veered off because you steered to the side.

301
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,370
I was holding tightly in the front.

302
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:53,900
You're going too fast. You need to keep balance.

303
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,770
This keeps happening because of you.

304
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:56,800
Be careful. Be careful.

305
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,010
Geez, what's wrong with you?

306
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,570
I don't want to.

307
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,840
Do it alone if you must.

308
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,040
You can't even do this much for me...

309
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,890
between us?

310
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,160
Hey, I've been looking for you everywhere.

311
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,440
Why did we keep missing each other?

312
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,680
Why are you doing this to me?

313
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,370
What do you mean?

314
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,920
I feel pressured because it's the platinum level.

315
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,250
I want you and Ram Woo to work out.

316
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:35,340
So, I've been thinking really, really hard—

317
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,920
So, where's the letter?

318
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,520
Aren't you done yet?

319
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,210
Well,

320
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,440
it's almost done.

321
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,340
There's only 1% left.

322
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,770
Because I want you and Ram Woo to really work out,

323
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:48,750
I'm pouring my heart into it.

324
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,410
Unnie, do you like Oppa Hee Wan...

325
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,190
I mean, Oppa Ram Woo, by chance?

326
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,280
What?

327
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,880
Hey, why would you say that?

328
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:08,040
Pretty girls have unrealistic imagination like this at times.

329
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,570
Right, Tae Kyung? Right?

330
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,350
Gosh, Ram Woo and Hee Wan?

331
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:14,040
I think I'll throw up.

332
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:16,590
Are you okay? I think I'll throw up, too.

333
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,440
Seriously. I think I'll throw up.

334
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:22,850
You're acting even more suspicious now.

335
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,090
No, no, no.

336
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,880
I really... I... I hate him.

337
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,350
He's the type I hate. You know what I mean?

338
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,410
How could you not like him?

339
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,790
He's tall,

340
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,700
has broad shoulders, and his face is tiny.

341
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,390
She hates tall men because of her cervical disc issue.

342
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,670
Not only that, his eyes look like half-moons when he smiles.

343
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:45,860
It's so adorable!

344
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,550
Gosh, I hate it. I hate it.

345
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,120
I really hate that type.

346
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,820
I hate it when men smile.

347
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:53,350
She has a terrible taste.

348
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,970
Gosh, I'm sorry.

349
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:59,290
Because Ram Woo is so kind,

350
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,940
I thought someone unqualified might be after him.

351
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,900
Gosh, I'm sorry I misunderstood you!

352
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,410
Yes, she must be sorry.

353
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,130
I'm glad I was mistaken.

354
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,960
I'll take the letter now, then.

355
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,670
It's in the classroom, right?

356
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:16,240
What?

357
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,310
Gosh, Unnie. The letter. The letter.

358
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:21,070
You said only 1% was left.

359
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,090
Can't you finish that now?

360
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:58,330
It's a traditional font style, Unnie.

361
00:21:58,330 --> 00:21:59,890
   

362
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:01,240
Yes.

363
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,160
It's such a heartfelt letter.

364
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,800
I thought I should refrain from decorations.

365
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,700
Oh, I see.

366
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,440
How about the last 1%, then?

367
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,850
What's left?

368
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,110
The poop brown one?

369
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:59,570
Oppa Ram Woo likes the color brown, right?

370
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,330
   

371
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:06,990
It's at 100% now.

372
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:09,450
Thank you!

373
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:23,300
Why the night view? It doesn't suit you.

374
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,500
And why did you want a tandem bike?

375
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,500
I would've had to ride on your back if it were a normal bicycle.

376
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,240
Whatever. Cross those off the list now.

377
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,960
Finished riding a tandem bike.

378
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,430
The remaining ones are,

379
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,300
watching migrating birds at a migratory bird habitat.

380
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,520
Attending a classical music concert at Seoul Arts Center.

381
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,680
Eating cup ramen in the Arctic.

382
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,740
Backpacking in South America.

383
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,420
Entering "National Singing Contest."

384
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,610
What's this now?

385
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:47,900
"Buying a house."

386
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,660
"Giving pocket money to grandchildren"?

387
00:23:51,950 --> 00:23:53,620
Are you kidding me? What?

388
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,990
How will you buy a house and make grandchildren?

389
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:58,110
Come on.

390
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:02,060
It's a bucket list. It can't all be realistic.

391
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:05,210
I want to do these before I really die. 
    

392
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,680
Right. It wouldn't be a bucket list otherwise.

393
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,150
Right. Yes.

394
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:11,750
It's too sad.

395
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:16,370
Traveling alone as a Grim Reaper isn't fun.

396
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:29,340
Just 10 of them.

397
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,390
Just 10.

398
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:34,660
You can do that for me, right?

399
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,140
If I do these, will you leave then?

400
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,500
What?

401
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,770
Promise me.

402
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,650
That you'll leave me after this.

403
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,900
That you'd never come back.

404
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,190
Okay.

405
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:55,100
It'll be over once we finish this.

406
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,690
I'll get out of your sight immediately, then.

407
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,370
Fine now?

408
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:07,700
By the way, isn't the night view here amazing?

409
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,850
Your taste is so obvious.

410
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,070
Are you done? Gosh.

411
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:19,130
Let's do the next one if you're done.

412
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:20,960
You're so strict.

413
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,600
Let's go do the next one. Hurry.

414
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,800
Hey, Kim Ram Woo. You're so weird.

415
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,860
We need to take this bike with us. 
    

416
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,430
♫  I realized I'm blessed  ♫

417
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:36,650
♫  When I held your hand  ♫

418
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,150
♫  The sky turned blue  ♫

419
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,420
   

420
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,560
   

421
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:48,650
♫  Time became too precious  ♫ 
 ♫  And the days started feeling short  ♫

422
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,320
♫  I fill my days with us instead  ♫ 
 ♫  I'd go back to day one, to the beginning  ♫

423
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,270
   

424
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:01,640
   

425
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,420
   

426
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:11,410
   

427
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:15,420
   

428
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:18,840
   

429
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,620
Hey. Wake me up when it's over.

430
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,830
How uncivilized.

431
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:26,720
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

432
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,750
I've been thinking.

433
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:52,050
A friend is better than a boyfriend.

434
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:53,370
About Jeong Hee Wan again?

435
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,950
How long could a high school romance last?

436
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:58,140
It's over once we graduate and go to college.

437
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,210
He'll have another girlfriend in college.

438
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:02,200
But they'll break up once he joins the army.

439
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,760
He'll get one again after he gets discharged.

440
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,020
But they say you break up when you start a job.

441
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,390
It keeps getting repeated.

442
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,230
But not with friends.

443
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,770
Which one is better in the long run?

444
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:15,220
- A friend. 
 - Sounds like self-justification.

445
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,920
But you make a good point.

446
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,300
And dating is too much of a hassle.

447
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,150
You need to celebrate the 100th and 200th days and the birthdays.

448
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:22,350
And the Pepero Day too.

449
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:23,900
There's Christmas too.

450
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,650
And you have to hold hands in summer when you're all sweaty.

451
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,820
- Gosh, I hate it. 
 - It's the worst.

452
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:30,500
I know.

453
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,400
Jeong Hee Wan and Bang Ji Soo won't last long either.

454
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,780
So, who's the winner in the end?

455
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,470
Me, who didn't confess my love.

456
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:40,080
There's Ji Soo and Jeong Hee Wan.

457
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:44,290
Wow, something about this looks romantic.

458
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:46,650
I bet she's confessing to him now.

459
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:50,960
Jeong Hee Wan is smiling.

460
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,000
He's smiling with those half-moon eyes.

461
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:58,640
But I'm sure they'll break up quickly, as you say.

462
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,850
Hey, your crutch!

463
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,550
 Hey, what are you doing? 

464
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:20,550
Move! Move!

465
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,010
No!

466
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,490
Unnie.

467
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,060
Is your leg okay?

468
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,640
Hey, where's your crutch?

469
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,690
Are you sure you're okay?

470
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:13,370
Unnie.

471
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:15,950
What did you mean, "no," by the way?

472
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,750
What?

473
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:21,470
Well, the thing is...

474
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,940
I like you, Kim Ram Woo.

475
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,400
   

476
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,970
What did you say?

477
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:40,760
I'm sorry. I like Ji Soo.

478
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,560
I feel uncomfortable, so I can't be friends with you anymore.

479
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,060
I want us to be strangers from now on.

480
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,460
No.

481
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,150
I like you. I like you, Ji Soo.

482
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,440
I can't let you have her.

483
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,580
   

484
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:03,730
I see.

485
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,680
I hope things work out between you two.

486
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,970
Gosh, Unnie!

487
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,360
That's why you've been doing that.

488
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,440
We'll stay friends forever, then, right?

489
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,120
No, no, no, no.

490
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,990
Gosh, Unnie! I almost humiliated myself.

491
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,200
You're a lifesaver, Unnie.

492
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,800
   

493
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:28,860
- Oh, my. 
 - I don't care if there's spinach in your teeth.

494
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,800
I still find you pretty.

495
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,140
No.

496
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,340
Are you kidding?

497
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,170
When will you play board games with me if you start dating?

498
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,880
   

499
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,000
Hey, I'm sorry.

500
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,930
Play with Kim Ram Woo from now on.

501
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,700
What?

502
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,730
This isn't it!

503
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:58,550
Gosh, look how romantic you two are.

504
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,880
This is way too cringe.

505
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,470
Where's an eye mask to cover my eyes?

506
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,830
An eye mask. I can't see this. No.

507
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,480
I'd rather cover my eyes and not see this.

508
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,700
Andae*. An andae to cover my eyes.
  (T/N: Andae = eye mask, sounds like "no") 

509
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,770
   

510
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,170
Unnie.

511
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:16,650
No matter how much I think, that makes...

512
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:19,180
 ...no sense. 

513
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,370
Unnie?

514
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,500
What? Well...

515
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,630
I...

516
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:27,670
Please. Just say something.

517
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,680
To be honest...

518
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,340
Kim Ram Woo!

519
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,560
Ma'am!

520
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,770
She got hit here.

521
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,780
She jumped off a bathroom window recently.

522
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:53,850
And I don't know what happened,

523
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,340
but she's acting strange.

524
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,250
She was normal before.

525
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:58,540
But she's been acting strange lately.

526
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:01,920
I looked it up. An extreme bipolar disorder...

527
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,910
 What's with Kim Ram Woo and Bang Ji Soo? 

528
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:27,120
 Did you see them? It was daebak. 

529
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,990
What happened?

530
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,370
It's over.

531
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:43,410
Right after he brought you here, Ji Soo...

532
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,550
confessed publicly.

533
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,890
Everyone was cheering. It was crazy.

534
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,570
I see.

535
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,300
That ended up happening.

536
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,750
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

537
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:04,540
Kim Ram Woo.

538
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,990
Are you okay?

539
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,580
Why did you skip the night study session?

540
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,320
Are you very sick? What did the nurse say?

541
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,540
Give me that. I'll carry it.

542
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,890
Gosh, what's with all the fuss?

543
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,690
Fuss? I'm worried.

544
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:21,110
You got hit by a soccer ball and fainted.

545
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:23,400
Did you have a concussion?

546
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,830
You said you write letters for people.

547
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,050
I closed down my business.

548
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,350
Closed down? Why?

549
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,150
I don't know.

550
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:39,440
Write one for me before you close it, then.

551
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,380
You know I have terrible handwriting.

552
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:43,840
It's an important letter.

553
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,320
   

554
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,840
30,000 won.

555
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,810
30,000 won? The others said it was 15,000 won.

556
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,330
I said it wrong. It's 40,000 won.

557
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:01,960
40...

558
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:05,960
It's more expensive than I thought.

559
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,310
Is there a friend discount, by chance?

560
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:23,640
Even just a bit...

561
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,500
Hey, after what you did,

562
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,390
I need to add 5,000 won for an MSB, okay?

563
00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:30,310
Hey, I closed business.

564
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,080
Be thankful I'm doing this for you.

565
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,480
What's MSB, by the way?

566
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,660
You don't have to know.

567
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:41,030
You mean as in "Ignore"?

568
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,880
Is it "Someone you hate"?

569
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:47,280
It's not "Ugly jerk", is it?

570
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,390
   

571
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,600
   

572
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,090
Why does he write letters in an old-fashioned way?

573
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,010
Does he think this kind of confession will work?

574
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:05,110
Gosh, why am I crying?

575
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:07,490
So annoying.

576
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,030
   

577
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,170
   

578
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:14,200
I have to write this again...

579
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:21,970
   

580
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,710
No.

581
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,790
I still need to be professional. Professional.

582
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,290
 Kim Ram Woo, are you crying? 

583
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,780
That whole bucket list thing.

584
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:43,150
Don't you think it's a marketing strategy?

585
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,020
What if a genius marketer started it to sell stuff?

586
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,680
I'll help him sell it, then.

587
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,840
 Come on over! 

588
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,260
He's calling us. Let's go.

589
00:35:51,260 --> 00:35:52,450
Hurry, hurry.

590
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,980
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

591
00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:00,110
It's too high up. Hold on.

592
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,460
Seriously.

593
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,510
Be honest.

594
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:08,460
You came to take revenge on me because you hate me, didn't you?

595
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,070
Why would I take revenge on you, Ram Woo?

596
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:13,400
Why are you doing this to me, then?

597
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,370
Come on. Stop talking to yourself.

598
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:19,340
They won't let you go, thinking you're a weird person.

599
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,070
Gosh, I hate it.

600
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:25,310
Hey, you look ridiculous right now.

601
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,710
Are you okay?

602
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:37,300
 I did have one of those things, too. 

603
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,710
 Something I wanted to do before I died. 

604
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,800
 I just didn't know it'd come true like this. 

605
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,800
 Whether it's an illusion my brain created 

606
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,450
 or a variation of my usual nightmare, 

607
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,340
 In any case, Kim Ram Woo is in front of me now. 

608
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,530
Great.

609
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:56,550
You're ready to go.

610
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:59,170
Will you not wear a helmet, by the way?

611
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:01,020
I guess you don't need to.

612
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,700
No, I don't need a helmet.

613
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,550
Because I'm not doing this.

614
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,670
- What? 
 - Next person, please.

615
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,490
- Yes! 
 - You're ready, right?

616
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,990
- Yes! 
 - One person, right?

617
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,970
What are you saying? We came because you wanted to ride it.

618
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:17,300
I can't ride this stuff.

619
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,970
Are you crazy?

620
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,070
Are you out of your mind?

621
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,560
- Let's go. Fighting, fighting! 
 - Wait a minute, Ahjussi.

622
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,340
Hold on! Hold on!

623
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,120
- Okay, okay! 
 - Hold on!

624
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,990
It's okay. Look over there. How fun!

625
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:30,530
- It looks so fun. 
 - Him, not me...

626
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,690
- Come back safe! 
 - It's okay, it's okay.

627
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,980
See you down there!

628
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,120
Don't cry. Don't cry.

629
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,250
It's okay!

630
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:38,390
It's not scary!

631
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:39,520
Hold on to it. Hold on.

632
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,230
- Run. Let's run. 
 - Wait, wait!

633
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:45,550
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!

634
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,570
It's okay! It's okay!

635
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:51,890
See you!

636
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:57,540
No, no, no.

637
00:37:58,650 --> 00:38:01,020
Hold on!

638
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:05,960
♫  Everything's so bright and  ♫

639
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,720
♫  I know oh oh oh  ♫

640
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,070
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

641
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,350
Wow, that was quick. 
    

642
00:38:15,350 --> 00:38:16,730
Since we're friends,

643
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,050
I made you a platinum tier one.

644
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,880
Thanks.

645
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:25,290
"Ji Soo"? 
    

646
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,440
Why "Ji Soo"?

647
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,120
J.S. Ji Soo.

648
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,050
Your girlfriend.

649
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,120
My girlfriend?

650
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,220
She's not.

651
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,030
J.S. is Jeong Sook.

652
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,110
"Jeong Sook"?

653
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,240
Who's Jeong Sook? What class is she in?

654
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,770
Jeong Sook is my mom.

655
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:45,350
What?

656
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:47,280
My mom.

657
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:50,350
She doesn't like her name. She thinks it's tacky.

658
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,060
You're confessing your love to your mom, not Ji Soo?

659
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,630
I'm not confessing my love.

660
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,340
It's a letter for my mom's birthday.

661
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:05,340
That's why you wrote, "You've worked hard all this time."

662
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,920
Yes.

663
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,100
Anyway, I just need to change the name in the beginning.

664
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,470
It's 45,000 won, right?

665
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,820
Hey, no, no, no.

666
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,200
Why bring money into our friendship?

667
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,490
Keep it. Keep it.

668
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,910
- No, but still— 
 - No, keep it.

669
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,740
Keep it.

670
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:23,490
Keep it.

671
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:26,020
- Thank you. 
 - Sure.

672
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,710
Hey, Jeong Hee Wan.

673
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,820
What about Ji Soo, then?

674
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,690
What about her confession?

675
00:39:37,690 --> 00:39:40,280
Why ask something like that? It's embarrassing.

676
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,940
I just apologized to her.

677
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,210
You apologized?

678
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,910
You turned her down?

679
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:47,130
Why would you turn Ji Soo down?

680
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,430
I need to focus on the college entrance exam now.

681
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:55,750
And I need to keep getting the scholarship.

682
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,270
I need to maintain my grades, too.

683
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,490
Gosh, seriously.

684
00:39:58,490 --> 00:39:59,900
Are you crazy?

685
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,830
I'm proud of you. You're so filial.

686
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,470
You'd win if you went on "Show Me the Money."

687
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:08,290
Ms. Jeong Sook must be so happy.

688
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,150
Give me that. I'll make you

689
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:13,900
a Gold Dragon Diamond version.

690
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,630
Hey...

691
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:18,860
It hurts.

692
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,380
Kim Ram Woo!

693
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,780
Gosh, hold on!

694
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,120
Stop!

695
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,340
Please, stop!

696
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:34,980
♫  I open my eyes to this spring  ♫

697
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,320
♫  All the words I once held back, the confessions I rehearsed  ♫

698
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,620
♫  All the words I once held back, the confessions I rehearsed  ♫

699
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:43,540
♫  Today, I want to tell them all to you  ♫

700
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:46,500
♫  It feels like you're coming to me by chance  ♫

701
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,570
♫  I can smell the scent of spring  ♫

702
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,910
♫  It seems you're coming along with it  ♫

703
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:53,730
♫  From far away, your scent drifts in  ♫

704
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:55,660
Seriously.

705
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,840
What have I done?

706
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,860
♫  This gentle feeling, this flutter  ♫

707
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,400
♫  Without realizing, it's suddenly spring  ♫

708
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,700
I do all sorts of things because of you.

709
00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:11,640
Kim Ram Woo?

710
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,420
Kim Ram Woo.

711
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:17,080
Kim Ram Woo?

712
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,630
Kim Ram Woo.

713
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:23,160
Kim Ram Woo.

714
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,730
Kim Ram Woo!

715
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:29,310
Hey...

716
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,140
Kim Ram Woo!

717
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,500
Kim Ram Woo!

718
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,140
Kim Ram Woo!

719
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:39,120
Where's Kim Ram Woo?

720
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:41,360
Where did he go?

721
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,110
Kim Ram Woo.

722
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:46,340
I'm right here.

723
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,310
Hey.

724
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:51,730
Did you think I disappeared?

725
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,180
Why are you so shocked?

726
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,840
You missed me while you were away from me, right?

727
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,340
Anyway, how was it?

728
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,260
It wasn't scary once you took off, right?

729
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:04,070
It was fun, right? You don't regret it, right?

730
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,100
It wasn't fun at all.

731
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:14,510
Hey, what will you do on your 100th day?

732
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,750
Not much.

733
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:17,070
We'll take a walk by the Han River

734
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,410
and we'll have pasta

735
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:22,120
at a restaurant with a night view.

736
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,120
Hey, that's so cheesy.

737
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,480
What do you mean?

738
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,230
I want to try all cheesy things.

739
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:29,230
I want to ride a tandem bike by the Han River.

740
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,380
I'll drink beer while watching a night view.

741
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:34,230
And I want to take a trip and do paragliding.

742
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,350
Paragliding?

743
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:39,010
I'll watch a classical concert like an adult, too.

744
00:42:39,010 --> 00:42:41,660
 - Wow!  
 - How sophisticated.

745
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,900
- It doesn't suit you. 
 - What else is there to do?

746
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:47,430
Why are you riding a tandem bike?

747
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,850
I'll ride it with my baby.

748
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,750
 - Baby! 
 - With my baby! 

749
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,090
 I'll ride it with my baby. 

750
00:42:55,090 --> 00:42:57,170
 - I'm losing my mind. 
 - Where's your baby? 

751
00:42:57,170 --> 00:42:58,270
 "My baby," she said. 

752
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,660
 I don't see her baby. 

753
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,010
 Has he even been born? 

754
00:43:01,010 --> 00:43:03,820
 Where's he? Right here? Where? 

755
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:07,580
♫  Take my hand  ♫

756
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:10,670
Seriously. Where's your baby?

757
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,900

00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,260
 Where's Jeong Hee Wan? 

766
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,770
 She hasn't come to school since two days ago. 

767
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,940
 It really must be her fault. 

768
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,200
 What do you mean? 

769
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,520
 Someone told me that. 

770
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,930
 Kim Ram Woo died because of Jeong Hee Wan. 

771
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,280
 Because of the name? 

772
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,070
 You're right. 

773
00:44:07,070 --> 00:44:09,680
 She suggested switching names first, too. 

774
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,540
 Right.
