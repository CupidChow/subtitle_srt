1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,796
(Gong Myoung)

2
00:00:02,797 --> 00:00:04,796
(Kim Min Ha)

3
00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,767
(Jung Gun Joo, Oh Woo Ri, Ko Chang Seok, Seo Young Hee)

4
00:00:06,807 --> 00:00:08,407
(And Shim Eun Kyung)

5
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:12,977
(Way Back Love)

6
00:00:21,117 --> 00:00:22,416
(Danger)

7
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:23,917
(Stop)

8
00:00:27,387 --> 00:00:28,427
(Stop)

9
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:28,787
The stars have all gone.

10
00:01:29,812 --> 00:01:31,187
They were pretty.

11
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:34,557
No.

12
00:01:35,857 --> 00:01:36,957
What do you mean "no?"

13
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:38,997
They haven't gone.

14
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:41,727
They're still all there. The sun's just too bright.

15
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,277
Imagine them.

16
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,307
Do you see them?

17
00:02:11,457 --> 00:02:12,657
I have one day left.

18
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:23,807
What's this?

19
00:02:25,007 --> 00:02:26,647
I want to do everything I can.

20
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:32,777
"Special Pilates deal, 8 sessions for 250 dollars."

21
00:02:33,717 --> 00:02:35,547
You're going to die doing Pilates?

22
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,116
(Say goodbye, go on a picnic with boxed meals...)

23
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,527
It's my bucket list.

24
00:02:45,427 --> 00:02:46,827
(Special Pilates Deal, 8 sessions for 250 dollars)

25
00:02:48,467 --> 00:02:50,737
I wasted most of my week,

26
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:54,566
but I still have one more day to say goodbye...

27
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:55,967
to the world.

28
00:02:58,077 --> 00:03:00,107
I want to do that before it's too late.

29
00:03:00,377 --> 00:03:01,477
Saying goodbye.

30
00:03:14,757 --> 00:03:16,257
Is it for your father?

31
00:03:16,527 --> 00:03:17,956
- Yes. - Then...

32
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,026
a black suit would be more practical.

33
00:03:20,027 --> 00:03:21,497
He will attend more funerals in the future.

34
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:24,897
Or would you like a brighter colour?

35
00:03:25,737 --> 00:03:27,066
No. I'll take this.

36
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,937
Okay. I'll pack it for you.

37
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:30,277
What should I get?

38
00:03:31,737 --> 00:03:33,077
Let's see.

39
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,246
(Ko Yeong Hyeon: Can we meet?)

40
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:42,687
(Ko Yeong Hyeon: I'm not a weirdo.)

41
00:03:47,027 --> 00:03:50,126
If you're just picking up scuba diving or snorkelling,

42
00:03:50,127 --> 00:03:52,796
short fins are easier on the legs and ankles...

43
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:55,397
when you're learning to kick.

44
00:04:06,707 --> 00:04:08,177
I won't cry.

45
00:04:10,147 --> 00:04:12,547
You can do this. Good luck.

46
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:15,917
See you.

47
00:04:24,557 --> 00:04:25,827
Dad.

48
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:27,967
Hee Ju. I'm back.

49
00:04:28,397 --> 00:04:30,266
Ta-da. Look at this.

50
00:04:30,267 --> 00:04:31,536
A surprise gift.

51
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,466
No pressure. I'd been saving up.

52
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,807
Designers all use these.

53
00:04:37,137 --> 00:04:38,336
- Let's do an unboxing. - Hurry up.

54
00:04:38,337 --> 00:04:40,447
No, Dad. Don't break the seal.

55
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,077
What? I'd like to see what it looks like too.

56
00:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,786
That's... You might want to get a refund.

57
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,686
I was bothered that you still use the laptop...

58
00:04:50,687 --> 00:04:52,916
I got you when you got into university.

59
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:53,956
You graduate soon,

60
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,656
so I decided to go all out.

61
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:58,026
I really don't need that.

62
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:00,027
As if you didn't need it.

63
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,426
You were crying when I called you. I asked why,

64
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:05,466
and you said it was because your laptop was useless.

65
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,966
- You'd lost all your assignments. - You believed that?

66
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,876
Hee Ju chipped in with savings...

67
00:05:09,877 --> 00:05:11,336
from her part-time job. Thank her.

68
00:05:11,337 --> 00:05:12,406
No worries.

69
00:05:12,407 --> 00:05:14,447
She'll repay the favour when I graduate.

70
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:16,377
That's two years away.

71
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:18,717
Start saving up if you think you have to.

72
00:05:25,357 --> 00:05:27,556
Why did you get me a suit?

73
00:05:27,557 --> 00:05:29,897
- It suits you. - Goodness.

74
00:05:31,157 --> 00:05:32,327
Just a moment.

75
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,336
He has been practising...

76
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:40,067
to play at our weddings.

77
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:41,637
- At our weddings? - Yes.

78
00:06:19,077 --> 00:06:20,107
What are you thinking about?

79
00:06:23,477 --> 00:06:24,717
My dad's present.

80
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,747
Should I have gotten him something on top of a suit?

81
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:32,917
A dye job.

82
00:06:33,587 --> 00:06:34,727
Darn it.

83
00:06:35,457 --> 00:06:38,197
I should've cared more and not just now.

84
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,197
Stop it.

85
00:06:42,227 --> 00:06:44,067
Let's do the next thing on the list.

86
00:06:44,367 --> 00:06:46,497
- The flyer... Here it is. - My gosh.

87
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,977
I've been looking up Honolulu restaurants all night.

88
00:06:50,337 --> 00:06:51,477
I didn't sleep.

89
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,907
I was too excited to sleep a wink.

90
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,777
My bus is here. Bye.

91
00:06:58,277 --> 00:06:59,616
What do you want to do?

92
00:06:59,617 --> 00:07:01,647
"Go on a picnic with boxed meals."

93
00:07:02,047 --> 00:07:04,287
"Stay at an amusement park from morning until night."

94
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,286
"Have gimbap all day."

95
00:07:06,287 --> 00:07:09,357
You called me childish, but you're just the same.

96
00:07:13,157 --> 00:07:14,927
Hey. Isn't that a passport?

97
00:07:21,037 --> 00:07:22,806
(Say goodbye, go on a picnic with boxed meals,)

98
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,006
(have gimbap all day,)

99
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:25,977
(do a good deed)

100
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:27,977
(Airport Railroad, Bus, Terminal 2)

101
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:31,917
(Terminal 2 Joint Government Building)

102
00:07:32,447 --> 00:07:33,547
What do I do?

103
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:39,187
Should we split up and look for her?

104
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:40,427
What?

105
00:07:40,657 --> 00:07:42,727
If I find her, I yell for you.

106
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:47,327
Okay. I'll go over there and look for her.

107
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:07,717
Wait.

108
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,746
- What are we going to do? - I don't know.

109
00:08:09,747 --> 00:08:12,657
Excuse me. Didn't you drop this?

110
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,297
Thank you!

111
00:08:18,827 --> 00:08:21,767
- Thank you. - Gosh, sure.

112
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,667
- Thank you so much. - Sure.

113
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,707
- Thank you. - Oh, my.

114
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:29,907
So you can go?

115
00:08:30,537 --> 00:08:31,877
Yes, I can.

116
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:43,117
- Gosh, I'm so sorry. - It's okay.

117
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:44,917
- We have time anyway. - Let's go.

118
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:53,797
I wonder what they're talking about.

119
00:08:57,167 --> 00:08:58,267
"Take care."

120
00:08:58,897 --> 00:09:00,037
"I'll miss you."

121
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:03,837
"I know I'm lying, but don't be too sad."

122
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,037
"Make sure to eat well."

123
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,007
"I told you not to cry."

124
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,777
"Are you sad you might not be able to date a guy as handsome as me?"

125
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:14,017
"Right? That will be a challenge."

126
00:09:15,047 --> 00:09:16,857
"Can't I just go with you?"

127
00:09:22,427 --> 00:09:23,597
"You must stay here."

128
00:09:23,727 --> 00:09:26,226
"Stay here and save this world."

129
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,327
"I don't want to."

130
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,027
"You're all I need."

131
00:09:29,127 --> 00:09:31,897
"How can a superhero say something so irresponsible like that?"

132
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,507
"It's impossible with just my superpower."

133
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,306
"I can't do this alone."

134
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,676
"You can do it without me. Don't forget."

135
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:40,847
"Even if you can't see me,"

136
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,917
"we'll always be together."

137
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,317
"Stay alive to the end."

138
00:09:50,117 --> 00:09:51,387
"And let's meet again."

139
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:55,657
"Can I leave this world in your hands now?"

140
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:57,597
"Yes."

141
00:09:58,757 --> 00:09:59,927
"Trust me."

142
00:10:02,027 --> 00:10:03,297
I wonder...

143
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,767
how it would have been for us if you didn't die.

144
00:10:08,137 --> 00:10:09,736
I wonder if we would've been a couple...

145
00:10:09,737 --> 00:10:11,307
displaying affection in public like them.

146
00:10:12,477 --> 00:10:14,407
- My gosh. - My goodness.

147
00:10:17,777 --> 00:10:20,316
Well, we would have been sick of each other...

148
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,146
and broken up a long time ago.

149
00:10:22,147 --> 00:10:25,486
We would have gone on typical dates like any other couple.

150
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:27,656
Then we would have fought over trivial matters and reconciled.

151
00:10:27,657 --> 00:10:29,887
Afterward, we would have been sick of each other and broken up.

152
00:10:30,057 --> 00:10:31,596
We could have had...

153
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,127
a relationship that wouldn't have been built to last.

154
00:10:34,397 --> 00:10:35,527
Are we...

155
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:41,037
still doing this because our time stopped after that night?

156
00:10:45,407 --> 00:10:47,907
But I don't think we would have fought a lot.

157
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:49,907
Mostly,

158
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,417
I would have been the patient one in the relationship.

159
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:56,546
As you know, I have a big heart and am thoughtful.

160
00:10:56,547 --> 00:10:57,887
I'm quite understanding.

161
00:10:58,017 --> 00:11:00,056
So you have a big heart, are understanding,

162
00:11:00,057 --> 00:11:01,126
and dull.

163
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:02,227
Unbelievable.

164
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:04,656
Hey, it's better to be dull.

165
00:11:04,657 --> 00:11:06,727
You would probably have caused me a lot of heartaches.

166
00:11:06,797 --> 00:11:08,727
Gosh, what's the point of talking about this?

167
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:12,097
We'll know once we try it.

168
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:17,076
"Go on a typical,"

169
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,877
"predictable date..."

170
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:22,947
"with Kim Ram Woo."

171
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,747
We have less than a day left, right?

172
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:28,387
Let's do this and see which one of us gets sick of the other.

173
00:11:30,017 --> 00:11:31,087
Okay.

174
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:32,857
Let's go.

175
00:11:34,057 --> 00:11:35,357
What do you want to do for our date first?

176
00:11:39,457 --> 00:11:41,597
- None? - Right, none.

177
00:11:51,937 --> 00:11:53,037
("Sweet Man")

178
00:11:54,077 --> 00:11:57,947
Erotic comic books are on a different level.

179
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:03,347
Could you hurry up? I want to read it too.

180
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,157
What?

181
00:12:08,087 --> 00:12:09,157
What is it?

182
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,726
Seriously? This is it.

183
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:13,726
It ended with a huge cliffhanger.

184
00:12:13,727 --> 00:12:15,267
I need Book 12.

185
00:12:17,897 --> 00:12:20,867
There are so many things I don't know about in this world.

186
00:12:21,067 --> 00:12:22,137
That's it.

187
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,307
Let's buy all of them. Pay for the books.

188
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,077
Let's go.

189
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:33,046
- Which flavour? Chocolate. Okay. - Chocolate, please.

190
00:12:33,047 --> 00:12:36,116
You must grab it quickly. How cute. Grab it now.

191
00:12:36,117 --> 00:12:38,916
- Grab it. You can't, can you? - Oh, no.

192
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,486
Grab it. You can't, can you?

193
00:12:40,487 --> 00:12:42,056
Grab it quickly.

194
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:44,226
- Sir. - Grab it. You can't, can you?

195
00:12:44,227 --> 00:12:45,926
- Sir, please stop it. - One, two.

196
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,696
- Come on. - Oh, my gosh. Okay.

197
00:12:47,697 --> 00:12:49,866
Thank you. Enjoy the ice cream.

198
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:50,867
Did you already finish that?

199
00:12:50,868 --> 00:12:53,237
I'm going to tell on you to Ram Woo. He's a scary man.

200
00:12:53,537 --> 00:12:54,567
(Fate Line)

201
00:12:56,937 --> 00:12:58,776
My gosh. It's working.

202
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,837
(Pick up the report here.)

203
00:13:01,177 --> 00:13:04,416
"By nature, you're generous and modest in ambition."

204
00:13:04,417 --> 00:13:06,446
"You often help people around you."

205
00:13:06,447 --> 00:13:07,486
"As you have a kind heart,"

206
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:09,516
"you struggle to pursue your own interest."

207
00:13:09,517 --> 00:13:11,786
"So you must avoid spending money extravagantly or out of vanity."

208
00:13:11,787 --> 00:13:13,017
"Extravagantly or out of vanity?"

209
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,056
Hey, you know what?

210
00:13:15,057 --> 00:13:17,296
I had a feeling when you were buying presents for your family.

211
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,766
Hey, look. It says, "You'll be a good fit..."

212
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,867
"with someone handsome, good-natured, and calm."

213
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,496
That's totally me. Right?

214
00:13:24,497 --> 00:13:26,066
No. This is so off. Look.

215
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:28,236
"Your life line is strong and well-developed."

216
00:13:28,237 --> 00:13:29,836
"You will live in luxury in your later years..."

217
00:13:29,837 --> 00:13:31,437
"thanks to your children."

218
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,577
I don't think this is right.

219
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,877
(Palm Reading)

220
00:13:46,187 --> 00:13:47,786
The life line.

221
00:13:47,787 --> 00:13:50,187
Hey, what are you doing? Hey.

222
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:53,557
I gave you an extension.

223
00:13:54,427 --> 00:13:56,826
I'll extend it. That's the one for intelligence.

224
00:13:56,827 --> 00:13:58,697
- Come on. Stop it. - Let me.

225
00:13:59,137 --> 00:14:01,367
- You should get one too. - Wait.

226
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:05,037
- What? - Hold on. I'm getting a call.

227
00:14:05,607 --> 00:14:06,976
(Ko Yeong Hyeon)

228
00:14:06,977 --> 00:14:08,077
It's her again?

229
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:10,207
Why does she keep calling me?

230
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,186
Answer it. She might have an urgent matter to discuss.

231
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,186
She keeps talking about the graduation exhibition.

232
00:14:16,187 --> 00:14:18,157
I told her I couldn't be part of it.

233
00:14:19,217 --> 00:14:20,257
Hello.

234
00:14:20,727 --> 00:14:22,386
Hello? Hee Wan.

235
00:14:22,387 --> 00:14:24,196
Hee Wan, where are you right now?

236
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,026
- I'm out. - You're out? Why?

237
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:27,167
Are you alone right now?

238
00:14:27,627 --> 00:14:28,897
Is something wrong?

239
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:30,497
Well...

240
00:14:31,137 --> 00:14:33,037
Yes. There's something.

241
00:14:33,597 --> 00:14:35,836
Today is the last day of our school festival.

242
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:37,237
So there will be fireworks.

243
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:38,377
Fireworks?

244
00:14:39,977 --> 00:14:41,207
Yes, that's right.

245
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:42,807
Fireworks.

246
00:14:42,808 --> 00:14:45,117
It's all included in our tuition fee.

247
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,016
Not watching it would be a waste, no?

248
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:48,047
But you see...

249
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,187
I already have plans.

250
00:14:51,717 --> 00:14:54,187
- Let me call you back. - What plans?

251
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,886
With whom, when, and where?

252
00:14:55,887 --> 00:14:58,256
Well... I have to hang up now.

253
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:00,156
Hee Wan. Sorry, I'm not angry at you.

254
00:15:00,157 --> 00:15:02,327
You haven't hung up yet, right?

255
00:15:02,767 --> 00:15:04,836
Today's lineup is no joke.

256
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,036
IVE is coming.

257
00:15:06,037 --> 00:15:08,007
You know, IVE, right? They sang "LOVE DIVE."

258
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,306
- They're the talk of the town. - I...

259
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:12,936
- Hurry up and come. - I can't be on the phone right now.

260
00:15:12,937 --> 00:15:14,347
- What? - I'll call you back.

261
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,207
Hee Wan. It's IVE. Hello?

262
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,747
Gosh.

263
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:21,047
She's a weirdo.

264
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:23,917
What?

265
00:15:35,497 --> 00:15:37,967
That darn grim reaper.

266
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:40,067
- Gosh. - Oh, my goodness!

267
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:41,966
- Oh, goodness. - Ram Woo,

268
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:43,067
are you all right?

269
00:15:46,677 --> 00:15:48,206
We once took a class together.

270
00:15:48,207 --> 00:15:50,577
You know at least one person at your school.

271
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:51,817
Right?

272
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,547
I'm sorry.

273
00:15:56,147 --> 00:15:57,387
Are you sure you can do this?

274
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,057
- Shall I leave this here? - Yes.

275
00:15:59,757 --> 00:16:01,327
Do you at least know her name?

276
00:16:02,287 --> 00:16:03,827
My name is Ko Yeong Hyeon.

277
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:07,727
(Design)

278
00:16:07,728 --> 00:16:08,897
- Oh, no. - Hey.

279
00:16:12,637 --> 00:16:13,697
This is bad.

280
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:18,237
That jerk.

281
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:32,557
Get lost!

282
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:37,497
What?

283
00:16:39,697 --> 00:16:41,197
What do I do?

284
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,666
You should use better-quality salt.

285
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:44,697
What?

286
00:16:46,037 --> 00:16:47,137
Get away!

287
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:51,837
Excuse me!

288
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:53,777
Ms. Senior!

289
00:16:54,477 --> 00:16:55,477
Ms. Senior!

290
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,877
Darn it.

291
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,147
Ms. Senior.

292
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:01,687
Why is it so cold today?

293
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:04,517
The weather will be fine throughout the festival.

294
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:06,917
It must be the cold snap.

295
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,687
Because of the cherry blossoms.

296
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:10,187
You're right.

297
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:11,926
But it's colder than usual this year,

298
00:17:11,927 --> 00:17:13,157
so the flowers are blooming late.

299
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:16,267
I knew it.

300
00:17:17,127 --> 00:17:18,997
You can see me, right? But how?

301
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,237
That's none of your business.

302
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:22,107
Life must've been tough.

303
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,477
It was because of punks like you.

304
00:17:24,677 --> 00:17:25,707
Now get lost.

305
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:27,307
Why should I?

306
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,217
I don't want to know, but I'll end up knowing too much.

307
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:33,547
So leave.

308
00:17:35,117 --> 00:17:36,147
Got it.

309
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,716
But because you threw salt at me,

310
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,386
I thought you wanted to talk.

311
00:17:41,387 --> 00:17:42,557
I bothered you for nothing.

312
00:17:43,057 --> 00:17:44,257
I'll take my leave now.

313
00:17:45,927 --> 00:17:47,057
Is it Jung Hee Wan?

314
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:50,697
No.

315
00:17:51,337 --> 00:17:53,067
Why are you following her around?

316
00:17:54,167 --> 00:17:55,637
Why would a grim reaper appear?

317
00:18:02,077 --> 00:18:03,546
(Daedong Festival)

318
00:18:03,547 --> 00:18:05,117
(Fireworks Scheduled at 9pm)

319
00:18:05,477 --> 00:18:06,677
Do you like fireworks?

320
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,657
It'd be nice to watch it together with someone.

321
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,457
What are you going on about?

322
00:18:15,187 --> 00:18:16,656
I wanted to watch the fireworks with her...

323
00:18:16,657 --> 00:18:18,097
if shooting stars were a no-go.

324
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:24,367
Anyway, think about who you want to watch the fireworks with.

325
00:18:24,637 --> 00:18:25,997
Hee Wan would be a nice choice.

326
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,107
Hi.

327
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:31,607
Is work going well?

328
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,807
Thank you.

329
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:34,506
Listen.

330
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:37,447
Can't you tell me where Jung Hee Wan lives?

331
00:18:37,577 --> 00:18:38,617
Jung Hee Wan?

332
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:40,987
She, Jung Hee Wan,

333
00:18:41,817 --> 00:18:42,946
bought the tools together...

334
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,317
but ghosted with the money.

335
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:47,686
Are you asking for her address?

336
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:48,687
Yes.

337
00:18:48,688 --> 00:18:49,827
It's personal information.

338
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:51,827
I know. Then...

339
00:18:52,727 --> 00:18:56,866
Can you tell me which direction she lives in?

340
00:18:56,867 --> 00:18:57,937
No.

341
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,637
And Jung Hee Wan didn't take a graduation photo, did she?

342
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:04,136
She wouldn't have carried out a group purchase.

343
00:19:04,137 --> 00:19:05,477
Maybe you have the wrong person.

344
00:19:05,607 --> 00:19:07,576
Hye Ran. It's an urgent matter.

345
00:19:07,577 --> 00:19:09,177
A person's life is at stake.

346
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:12,677
It's my life that's at stake, okay?

347
00:19:13,317 --> 00:19:16,087
You know I have to graduate, don't you?

348
00:19:16,417 --> 00:19:19,087
Yeong Hyeon. You're really desperate, aren't you?

349
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:25,697
The least you can do is stop the fireworks.

350
00:19:26,157 --> 00:19:27,996
Just don't do it, Hye Ran.

351
00:19:27,997 --> 00:19:29,826
What about the fireworks?

352
00:19:29,827 --> 00:19:31,097
It's being set up right now.

353
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:33,267
- For real? - Yes.

354
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,077
Darn it. I'm losing it here.

355
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:40,776
"View cherry blossom."

356
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:42,407
Failed because the flowers didn't bloom.

357
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:43,847
"Travel Northern Europe."

358
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,517
Failed because I didn't have time or a passport.

359
00:19:47,247 --> 00:19:49,317
"Call Tae Gyeong." I couldn't do this either.

360
00:19:51,987 --> 00:19:53,687
If only I had asked for her number.

361
00:20:02,897 --> 00:20:03,967
Listen.

362
00:20:05,497 --> 00:20:06,937
Did you see the shooting stars that day?

363
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:08,537
During the festival?

364
00:20:11,207 --> 00:20:12,237
I did.

365
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:14,847
What about you?

366
00:20:15,707 --> 00:20:16,707
I did too.

367
00:20:17,047 --> 00:20:18,147
Wasn't it pretty?

368
00:20:19,247 --> 00:20:20,247
It was.

369
00:20:22,147 --> 00:20:23,747
I wanted to watch it together.

370
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,196
Come to think of it, I didn't have that dream...

371
00:20:33,197 --> 00:20:34,727
the whole week we were together.

372
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:38,296
- What dream? - Remember the lost spot...

373
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:40,497
we split up at the Meteor Shower Festival?

374
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:43,507
Your back that I saw kept appearing in my dreams.

375
00:20:44,337 --> 00:20:47,747
In my dreams, I would send you there...

376
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,047
and realize something had happened a while later.

377
00:20:51,177 --> 00:20:52,577
I keep calling out for you...

378
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,287
to stop you from going there and wait for me.

379
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,757
When I barely make it and grab you,

380
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:03,057
you're not the one who turns around.

381
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,897
You can't imagine the relief I felt yesterday...

382
00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:11,267
when you were there and hadn't disappeared.

383
00:21:15,467 --> 00:21:16,907
I see.

384
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:21,977
Was that why you kissed me?

385
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:23,107
Stop it.

386
00:21:33,957 --> 00:21:34,957
By the way,

387
00:21:38,097 --> 00:21:39,597
how do I disappear?

388
00:21:42,397 --> 00:21:43,427
What?

389
00:21:44,597 --> 00:21:46,297
How do you disappear this time?

390
00:21:50,107 --> 00:21:51,677
Can we meet again?

391
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,587
Wait.

392
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:09,857
Hey, your bag's gone.

393
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:14,127
Hey!

394
00:22:14,227 --> 00:22:15,267
Hey.

395
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:21,837
- Hey. Wait. - Let's go.

396
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:25,237
Hey! Dang it.

397
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,547
Seriously.

398
00:22:28,907 --> 00:22:30,506
You're still a fast runner.

399
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:32,547
Seriously. Stop right there.

400
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,417
Why are we running?

401
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:37,757
Everything my dad gave me is in there.

402
00:22:39,717 --> 00:22:41,387
You don't need that anymore.

403
00:22:41,857 --> 00:22:42,957
Whatever. Hurry.

404
00:22:45,127 --> 00:22:46,157
Hurry.

405
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:56,737
(Yeongwol)

406
00:22:58,877 --> 00:22:59,977
("Sweet Man")

407
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:09,387
What is this? How can this happen?

408
00:23:20,057 --> 00:23:21,297
This is better.

409
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,447
So how am I going to die?

410
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:53,127
I choose it, don't I?

411
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:01,637
Kim Ram Woo.

412
00:24:07,407 --> 00:24:08,507
Kim Ram Woo.

413
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:11,747
I don't get it.

414
00:24:14,147 --> 00:24:15,847
Why do I make that choice?

415
00:24:17,447 --> 00:24:20,157
When I think about it, how did I not know?

416
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:25,197
To be honest, I don't know how to accept it.

417
00:24:28,397 --> 00:24:29,827
You already know.

418
00:24:32,397 --> 00:24:33,737
You don't want to die.

419
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,537
That's all you need.

420
00:24:36,837 --> 00:24:38,007
Don't die.

421
00:24:39,537 --> 00:24:40,607
And carry on.

422
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:50,487
Is that why you're here?

423
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,317
A week of vacation, was that your excuse?

424
00:24:54,017 --> 00:24:55,727
Are you here to stop me from dying?

425
00:24:58,857 --> 00:25:01,767
It wasn't an excuse. This was what I really wanted to do.

426
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,567
That you're here to save me?

427
00:25:06,897 --> 00:25:09,237
When you died because of me?

428
00:25:09,437 --> 00:25:11,206
I didn't die because of you, and...

429
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:12,877
What happens to you if I don't die?

430
00:25:16,077 --> 00:25:17,477
Do we never get to see each other again?

431
00:25:21,447 --> 00:25:23,216
Hey, look. The sun's setting.

432
00:25:23,217 --> 00:25:24,387
Don't change the subject.

433
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:27,887
Hey.

434
00:25:28,457 --> 00:25:30,726
Why would you want to see a grim reaper again?

435
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,627
Cut it out and answer me.

436
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:35,827
Do we never get to meet again?

437
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:41,567
Yes.

438
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,267
We'll never meet again.

439
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:49,007
I'm dead, and you're alive.

440
00:25:50,577 --> 00:25:52,147
And you'll continue to live.

441
00:25:55,447 --> 00:25:57,017
That's nonsense.

442
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,157
Ram Woo.

443
00:26:06,827 --> 00:26:09,497
Say you'll be better off. That you'll carry on.

444
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,837
Remember what you said?

445
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:16,737
That the time finally feels like it's flowing again.

446
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:20,307
That's all that matters.

447
00:26:21,777 --> 00:26:23,007
Don't forget that.

448
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:24,947
Keep that determination.

449
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:29,017
No.

450
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,887
I only said that because you were here.

451
00:26:39,327 --> 00:26:40,427
No.

452
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:42,467
You can do it without me.

453
00:26:42,927 --> 00:26:45,167
You and I made this week together.

454
00:26:46,167 --> 00:26:48,506
We had an ordinary and obvious date...

455
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,667
in a short time.

456
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:51,837
So...

457
00:26:53,137 --> 00:26:54,407
it's time to let me go.

458
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,347
Stop your nonsense.

459
00:26:58,777 --> 00:27:00,677
Remember the people you met at the airport?

460
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:03,487
They were all excited.

461
00:27:05,887 --> 00:27:09,387
I want you to carry on like them. In excitement.

462
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,757
Looking forward to seeing where you arrive.

463
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,827
I'm not ready yet.

464
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:19,567
There's so much I want to do with you.

465
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,766
You can do it from now on. I'll be watching you.

466
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:24,366
I have so much to say to you.

467
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:25,707
I'll be listening.

468
00:27:26,537 --> 00:27:27,707
Kim Ram Woo.

469
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:29,007
Yes, Kim Ram Woo.

470
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:34,947
Don't forget.

471
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,187
Everything we did together...

472
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:41,057
won't disappear.

473
00:27:42,987 --> 00:27:44,387
It's all inside you.

474
00:27:46,157 --> 00:27:47,257
You are...

475
00:27:55,307 --> 00:27:57,837
You're Jung Hee Wan and also Kim Ram Woo.

476
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:01,037
Please.

477
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:08,787
Please.

478
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:14,187
Please.

479
00:28:33,577 --> 00:28:34,577
Kim Ram Woo.

480
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:38,147
Kim Ram Woo.

481
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:42,687
Jung Hee Wan.

482
00:28:51,227 --> 00:28:52,457
Okay.

483
00:28:54,027 --> 00:28:55,727
Okay. I'll carry on.

484
00:28:56,397 --> 00:28:57,627
I'll be well off.

485
00:28:58,437 --> 00:28:59,967
Don't worry.

486
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:04,207
I'll live happily ever after.

487
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:07,107
Are you listening?

488
00:29:08,277 --> 00:29:10,507
I'll live happily. Are you listening?

489
00:29:13,047 --> 00:29:14,147
I'm sorry.

490
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:17,787
I need you.

491
00:29:23,657 --> 00:29:25,127
I can't do this.

492
00:29:25,627 --> 00:29:27,757
I don't think I can live without you.

493
00:29:31,697 --> 00:29:32,767
Don't go.

494
00:30:15,607 --> 00:30:17,747
(Kwon Yu Na, Kim Ram Woo)

495
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,827
Do you want to come with me?

496
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,567
Come with me. I have something to tell you.

497
00:30:40,337 --> 00:30:42,207
No. Just enjoy the event by yourself tonight.

498
00:30:56,547 --> 00:30:58,217
Jung Hee Wan.

499
00:30:58,987 --> 00:31:00,687
Jung Hee Wan. Wait.

500
00:31:00,857 --> 00:31:03,556
Jung Hee Wan! Stop!

501
00:31:03,557 --> 00:31:04,957
Wait. Jung Hee Wan!

502
00:31:05,857 --> 00:31:07,327
Wait! Jung Hee Wan!

503
00:31:47,637 --> 00:31:49,807
That's it. Now let's go see the gig.

504
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:51,476
When do the fireworks start?

505
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,176
This is the last show,

506
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,877
so at about 9pm, I guess?

507
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,277
Yeong Hyeon.

508
00:31:57,477 --> 00:31:58,616
Will you be at the after-party?

509
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,846
I don't know. I'm busy. Get lost.

510
00:32:00,847 --> 00:32:01,947
I know you'll come.

511
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:03,786
We meet at the railroad bar at 10pm.

512
00:32:03,787 --> 00:32:04,917
Ten dollars advance payment.

513
00:32:10,087 --> 00:32:11,826
Did you just say the railroad bar?

514
00:32:11,827 --> 00:32:13,957
Yes. It's where we always go.

515
00:32:14,497 --> 00:32:15,827
It's next to the crossing.

516
00:32:17,527 --> 00:32:18,997
(Stop)

517
00:32:28,307 --> 00:32:29,377
Yes.

518
00:32:29,947 --> 00:32:31,477
There's a crossing.

519
00:32:33,177 --> 00:32:34,417
She'll be near there.

520
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:38,687
(Go, Geu, Gak, Ga, Geot, Ge, Gwa, Gge)

521
00:32:45,957 --> 00:32:47,927
The fireworks.

522
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:50,227
The fireworks.

523
00:32:50,727 --> 00:32:51,797
The fireworks.

524
00:32:53,397 --> 00:32:54,937
The rail tracks.

525
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:57,237
(Stop)

526
00:33:09,347 --> 00:33:10,917
This is crazy.

527
00:33:11,587 --> 00:33:12,757
Darn it.

528
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:31,607
The cross.

529
00:34:15,187 --> 00:34:17,817
I couldn't do anything for you.

530
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,057
I couldn't say I was sorry.

531
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:23,427
I couldn't ask for forgiveness.

532
00:34:23,527 --> 00:34:24,857
Oh, no.

533
00:34:24,997 --> 00:34:26,897
You gave me everything.

534
00:34:27,797 --> 00:34:30,467
But yet again, I let you go.

535
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:35,806
No. Don't, Hee Wan.

536
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:38,307
- No. Don't do it. - How should I live without you?

537
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:42,907
- Hee Wan. - I looked back at the past week,

538
00:34:43,377 --> 00:34:45,517
and now, I can't go on without you.

539
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:46,747
Hey.

540
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:50,687
I'm sorry. I really am.

541
00:34:51,147 --> 00:34:53,717
And I'm so grateful.

542
00:34:56,657 --> 00:34:58,187
Jung Hee Wan.

543
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:08,537
Hee Wan. Wait.

544
00:35:09,137 --> 00:35:10,207
Hey.

545
00:35:10,807 --> 00:35:12,877
Hee Wan. You can't do this.

546
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:15,307
Don't do this.

547
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:19,747
Get down from there.

548
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:24,817
It's dangerous.

549
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:27,917
Let's talk.

550
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,757
Come down so we can chat.

551
00:35:30,927 --> 00:35:34,027
- What? - What can I say...

552
00:35:34,527 --> 00:35:37,897
to make you change your mind?

553
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:43,367
Hee Wan, when it comes to life, it's not that easy to...

554
00:35:44,867 --> 00:35:45,877
It's...

555
00:35:47,677 --> 00:35:49,547
Hee Wan. If you want to die...

556
00:35:51,747 --> 00:35:53,347
In order to die,

557
00:35:55,117 --> 00:35:56,647
you must suffer to death.

558
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:01,657
I bet that's how the grim reaper felt.

559
00:36:04,057 --> 00:36:05,257
What did you just say?

560
00:36:07,227 --> 00:36:08,327
Did you talk to Ram Woo?

561
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,127
How did you... When?

562
00:36:11,397 --> 00:36:13,337
Calm down, Hee Wan.

563
00:36:17,037 --> 00:36:18,837
He wants to see the fireworks with you.

564
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:22,647
If you die the way you want, it all ends.

565
00:36:23,847 --> 00:36:25,817
So does your suffering.

566
00:36:26,777 --> 00:36:28,787
That's true. But Hee Wan...

567
00:36:29,347 --> 00:36:31,917
Everything you experienced and remember.

568
00:36:33,187 --> 00:36:36,187
Everyone you miss and want to spend time with.

569
00:36:36,757 --> 00:36:39,827
They all disappear as well.

570
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:49,967
Hee Wan.

571
00:36:50,637 --> 00:36:51,677
Hee Wan.

572
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:54,177
No. Please don't do it.

573
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,247
Hee Wan. Wait.

574
00:36:59,977 --> 00:37:01,617
Jung Hee Wan.

575
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:04,017
Jung Hee Wan! Wait.

576
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,356
Jung Hee Wan!

577
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,886
Jung Hee Wan, wait a second!

578
00:37:06,887 --> 00:37:08,387
Wait. Jung Hee Wan!

579
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:10,757
Wait. Jung Hee Wan!

580
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,067
Kim Ram Woo.

581
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:30,407
Kim Ram Woo.

582
00:37:34,277 --> 00:37:36,787
There are 30 seconds left. Let's watch the fireworks together.

583
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:30,267
Watching the fireworks with you makes them even more beautiful,

584
00:38:30,767 --> 00:38:31,777
right?

585
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:33,577
Yes. They're beautiful.

586
00:39:17,147 --> 00:39:18,347
I told you, didn't I?

587
00:39:19,417 --> 00:39:20,417
See?

588
00:39:20,418 --> 00:39:22,457
You would have caused me a lot of heartaches.

589
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:24,457
Kim Ram Woo.

590
00:39:25,057 --> 00:39:26,257
But you're also Jung Hee Wan.

591
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:28,097
So you're both Kim Ram Woo and Jung Hee Wan.

592
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:31,567
I'm sorry.

593
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:35,067
I lost you twice.

594
00:39:40,537 --> 00:39:41,607
You didn't lose me.

595
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,607
You just can't see me.

596
00:39:45,217 --> 00:39:46,947
I'm sure you wanted to live.

597
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,247
You didn't have a choice.

598
00:39:51,587 --> 00:39:53,717
I couldn't save you. Not even once.

599
00:39:55,257 --> 00:39:56,587
I'm sorry, Ram Woo.

600
00:39:58,057 --> 00:39:59,527
I'm so sorry,

601
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,067
Jung Hee Wan.

602
00:40:03,367 --> 00:40:04,427
You understand it now, right?

603
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:07,197
Saving you...

604
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:10,407
is saving myself.

605
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,407
I'll be off now.

606
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,717
Keep living until the end.

607
00:40:19,877 --> 00:40:20,877
So...

608
00:40:22,347 --> 00:40:23,417
let's meet again.

609
00:40:25,357 --> 00:40:26,557
Can I leave this world...

610
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:29,157
in your hands now?

611
00:40:30,357 --> 00:40:31,587
You can count on me.

612
00:40:51,947 --> 00:40:53,017
Kim Ram Woo.

613
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:55,317
Kim Ram Woo.

614
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:57,847
Kim Ram Woo.

615
00:41:29,517 --> 00:41:30,547
Goodbye.

616
00:41:34,717 --> 00:41:35,757
Bye.

617
00:42:05,887 --> 00:42:07,316
- My gosh. - Hey.

618
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:08,956
- Yes. I was supposed to... - Don't touch it with your hands.

619
00:42:08,957 --> 00:42:11,056
- wear ear covers. - No. It didn't get on your ears.

620
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,427
Come on. Why are you using that?

621
00:42:12,527 --> 00:42:19,467
(Do you want to go and see the cherry blossoms?)

622
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:32,177
I'm so sleepy.

623
00:42:34,747 --> 00:42:35,787
Darn it.

624
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:41,317
Hey.

625
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,457
I need to graduate this year.

626
00:42:44,327 --> 00:42:46,697
How can I focus on my assignments in this weather?

627
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:48,497
I need to graduate too.

628
00:42:48,727 --> 00:42:50,167
You and I aren't the same.

629
00:42:52,667 --> 00:42:54,936
You probably want to pass on your first try.

630
00:42:54,937 --> 00:42:57,406
If you don't, you'll be so miserable.

631
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,706
It's going to be awful for you.

632
00:42:58,707 --> 00:42:59,977
Hey, you.

633
00:43:00,507 --> 00:43:02,307
Does seniority not matter to you?

634
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:04,747
Seriously.

635
00:43:06,847 --> 00:43:08,077
How beautiful.

636
00:43:11,587 --> 00:43:13,217
Spring is the toughest.

637
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:15,857
When everything is shining vibrantly,

638
00:43:16,657 --> 00:43:18,257
you feel as if you're the only one feeling gloomy.

639
00:43:20,657 --> 00:43:23,067
Actually, you wouldn't be the only one.

640
00:43:23,827 --> 00:43:26,867
It might seem other people are easily moving on,

641
00:43:26,997 --> 00:43:28,597
but it's just their facade. Deep down, they're the same.

642
00:43:32,677 --> 00:43:33,937
I think the grim reaper...

643
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:36,107
knew that.

644
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:37,877
Hey!

645
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:41,546
Try to make some sense. You're a grim reaper.

646
00:43:41,547 --> 00:43:42,887
What's your deal with Jung Hee Wan?

647
00:43:43,147 --> 00:43:45,047
I think you and Kim Ram Woo will hit it off.

648
00:43:45,317 --> 00:43:47,317
What? Kim Ram Woo?

649
00:43:47,987 --> 00:43:49,887
Who's Kim Ram Woo?

650
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:52,857
So why are you talking to me of all people?

651
00:43:53,257 --> 00:43:55,497
Because you seem to understand the pain of being left behind.

652
00:43:57,897 --> 00:44:00,767
Isn't that why you couldn't turn a blind eye to Kim Ram Woo?

653
00:44:04,467 --> 00:44:05,877
Take good care of her, okay?

654
00:44:09,977 --> 00:44:13,277
I can never get used to being left behind.

655
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:14,777
I'd be okay,

656
00:44:16,247 --> 00:44:18,417
but then again, I'd sometimes return to that moment.

657
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,187
When someone disappears from this world,

658
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:25,827
you're left with a hole this big.

659
00:44:26,627 --> 00:44:29,267
But memories with that person remain.

660
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,197
You just live with that hole.

661
00:44:32,767 --> 00:44:34,237
That's what loss is like.

662
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:37,937
It gets clearer the more you try not to forget.

663
00:44:38,807 --> 00:44:40,707
Even if years pass...

664
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,507
and spring comes again, it won't end.

665
00:44:51,347 --> 00:44:52,717
That's not bad.

666
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:56,157
- Sorry? - The hole.

667
00:44:59,457 --> 00:45:01,157
You can live embracing it.

668
00:45:04,227 --> 00:45:05,267
Well...

669
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:07,536
I think leaving it in a drawer...

670
00:45:07,537 --> 00:45:10,507
and taking it out every now and then isn't bad.

671
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,617
Let's see. Here it is.

672
00:45:21,147 --> 00:45:24,216
Here. I took it during the festival.

673
00:45:24,217 --> 00:45:27,917
I can finally give it to you after you dropped it.

674
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,697
Hi, Kim Ram Woo, who was called Jung Hee Wan.

675
00:45:36,197 --> 00:45:37,227
It's me.

676
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:40,937
Are you doing well?

677
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:42,607
It seems like it.

678
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:45,267
You often appear in my dreams these days.

679
00:45:48,137 --> 00:45:50,907
There are times when I think your appearance isn't real.

680
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:55,047
But at times like that,

681
00:45:55,147 --> 00:45:57,917
the traces you were here show up as a gift.

682
00:46:00,217 --> 00:46:02,057
The sand inside my shoes.

683
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,287
The photo of us together.

684
00:46:06,327 --> 00:46:07,456
(Kim Ram Woo)

685
00:46:07,457 --> 00:46:10,267
The scribble you left on my yearbook.

686
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:15,267
There's also a gift I received after you left.

687
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:17,937
(Tae Gyeong)

688
00:46:18,767 --> 00:46:19,806
Hey.

689
00:46:19,807 --> 00:46:22,106
There's an early bird ticket from Incheon to Honolulu.

690
00:46:22,107 --> 00:46:24,376
- Get that ticket. - I got in touch with Tae Gyeong.

691
00:46:24,377 --> 00:46:27,846
You see, Hee Ju wanted to do free diving.

692
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:30,746
- We made a three-month payment. - What about the flight ticket?

693
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,146
You promised to come.

694
00:46:32,147 --> 00:46:34,386
Ta-da. I got my passport.

695
00:46:34,387 --> 00:46:36,056
Did you not have one until now?

696
00:46:36,057 --> 00:46:38,256
Hey. Are you bragging about living in Hawaii?

697
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:39,997
I also have a new habit.

698
00:46:40,627 --> 00:46:43,326
These days, I often ask how people are doing.

699
00:46:43,327 --> 00:46:44,467
(Just try living.)

700
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:56,776
Dad's goal is to get to the finals of the upcoming...

701
00:46:56,777 --> 00:46:58,307
saxophone amateur contest.

702
00:46:58,907 --> 00:47:01,947
As for me, I will learn free diving as per Hee Ju's request.

703
00:47:05,047 --> 00:47:06,887
Hong Seok must've passed the exam.

704
00:47:06,987 --> 00:47:09,726
He's working out for next month's muscle firefighter...

705
00:47:09,727 --> 00:47:11,227
calendar cover shoot.

706
00:47:11,387 --> 00:47:12,557
But we'll see about that.

707
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:15,297
(Visual Design Graduation Exhibition)

708
00:47:17,567 --> 00:47:21,237
The most important event is my graduation exhibition.

709
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,337
I couldn't think of anything to draw.

710
00:47:26,307 --> 00:47:28,007
But guess what I found.

711
00:47:29,307 --> 00:47:31,046
(Even if we see each other often,)

712
00:47:31,047 --> 00:47:32,616
(getting my feelings through isn't easy.)

713
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:34,847
Your handwriting amazes me every time.

714
00:47:38,747 --> 00:47:41,186
For example, the "O" you write...

715
00:47:41,187 --> 00:47:42,827
looks like a flat peach.

716
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,856
For some letters, I couldn't tell if it was a consonant or a vowel.

717
00:47:46,857 --> 00:47:48,957
(Happy birthday.)

718
00:48:00,537 --> 00:48:04,677
(Hongmin University Visual Design Graduation Exhibition)

719
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:07,217
(Hongmin University Visual Design Graduation Exhibition)

720
00:48:09,187 --> 00:48:11,317
(Because everything is real.)

721
00:48:12,617 --> 00:48:13,717
Hee Wan.

722
00:48:14,187 --> 00:48:16,057
- Dad. Hee Ju. - My gosh.

723
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,657
- Dad. - Great work until now.

724
00:48:19,357 --> 00:48:21,796
- Congratulations, Hee Wan. - Welcome.

725
00:48:21,797 --> 00:48:23,466
- Is this the one? - Yes.

726
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,467
- What pretty handwriting. - Is this your work?

727
00:48:25,497 --> 00:48:26,537
I made it.

728
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:28,037
Honestly,

729
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:30,067
your work is the best.

730
00:48:30,267 --> 00:48:32,637
Don't say that anywhere else, okay?

731
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:33,807
Hush.

732
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:42,987
(Because everything is real.)

733
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:46,657
Neither flowers nor green leaves...

734
00:48:47,317 --> 00:48:48,417
come back.

735
00:48:49,887 --> 00:48:51,157
There are new flowers...

736
00:48:51,827 --> 00:48:54,297
and new green leaves.

737
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:58,467
And the cosy days ahead are new.

738
00:48:59,867 --> 00:49:01,797
Nothing comes back.

739
00:49:02,367 --> 00:49:04,207
Nothing repeats.

740
00:49:06,237 --> 00:49:07,877
Because everything is real.

741
00:49:39,837 --> 00:49:42,847
But now, I don't want to change anything.

742
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:44,907
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

743
00:49:49,147 --> 00:49:50,186
Hey.

744
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:53,186
Everything happened to us for real.

745
00:49:53,187 --> 00:49:55,016
(But Kim Ram Woo...)

746
00:49:55,017 --> 00:49:56,357
(And yesterday...)

747
00:49:57,257 --> 00:49:58,827
As long as I remember,

748
00:49:59,057 --> 00:50:01,457
that truth will never disappear.

749
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,367
(Jung Hee Wan)

750
00:50:14,377 --> 00:50:15,777
I'll remember you.

751
00:50:16,707 --> 00:50:17,807
I'll...

752
00:50:18,547 --> 00:50:19,677
live on.

753
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:25,787
To us, loving myself...

754
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:28,417
means loving you.
