(Stop)

00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:35,782

(Electricity Bill, Jung Hee Wan)

10
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:05,955
You died that day.

11
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:08,255
Four years ago.

12
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:10,225
Yes.

13
00:01:11,455 --> 00:01:13,765
But I came because I had to say something.

14
00:01:14,065 --> 00:01:15,065
Kim Ram Woo.

15
00:01:17,295 --> 00:01:19,465
You will die a week from now.

16
00:01:21,365 --> 00:01:22,405
What?

17
00:01:22,535 --> 00:01:26,075
You will die 176 hours 12 minutes and 35 seconds later.

18
00:01:26,645 --> 00:01:28,945
I will die? Next week?

19
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:30,415
Yes.

20
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,015
How do you know that?

21
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:33,615
Are you a grim reaper?

22
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:34,885
Yes.

23
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:16,425
I'll leave it by the door, then.

24
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,664
- Hey, mister. Wait. - What for?

25
00:02:19,665 --> 00:02:21,925
Can you help me? A weirdo's in my house.

26
00:02:22,295 --> 00:02:23,295
What?

27
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:25,635
- Call the police, then. - Well...

28
00:02:26,365 --> 00:02:28,065
- What can a courier do? - Thanks.

29
00:02:30,575 --> 00:02:31,605
Watch out.

30
00:02:36,445 --> 00:02:37,745
Is he hiding in the bathroom?

31
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,284
He's standing right in front of you.

32
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:42,515
- Where? - This guy right here.

33
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:43,955
What?

34
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:46,924
There is no guy right here.

35
00:02:46,925 --> 00:02:49,595
He can't see me, so don't waste your time.

36
00:02:50,225 --> 00:02:53,095
My gosh. He has so long left to live.

37
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:55,995
Good for you. You'll live to be very old.

38
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:57,395
- You don't hear that? - What?

39
00:02:57,695 --> 00:02:58,795
Hear what?

40
00:03:05,535 --> 00:03:07,205
- I'm dead busy. - You won't die.

41
00:03:07,305 --> 00:03:08,605
Well, the thing is...

42
00:03:08,975 --> 00:03:11,245
- I'm sorry, but... - Forget it.

43
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,115
Does she think I'm someone who runs errands?

44
00:03:13,145 --> 00:03:14,185
Sorry.

45
00:03:15,685 --> 00:03:18,254
Hello? Can I talk to the doctor?

46
00:03:18,255 --> 00:03:19,455
I'm Jung Hee Wan.

47
00:03:19,855 --> 00:03:21,225
It's really urgent.

48
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:23,324
The medicine I was prescribed.

49
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:25,425
Do any of them cause hallucinations?

50
00:03:25,795 --> 00:03:26,925
They do, right?

51
00:03:27,195 --> 00:03:29,634
Did you check every single medication...

52
00:03:29,635 --> 00:03:30,635
Yes.

53
00:03:30,636 --> 00:03:33,935
The average person needs 2 to 3 hours to come around.

54
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:39,005
Later on, you'll look back and regret wasting time doing this.

55
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,405
You'll have so many regrets once you die.

56
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,215
If you need advice on...

57
00:03:53,855 --> 00:03:54,855
Excuse me.

58
00:03:54,856 --> 00:03:55,925
(Buddhist text)

59
00:03:56,025 --> 00:03:57,154
Excuse me?

60
00:03:57,155 --> 00:03:58,295
(Buddhist text)

61
00:03:58,595 --> 00:03:59,725
I have...

62
00:04:00,095 --> 00:04:01,824
a few years of experience,

63
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,665
so stuff like this is nothing but background noise.

64
00:04:08,205 --> 00:04:09,705
Have you come around?

65
00:04:10,835 --> 00:04:13,205
Then let's do some cleaning up.

66
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:15,844
Look at all this food.

67
00:04:15,845 --> 00:04:17,315
You haven't touched a thing.

68
00:04:17,615 --> 00:04:19,814
How heartbroken would your dad and Hee Ju be...

69
00:04:19,815 --> 00:04:21,185
if they saw this after you died?

70
00:04:23,215 --> 00:04:24,285
Who are you?

71
00:04:25,485 --> 00:04:27,225
What? I'm Hee Wan.

72
00:04:27,425 --> 00:04:28,825
Cut the crap.

73
00:04:28,885 --> 00:04:31,194
If you say my name once more, I'll beat you up.

74
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:32,854
I'm Jung Hee Wan.

75
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,264
You're Kim Ram Woo.

76
00:04:34,265 --> 00:04:35,265
I don't believe this.

77
00:04:35,266 --> 00:04:38,835
You're the one who insisted we swap names.

78
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:45,935
Our yearbook.

79
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:51,315
Don't you remember using stickers to correct our names?

80
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:53,185
We had to stay back for a month to clean the school.

81
00:04:53,645 --> 00:04:54,785
Here you are.

82
00:04:55,415 --> 00:04:57,815
All the trouble I went to stick...

83
00:04:58,085 --> 00:04:59,615
(Kim Ram Woo)

84
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:03,425
Kim Ram Woo.

85
00:05:04,155 --> 00:05:05,195
What?

86
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,775
Salt. Chicken blood.

87
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,535
I was assaulted with everything.

88
00:05:24,045 --> 00:05:25,175
A fire extinguisher.

89
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:27,445
That's new.

90
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:31,015
Kim Ram Woo.

91
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:32,955
What?

92
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:34,585
Do you know Bang Ji Su?

93
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,495
- Who? - Tenth-grader Bang Ji Su.

94
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:38,255
She's looking for you.

95
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:41,825
The hair product commercial girl.

96
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:46,035
Oh, her.

97
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:53,645
I have dreadful handwriting.

98
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:56,944
I saw the letter you wrote for my friend.

99
00:05:56,945 --> 00:05:59,785
It was so nice and pretty.

100
00:06:00,345 --> 00:06:02,215
I see word spread far and wide.

101
00:06:02,715 --> 00:06:04,084
Is it a love letter?

102
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:07,185
There are four prices, each for the basic,

103
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:09,955
premium, special, or platinum design.

104
00:06:10,025 --> 00:06:11,095
Platinum, please.

105
00:06:11,255 --> 00:06:13,494
That's a bit expensive.

106
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:14,495
That's fine.

107
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:15,765
It's 30 dollars.

108
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:16,965
That's fine.

109
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,064
Can I have it next week?

110
00:06:21,065 --> 00:06:23,405
That's when I'm going to say I like him.

111
00:06:23,535 --> 00:06:24,634
If we start dating then,

112
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,145
Christmas will be our 100th day together.

113
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:30,245
Him rejecting your proposal...

114
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:31,744
isn't an option for you?

115
00:06:31,745 --> 00:06:33,584
Well...

116
00:06:33,585 --> 00:06:34,645
No.

117
00:06:35,815 --> 00:06:38,015
- Here's the letter. - Okay.

118
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:42,284
"Your dizzying good looks,"

119
00:06:42,285 --> 00:06:43,855
"your smile that makes my heart race."

120
00:06:44,595 --> 00:06:46,595
There's someone this handsome at our school?

121
00:06:46,965 --> 00:06:48,425
"I don't usually approach..."

122
00:06:50,965 --> 00:06:52,335
"Just you, Ram Woo?"

123
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:53,835
Yes.

124
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:55,665
Kim Ram Woo.

125
00:06:56,975 --> 00:06:58,034
Not you.

126
00:06:58,035 --> 00:07:00,705
Kim Ram Woo who goes by Jung Hee Wan.

127
00:07:01,875 --> 00:07:03,945
This letter is for Kim Ram Woo?

128
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:05,245
The Kim Ram Woo I know?

129
00:07:05,275 --> 00:07:06,585
Yes. Why?

130
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:08,715
Is that a problem?

131
00:07:09,985 --> 00:07:12,415
No, there's no problem.

132
00:07:12,715 --> 00:07:14,684
I'm just not sure...

133
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:17,755
if Ram Woo likes stuff like this.

134
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,255
Does he not?

135
00:07:19,655 --> 00:07:21,664
Should I skip the whole letter thing...

136
00:07:21,665 --> 00:07:23,365
and ask him out to his face?

137
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,465
No, don't do that. A letter's fine.

138
00:07:27,565 --> 00:07:29,465
A letter would be perfect.

139
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:32,405
Written words get the message across with more meaning.

140
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:33,505
It's perfect.

141
00:07:33,506 --> 00:07:34,675
Okay, then.

142
00:07:35,405 --> 00:07:36,615
Then here is...

143
00:07:37,275 --> 00:07:38,345
your 30 dollars.

144
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:43,285
Wait!

145
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:46,985
Yes? What is it?

146
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:55,024
You can choose from modern, classic, petit, or lovely.

147
00:07:55,025 --> 00:07:56,125
What do you want?

148
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:00,434
Since you're closest to Ram Woo,

149
00:08:00,435 --> 00:08:02,865
pick whatever theme you think he'll like.

150
00:08:02,965 --> 00:08:03,975
Good luck.

151
00:08:05,205 --> 00:08:06,235
Good luck.

152
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:10,644
(My dear Ram Woo)

153
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:12,644
"Your dizzying good looks?"

154
00:08:12,645 --> 00:08:16,144
You stay up every night thinking of him too?

155
00:08:16,145 --> 00:08:17,985
Quit drinking coffee, then.

156
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:27,525
Darn it.

157
00:08:28,725 --> 00:08:30,134
It's so annoying.

158
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:32,335
(18th, Bang Ji Su's D-day)

159
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:39,405
Kim Ram Woo.

160
00:08:45,315 --> 00:08:47,145
What's up with you? Are you a zombie?

161
00:08:48,015 --> 00:08:49,015
What?

162
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,785
She's outside.

163
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,455
Bang Ji Su?

164
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:57,324
Just write out what she asked.

165
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:58,325
No.

166
00:08:58,825 --> 00:09:01,464
Tell her I'm ill. No, tell her I went to the toilet.

167
00:09:01,465 --> 00:09:04,435
No, wait. Tell her I didn't come to school today.

168
00:09:05,595 --> 00:09:07,435
She can't see my face if I do this.

169
00:09:07,635 --> 00:09:09,165
I'm not here today, okay?

170
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:10,635
Not a word.

171
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:17,945
Get her for me.

172
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:22,585
She's not here today.

173
00:09:22,785 --> 00:09:23,855
She went to the teachers' office.

174
00:09:24,255 --> 00:09:25,355
She went to the infirmary.

175
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:28,055
She was in a car accident and was admitted to a hospital.

176
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,995
- Tae Gyeong. - Will...

177
00:09:30,725 --> 00:09:33,095
Will you believe me if I say she transferred away?

178
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,175
Darn it.

179
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,905
My gosh.

180
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,145
How long do we have to do this for?

181
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,815
I feel so sorry for you.

182
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:54,884
Why do this when you can just write it in no time?

183
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,545
I don't know. She wants the platinum package,

184
00:09:56,855 --> 00:09:58,915
and I just don't have any ideas.

185
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,655
Don't you think Ji Su's nothing without her hair?

186
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:06,325
No. Is her hair nothing without that face?

187
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:10,265
This is madness.

188
00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:12,095
Ask him out yourself.

189
00:10:13,065 --> 00:10:14,135
What?

190
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:17,675
Why would you say that? Are you insane?

191
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:19,074
Don't drag this out.

192
00:10:19,075 --> 00:10:21,274
Ask him out and get rejected.

193
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,904
The more miserable your love life is,

194
00:10:22,905 --> 00:10:24,974
the greater stepping stone it can become.

195
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,984
Singers release their greatest hits after a breakup.

196
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:28,514
What are you talking about?

197
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:29,585
Take that back.

198
00:10:29,985 --> 00:10:31,755
- Take it back right now. - Hee Wan!

199
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,524
- Hey, the cup noodles... - Go.

200
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:36,794
- I'll be right back. - Go, now.

201
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:38,994
- Get out of here. - No, Hee Wan. Wait.

202
00:10:38,995 --> 00:10:41,625
- Hee Wan! Wait. - Go!

203
00:11:05,015 --> 00:11:06,015
Hey.

204
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:10,555
She was right here.

205
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:12,625
Wait.

206
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:19,735
Hey!

207
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:23,435
- Let's go! - Run!

208
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:26,075
- What the heck? - My gosh.

209
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,245
Darn it.

210
00:11:28,575 --> 00:11:29,945
Hee Wan.

211
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,345
Hee Wan?

212
00:11:41,555 --> 00:11:42,585
What?

213
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,705
- Oh, no. - This is a habit of hers.

214
00:11:55,905 --> 00:11:57,534
- Did she really jump? - My gosh.

215
00:11:57,535 --> 00:11:59,235
- Is she okay? - What's going on?

216
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:03,345
Hello, this is Hee Wan Tang.

217
00:12:05,145 --> 00:12:06,245
A suicide attempt?

218
00:12:06,815 --> 00:12:07,914
Dad!

219
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:09,485
What's going on?

220
00:12:09,515 --> 00:12:12,985
She looked so cheerful and carefree the last time we met.

221
00:12:13,015 --> 00:12:14,685
She still doesn't have a worry in the world.

222
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:17,825
- How can you say that? - I mean...

223
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:20,725
she does weird stuff you can never imagine.

224
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:26,635
You talk as if you didn't care at all.

225
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:27,935
People who struggle...

226
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:31,175
pretend to be extra cheerful...

227
00:12:31,705 --> 00:12:34,605
to hide how they really feel.

228
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:39,575
Did Ram Woo try to off herself?

229
00:12:40,115 --> 00:12:41,445
Is Ram Woo okay?

230
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:43,415
- Is something wrong? - I don't know.

231
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:44,885
Me neither.

232
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:53,225
If there's anything I can do to help, tell me.

233
00:13:01,965 --> 00:13:03,935
She has lost her mind.

234
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:06,945
I think she went insane.

235
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:12,614
Everyone thought you were out of your mind.

236
00:13:12,615 --> 00:13:14,045
We were so worried.

237
00:13:14,785 --> 00:13:15,944
Where are we going?

238
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,485
"We" are not going anywhere.

239
00:13:19,915 --> 00:13:21,655
Why am I even talking to you?

240
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:26,024
- Accept the fact. - Darn it.

241
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:27,264
You're not crazy.

242
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,994
- I'm a grim reaper. - I don't hear you.

243
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:31,694
- I don't hear you. - She must be crazy.

244
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:33,194
I don't.

245
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:34,934
(Aperion Spa Land, Customer Instructions)

246
00:13:34,935 --> 00:13:36,165
- Welcome. - Hello.

247
00:13:37,135 --> 00:13:38,205
One adult, please.

248
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:40,135
The doors are closing.

249
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:42,205
I see you're still as smart.

250
00:14:19,675 --> 00:14:22,015
Why are you even more down after the bath?

251
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:28,155
I feel clean and refreshed for once.

252
00:14:28,525 --> 00:14:29,784
I felt lethargic,

253
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,795
but the bath was a lifesaver.

254
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:35,665
Was that a weird word to use for a dead guy?

255
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:40,195
Let's say I'll actually die.

256
00:14:40,935 --> 00:14:43,005
Why do you have to be the one to tell me?

257
00:14:43,535 --> 00:14:44,575
Well...

258
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,445
Call it a favour from a friend.

259
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:52,345
- Let's say that's it. - A favour?

260
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:54,915
Then get lost now. I have no use for you.

261
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:56,945
Or come back when I die.

262
00:15:03,225 --> 00:15:05,455
Hey. Why are you dragging me here?

263
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:08,595
How long has it been?

264
00:15:08,596 --> 00:15:10,595
I did 18 times at 5-minute intervals.

265
00:15:10,995 --> 00:15:12,095
Give it to him.

266
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:19,734
It's in.

267
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:21,975
- As he's passing away first, - Stop. Switch with me.

268
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:23,915
I brought her with me.

269
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:26,975
We have a patient! Make way, please!

270
00:15:27,185 --> 00:15:28,245
Move please!

271
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:30,215
- Get an OR room for GS. - Understood.

272
00:15:41,865 --> 00:15:42,865
What's this?

273
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,495
BP is dropping. It's 40.

274
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:47,665
Doctor.

275
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:53,305
Let's stop.

276
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,115
Time of death, 4:55pm.

277
00:16:01,115 --> 00:16:02,885
Mr. Lim Su Hyeon has passed away.

278
00:16:04,585 --> 00:16:05,914
Born in the Year of the White Sheep...

279
00:16:05,915 --> 00:16:07,225
on October 6 between 11pm to 1am.

280
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:10,355
Died in the Year of the Blue Dragon on April 1 between 3pm to 5pm.

281
00:16:11,925 --> 00:16:14,195
Lim Su Hyeon.

282
00:16:50,935 --> 00:16:51,965
Let's go.

283
00:17:01,005 --> 00:17:02,505
Has it hit you now?

284
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,185
You're sure, right?

285
00:17:10,015 --> 00:17:11,085
Yes.

286
00:17:12,455 --> 00:17:13,885
How do I die?

287
00:17:14,255 --> 00:17:15,785
I can't tell you.

288
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:18,425
One week, was it?

289
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:21,295
Yes.

290
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:34,875
What do you want to do in your last week?

291
00:17:36,545 --> 00:17:37,975
I want to go home and sleep.

292
00:17:38,845 --> 00:17:40,315
What? Hey.

293
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,585
You're going to sleep when you'll die in a week?

294
00:17:44,785 --> 00:17:46,115
What else am I to do?

295
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:47,585
Goodness.

296
00:17:49,025 --> 00:17:50,155
Really.

297
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,395
Isn't there anything you want to do?

298
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:56,264
Someone you wanted to meet or a place you wanted to go.

299
00:17:56,265 --> 00:17:58,164
Or food you couldn't eat because it was too expensive.

300
00:17:58,165 --> 00:17:59,194
Anything you like.

301
00:17:59,195 --> 00:18:01,404
A tour of the oldest bakeries in the country.

302
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:03,875
How about solving a challenging math problem?

303
00:18:04,475 --> 00:18:06,405
Isn't that what you want to do?

304
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:11,975
I have something else I want to do.

305
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:21,225
"Riding a tandem bike?"

306
00:18:21,555 --> 00:18:23,755
"Drinking beer while looking at the night view."

307
00:18:24,655 --> 00:18:25,725
What are these?

308
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:27,695
My bucket list.

309
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:30,535
Isn't a bucket list something you do before you die?

310
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:31,895
I'm...

311
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:33,935
indeed already dead.

312
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:37,935
Do them with me.

313
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,914
- You must keep your balance. - It's dangerous.

314
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,714
You're the one moving around, making it sway.

315
00:18:45,715 --> 00:18:47,444
- I didn't do anything. - I'm moving straight.

316
00:18:47,445 --> 00:18:50,044
We're too fast. You have to keep the balance.

317
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:51,954
Or else the bicycle keeps swaying.

318
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:52,955
Be careful.

319
00:18:52,956 --> 00:18:54,925
What is wrong with you?

320
00:18:55,225 --> 00:18:56,285
I don't want to.

321
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:57,825
You can do them alone.

322
00:18:59,495 --> 00:19:01,025
Is this really too much to ask?

323
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:06,065
You know, between us.

324
00:19:12,405 --> 00:19:15,274
Hey. I've been looking for you for ages.

325
00:19:15,275 --> 00:19:18,175
I wonder why we missed each other so much.

326
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,714
Why are you doing this to me?

327
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:22,584
Isn't this obvious?

328
00:19:22,585 --> 00:19:25,014
Since this is platinum,

329
00:19:25,015 --> 00:19:26,015
I have a grave responsibility.

330
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:28,284
I really want things to work out between you and Ram Woo.

331
00:19:28,285 --> 00:19:29,924
I'm working super hard...

332
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:31,394
- Right. - and being extra careful.

333
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:32,825
What about my letter?

334
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,295
Is it not ready yet?

335
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:35,765
Not yet?

336
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:38,265
But I'm almost there.

337
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:40,534
One percent is all that's left.

338
00:19:40,535 --> 00:19:42,904
In hopes things work out for you two,

339
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,904
I've been throwing my heart and soul into it that I...

340
00:19:44,905 --> 00:19:47,504
Hee Wan. Do you have feelings...

341
00:19:47,505 --> 00:19:50,375
for Hee Wan... No, Ram Woo?

342
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:53,645
What?

343
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:59,755
What kind of nonsense are you spouting?

344
00:19:59,815 --> 00:20:01,854
Pretty girls have...

345
00:20:01,855 --> 00:20:04,124
the silliest imaginations at times.

346
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,654
Right, Tae Gyeong?

347
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,494
Yes. Ram Woo and Hee Wan?

348
00:20:07,495 --> 00:20:09,495
- You're making me sick. - Gosh.

349
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:12,765
Oh, no. Are you okay? I also feel like throwing up.

350
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:14,604
- I see. - I feel sick.

351
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:17,805
How you act makes it more suspicious.

352
00:20:21,075 --> 00:20:24,614
No way. I swear that...

353
00:20:24,615 --> 00:20:26,014
I hate him, okay?

354
00:20:26,015 --> 00:20:28,514
He's the type I hate. Get it?

355
00:20:28,515 --> 00:20:30,514
But how can you not like him?

356
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,754
He's tall with broad shoulders.

357
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:33,784
And his face is tiny.

358
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:35,524
She has a herniated disc and hates tall men.

359
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,724
She's right.

360
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:39,194
Even besides those, when he smiles,

361
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,325
his eyes look like a half-moon.

362
00:20:40,895 --> 00:20:42,024
That's adorable.

363
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,624
No, I hate it.

364
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,194
- I loathe that type. - She...

365
00:20:45,195 --> 00:20:46,964
I hate it when men smile.

366
00:20:46,965 --> 00:20:49,035
This girl loves trashy guys.

367
00:20:50,265 --> 00:20:52,104
My bad.

368
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:55,374
Since Ram Woo is such a nice guy,

369
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:57,304
I thought some might not know their place...

370
00:20:57,305 --> 00:20:59,075
and try to hit on him.

371
00:20:59,575 --> 00:21:01,785
I'm sorry for getting the wrong idea.

372
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,755
Right. You better apologize.

373
00:21:05,385 --> 00:21:07,155
I'm glad it's a misunderstanding.

374
00:21:07,255 --> 00:21:09,024
I'll take the letter now.

375
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:10,185
It's in your classroom, right?

376
00:21:10,755 --> 00:21:11,825
What?

377
00:21:13,025 --> 00:21:15,524
Come on, Hee Wan. The letter.

378
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,194
You said only one percent was left.

379
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:18,935
Can't you finish it off right now?

380
00:21:50,695 --> 00:21:54,264
It's in a dead serious font, Hee Wan.

381
00:21:54,265 --> 00:21:55,805
(Dear Kim Ram Woo)

382
00:21:55,965 --> 00:21:57,035
Yes.

383
00:21:57,305 --> 00:21:59,174
Since the content is so passionate,

384
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,844
I think the decoration should be minimal.

385
00:22:01,845 --> 00:22:04,714
Oh, I see.

386
00:22:04,715 --> 00:22:07,115
And the remaining one percent?

387
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:08,845
What's there to do?

388
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:45,385
A poop colour?

389
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:51,224
Ram Woo must like...

390
00:22:51,225 --> 00:22:54,565
the colour brown, right?

391
00:22:57,595 --> 00:22:59,295
(Sincerely, Bang Ji Su)

392
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:01,765
It's 100 percent complete.

393
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:04,775
Thank you!

394
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:18,685
A night view is so not the vibe.

395
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:21,554
And why the tandem bike of all things?

396
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:23,484
If it was a regular bike, I had to ride behind you.

397
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:26,495
Whatever. Just strike out what we just did earlier.

398
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:30,124
Done with riding a tandem bike.

399
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,295
What's left to do is...

400
00:23:31,495 --> 00:23:33,394
bird watching at a migratory bird sanctuary,

401
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,534
watching a classical performance at the Seoul Arts Center,

402
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:37,734
eating ramyeon in the Arctic, backpacking through South America,

403
00:23:37,735 --> 00:23:39,375
- and going on "National Singing..." - What?

404
00:23:40,505 --> 00:23:43,105
What are all of these? "Buying a house."

405
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:45,645
"Giving pocket money to my grandchildren."

406
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:49,644
Are you kidding me?

407
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:52,114
How can I make grandchildren right here, right now?

408
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:53,255
Come on.

409
00:23:54,155 --> 00:23:56,224
The bucket list doesn't always...

410
00:23:56,225 --> 00:23:57,755
have to be realistic.

411
00:23:58,025 --> 00:24:00,095
Those are things I want to do before I die.

412
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:02,295
Right.

413
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,865
If not, that won't be a bucket list. No.

414
00:24:05,165 --> 00:24:06,795
Isn't that miserable?

415
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,864
Going around alone as a grim reaper...

416
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,305
is no fun.

417
00:24:23,315 --> 00:24:26,115
Only 10, okay? 10.

418
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:29,555
You can do that for me, no?

419
00:24:30,585 --> 00:24:33,025
Will you leave after we do ten?

420
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:36,425
What?

421
00:24:36,565 --> 00:24:37,695
Promise me.

422
00:24:38,795 --> 00:24:40,664
That you'll leave me after we're done...

423
00:24:40,665 --> 00:24:41,935
and won't come see me again.

424
00:24:45,575 --> 00:24:46,605
Okay.

425
00:24:48,245 --> 00:24:50,245
Do those, and it'll be the end.

426
00:24:52,545 --> 00:24:54,684
I'll disappear from your sight right away.

427
00:24:54,685 --> 00:24:55,745
All right?

428
00:24:59,485 --> 00:25:02,725
By the way, isn't the night view here amazing?

429
00:25:06,025 --> 00:25:08,465
You have such a cliche taste.

430
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,094
Are you done here?

431
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,065
If so, let's move on to the next one.

432
00:25:15,065 --> 00:25:17,004
You are really stingy.

433
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:18,875
Let's go do the next thing on the list.

434
00:25:19,175 --> 00:25:21,604
Come on, Kim Ram Woo.

435
00:25:21,605 --> 00:25:22,844
What a strange girl.

436
00:25:22,845 --> 00:25:25,545
We have to take the bike with us.

437
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:37,485
(Bird watching at a migratory bird sanctuary)

438
00:25:37,525 --> 00:25:38,555
(Bird watching)

439
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:51,934
(Eating cup noodles in the Arctic)

440
00:25:51,935 --> 00:25:57,574
(Eating cup noodles)

441
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,015
(Sing A Silver Dream)

442
00:26:01,415 --> 00:26:04,085
(Life begins at 70.)

443
00:26:07,285 --> 00:26:13,694
(Watching a classical performance at the Seoul Arts Center)

444
00:26:13,695 --> 00:26:14,724
(Watching a classical performance)

445
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:16,465
Hey. Wake me up after the show.

446
00:26:17,595 --> 00:26:18,735
Mind your manners.

447
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:44,794
I did some thinking.

448
00:26:44,795 --> 00:26:47,355
Friends are better than boyfriends.

449
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:49,394
It's about Jung Hee Wan, right?

450
00:26:49,395 --> 00:26:51,894
Honestly, how long would high school relationships last?

451
00:26:51,895 --> 00:26:54,035
It's over when he graduates and goes to college.

452
00:26:54,165 --> 00:26:56,264
He'll find a new girlfriend in college.

453
00:26:56,265 --> 00:26:58,234
But it'll be over when he goes to the military.

454
00:26:58,235 --> 00:26:59,834
He'll find another one after being discharged.

455
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:02,545
But again, he'll break up after finding a job.

456
00:27:03,005 --> 00:27:04,444
It's an endless cycle.

457
00:27:04,445 --> 00:27:05,775
But friends are different.

458
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:08,884
In the long run, who's the real winner?

459
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:11,314
- Friends. - It sounds like self-justification,

460
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:12,685
but you have a point.

461
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,424
Frankly, dating is a pain.

462
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,184
You have to celebrate 100 days, 200 days,

463
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:18,424
- and his birthday. - Also Pepero Day.

464
00:27:18,425 --> 00:27:20,024
You can't miss Christmas.

465
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:21,594
Not to mention, summer means sweaty hands.

466
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:22,794
But you still have to hold hands.

467
00:27:22,795 --> 00:27:24,895
- I hate it. - It makes me sick.

468
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:26,564
That's why I'm telling you that...

469
00:27:26,565 --> 00:27:29,504
Jung Hee Wan and Bang Ji Su won't last long.

470
00:27:29,505 --> 00:27:31,904
In the end, who's the winner?

471
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:33,534
Me, who hasn't confessed to him.

472
00:27:33,535 --> 00:27:35,045
There goes Ji Su and Jung Hee Wan.

473
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:40,414
Gosh, there's this warm filter around them.

474
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:41,685
I bet she'll confess to him.

475
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,054
Jung Hee Wan is smiling,

476
00:27:47,055 --> 00:27:48,955
making that half-moon sort of eyes.

477
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:53,725
But like you said, I'm sure they'll break up soon.

478
00:27:58,735 --> 00:28:00,035
Hey! Your crutch!

479
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:06,335
- Is she okay? - What are you doing?

480
00:28:13,815 --> 00:28:15,415
Move it!

481
00:28:37,665 --> 00:28:38,935
No!

482
00:28:44,245 --> 00:28:45,415
What's wrong with her?

483
00:28:46,415 --> 00:28:47,745
- Is she dead? - What?

484
00:28:49,545 --> 00:28:50,545
Hee Wan?

485
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:54,255
- Is your leg okay? - Is she okay?

486
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:55,725
Oh, no.

487
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:56,985
What...

488
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,755
- Guys. Let's keep playing. - She looks okay.

489
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:02,695
Where's your crutch?

490
00:29:03,725 --> 00:29:04,895
Are you really okay?

491
00:29:07,665 --> 00:29:09,005
Hee Wan?

492
00:29:09,465 --> 00:29:12,074
What was the "no" about?

493
00:29:12,075 --> 00:29:13,075
What?

494
00:29:13,875 --> 00:29:17,005
You see...

495
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,445
Well...

496
00:29:23,145 --> 00:29:24,984
I like you, Kim Ram Woo.

497
00:29:24,985 --> 00:29:27,315
(1: Confess my true feelings to Ram Woo.)

498
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,255
What?

499
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:36,025
I'm sorry, but I like Ji Su.

500
00:29:36,865 --> 00:29:38,664
It's awkward to be friends now.

501
00:29:38,665 --> 00:29:40,265
Let's act like strangers.

502
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:45,905
No.

503
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:47,945
(1: Confess my true feelings to Ram Woo.)

504
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:53,515
I like you, Ji Su.

505
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:55,684
I can't give her to you.

506
00:29:55,685 --> 00:29:57,315
(2: Act like I like Ji Su.)

507
00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:59,085
I see.

508
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:01,724
I hope things work out for you two.

509
00:30:01,725 --> 00:30:03,025
My gosh, Hee Wan.

510
00:30:04,025 --> 00:30:06,394
Was that why you've been...

511
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:09,325
Then we'll stay friends for the rest of our lives, right?

512
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:13,135
No.

513
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:17,034
My gosh, Hee Wan. You saved me from embarrassing myself.

514
00:30:17,035 --> 00:30:19,504
You're my lifesaver. I mean it.

515
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:20,775
(3: Tell Ji Su that there's a chilli flake between her teeth.)

516
00:30:21,305 --> 00:30:22,305
My gosh.

517
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:24,405
I don't care if there's spinach stuck between your teeth.

518
00:30:24,875 --> 00:30:25,945
You still look beautiful.

519
00:30:29,045 --> 00:30:30,085
No.

520
00:30:31,215 --> 00:30:32,385
Are you kidding me?

521
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:34,214
If you start dating, you won't have time to play board games with me.

522
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:35,825
(4: Tell him he can't date her because Hong Seok will be lonely.)

523
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:38,825
I'm sorry about that.

524
00:30:39,025 --> 00:30:40,525
You can play board games with Ram Woo from now on.

525
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:43,025
What?

526
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:50,435
This is not it!

527
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,604
My gosh, what's going on? There's romance in the air.

528
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:55,944
It's making me cringe hardcore.

529
00:30:55,945 --> 00:30:57,574
So I needed an eyepatch like a hardcore pirate.

530
00:30:57,575 --> 00:30:58,874
I can't watch this, so I need an eyepatch.

531
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:00,515
I'd rather cover up my eyes and not watch this.

532
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:02,615
An eyepatch to cover up my eyes.

533
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:04,715
(99: Tell them I was looking for an eyepatch.)

534
00:31:07,815 --> 00:31:08,855
Hee Wan.

535
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:11,355
No matter how hard I try to make sense of this,

536
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:13,655
- this makes no sense. - This makes no sense.

537
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,365
- Hee Wan? - Well...

538
00:31:19,795 --> 00:31:20,834
I...

539
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:23,605
Please say something.

540
00:31:23,765 --> 00:31:25,605
Well, the truth is...

541
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,015
(Bang Ji Su)

542
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:33,475
Kim Ram Woo!

543
00:31:38,585 --> 00:31:39,615
Ma'am!

544
00:31:43,855 --> 00:31:44,924
She got hit in the head.

545
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:46,894
She recently jumped off the restroom window.

546
00:31:46,895 --> 00:31:49,795
And I don't know what happened to her.

547
00:31:50,025 --> 00:31:51,494
She's been acting weird.

548
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:52,865
She used to be so normal.

549
00:31:53,365 --> 00:31:55,704
But lately, she's been odd. So I read up on the news.

550
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,505
It said if she had bipolar disorder...

551
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,855
What's the deal with Kim Ram Woo and Bang Ji Su?

552
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,325
Did you see what happened? It was crazy.

553
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,135
What happened?

554
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:35,175
It's over.

555
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:36,904
After he brought you into the infirmary,

556
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,215
Ji Su asked him out right there.

557
00:32:41,885 --> 00:32:43,145
She did it in front of everyone.

558
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:45,855
Everyone was cheering. It was quite a scene.

559
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,225
I see.

560
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,255
So it's over now.

561
00:32:56,965 --> 00:32:58,095
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

562
00:32:58,795 --> 00:32:59,835
Kim Ram Woo.

563
00:33:01,705 --> 00:33:03,004
Are you all right?

564
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:04,265
Why did you skip the evening study hall?

565
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:06,575
Does it hurt a lot? What did the school nurse say?

566
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:08,975
Hey, give it to me. I'll carry it for you.

567
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:11,245
Come on. Why are you making such a fuss?

568
00:33:11,975 --> 00:33:13,714
I'm not making a fuss. I'm just worried about you.

569
00:33:13,715 --> 00:33:15,715
You got hit by the soccer ball and passed out.

570
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:18,485
Could it be a concussion?

571
00:33:22,525 --> 00:33:25,195
I hear you write letters for other people.

572
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:28,165
- I closed down my business. - You did? Why?

573
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:29,465
I don't know.

574
00:33:29,865 --> 00:33:30,925
Well,

575
00:33:31,935 --> 00:33:34,835
could you do one for me before you close down?

576
00:33:35,465 --> 00:33:37,035
You know that my handwriting is awful.

577
00:33:37,505 --> 00:33:38,835
It's an important letter.

578
00:33:43,575 --> 00:33:45,215
(No matter how many times...)

579
00:33:48,915 --> 00:33:49,945
Thirty dollars.

580
00:33:50,685 --> 00:33:51,685
Thirty dollars?

581
00:33:51,686 --> 00:33:54,015
I heard that you only charged 15 dollars for the others.

582
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,324
I gave you the wrong number. It's 40 dollars.

583
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,325
What?

584
00:33:58,295 --> 00:34:00,895
My gosh. It's more expensive than I thought.

585
00:34:11,105 --> 00:34:12,675
Do you offer any discounts...

586
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:15,045
for friends?

587
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,575
Not even a small discount?

588
00:34:19,745 --> 00:34:21,614
Hey, because you're being cheeky,

589
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:23,685
I'll charge you five more dollars for HMH. Got it?

590
00:34:24,485 --> 00:34:26,314
Listen. You should be grateful that...

591
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:28,225
I'm doing this for you when I closed down my business.

592
00:34:29,225 --> 00:34:31,655
- What's HMH? - You don't need to know.

593
00:34:34,795 --> 00:34:35,865
Does it stand for a hot mess?

594
00:34:37,625 --> 00:34:38,835
A hothead?

595
00:34:40,795 --> 00:34:43,235
Hey, don't tell me that stands for a horrible man.

596
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,405
(Kim Ram Woo, 45 dollars, extra charge for hurting my heart)

597
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:48,205
Darn it.

598
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:51,644
(I love you so much.)

599
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:54,415
He sounds like a dinosaur in this letter.

600
00:34:55,145 --> 00:34:57,014
Does he think this is going to work?

601
00:34:57,015 --> 00:34:58,015
Darn it.

602
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:00,085
Why am I crying?

603
00:35:00,715 --> 00:35:02,085
This is so annoying.

604
00:35:04,855 --> 00:35:07,194
(I'll be really nice to you. You can look forward to it.)

605
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:09,195
I have to write this again.

606
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:12,365
Darn it.

607
00:35:14,365 --> 00:35:17,935
(To Ji Su)

608
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,005
No.

609
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,605
But I need to be professional.

610
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:32,355
Are you crying?

611
00:35:34,685 --> 00:35:36,824
So this thing you call the bucket list...

612
00:35:36,825 --> 00:35:38,655
Don't you think it's a sales gimmick?

613
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:41,394
What if a genius marketer started the trend...

614
00:35:41,395 --> 00:35:42,865
to make a profit off people?

615
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:44,525
Then let's go along with it.

616
00:35:44,695 --> 00:35:45,865
You can come over now!

617
00:35:45,995 --> 00:35:47,394
Hey, he told you to come. Let's go.

618
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,834
- Oh, no. - Hurry up.

619
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:51,065
- Wait. - My gosh.

620
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:55,005
This is way too high. Hold on.

621
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:00,945
- Hey. - Come on.

622
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:02,584
Be honest.

623
00:36:02,585 --> 00:36:04,514
You're here to get back at me and because you hate me, right?

624
00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:07,085
Get back at you? Why would I want to do that?

625
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:09,884
Then why are you doing this to me?

626
00:36:09,885 --> 00:36:12,524
My gosh, come on. Stop talking to yourself.

627
00:36:12,525 --> 00:36:15,025
They think you're a weirdo and won't let you do it.

628
00:36:16,195 --> 00:36:17,525
Gosh, I hate it.

629
00:36:17,765 --> 00:36:20,165
You look so awful right now.

630
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:29,845
Are you okay?

631
00:36:30,775 --> 00:36:32,745
There was also something...

632
00:36:33,315 --> 00:36:34,985
I wanted to do before dying.

633
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:37,645
But I didn't know it would come true like this.

634
00:36:39,715 --> 00:36:41,754
Be it a figment of my imagination...

635
00:36:41,755 --> 00:36:44,225
or a variation of my usual nightmare.

636
00:36:44,485 --> 00:36:47,155
However it happened, Kim Ram Woo is in front of me.

637
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:51,565
Great. You're ready.

638
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:54,365
But you're not going to wear a helmet?

639
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,365
Do you not need a helmet?

640
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:59,635
No. I don't need to wear a helmet.

641
00:37:00,005 --> 00:37:01,005
- I see. - No.

642
00:37:02,275 --> 00:37:03,505
Because I'm not doing it.

643
00:37:04,545 --> 00:37:06,115
- What? - Next!

644
00:37:06,715 --> 00:37:08,114
- Okay! - You're ready, right?

645
00:37:08,115 --> 00:37:09,115
- What... - Yes!

646
00:37:09,116 --> 00:37:10,514
- It's just you, right? - What are you talking about?

647
00:37:10,515 --> 00:37:11,984
You're here because you wanted to do this.

648
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:13,214
Hey, how can I possibly do this?

649
00:37:13,215 --> 00:37:14,284
You must be out of your mind.

650
00:37:14,285 --> 00:37:16,284
- Have you lost your mind? - All right.

651
00:37:16,285 --> 00:37:17,654
- Let's go. We can do this. - Wait.

652
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:19,394
- Hold on, sir. - You got this, girl.

653
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:21,094
- Wait. No, sir. - Okay!

654
00:37:21,095 --> 00:37:22,194
- You... - It's okay.

655
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:23,224
- Look over there. That looks fun! - Wait.

656
00:37:23,225 --> 00:37:24,264
He's...

657
00:37:24,265 --> 00:37:25,664
- That looks fun. - Have fun, Ram Woo.

658
00:37:25,665 --> 00:37:26,694
- You... - All right.

659
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:28,364
- Good luck. - You got this. You'll be fine.

660
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:29,365
- Please. - My gosh.

661
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:31,004
- See you down there! - My gosh.

662
00:37:31,005 --> 00:37:32,274
- Don't cry. - But...

663
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:33,374
It's okay.

664
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:34,904
- It's not scary. - Is this safe?

665
00:37:34,905 --> 00:37:35,944
- Look over there. - All right.

666
00:37:35,945 --> 00:37:37,144
- Run! - Hold on!

667
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:38,275
Wait!

668
00:37:38,845 --> 00:37:39,875
- You'll be fine. - Wait.

669
00:37:40,845 --> 00:37:42,985
- No! - It's okay!

670
00:37:43,415 --> 00:37:44,684
- It's okay! - It's okay!

671
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:47,285
Have a blast!

672
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:52,525
Are you sure this is safe? Wait.

673
00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:56,195
My gosh. Hold on!

674
00:38:10,675 --> 00:38:12,774
- That was fast. - Given our friendship,

675
00:38:12,775 --> 00:38:15,145
I did the platinum version for the letter.

676
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:17,145
Thanks.

677
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,755
"Ji Su?"

678
00:38:21,385 --> 00:38:22,685
Why did you write "Ji Su?"

679
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:26,325
JS. It stands for Ji Su, your girlfriend.

680
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,295
My girlfriend?

681
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:31,065
No.

682
00:38:31,465 --> 00:38:32,935
JS stands for Jeong Suk.

683
00:38:33,165 --> 00:38:34,234
Jeong Suk?

684
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:35,865
Who's Jeong Suk? Which class is she in?

685
00:38:36,405 --> 00:38:37,935
She's my mother.

686
00:38:39,575 --> 00:38:40,605
What?

687
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:42,505
She's my mother.

688
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:45,375
She thinks that's an old name and hates it when I call her that.

689
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:51,854
So you wrote this love letter not for Ji Su,

690
00:38:51,855 --> 00:38:52,915
but for your mother?

691
00:38:53,115 --> 00:38:54,315
It's not a love letter.

692
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:56,655
It's a letter for her birthday.

693
00:38:57,455 --> 00:39:00,525
Hey, that's why you thanked her for her hard work in the letter.

694
00:39:01,395 --> 00:39:03,625
- Yes. - I see.

695
00:39:03,865 --> 00:39:06,265
Anyway, I can just fix the name in the letter.

696
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:08,734
So it was 45 dollars, right?

697
00:39:08,735 --> 00:39:11,264
Hey, no. You don't have to pay me. Come on, it's me.

698
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,574
You keep it.

699
00:39:12,575 --> 00:39:14,235
- No, but still. I... - No, keep it.

700
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,175
Keep it.

701
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:18,875
Keep it.

702
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:21,315
- Thanks. - Sure.

703
00:39:27,155 --> 00:39:28,285
Jung Hee Wan.

704
00:39:29,025 --> 00:39:30,155
Then...

705
00:39:31,085 --> 00:39:32,695
what about Ji Su? Didn't she ask you out?

706
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:35,695
This is embarrassing. Why are you asking me about that?

707
00:39:36,425 --> 00:39:37,865
I told her I was sorry.

708
00:39:38,095 --> 00:39:40,495
You said you were sorry? You turned her down?

709
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:42,265
Why did you turn her down?

710
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:47,505
I need to focus on my studies to get into college.

711
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:50,975
I need to keep getting the scholarship too.

712
00:39:51,875 --> 00:39:53,145
I must maintain my GPA.

713
00:39:53,475 --> 00:39:54,545
My gosh.

714
00:39:55,075 --> 00:39:56,814
- Hey, have you gone mad? - How admirable.

715
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:58,915
You really are a dutiful son.

716
00:39:58,985 --> 00:40:01,455
I bet you could even win "Show Me the Money."

717
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,955
Gosh, good for Jeong Suk.

718
00:40:04,255 --> 00:40:05,255
Hey, give it back.

719
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:08,024
Let me redo the letter with the gold dragon diamond version.

720
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:09,025
Okay?

721
00:40:09,995 --> 00:40:10,995
Hey.

722
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:14,465
My arm. Gosh.

723
00:40:15,905 --> 00:40:18,735
Kim Ram Woo! My gosh. Come on.

724
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:21,275
Oh, no. Where am I?

725
00:40:21,575 --> 00:40:23,905
Hold on. Could you stop this?

726
00:40:24,275 --> 00:40:25,845
Please stop it!

727
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:38,525
My gosh. Oh, my. Thank you.

728
00:40:44,195 --> 00:40:45,565
My gosh.

729
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:50,935
My goodness.

730
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:53,035
I can't believe I did that.

731
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,775
I'm doing all sorts of things because of you.

732
00:41:06,085 --> 00:41:07,115
Kim Ram Woo?

733
00:41:07,685 --> 00:41:08,685
Kim Ram Woo.

734
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:12,755
Kim Ram Woo.

735
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:14,995
Kim Ram Woo.

736
00:41:17,465 --> 00:41:18,495
Kim Ram Woo.

737
00:41:21,835 --> 00:41:22,865
Kim Ram Woo.

738
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:24,735
Hey.

739
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:26,405
Kim Ram Woo!

740
00:41:28,845 --> 00:41:29,875
Kim Ram Woo.

741
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:31,644
Kim Ram Woo.

742
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:34,315
Darn it. Kim Ram Woo, where are you?

743
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,115
Where did he go?

744
00:41:37,415 --> 00:41:38,445
- Kim Ram Woo. - What?

745
00:41:40,215 --> 00:41:41,385
I'm right here.

746
00:41:44,155 --> 00:41:45,185
Hey.

747
00:41:45,425 --> 00:41:46,755
Did you think I was gone?

748
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:49,725
Why were you so scared?

749
00:41:50,195 --> 00:41:51,825
Did you miss me when we were apart?

750
00:41:54,165 --> 00:41:55,434
So how was it?

751
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:57,034
Once you were up in the air, it wasn't scary at all, right?

752
00:41:57,035 --> 00:41:58,104
Wasn't it fun?

753
00:41:58,105 --> 00:41:59,205
You don't regret it, do you?

754
00:42:00,735 --> 00:42:02,205
It wasn't fun at all.

755
00:42:08,415 --> 00:42:09,845
What are you doing to celebrate your 100th day together?

756
00:42:10,615 --> 00:42:13,184
Nothing special. We'll go for a walk along the Han River.

757
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:15,384
We'll go to a restaurant with a nice view in the evening.

758
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:16,824
- We'll have pasta. - My gosh.

759
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,124
And what's next?

760
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:20,254
- Hey. That's cringe. - That's cringe.

761
00:42:20,255 --> 00:42:21,624
Hey, that's not cringe at all.

762
00:42:21,625 --> 00:42:23,294
I want to do all the cringey things couples do.

763
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:25,394
I want to ride the tandem bicycle along the Han River.

764
00:42:25,395 --> 00:42:27,464
I want to have a beer at night while looking at the view.

765
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:29,004
Oh, right. I want to go on a trip...

766
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,334
and try paragliding too.

767
00:42:30,335 --> 00:42:31,534
- My gosh. - Paragliding?

768
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:35,204
I want to go to a classical concert like an elegant lady.

769
00:42:35,205 --> 00:42:36,604
- Elegant? - My gosh.

770
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:37,744
- What's wrong with you? - Elegant.

771
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:39,374
- Hey, that doesn't suit you. - No way.

772
00:42:39,375 --> 00:42:40,974
Why wouldn't that suit me?

773
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,085
- I can just go. - Why a tandem bicycle then?

774
00:42:43,585 --> 00:42:44,815
I must ride it with my sweetie.

775
00:42:44,985 --> 00:42:46,414
- My gosh. - Come on.

776
00:42:46,415 --> 00:42:48,184
- That's unexpected. - Your sweetie?

777
00:42:48,185 --> 00:42:49,784
- Your sweetie. - With my sweetie.

778
00:42:49,785 --> 00:42:51,154
I must ride it with my sweetie.

779
00:42:51,155 --> 00:42:53,094
- She's driving me crazy. - Where's her sweetie?

780
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:54,354
- It's killing me. - She'll ride it with her sweetie.

781
00:42:54,355 --> 00:42:55,864
I don't see her sweetie.

782
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,024
Is he even born?

783
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:58,164
- Where is he? - My gosh.

784
00:42:58,165 --> 00:42:59,395
- Here? There? - I want to see him.

785
00:43:03,105 --> 00:43:04,164
- Hey. - Seriously.

786
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,304
When will I meet my sweetie?

787
00:43:06,305 --> 00:43:07,674
- Really? - My gosh.

788
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:09,145
- Why does she always do that? - That's...

789
00:43:09,345 --> 00:43:11,175
- She drives me crazy. - Is he even born?

790
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,215
Where could he be? I want to see him.

791
00:43:45,815 --> 00:43:47,045
Jung Hee Wan?

792
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:49,185
She stopped coming to school since two days ago.

793
00:43:49,815 --> 00:43:51,415
I guess it really was her fault.

794
00:43:51,915 --> 00:43:52,955
What do you mean?

795
00:43:53,285 --> 00:43:54,614
That's what I heard too.

796
00:43:54,615 --> 00:43:56,885
That Kim Ram Woo is dead because of her.

797
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,224
No way. Because of switching names?

798
00:43:58,225 --> 00:43:59,725
- Right. - That's what I heard.

799
00:44:01,655 --> 00:44:02,725
You're right.

800
00:44:03,165 --> 00:44:05,295
Jung Hee Wan was the one who suggested switching names.

801
00:44:05,865 --> 00:44:06,865
Right.

802
00:44:06,866 --> 00:44:08,365
