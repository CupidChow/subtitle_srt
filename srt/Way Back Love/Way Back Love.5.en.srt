1
00:00:00,867 --> 00:00:02,936
(Gong Myoung)

2
00:00:02,937 --> 00:00:04,936
(Kim Min Ha)

3
00:00:04,937 --> 00:00:06,906
(Jung Gun Joo, Oh Woo Ri, Ko Chang Seok, Seo Young Hee)

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:08,507
(And Shim Eun Kyung)

5
00:00:09,747 --> 00:00:12,987
(Way Back Love)

6
00:00:21,027 --> 00:00:22,626
(Danger)

7
00:00:22,627 --> 00:00:23,957
(Stop)

8
00:00:51,555 --> 00:00:53,165
The patient went into shock once,

9
00:00:53,295 --> 00:00:54,765
and blood pressure's falling.

10
00:00:55,625 --> 00:00:57,735
Kim Ram Woo.

11
00:00:58,635 --> 00:00:59,635
Yes?

12
00:01:01,965 --> 00:01:04,035
Do you understand what I explained just now?

13
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:07,105
Yes.

14
00:01:08,045 --> 00:01:09,445
Am I dead?

15
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:10,745
Yes.

16
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:12,815
I'll take you to the afterlife now.

17
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:14,985
You just have to follow me.

18
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:17,814
You grasped the situation quicker than most.

19
00:01:17,815 --> 00:01:18,955
Don't make it too hard.

20
00:01:19,185 --> 00:01:21,355
- Okay. - No! I won't go!

21
00:01:22,425 --> 00:01:24,525
Don't tell me to come! I won't go!

22
00:01:24,625 --> 00:01:26,094
Leading the dead on...

23
00:01:26,095 --> 00:01:28,295
is a lot like a random draw.

24
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:30,535
The dead have all sorts of reactions.

25
00:01:30,935 --> 00:01:33,004
Most lie down and kick and scream...

26
00:01:33,005 --> 00:01:34,805
and refuse to go.

27
00:01:35,405 --> 00:01:37,635
They must have a lot here to leave behind.

28
00:01:37,905 --> 00:01:39,374
I do get it.

29
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:41,104
Quite a lot of people...

30
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,415
wail and beg me to revive them.

31
00:01:43,815 --> 00:01:44,945
There are all sorts.

32
00:01:46,075 --> 00:01:47,115
So,

33
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:49,085
what's your biggest regret right now?

34
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:54,025
Kim Ram Woo!

35
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:56,625
Switching names with you...

36
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:59,455
definitely made my school life harder.

37
00:02:00,195 --> 00:02:02,995
But that was the most fun thing I ever did in high school.

38
00:02:05,865 --> 00:02:08,035
Do you want to sit together on our way home later?

39
00:02:08,665 --> 00:02:09,675
Sure.

40
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:18,214
Something came to mind right away?

41
00:02:18,215 --> 00:02:19,215
Sorry,

42
00:02:19,545 --> 00:02:21,445
but are grim reapers usually rude to strangers?

43
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:23,915
I'm really sorry.

44
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:27,284
I didn't speak casually because you were under-aged.

45
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:29,424
I died two centuries ago,

46
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,725
so most are like kids to me.

47
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:33,265
So you're like a distant ancestor.

48
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:37,565
I had a massive grudge because I didn't do much...

49
00:02:37,795 --> 00:02:39,195
in my own lifetime.

50
00:02:39,765 --> 00:02:41,365
But I didn't want to be an evil spirit.

51
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:43,975
I found a wholesome way to vent.

52
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,404
Now I get to go between both worlds...

53
00:02:46,405 --> 00:02:48,845
totally legally and see how things are.

54
00:02:50,145 --> 00:02:51,575
You can come and go?

55
00:02:52,645 --> 00:02:53,645
Yes.

56
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:55,945
How do you become a grim reaper?

57
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:00,025
Goodness.

58
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,504
I asked the realtor,

59
00:03:18,505 --> 00:03:20,905
and no one has heard about Ms. Kim.

60
00:03:22,375 --> 00:03:23,515
My mom.

61
00:03:26,145 --> 00:03:27,545
How was she at the funeral?

62
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:29,215
What?

63
00:03:32,815 --> 00:03:34,125
Did she cry a lot?

64
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:36,455
It must've been hard, right?

65
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:38,625
I thought she must've felt lonely.

66
00:03:39,865 --> 00:03:41,524
I wasn't there, obviously,

67
00:03:41,525 --> 00:03:42,665
because it was my funeral.

68
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:45,465
I don't know if I never had a grandma,

69
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:48,035
or if Mom cut ties with her because of me,

70
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:50,775
but my mom's mom...

71
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:52,635
and Dad too.

72
00:03:53,545 --> 00:03:55,205
I bet none of them were there with her.

73
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,155
What kind of grim reaper are you?

74
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:06,455
You can't find someone?

75
00:04:06,585 --> 00:04:07,585
Hey.

76
00:04:08,025 --> 00:04:10,155
Do you think a grim reaper is a deity?

77
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:12,394
We only know about our task...

78
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:14,095
or we'd go have fun and slack off.

79
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,035
You're oddly incompetent.

80
00:04:17,635 --> 00:04:19,095
You look good on the outside.

81
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:20,565
Do you only look like a grim reaper?

82
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,834
I look good...

83
00:04:21,835 --> 00:04:23,975
because I was Employee of the Month.

84
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:27,675
Did you get a monetary prize?

85
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:29,405
Yes.

86
00:04:30,215 --> 00:04:32,514
I saved up quite a lot from that.

87
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:33,515
I see.

88
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:35,544
I have a housing subscription account.

89
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:37,254
After my break, I'll buy a house...

90
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:38,614
overlooking the Samdo Stream.

91
00:04:38,615 --> 00:04:42,085
It's time I plan for a stable second stage of my life.

92
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,224
I like a busy, chaotic house,

93
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:46,725
so I'll get a dog and work a bit less...

94
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:48,294
Yes.

95
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:50,864
I might get a Korean cuisine cooking license.

96
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,905
Good for you. That's so cool.

97
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:55,465
Goodness.

98
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:57,635
I don't believe that.

99
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:05,645
It's a joke.

100
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,685
- What? - There's no such thing.

101
00:05:07,985 --> 00:05:09,045
Once you die,

102
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:11,055
there's nothing.

103
00:05:15,355 --> 00:05:16,624
I'll be a grim reaper too.

104
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:17,995
How do you become one?

105
00:05:18,395 --> 00:05:19,925
- What? - What?

106
00:05:20,065 --> 00:05:22,365
Don't I get to hang out with you in death, then?

107
00:05:24,565 --> 00:05:25,665
You can't do this.

108
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:27,235
Why not? You do it.

109
00:05:28,005 --> 00:05:30,004
Well, you...

110
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:32,274
What? Me what?

111
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:33,804
You don't know Chinese letters.

112
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,174
What the heck?

113
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:37,115
You hate to study.

114
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:39,275
So what? I can still do it.

115
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:43,615
My mom.

116
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,385
There might be someone who knows her.

117
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:48,655
Kim Ram Woo?

118
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:58,265
You're Kim Ram Woo.

119
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:01,135
No. I'm Jung Hee Wan.

120
00:06:02,465 --> 00:06:04,505
(Jung Hee Wan)

121
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:08,674
I see.

122
00:06:08,675 --> 00:06:11,015
You look a lot like someone I know.

123
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,344
Who are you?

124
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:13,844
(Ryu Ho Gyeong, CEO)

125
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,115
This is who I am.

126
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:17,085
Keep it.

127
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:19,215
You might need it one day.

128
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:42,245
(Waiver of Rights)

129
00:06:44,845 --> 00:06:46,844
(I hereby confirm that I renounce all rights as an heir...)

130
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,245
(and I will not contest the will in the future.)

131
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,864
Hey. Maybe, I should have dressed up a bit.

132
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,865
What if she thinks I'm shady or something?

133
00:07:03,995 --> 00:07:06,335
Right. You do look a bit dull.

134
00:07:06,765 --> 00:07:07,835
Darn it.

135
00:07:09,165 --> 00:07:12,005
Then how should I introduce myself to her?

136
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:16,974
"I'm a friend..."

137
00:07:16,975 --> 00:07:18,575
"of your husband's illegitimate child."

138
00:07:19,245 --> 00:07:20,915
No. I don't think that's right.

139
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,614
"I'm the student of your husband's mistress."

140
00:07:24,615 --> 00:07:26,655
My gosh. Don't be ridiculous.

141
00:07:26,755 --> 00:07:28,484
My gosh, I'm doomed. What do I do?

142
00:07:28,485 --> 00:07:29,995
So I heard you were looking for me.

143
00:07:33,155 --> 00:07:34,295
Hey, that's her.

144
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:39,294
What brings you here?

145
00:07:39,295 --> 00:07:40,735
You must be the CEO.

146
00:07:41,635 --> 00:07:45,104
I'm trying to get in touch with an artist.

147
00:07:45,105 --> 00:07:47,975
I'm looking for her because...

148
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:51,145
I'm a journalist.

149
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,415
A journalist?

150
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:55,115
You didn't call ahead to make an appointment, correct?

151
00:07:55,985 --> 00:07:57,484
Why did you tell such an absurd lie?

152
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:59,925
May I have your business card? I'll hand it over to my employee.

153
00:08:00,185 --> 00:08:01,225
My business card?

154
00:08:02,585 --> 00:08:04,525
- Yes. I'll give you one. - She doesn't have one.

155
00:08:04,555 --> 00:08:05,625
- Excuse me. - What?

156
00:08:07,165 --> 00:08:08,924
- You have one? - Well, my business cards...

157
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:11,964
Hold on. I saw them here.

158
00:08:11,965 --> 00:08:13,465
Wait. So...

159
00:08:14,235 --> 00:08:15,235
here you go.

160
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,274
(Jung Hee Wan, Visual Design Department)

161
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,345
That's your student ID card.

162
00:08:23,075 --> 00:08:24,175
Jung Hee Wan?

163
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:26,245
The name sounds familiar.

164
00:08:27,815 --> 00:08:30,085
I'm sorry for telling you a sloppy lie.

165
00:08:30,455 --> 00:08:34,025
I didn't know how to introduce myself to you.

166
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,795
I was curious why he told me his name was...

167
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:38,595
Jung Hee Wan that night.

168
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,665
I didn't know it was his girlfriend's name.

169
00:08:40,765 --> 00:08:43,165
No. I'm not his girlfriend.

170
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:46,495
I mean, I wasn't...

171
00:08:47,535 --> 00:08:50,134
I know this is quite sudden,

172
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:52,305
but I'm really hoping you can help me.

173
00:08:52,705 --> 00:08:54,605
This is an important matter to me.

174
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:56,845
I really need to see her.

175
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:59,875
But why do you think I would know where she is?

176
00:09:00,585 --> 00:09:03,385
Well, Ram Woo told me.

177
00:09:04,055 --> 00:09:07,185
I mean, that's what Ram Woo told me a long time ago.

178
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:09,685
Because he was the son of my husband's mistress?

179
00:09:10,795 --> 00:09:12,555
- Well... - But...

180
00:09:13,495 --> 00:09:17,165
I'm not sure if she'd be happy to see you.

181
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:20,605
I'm sorry, but I don't think I can help you.

182
00:09:21,035 --> 00:09:23,264
There's no way of knowing...

183
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,375
that Jeong Suk wants to see you.

184
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:27,274
And you could have drifted apart...

185
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,405
for a reason too.

186
00:09:33,345 --> 00:09:34,385
Wait.

187
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,485
Have you ever done something like this?

188
00:09:40,485 --> 00:09:43,495
Hiding or running away from something you had to do.

189
00:09:46,355 --> 00:09:47,965
So it was your fault.

190
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:50,534
But you didn't want to be criticized or accept the consequences,

191
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,135
you acted like a coward.

192
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:56,165
I've done something like that to Ms. Kim.

193
00:09:56,975 --> 00:09:58,035
Ram Woo...

194
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,644
I should have told her that Ram Woo's death was my fault,

195
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,845
but I ran away from that.

196
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:10,585
I was a coward back then.

197
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,795
So we meet, after all.

198
00:10:18,725 --> 00:10:20,295
How much longer will you keep this up?

199
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:24,595
If you want an apology from me, you should stop coming.

200
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,995
I told you.

201
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:28,035
I didn't know he was married.

202
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,905
It was your husband who hid that from me.

203
00:10:31,435 --> 00:10:33,505
It's not something I need to apologize for.

204
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:36,405
But...

205
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,375
I still accepted the money, ran away, and lived in hiding.

206
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:43,045
Yes, it was an act of cowardice on my part.

207
00:10:43,145 --> 00:10:46,055
I had no other choice, but it was a cowardly thing to do.

208
00:10:46,955 --> 00:10:48,025
So I apologize for that.

209
00:10:52,325 --> 00:10:53,895
You did leave an impression on me.

210
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:56,695
You took the money without a complaint and ran away.

211
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:58,195
You did that seven times, not once.

212
00:10:59,135 --> 00:11:01,905
But he's still the son of my husband.

213
00:11:01,935 --> 00:11:04,504
It's natural for a father to pay child support.

214
00:11:04,505 --> 00:11:05,734
Why would you return that?

215
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:06,804
You should've gotten more if you could.

216
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:07,844
Pardon?

217
00:11:07,845 --> 00:11:09,845
Stop moving around. Don't make it harder on you than it already is.

218
00:11:10,145 --> 00:11:11,845
It's not like we won't be able to find you even if you move.

219
00:11:12,015 --> 00:11:13,744
Anyway, what my husband wants is simple.

220
00:11:13,745 --> 00:11:15,084
He doesn't want there to be a scandal...

221
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:17,085
and any issues regarding the inheritance.

222
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:21,185
As long as you can agree on that, you name the price, and he'll pay.

223
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:22,625
And take advantage of that.

224
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:27,924
The moment you sign it, he will change his attitude.

225
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,795
Don't sign this document.

226
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:31,494
- But why... - Why did I follow you around...

227
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:32,935
and send you this document?

228
00:11:33,195 --> 00:11:34,235
Yes.

229
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:36,635
Because I needed a trump card too.

230
00:11:37,075 --> 00:11:40,645
As you can guess, I didn't marry him out of love.

231
00:11:41,405 --> 00:11:43,045
I married his family.

232
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:46,215
The two of you are a major weakness of my husband.

233
00:11:48,745 --> 00:11:50,685
I'm sorry. This is who I am.

234
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:53,825
That's why I found you fascinating.

235
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:57,495
You could've milked him out more.

236
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:00,865
I wondered why you would waste such a good opportunity like this.

237
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:05,995
I have a child too.

238
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,035
My child will enter elementary school soon.

239
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:11,635
My child is at an age to notice some things now.

240
00:12:11,735 --> 00:12:13,035
Like the atmosphere in the house,

241
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,044
the form of our family,

242
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:17,345
and the topics discussed over dinner.

243
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:22,345
So...

244
00:12:23,245 --> 00:12:24,454
I was curious about the life of a woman...

245
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:25,615
who made a different choice.

246
00:12:26,785 --> 00:12:28,225
That's why I came.

247
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:30,085
This should answer your question.

248
00:12:32,155 --> 00:12:33,355
To what question?

249
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:38,634
If there's anything you need, please let me know.

250
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:39,765
- Well done. - Thanks.

251
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:43,204
Are you still working on your art?

252
00:12:43,205 --> 00:12:44,205
What's this?

253
00:12:44,206 --> 00:12:45,575
- I hope we can meet more often. - It arrived a while ago.

254
00:12:46,235 --> 00:12:48,004
Let's have meetings more frequently.

255
00:12:48,005 --> 00:12:49,845
We can meet here from now on.

256
00:12:52,915 --> 00:12:54,345
My husband and I got a divorce.

257
00:12:55,045 --> 00:12:56,845
We both have something to celebrate.

258
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,555
Congratulations on opening your studio.

259
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:08,165
Just forget about going.

260
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,094
How many more times must I say so?

261
00:13:10,095 --> 00:13:11,965
I'll just erase it from my bucket list.

262
00:13:12,335 --> 00:13:14,865
You know I'm not all that comfortable about it either.

263
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:19,674
I only wanted you and my mom to get along well like in the past.

264
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,944
I simply wanted my mom to feel like...

265
00:13:21,945 --> 00:13:24,014
I was around for even a split second.

266
00:13:24,015 --> 00:13:25,915
That was why I wanted to go with you.

267
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:31,055
This wasn't what I imagined.

268
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:33,855
Before leaving,

269
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,655
she dropped by my dad's restaurant.

270
00:13:39,795 --> 00:13:41,095
Back then, she said...

271
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,465
everything was all her fault.

272
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:50,934
But you don't know anyone over there.

273
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:53,574
How about giving it a second thought?

274
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:57,045
Ram Woo wanted to go see stars, and I told him to.

275
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,415
"Great. I'll have time alone for the first time in a while."

276
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:05,215
That was what I thought.

277
00:14:10,395 --> 00:14:14,465
I should still bid Hee Wan farewell.

278
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,065
She'll be back soon.

279
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:20,735
So? If your side of the story makes her hate you,

280
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,865
will Mom feel better?

281
00:14:22,935 --> 00:14:25,405
- Ram Woo. - Do you think resenting you...

282
00:14:25,605 --> 00:14:27,745
will make Mom live in peace?

283
00:14:27,805 --> 00:14:30,575
That's what you think. You're being selfish.

284
00:14:32,415 --> 00:14:34,844
Why are you trying to make things harder for you and my mom?

285
00:14:34,845 --> 00:14:36,885
You know that's not my intention.

286
00:14:37,855 --> 00:14:39,755
It's like an unsolved problem for me.

287
00:14:40,325 --> 00:14:41,325
Hee Wan.

288
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:44,424
Can't you just forget about the past and move on?

289
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,794
It's not the past to me.

290
00:14:45,795 --> 00:14:47,525
That's only to you.

291
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,595
To others, it's the past.

292
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:54,034
No matter how painful an incident is,

293
00:14:54,035 --> 00:14:55,935
people move on from it over time.

294
00:14:57,805 --> 00:15:00,645
Mom must be living her life.

295
00:15:01,005 --> 00:15:02,374
You should live your...

296
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:03,945
All I have left are two days.

297
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:10,015
That's why I must do it before that.

298
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,054
Your mom is important to me too.

299
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:14,885
Why can't you understand that?

300
00:15:14,985 --> 00:15:16,854
It's the one thing I want to do.

301
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:19,395
Only then will I feel at ease.

302
00:15:27,735 --> 00:15:28,805
Forget it.

303
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:31,835
You don't have to come.

304
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:35,905
Hee Wan.

305
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:41,715
It's neither your nor Mom's fault.

306
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:44,815
Why can't you get that?

307
00:15:45,755 --> 00:15:47,685
How much longer will you feel guilty?

308
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,085
How much longer will you keep this up?

309
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:55,195
Why in the world can't you move on?

310
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:00,295
Me.

311
00:16:01,805 --> 00:16:04,004
A grim reaper. I came to get you.

312
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,075
So why?

313
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,475
Why are you preparing to leave as if you were waiting to die?

314
00:16:09,805 --> 00:16:10,815
Just why?

315
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:15,015
From the minute we met until now.

316
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,515
Why?

317
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:23,125
Why have you not told me to spare you?

318
00:16:23,955 --> 00:16:26,325
- One week, was it? - Yes.

319
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:32,565
Let's say I'll actually die.

320
00:16:33,165 --> 00:16:35,404
Why do you have to be the one to tell me?

321
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:37,334
Call it a favour from a friend.

322
00:16:37,335 --> 00:16:39,575
Then get lost now. I have no use for you.

323
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,305
Or come back when I die.

324
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:24,115
So you've come back.

325
00:17:24,785 --> 00:17:27,285
I don't know what got you to make up your mind,

326
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:28,825
but weigh it well.

327
00:17:30,425 --> 00:17:33,825
You won't care about it if it's not before your eyes.

328
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:35,724
The ignorant human beings outside...

329
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:37,735
don't know how priceless life is.

330
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:40,265
They waste their lives.

331
00:17:41,405 --> 00:17:42,605
But you know, right?

332
00:17:43,365 --> 00:17:46,205
How invaluable the days they waste are.

333
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,045
What can you do while witnessing all that?

334
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,375
Nothing.

335
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:56,245
It's not a privilege but a punishment.

336
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,785
You've been doing this job for a while, right?

337
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,125
Yes.

338
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:06,425
How is it?

339
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,165
When is it the hardest for you?

340
00:18:11,695 --> 00:18:13,134
- Father! - Dad!

341
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:14,564
- Father! - Dad!

342
00:18:14,565 --> 00:18:16,035
- Dad! - Father!

343
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:18,074
Died on April 10 between 7am to 9am.

344
00:18:18,075 --> 00:18:20,305
Kim Doo Ho.

345
00:18:23,005 --> 00:18:27,215
It was just yesterday that I brought a cat home!

346
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,184
I'm telling you I'm not going with you!

347
00:18:30,185 --> 00:18:31,185
- Please stop! - I'm not!

348
00:18:31,186 --> 00:18:33,415
- Go away! - Mr. Ko Yoon Ho!

349
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:35,925
What did you have before death to run so fast?

350
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:38,124
- My grandson. - I'm not your grandson.

351
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,924
- My grandson. - Hold on.

352
00:18:39,925 --> 00:18:42,324
My sweetie. My lovely grandson.

353
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:44,294
In the Year of the Red Rooster in July...

354
00:18:44,295 --> 00:18:47,035
- My cutie pie. - Hold on, ma'am.

355
00:18:49,705 --> 00:18:51,634
Give me a moment.

356
00:18:51,635 --> 00:18:53,575
What do I have for you?

357
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,715
Let's go get you some snacks.

358
00:19:04,215 --> 00:19:07,085
Come on. Let's get some snacks.

359
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:08,854
- Come now. - Wait, ma'am.

360
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,485
Gosh, it's time for snacks.

361
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:12,595
So she lives nearby.

00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:46,625
Yes!

366
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:49,265
Im Jeong Taek.

367
00:19:52,665 --> 00:19:54,465
This is really serious.

368
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:56,765
Hey, guys.

369
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:00,475
A combination of a naive-looking man...

370
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:02,105
and a super sensitive coy woman.

371
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,745
And a love triangle with a sweet man who has eyes like a cat.

372
00:20:04,945 --> 00:20:06,375
Your taste still hasn't changed.

373
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:08,844
Still, it's nice to see you again.

374
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:11,155
I hope it's the same for Jung Hee Wan.

375
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:13,554
(Winter Meteor Shower Festival)

376
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,255
(Winter Meteor Shower Festival)

377
00:20:19,325 --> 00:20:20,864
Let's drink until we die.

378
00:20:20,865 --> 00:20:21,964
Do you want to die?

379
00:20:21,965 --> 00:20:23,464
Come here.

380
00:20:23,465 --> 00:20:24,634
- I feel like dying. - If you don't drink it,

381
00:20:24,635 --> 00:20:25,694
- Where are you going? - I'll kill you.

382
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,695
I'm so full.

383
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:28,135
- How can you do that? - Stop it.

384
00:20:28,365 --> 00:20:30,135
Why do you keep talking about dying?

385
00:20:30,975 --> 00:20:33,235
What time are you going to be there?

386
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,405
Ready?

387
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:17,585
(Pilates Special Price, 250 dollars for 8 times)

388
00:21:34,505 --> 00:21:35,505
Hello.

389
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:37,975
Hey. Have you heard from Hee Wan yet?

390
00:21:38,435 --> 00:21:39,435
No.

391
00:21:39,436 --> 00:21:40,845
That's the third time you asked today.

392
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:43,375
Why is it so hard to reach her?

393
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:46,545
Why do you care about Hee Wan so much?

394
00:21:46,815 --> 00:21:47,885
I don't know.

395
00:21:49,985 --> 00:21:51,415
I find her uneasy.

396
00:21:51,815 --> 00:21:53,085
She's always gloomy.

397
00:21:54,325 --> 00:21:55,985
Maybe she has a reason.

398
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:57,494
(Aren't you getting ready for the graduation exhibition?)

399
00:21:57,495 --> 00:21:58,924
(Do you want to go for coffee? Or a meal?)

400
00:21:58,925 --> 00:22:03,365
(The graduation exhibition...)

401
00:22:06,695 --> 00:22:07,705
(Seriously...)

402
00:22:17,715 --> 00:22:18,914
(Do you want to go for coffee? Or a meal?)

403
00:22:18,915 --> 00:22:20,114
(Aren't you going to hold the graduation exhibition?)

404
00:22:20,115 --> 00:22:22,115
Hey. What are you doing?

405
00:22:22,445 --> 00:22:24,114
What are you saying?

406
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:25,284
- Let's go first. - Come on.

407
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:27,114
- Let's go, guys. - Yes, let's go.

408
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,324
- It's only the beginning. - Let's go.

409
00:22:28,325 --> 00:22:29,784
Wait for me.

410
00:22:29,785 --> 00:22:30,824
- Watch out. - Don't push me.

411
00:22:30,825 --> 00:22:31,995
That hurts. What are you doing?

412
00:22:32,995 --> 00:22:33,995
Come on.

413
00:22:39,465 --> 00:22:41,165
This is also a trip in a way.

414
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:47,645
Shall we?

415
00:22:56,515 --> 00:22:58,355
(Gongwoojae)

416
00:23:13,195 --> 00:23:14,365
Have a good time with her.

417
00:23:15,565 --> 00:23:16,605
What about you?

418
00:23:18,135 --> 00:23:20,675
What if you two get into a fight?

419
00:23:21,005 --> 00:23:22,775
I don't want to worry about whose side I should take.

420
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:24,175
I'd rather stay here.

421
00:23:24,575 --> 00:23:25,575
Still.

422
00:23:25,576 --> 00:23:27,615
If I stay next to you, it'd bother you.

423
00:23:28,585 --> 00:23:30,115
I'll enjoy the fresh breeze here.

424
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:33,054
It reminds me of the place I went for my first mission.

425
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:34,255
It brings back the memories.

426
00:23:37,485 --> 00:23:39,255
This isn't my only chance.

427
00:23:39,455 --> 00:23:40,625
I'm fine.

428
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:45,695
I'll be back soon.

429
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,305
(Gongwoojae)

430
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:03,484
(Gongwoojae)

431
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:05,855
Gong as in bracing, and woo as in hill.

432
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,094
The painting looks like it's swimming...

433
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:16,725
depending on the light.

434
00:24:16,825 --> 00:24:17,895
Isn't that beautiful?

435
00:24:18,635 --> 00:24:21,265
This is a new piece in our museum.

436
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:23,234
I used the coil technique...

437
00:24:23,235 --> 00:24:24,705
in pottery.

438
00:24:24,935 --> 00:24:26,904
You roll the clay like thick thread...

439
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:28,544
and pile it one by one.

440
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:30,204
Instead of the clay,

441
00:24:30,205 --> 00:24:32,215
I used the thread to make it look more three dimensional.

442
00:24:32,415 --> 00:24:33,644
What's impressive is...

443
00:24:33,645 --> 00:24:37,085
that this artist was born with visual impairment.

444
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:40,315
Instead of her eyes, she drew with her hands.

445
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:43,055
That doesn't mean you can touch it though.

446
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:18,555
Sorry for making you wait.

447
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:21,295
Did I surprise you?

448
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,295
I couldn't believe it at first.

449
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:25,065
It's not a coincidence, is it?

450
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:28,835
No.

451
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:33,305
It's a small art museum slash an atelier.

452
00:25:33,675 --> 00:25:35,175
I have my own room behind the building.

453
00:25:35,375 --> 00:25:36,405
I see.

454
00:25:37,475 --> 00:25:38,975
Were you staying here the whole time?

455
00:25:40,045 --> 00:25:41,045
Yes.

456
00:25:41,615 --> 00:25:43,985
I had a connection.

457
00:25:44,555 --> 00:25:46,454
From curating to docent...

458
00:25:46,455 --> 00:25:47,925
and the building management.

459
00:25:48,585 --> 00:25:50,024
Even though it's such a small art museum,

460
00:25:50,025 --> 00:25:51,695
there's so much work to do.

461
00:25:52,025 --> 00:25:53,895
I feel like I was deceived.

462
00:25:55,825 --> 00:25:56,995
You look well.

463
00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:58,765
This place suits you.

464
00:26:01,105 --> 00:26:03,005
Who left trash out here?

465
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:09,145
Are you doing well yourself?

466
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:11,745
When did you grow up?

467
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,545
You're an adult now.

468
00:26:15,345 --> 00:26:16,415
I left...

469
00:26:17,215 --> 00:26:19,355
as if someone was after me.

470
00:26:20,985 --> 00:26:23,325
I felt bad for leaving without saying goodbye.

471
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,825
I wasn't in my right mind.

472
00:26:28,765 --> 00:26:30,965
You shouldn't apologize to me, Ms. Kim.

473
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:33,465
What?

474
00:26:38,235 --> 00:26:39,305
Actually...

475
00:26:40,275 --> 00:26:41,375
The thing is...

476
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:43,305
Hang on, Hee Wan.

477
00:26:43,905 --> 00:26:45,515
You there, the guy who's smoking!

478
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:48,444
I told you not to smoke out here.

479
00:26:48,445 --> 00:26:50,344
Fine. We're about to leave.

480
00:26:50,345 --> 00:26:53,355
You have a loud voice for a woman.

481
00:26:53,385 --> 00:26:55,485
You should be taught a lesson.

482
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,454
I'll report you this time...

483
00:26:58,455 --> 00:27:01,124
- for trespassing on my property. - Hey, come on.

484
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:02,365
Darn it.

485
00:27:08,235 --> 00:27:09,335
Shall we go?

486
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,605
Oh, right. I have something to give you.

487
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:17,505
Ms. Kim.

488
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:27,285
It's all my fault.

489
00:27:32,195 --> 00:27:33,225
Well...

490
00:27:37,665 --> 00:27:39,735
What happened to Ram Woo.

491
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:42,965
It's my fault that he didn't come home that day.

492
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:48,705
I had won the raffle ticket.

493
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,045
I should've been the one there.

494
00:27:51,315 --> 00:27:53,045
But I sent Ram Woo.

495
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,584
He wouldn't have been there if not for me.

496
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:58,715
It was all me.

497
00:27:59,685 --> 00:28:02,855
When I saw how sad you were,

498
00:28:04,355 --> 00:28:06,495
I ran away without telling you.

499
00:28:07,455 --> 00:28:10,624
I knew you might struggle with it the rest of your life,

500
00:28:10,625 --> 00:28:13,165
but I ignored that and...

501
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:20,435
I see.

502
00:28:22,845 --> 00:28:24,745
Thank you for telling me.

503
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:30,385
The truth is, I had an idea that was what happened.

504
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:37,755
I didn't know that weighed you down for so long.

505
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:42,325
It must've been so hard on you.

506
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:48,465
You poor thing.

507
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:55,005
But that wasn't your fault.

508
00:29:00,715 --> 00:29:02,045
Don't think it was anymore.

509
00:29:12,955 --> 00:29:14,225
I'm sorry.

510
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:16,395
I'm so sorry.

511
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:27,835
I'm sorry.

512
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,445
I haven't had cake in so long.

513
00:29:39,055 --> 00:29:41,854
I had set aside some cake for Ram Woo...

514
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:44,385
from the art studio opening party.

515
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:47,055
But I never had any since then.

516
00:29:48,625 --> 00:29:51,995
One day, someone got me a cake, so I was forced to eat it.

517
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:53,965
It was so delicious.

518
00:29:54,835 --> 00:29:58,635
I wondered why I hadn't eaten something this good for so long.

519
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:00,105
I thought it wasn't fair.

520
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:04,975
I barely remember how I lived after the funeral.

521
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:08,285
I was mean to everyone and put up a wall.

522
00:30:08,415 --> 00:30:10,445
I resented everyone I met.

523
00:30:11,585 --> 00:30:14,215
I think I resented myself most of all.

524
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:18,425
But then I realized I was...

525
00:30:18,725 --> 00:30:22,865
more focused on hating myself than remembering Ram Woo.

526
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,594
After I moved here and started painting again,

527
00:30:26,595 --> 00:30:28,135
I understood...

528
00:30:28,705 --> 00:30:30,335
that what I should do...

529
00:30:30,735 --> 00:30:32,275
wasn't hate others...

530
00:30:32,805 --> 00:30:34,675
but miss and cherish Ram Woo.

531
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:38,714
Anyway, I'm done...

532
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:41,015
resenting others or feeling guilty.

533
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:44,885
I'd like you to live like that too.

534
00:30:48,425 --> 00:30:51,155
Now I just miss Ram Woo and wish I could see him.

535
00:30:51,995 --> 00:30:54,025
He worried about me so much.

536
00:30:55,795 --> 00:30:59,435
I'm actually quite sprightly and strong.

537
00:30:59,835 --> 00:31:01,735
I wish he'd know that.

538
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,275
Just a moment, Ms. Kim.

539
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:11,204
Wait right here.

540
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,575
Where are you going?

541
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:14,815
What?

542
00:31:25,195 --> 00:31:27,025
(Gongwoojae)

543
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:29,865
Kim Ram Woo.

544
00:31:30,325 --> 00:31:31,835
Hey.

545
00:31:35,905 --> 00:31:37,034
Come with me.

546
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:38,775
- What? - Come with me. Hurry.

547
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:39,975
Hey, wait.

548
00:31:42,205 --> 00:31:43,675
Hurry up.

549
00:31:44,505 --> 00:31:45,645
What's going on?

550
00:31:49,285 --> 00:31:51,015
Hey, no. Wait.

551
00:31:51,415 --> 00:31:52,485
Stay there.

552
00:31:54,215 --> 00:31:56,155
I'm sure I put it here.

553
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:35,195
(Cocoball)

554
00:32:37,865 --> 00:32:38,995
There it is.

555
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:40,695
How warm.

556
00:34:06,315 --> 00:34:07,515
Hi, Mom.

557
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:11,495
Bye.

558
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:53,394
Why do people have a stronger urge to die...

559
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:56,134
in spring when everything comes to life, not winter?

560
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:59,705
Because everything is shining and vibrant?

561
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:02,345
Then shouldn't people want to live more?

562
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:04,604
They must feel more miserable...

563
00:35:04,605 --> 00:35:07,215
because everything or everyone except for them...

564
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:08,745
appears to be full of joy.

565
00:35:08,845 --> 00:35:10,244
What are you talking about?

566
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:12,854
We were talking about our increased workload.

567
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:13,915
Isn't that because...

568
00:35:14,215 --> 00:35:16,624
Grim Reaper Park quit?

569
00:35:16,625 --> 00:35:17,884
So we're short-staffed. Isn't that it?

570
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:18,995
Sure.

571
00:35:19,725 --> 00:35:23,264
But Park didn't quit.

572
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:24,565
Park was vanished.

573
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:28,635
Vanished?

574
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:30,634
Park's daughter was sick.

575
00:35:30,635 --> 00:35:33,175
Park couldn't help but go AWOL to visit her daughter.

576
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:35,045
- So? - It's over.

577
00:35:35,205 --> 00:35:36,374
What about the daughter?

578
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:37,504
She probably lived.

579
00:35:37,505 --> 00:35:39,375
But I don't know how long she'll last.

580
00:35:39,575 --> 00:35:42,344
Grim Reaper Park didn't obey what was written on the roll.

581
00:35:42,345 --> 00:35:43,345
And now...

582
00:35:43,346 --> 00:35:45,285
Park will never get to see...

583
00:35:46,285 --> 00:35:48,755
her daughter or anyone else for that matter.

584
00:35:49,525 --> 00:35:52,595
In the end, when you defy what's written on the roll,

585
00:35:53,425 --> 00:35:55,425
you will vanish forever.

586
00:35:56,865 --> 00:35:58,394
(Say goodbye, go on a picnic with boxed meals,)

587
00:35:58,395 --> 00:35:59,494
(stay at an amusement park from morning until night,)

588
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:00,694
(have gimbap all day, do a good deed,)

589
00:36:00,695 --> 00:36:01,735
(meet Ms. Kim, tell her the truth)

590
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:11,005
Hee Wan, what are you doing out here?

591
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:14,215
Put this on.

592
00:36:14,415 --> 00:36:16,545
The temperature drops a lot here at night.

593
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:19,255
This is Ram Woo's.

594
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:22,925
It was Ram Woo's favourite jacket.

595
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:24,785
Why are you...

596
00:36:24,995 --> 00:36:28,095
If you wear it, I'm sure it will make him happy too.

597
00:36:28,565 --> 00:36:29,795
It's slightly big.

598
00:36:30,625 --> 00:36:31,765
But here.

599
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:38,575
My gosh, it looks great on you.

600
00:36:42,045 --> 00:36:43,905
There's a load off your chest now, right?

601
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:48,115
Thank you.

602
00:36:50,515 --> 00:36:51,545
Ms. Kim.

603
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:56,285
Promise me you'll be happy. I...

604
00:36:58,285 --> 00:36:59,555
Even if I can't come back.

605
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:02,125
You won't come back?

606
00:37:04,965 --> 00:37:07,264
My gosh, there's a hill behind this building.

607
00:37:07,265 --> 00:37:09,135
And the night view there is amazing.

608
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:11,405
But it's too dark right now.

609
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:19,515
The lights have been out of order for a while now.

610
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:22,045
The lights weren't working up until a moment ago.

611
00:37:22,785 --> 00:37:24,485
It's suddenly so bright now.

612
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:25,685
How fascinating.

613
00:37:43,935 --> 00:37:45,105
How beautiful.

614
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:49,875
And it's bright too.

615
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:51,845
Yes, indeed.

616
00:37:58,115 --> 00:37:59,185
What are these?

617
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:01,015
My bucket list.

618
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:02,824
(Visit Mom.)

619
00:38:02,825 --> 00:38:04,825
Do those, and it'll be the end.

620
00:38:07,155 --> 00:38:09,294
I'll disappear from your sight right away.

621
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:10,295
All right?

622
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:20,735
Ms. Kim.

623
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:25,515
I'm sorry. But I must get going.

624
00:38:26,815 --> 00:38:27,875
Hee Wan.

625
00:38:30,985 --> 00:38:32,055
Ram Woo.

626
00:38:32,955 --> 00:38:34,015
Kim Ram Woo!

627
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,555
Where are you? Kim Ram Woo!

628
00:38:37,885 --> 00:38:38,895
Ram Woo...

629
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:42,425
Only 10, okay? Just 10.

630
00:38:43,865 --> 00:38:45,895
You can do that for me, no?

631
00:38:46,965 --> 00:38:49,105
- Will you leave after we do ten? - Kim Ram Woo.

632
00:38:49,365 --> 00:38:50,735
- Kim Ram Woo! - Promise me.

633
00:38:50,805 --> 00:38:52,904
That you'll leave me after we're done...

634
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:54,105
and won't come see me again.

635
00:38:55,405 --> 00:38:56,604
Tell me what you want to do.

636
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:58,005
I'll keep you company.

637
00:38:58,305 --> 00:38:59,874
I have a wish, okay?

638
00:38:59,875 --> 00:39:01,315
It's not to see you after finishing the list.

639
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,215
Don't worry, okay?

640
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:06,055
I can only be with you for a few days.

641
00:39:06,315 --> 00:39:07,854
I will leave even if you stop me.

642
00:39:07,855 --> 00:39:09,025
I won't return even if you tell me to.

643
00:39:09,385 --> 00:39:10,385
Really.

644
00:39:11,385 --> 00:39:12,395
I hate this.

645
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,555
Kim Ram Woo! Please.

646
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:17,665
Be with me just a little longer. Please.

647
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:22,505
Kim Ram Woo.

648
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:26,605
Kim Ram Woo!

649
00:39:29,505 --> 00:39:30,545
Ram Woo?

650
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:34,675
Ran Woo.

651
00:39:36,745 --> 00:39:38,015
Did something happen?

652
00:40:24,465 --> 00:40:27,765
After you left like that,

653
00:40:28,365 --> 00:40:29,865
I had a messed-up life.

654
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,975
It felt like I was trapped in a strange time.

655
00:40:36,805 --> 00:40:38,775
I couldn't go back or move on.

656
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:43,985
I was stuck in that moment when others were moving on.

657
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:48,285
But nobody could understand that, which hurt me so much.

658
00:40:50,655 --> 00:40:52,495
I did wish...

659
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:58,935
to die quietly and easily.

660
00:41:00,035 --> 00:41:02,335
But during the week I've been with you,

661
00:41:02,705 --> 00:41:05,205
my time has finally started flowing.

662
00:41:06,475 --> 00:41:08,575
While I was with you, I hoped...

663
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:12,045
the day wouldn't end for the first time.

664
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:23,525
But we only have one day left, right?

665
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:28,725
Is it true?

666
00:41:29,465 --> 00:41:31,525
Will it all end tomorrow?

667
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:46,275
Did you really come to get me?

668
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:52,985
Have you visited them?

669
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:55,455
Your family or friends.

670
00:41:55,925 --> 00:41:57,555
I have. Just once.

671
00:41:57,855 --> 00:41:58,925
"Just once?"

672
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:02,525
Did you not go see them again after that?

673
00:42:03,125 --> 00:42:04,965
No. It's unbearable.

674
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:07,295
It'd be great if they're doing well.

675
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,805
But it's best just to hope for that.

676
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:13,635
What if you drop by...

677
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:16,045
and they're living a wrecked life?

678
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:18,545
There's nothing you can do.

679
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:20,675
You'd wish you hadn't visited in the first place.

680
00:42:22,645 --> 00:42:25,245
What was it like back then for you?

681
00:42:27,015 --> 00:42:28,115
I don't remember.

682
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,974

00:42:50,975 --> 00:42:53,815

(Suicide: Building rooftop in Seodaemun-gu, Seoul)

687
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:26,645
(Thank you for everything.)

688
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:27,435
Jung Hee Wan.

689
00:44:30,805 --> 00:44:32,645
