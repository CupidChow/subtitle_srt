1
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:06,750
   

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,720
   

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,710
   

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,300
   

5
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,970
   

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,130
♫  Broken hearts and dreams ♫

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,020
♫  Burn all your troubles away ♫

8
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:50,850


9
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,690
   

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,700
What does your husband do that

11
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:05,930
he made his wife and son move alone?

12
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,070
It's okay.

13
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,360
Anyway, you have way more stuff than I thought.

14
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,570
I'd actually need another person.

15
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,620
I think I need to charge more.

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:17,150
- Sir. 
 - Yes.

17
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,500
Why bring that up now?

18
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,660
Well, I just...

19
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:26,390
 I hated spring the most. 

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,210
Submit it by next week.

21
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,890
   

22
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,100
   

23
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,130
I hate writing this every March.

24
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,910
What should I say my dream job is?

25
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:55,570
Just make it up, then.

26
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,360
Last year, I said my mom works for the NIS

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,980
and can't reveal details.

28
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:02,570
So the homeroom teacher didn't ask anything.

29
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,480
Wow, that's smart.

30
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,660
What are you doing?

31
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,920
Hey, Kim Ram Woo.

32
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,660
- What's this? 
 - My mom painted this.

33
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,150
She kept calling it a nuisance.

34
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,480
She's actually throwing it away.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,120
Is your mom an artist?

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,330
Yeah.

37
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,700
She used to be, but not anymore.

38
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,720
Hey, why didn't you tell me?

39
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,500
Hey, this is so cool.

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,050
It's amazing.

41
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:45,110
I want to paint like this, too.

42
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,340
Your mom really painted this?

43
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,500
- Yes. 
 - Wow.

44
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,350
It's so cool.

45
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,560
Gosh, what's this?

46
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,900
It's amateur work. You shouldn't have.

47
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,540
I won't put it on auction even if you get famous.

48
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,350
What do you mean by auction?

49
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,970
There's no way.

50
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,230
Hee Wan, stop scribbling on your journal

51
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,540
and do something cool like this, too.

52
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,110
Gosh, no.

53
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,800
Her work is so impressive.

54
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,800
Not everyone can do this.

55
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,130
I think she has real talent.

56
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,660
Do you really think so?

57
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,930
Of course.

58
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,380
The college prep academy said otherwise.

59
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,310
My wild daughter...

60
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,890
needs to be tamed a bit, right?

61
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,170
Don't ever be discouraged.

62
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,170
Don't listen to people who don't

63
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,140
recognize your talent.

64
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,530
Okay.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,890
Going home, ma'am?

66
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,390
Yes.

67
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,120
Are you off work, Teacher?

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,480
You scared me.

69
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,130
Let's go, Teacher.

70
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:08,060
Where?

71
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,520
Were you waiting for me?

72
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,280
And what's with "Teacher"?

73
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,930
Teach me how to draw.

74
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,130
You're at a very important stage.

75
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,980
You can't just learn from anyone.

76
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,210
I'm doing this because I don't want to.

77
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,810
I want to learn from someone who recognizes me.

78
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,920
That's what you said that day.

79
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,060
I'm way more intense than academies.

80
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,900
You're scared, aren't you?

81
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:37,320
That means you'll teach me, right?

82
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,700
- No. 
 - Yes.

83
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,100
- What? 
 - Yes.

84
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,700
It must be somewhere.

85
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,630
- Did I throw it away? 
 - Isn't this it?

86
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,830
It dried out, but let's try it.

87
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,430
We can use a different palette.

88
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,250
Should we use Ram Woo's bowl?

89
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,250
Yes, yes, yes.

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,880
Mom, have you seen my toothbrush—

91
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,300
Seriously.

92
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,490
Hey, it wasn't easy building that.

93
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:31,380
Hey, I'm focused for once. Please cooperate.

94
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,860
Sorry.

95
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,220
 I started becoming extremely busy starting that winter. 

96
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,010
You scared me.

97
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,590
When did you get here?

98
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:50,680
Did you sleep at all?

99
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,500
I'll sleep for a year once I go to college.

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,590
Seriously...

101
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,680
Your nose is running.

102
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,830
 We became so familiar with each other 

103
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:08,380
 that we weren't shy to get comfortable. 

104
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,460
Geez, your gross hand...

105
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,230
Hey!

106
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,970
   

107
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:20,660
   

108
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,710
   

109
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:26,220
 - I'm in Class 4. 
 - Class 4? 

110
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,920
   

111
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,790
 And we sometimes had lucky days. 

112
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,990
♫  Even if I returned to that promised day  ♫

113
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:35,230
♫  The moon would never set the same again  ♫

114
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:37,440
♫  Open your eyes, I'm on your side  ♫

115
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,780
♫  Until the moment time stands still  ♫

116
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,060
♫  Always always always  ♫

117
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,050
♫  Everything's a glow  ♫

118
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:53,740
♫  Our eternal memories in time... Everything's so bright  ♫

119
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:56,720
 Wearing wigs on April Fools' Day was fun. 

120
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,690
Aren't we doing anything today?

121
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,300
I guess we shouldn't do that in 12th grade.

122
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,090
♫  You are my best luck  ♫

123
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,150
   

124
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:16,010
Hey, hey...

125
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:18,280
Geez, what's this?

126
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,810
We got you, we got you.

127
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,380
- Did you get tricked? 
 - Look at his face. How ugly.

128
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,460
- How do you feel? 
 - This isn't fun.

129
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,840
It came well.

130
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,300
 I still didn't have answers for a lot of things, 

131
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,420
 but it was good that I started liking stuff. 

132
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,070
We finished it.

133
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,530
Am I satisfied with school...

134
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,650
 But... 

135
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,940
 at some point... 

136
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,470
Sit here, then.

137
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:46,810
I'll get dinner. Help Hee Wan.

138
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,100
Like this.

139
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,200
Mom, I'll go get it.

140
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,030
Thank you.

141
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,010
Hey, my nose is itchy.

142
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,400
- What? 
 - It's nothing. Just hurry.

143
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,140
I'm trying.

144
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,520
The light reflection is tricky.

145
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,150
Why is painting water always so hard?

146
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,130
What?

147
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,560
What is it?

148
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:45,620
What do you mean?

149
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,830
Look somewhere else. I can't focus.

150
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:49,420
Okay.

151
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,580
What is it?

152
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,440
What? I-I didn't say anything.

153
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,130
Why make eye contact? Look elsewhere.

154
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,770
I said I can't focus if you look at me.

155
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,740
He doesn't listen. Seriously.

156
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,350
Geez, seriously!

157
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,260
Why are your hands so difficult?

158
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,580
What do you mean? I quit, too.

159
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,470
My hands are sweaty because I'm hot.

160
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,560
- Why are your hands sweaty... 
 - It's so hot.

161
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,520
Geez.

162
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,840
Hey, a shooting star! A shooting star!

163
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,630
You scared me.

164
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,960
Where?

165
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,480
- Where? 
 - Did you miss it?

166
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,650
It passed by just now.

167
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,100
Geez, you scared me.

168
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,720
Hey...

169
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,740
it's not a shooting star. It's probably a drone.

170
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,200
Hey...

171
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,690
you think I can't tell them apart?

172
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,090
You think I'm stupid?

173
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:26,170
Yes, let's say you saw it.

174
00:10:26,170 --> 00:10:28,840
But the buildings are tall and

175
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,980
the lights are bright. It's hard to see.

176
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,800
How do you know?

177
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,160
Before I moved here the last time,

178
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,050
I lived in a remote area in Gangwon-do.

179
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,130
I used to see tons of stars there.

180
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,440
The time before the last time?

181
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,460
How many times have you moved?

182
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,440
Did you actually see a shooting star then?

183
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,810
No.

184
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,170
I don't think I've ever seen one.

185
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:58,570
It'd be... so romantic

186
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,570
to see it together.

187
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I mean, with everyone else.

188
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,780
With Ms. Kim, Tae Kyung, Hong Seok,

189
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,940
you, and me. All of us.

190
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,530
If we saw it together like that...

191
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,170
That'd be nice...

192
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,680
Seeing it just the two of us seems nice to me.

193
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,380
♫  It feels like you're coming to me by chance  ♫

194
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,600
♫  I can smell the scent of spring  ♫

195
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,670
- I-It's not that. I— 
 - Yes...

196
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,810
- By two, I mean— 
 - I know.

197
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:33,990
- Yes, the two— 
 - Yes, the two of us are...

198
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,840
Yes, there are Hong Seok and Tae Kyung.

199
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,940
- So, I meant in pairs like this... 
 - Two and two...

200
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,950
In pairs, you know...

201
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,720
The new tonkatsu shop is popular.

202
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,450
- It took forever. Let's eat. 
 - Yes.

203
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:48,520
I'm not hungry. See you tomorrow.

204
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,580
Enjoy.

205
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,760
Didn't she say she was hungry every five minutes?

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,730
♫  I drag my tired body and cross this street  ♫

207
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:08,450
♫  Leaving the cold winter behind, I open my eyes to this spring  ♫

208
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,490
♫  All the words I once held back, the confessions I rehearsed  ♫

209
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,040
Is he crazy? How could he say that so casually?

210
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,960
♫  It feels like you're coming to me by chance  ♫

211
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,000
♫  I can smell the scent of spring  ♫

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,470
   

213
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,790
   

214
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,420
This isn't it. This isn't it.

215
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:36,050
♫  This gentle feeling, this flutter, without realizing...  ♫

216
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:40,450
   

217
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,680
What are you looking at?

218
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,920
Can't believe I'm seeing you as a college student.

219
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,830
Why can't you believe it?

220
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,680
You're the only one...

221
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,530
who looks so extremely bored.

222
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,470
The last semester is always like this, right?

223
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:14,520
You did everything you wanted to do, right?

224
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:17,450
What did I want to do?

225
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:19,100
You used to say it all the time, like a habit.

226
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,530
You wanted a group date, become a campus couple,

227
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,820
join a student association, drink,

228
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,140
and go on a trip with the group.

229
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,700
You wanted to get a scholarship,

230
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,430
become an exchange student, and graduate early—

231
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,530
Your memory is annoyingly good. So annoying.

232
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,630
So which association did you join?

233
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:35,620
- I didn't. 
 - How about that trip?

234
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:38,640
- Did you become a campus couple? 
 - Gosh, stop asking.

235
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,870
What? What, what is it now?

236
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,300
What, what?

237
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,320
What is it?

238
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,640
Gosh, seriously.

239
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,180
Why are you so boring now?

240
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,840
What happened to you, Kim Ram Woo?

241
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,470
Why did you bring me to my school for a bucket list?

242
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,480
What are you trying to do?

243
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,950
I brought you here for you.

244
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,440
There must be things to sort out here.

245
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,700
You'll never come back here.

246
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,090
There's nothing to sort out.

247
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:21,340
Hey, you studied here for four years.

248
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,010
You have no one to say goodbye to?

249
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,600
Classmates, juniors, seniors,

250
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,460
- professors, TAs— 
 - No, no, I said!

251
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:32,240
Are you okay? Sorry, sorry.

252
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,860
Kim Ram Woo, are you okay?

253
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,370
Are you okay?

254
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:37,320
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,100
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, no...

256
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,030
Excuse me.

257
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,890
We took a class together once.

258
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:49,230
What was your name?

259
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,740
Me? I'm Jeong Hee Wan.

260
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,830
Yes, Hee Wan.

261
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,720
Hee Wan.

262
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,250
- We're in the same department. 
 - Really?

263
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,020
You know at least one person here.

264
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,540
I'll do it, I'll do it.

265
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,550
No, let me, let me.

266
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,530
Will you... will you be okay?

267
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,670
Gosh, be careful...

268
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:13,580
Oh, my gosh...

269
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,750
No, no, gosh...

270
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:16,930
I'm really okay.

271
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,420
I don't think you are.

272
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:20,560
Gosh, here...

273
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,460
They aren't here yet?

274
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,940
- Right here. 
 - Okay.

275
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,100
It's the department office.

276
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,800
- Right here, right? 
 - Yeah, yeah.

277
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:30,830
Give it to me.

278
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,570
Wow, daebak!

279
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:34,660
This place is awesome.

280
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,020
Are you leaving now, Hee Wan?

281
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,140
Yes, I need to go.

282
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,540
Isn't all this from your place?

283
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,580
Wait, let me get you something to drink.

284
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,800
No, let's just go out to eat.

285
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,160
The two of us?

286
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,020
Yes, the two of us.

287
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,810
I see. You don't want to eat with me.

288
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,780
It's not that. I really need to go.

289
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,760
I understand.

290
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,660
We took a class together once.

291
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,090
Do you even know her name?

292
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,120
My name is Go Yeong Hyun.

293
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,580
I'm two years your senior.

294
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,370
You don't remember?

295
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,810
I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of it.

296
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,810
You don't recognize a senior you took a class with?

297
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,960
How inattentive.

298
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,940
Since you don't come to department events, it's understandable.

299
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,550
I'm not criticizing you.

300
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,260
Well, I need to go.

301
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,090
If you win Sticky Sticks first place,

302
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:25,510
you get an iPad Pro.

303
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,810
Everyone must be heading there.

304
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:29,180
Say hello before you go. It's been a while.

305
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:31,380
Well...

306
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,960
I have a class.

307
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,880
- What? A class? 
 - Yes.

308
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,090
You said you're free today.

309
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,440
Come here for a second.

310
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,650
Come here.

311
00:16:39,650 --> 00:16:42,080
This is called Sticky Sticks.

312
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,340
- It's the best board game— 
 - Be quiet.

313
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:46,610
I don't think there are classes today...

314
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,700
because of the festival.

315
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,270
- Well... 
 - She's your senior.

316
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,370
She won't buy a lie like that.

317
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,010
Check this out first, please, in the middle—

318
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:00,200
We prepared that as an event.

319
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,000
Have a look.

320
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,850
We spent a lot on the prizes this time.

321
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,590
Second place gets Sony headphones.

322
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,160
Get out.

323
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,530
Get out?

324
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,890
No, no, no.

325
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,380
What do you get out of it?

326
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,860
Yes, yes, yes.

327
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,380
- A tablet, headphones, 
 - Just have a quick look.

328
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,980
An Apple Watch.

329
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,760
This is daebak! Daebak!

330
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,150
- Are you okay? 
 - Are you okay?

331
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,540
- Yes. 
  - Did you see ours? 

332
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,840
 - It turned out so well. 
 - It doesn't compare. 

333
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:46,330
- Ours is the best. 
 - It really is.

334
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:53,590
I didn't do it.

335
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,580
I didn't either.

336
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,640
It might get on your skirt.

337
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,560
Wipe that first, Sunbae.

338
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,310
- I'll do it. 
 - It's okay.

339
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:06,100
Wipe that.

340
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,550
I'm so sorry.

341
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:10,250
We spent the rest of the money on alcohol.

342
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,370
What do we do now?

343
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:13,440
I thought it'd be a hit with a nice design.

344
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,800
Who put the paint here anyway?

345
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,880
I feel terrible.

346
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,130
I'll try to figure out something, so...

347
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,560
You need to attend the meeting now.

348
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,700
Meeting?

349
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,890
Why is she suddenly here, anyway?

350
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,500
She never cared about school stuff.

351
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,730
Tell her to clean, too.

352
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,190
She has a class today.

353
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,070
I'll clean everything.

354
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,390
I think it's coming out.

355
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:52,010
- Hee Wan. 
 - We're going with this menu, right?

356
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,920
I-Is this the one?

357
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,120
Yes, it is.

358
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,100
It is.

359
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,200
What? What...

360
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,210
What's she doing?

361
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,940
It's better than the last one.

362
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,570
A little to the right. 
    

363
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,820
To the middle. To the middle.

364
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,660
- Here? 
 - To the right, I think.

365
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,300
I knew it.

366
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,230
Ours is better than the old one.

367
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:29,660
Right there, right there.

368
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,450
"Ours"?

369
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:35,160
Hee Wan saved us.

370
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,470
You did a great job.

371
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,170
Applause!

372
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,210
No, no...

373
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,960
Is your graduation show going to look like this?

374
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,480
Didn't you focus on Typography?

375
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,890
I don't have a plan yet.

376
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,570
How will you graduate, then?

377
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,430
Will you stay a senior forever?

378
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,410
Like Yeong Hyun?

379
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:53,290
Hey, you...

380
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,430
Well...

381
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:59,230
I think I'll have a bit of a situation.

382
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,730
Excuse me.

383
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:05,830
Hello.

384
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,880
We're from the history department.

385
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,500
Could we ask you for one too?

386
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,840
- Ask for what? 
 - That stuff. That stuff.

387
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,910
That, that.

388
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,180
Oh, that?

389
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,750
We barely managed to make it today, too.

390
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,890
Just this once, please.

391
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,600
Just once.

392
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,650
Daebak!

393
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,820
   

394
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,150
Hee Wan.

395
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,490
Let's do one for the philosophy department, too.

396
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,860
- Eat some. 
 - The philosophy department?

397
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,380
Yes.

398
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,850
The engineering department asked for one, too.

399
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,770
Daebak!

400
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,310
The sign business is hotter than our bar.

401
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,690
Have you gone to Mi Yeon's, then?

402
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:19,360
It's near the rear gate.

403
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,050
No. Are they famous?

404
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:23,800
- Geez. 
 - Tell her.

405
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,770
Their tteokbokki is amazing.

406
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,950
Really?

407
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,490
How about the Fawn?

408
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:30,250
The Fawn? What are they?

409
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,980
Geez.

410
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,190
The gamjatang restaurant.

411
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,580
You've been wasting your time. Seriously.

412
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,010
Gamjatang.

413
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,010
Hey, write them down. Write them down.

414
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,300
W-What did you say?

415
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,820
I'll check them out later.

416
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,950
You scared me.

417
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,970
Good thing I caused trouble today.

418
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:56,800
It was a huge hit.

419
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,180
You should've come to department events.

420
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,280
Why were you so busy?

421
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,520
It's not that I was busy...

422
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,830
I just struggle with enjoying things by myself.

423
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:26,000
Hee Wan,

424
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,590
let me know if you need help anytime.

425
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,630
- The graduation show. 
 - Pardon?

426
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,880
No need to feel pressure at all.

427
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,170
I'd love to get some help, too.

428
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:38,350
Let's help each other out.

429
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,940
No way.

430
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,700
Gosh, you sly jerk.

431
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,400
There's something off with this game.

432
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,450
I'm good at it, but this isn't right.

433
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,250
Nothing's wrong.

434
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,540
Hurry up and take it.

435
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,300
Done, done, done.

436
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:05,590
Why are you grunting?

437
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,770
- Who's next? Who's next? 
 - Let's go, go.

438
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,960
Hold on. Hold on.

439
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,320
Climb up.

440
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,120
Hold on.

441
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,480
You picked this, didn't you?

442
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,080
Was your mouth photoshopped?

443
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,740
It's like a burger.

444
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,680
We'll find a spot.

445
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,030
Get snacks at the convenience store.

446
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,410
Okay, ice cream. Yes or no?

447
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,350
- Yes. Of course. 
 - Tae Kyung wants

448
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,570
the Hershey's green tea.

449
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:35,810
Hee Wan wants Okdongja, right?

450
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,520
- That's right. 
 - He's pretty useful.

451
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,160
Thank you.

452
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,650
You're trying hard.

453
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:48,510
What do you think? I'm almost there, right?

454
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,850
I'm not sure about that, but you seem to get along well.

455
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:54,120
I noticed while taking pictures, too.

456
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,100
Did you notice?

457
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,580
Look, look.

458
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,320
I wanted one with just the two of us.

459
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,470
Won't you support me?

460
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:06,220
Help me out a bit.

461
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,980
But it turned out well, right?

462
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,690
You liked Jeong Hee Wan?

463
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,640
Yes. What?

464
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,180
Who else, then?

465
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,890
What are you saying?

466
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,120
We need the sparklers, too.

467
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,880
I noticed that Hee Wan wants fireworks.

468
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:33,100
 When did it start for Lee Hong Seok? 

469
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,810
 I started getting to know him at the beginning of 11th grade. 

470
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:42,260
 It was when we went to an internet cafe to play a video game. 

471
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,600
 The building the internet cafe was in 

472
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,230
 happened to be my mom's workplace. 

473
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,560
 Lee Hong Seok's ex-girlfriend 

474
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,970
 was working there, too. 

475
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,880
   

476
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,280
   

477
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,410
No, not that one.

478
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:12,660
This one.

479
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,350
- I'm done. 
 - No, no, no.

480
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:24,000
What? You can't just take it again.

481
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,270
You don't seem to understand the rules.

482
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,640
You get discounts based on the number of masks.

483
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,550
I was able to get one with what I had.

484
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,680
Right now, we're using the points.

485
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,220
I don't know. I don't know.

486
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,200
Why is this game so hard?

487
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,270
The recommended age is 10 and up.

488
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,800
Hold on.

489
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,410
I'm focusing. I'm learning.

490
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,130
   

491
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,260
Let's go home now.

492
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,820
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

493
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:55,760
Just one more round. What do you say?

494
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,970
 I learned this later, 

495
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,300
 but at the time, he upset his whole family 

496
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,120
 because he said he'd quit swimming. 

497
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,960
Hey, Kim Ram Woo!

498
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,010
What are you doing later?

499
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,300
- What's with him? 
 - Let's play another round later.

500
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,830
A revenge battle. Let's go!

501
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,780
How does this work?

502
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,910
That's mine...

503
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,380
But, but...

504
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,510
I think you're too worked up now.

505
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:35,850
Let's play with a smile. It's for fun.

506
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:37,800
Yes. I'm smiling. I'm smiling.

507
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,730
But I'm playing to win, not for fun.

508
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:44,160
I'm doing this instead of hanging out with friends.

509
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,800
You keep pretending you have many friends.

510
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,230
But maybe I'm your only friend.

511
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,130
 We happened to become friends, 

512
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,880
 but I thought we were very different. 

513
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,920
 But maybe... 

514
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,970
 we were more similar than I thought. 

515
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:06,250
Ahjumma, what are you doing?

516
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,620
What are you doing later?

517
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,000
Should we go somewhere with Ram Woo?

518
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,140
What?

519
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,050
 I wonder when it started for him. 

520
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,770
Hey, hey, hey!

521
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,070
Hey!

522
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,940
You scared me.

523
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,800
You can just fly it like this?

524
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,310
Will it turn into fireworks?

525
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,320
No, let me...

526
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,060
Here.

527
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,660
 - Where? 
 - Did you miss it? 

528
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:13,810
 It passed by just now. 

529
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,820
Why are you home so early?

530
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,440
You said you were hanging out with friends.

531
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,300
Yes.

532
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,700
Did you eat already?

533
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:34,360
Yeah, I did.

534
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,050
Okay.

535
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,440
Are we moving again?

536
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,540
What?

537
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,350
Where are we going? Somewhere far?

538
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,260
No, we aren't moving.

539
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,630
Why did you think that?

540
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,940
No, I just meant...

541
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,310
I wanted us to stop moving now.

542
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,440
I like the school here,

543
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,700
although I'm graduating soon.

544
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,560
We aren't moving anymore.

545
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,720
Don't worry.

546
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,090
I like your friends, too.

547
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:11,560
Hong Seok and Hee Wan.

548
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,790
   

549
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,560
Ta-da!

550
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,900
Check this out.

551
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,020
It was on sale, so I bought it at this price.

552
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:25,490
I noticed a nice coat on the way to the store.

553
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,640
And I ran into Hee Wan's dad right there.

554
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,960
Isn't that so funny?

555
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:32,680
It suits you so well.

556
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:37,050
 Wow, look at them. Look at them. 

557
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,870
 You've been caught. 

558
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,300
 How cute! 

559
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:45,320
It's not like that. My dad got it for me.

560
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:49,020
Everyone at school has a coat like this.

561
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,910
Don't be shy.

562
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,490
Kim Ram Woo, I'm taking your gym clothes.

563
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,200
Kim Ram Woo and Jeong Hee Wan are dating, right?

564
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,370
Just announce it already.

565
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,550
Or start dating now!

566
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,320
You saw that, right?

567
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:08,390
- It's not like that. 
  - Start dating! 

568
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,560
- Come on now. 
  - Start dating! 

569
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,930
 Start dating! 

570
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,130
It's not like that, I said.

571
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,350
It's not like that.

572
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:20,070
 Start dating! Start dating! 

573
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,810
 Start dating! 

574
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,860
Hold hands!

575
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,550
What?

576
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,710
It's not like that, I said.

577
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,980
Okay?

578
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,760
We don't have gym class today.

579
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,430
 They weren't a good match. 

580
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:52,950
Aren't you hungry?

581
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,070
I'm starving.

582
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,720
Have you seen Kim Ram Woo, by any chance?

583
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,190
Your friend took her with him.

584
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,590
Excuse me, Hee Wan.

585
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,930
I'm reading a royal drama comic book right now.

586
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:31,800
The male lead is a romantic knight who turns out to be impassioned.

587
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,360
He lost his chance to swear by his blood to a princess.

588
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,160
So he's about to lose her to the evil king.

589
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,450
So he starts losing it, but—

590
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,460
Excuse me. I'm sorry, but...

591
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:45,340
I need to go now.

592
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,130
I'm saying,

593
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,110
you can't lose her like this.

594
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,850
We're Team Hee Wan and Ram Woo.

595
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:55,240
Yes.

596
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:58,410
What should I do, then?

597
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,600
Do what?

598
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,610
I mean, how can I make her like me?

599
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,210
I think you can just tell her.

600
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:12,980
♫  It feels like you're coming to me by chance  ♫

601
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:15,790
I like you, Hee Wan.

602
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,590
Make sure to make eye contact

603
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,920
and say her name after saying, "I like you."

604
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,250
Put your coat on her, too.

605
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,950
Yes.

606
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:30,080
♫  This gentle feeling, this flutter, without realizing, it's suddenly spring  ♫

607
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,890
 - Chief Knight.  
 - Yes?

608
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,570
Fighting!

609
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:41,330
♫  In the whirlwind of time rushing past  ♫

610
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,610
Like this? Now?

611
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,120
One more time. One more time.

612
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,870
Like this?

613
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,920
Hold on. One more time. Sorry. One more time.

614
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,380
Like this?

615
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,280
What should we eat?

616
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,110
I won't eat. I'm full.

617
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:03,640
♫  All the words I once held back, the confessions I rehearsed  ♫

618
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,550
Splash like this. Like this.

619
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,870
- Like this? 
 - Lightly like this.

620
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,640
Now is the time.

621
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,210
Why isn't it working today?

622
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:15,710
Let me look.

623
00:33:16,890 --> 00:33:19,140
What? You nailed it.

624
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,510
How can you do better than this?

625
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,880
You're getting accepted. You are.

626
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,340
No.

627
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,410
How can I go to college like this?

628
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:28,830
You must be happy.

629
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:31,170
You just need to keep at what you're good at.

630
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,850
What am I good at?

631
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,980
Swimming.

632
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,040
I quit swimming a long time ago.

633
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,770
What? Really?

634
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:44,010
Why? You were the seal of Yiyeon Middle School.

635
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:49,170
I guess you don't know my specialty is false starts.

636
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,970
Well...

637
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:56,710
I wanted to make a record and felt anxious.

638
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,700
So I kept making false starts.

639
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,330
And my record got worse and worse.

640
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,830
Also, I'm avoiding it to move on

641
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:05,450
while prepping for PE college.

642
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:06,510
I see.

643
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,580
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

644
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,090
Why should you be sorry?

645
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:14,390
Whatever, whatever.

646
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,520
But I see it now that I'm back here after a while.

647
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:22,310
I love the smell of the swimming pool.

648
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:27,150
This is why people need to do what they want to do.

649
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,300
Right?

650
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:32,520
Hey, by the way,

651
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,410
Jeong Hee Wan isn't coming, is he?

652
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:39,630
No. I didn't invite him. I only invited you.

653
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:41,140
I see.

654
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,490
How did you know I was struggling with this, then?

655
00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:47,640
I thought Hee Wan told you.

656
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,920
I want a tattoo that represents swimming.

657
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,290
Can you design one for me?

658
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,930
- A tattoo? 
 - Yes.

659
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,590
You need to be careful with that.

660
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:00,860
It lasts forever.

661
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,640
You can design a good one, then.

662
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,250
You don't think you can?

663
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,990
What's with you?

664
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,760
Hurry.

665
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,300
- A tattoo? 
 - Yes.

666
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,980
What represents swimming?

667
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,130
- A tube? 
 - A tube.

668
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,870
How about a seal since it was your nickname?

669
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,370
Maybe it was your looks, not your swimming skills.

670
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:27,460
- You look like a seal. 
 - A seal? What?

671
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,420
- Geez. Wait, wait! 
 - You're the worst.

672
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

673
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,560
Hold on!

674
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,590
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

675
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,040
I'm sorry!

676
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,030
You started first. You started first.

677
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,040
- I'm a seal. I'm a seal. 
 - I got it.

678
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,880
- I'm a seal. 
 - Wait.

679
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,090
- Should we stop? 
 - Yes.

680
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:46,530
Okay.

681
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,840
Are you crazy? Geez!

682
00:36:06,810 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm all wet.

683
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:13,720
How did we get in if you quit swimming?

684
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,560
Can we just hang out here like this?

685
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,050
I've been here since I was in kindergarten.

686
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:22,570
So I'm like the security guard's third son—

687
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,840
Hello, sir. Long time no see.

688
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,730
You look even younger.

689
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,130
You little jerk...

690
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:33,670
When did you steal the key?

691
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,680
- I'm sorry. 
 - I'm sorry.

692
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,630
I took it when I quit.

693
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:38,520
But I used it only once today.

694
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,630
You jerk!

695
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,240
Hey, what school are you from?

696
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:44,560
We're from the same school.

697
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,800
What?

698
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,520
Is she your girlfriend?

699
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,690
She's not my girlfriend.

700
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,230
I just like her.

701
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:54,960
Oh, that's why.

702
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,180
You brought her here to impress her, right?

703
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,400
That's Hong Seok's jacket.

704
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,000
Yes, he told me to wear it.

705
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,760
That's mine, right? Hand me that.

706
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,300
Well...

707
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,570
♫  When the wind blows  ♫

708
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,910
 You know— 

709
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,120
♫  Close your eyes, my stars has ♫

710
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,380
We've been hanging out because of Hong Seok, right?

711
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,010
What?

712
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:20,900
Never mind. I'm leaving now.

713
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,080
♫  Even when we drifted apart  ♫

714
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:34,900
♫  We couldn't just leave  ♫

715
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,050
♫  I'll let you go now  ♫

716
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:46,200
♫  Into eternity  ♫

717
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,630
Okay, let's eat.

718
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,410
It looks so tasty.

719
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,810
Wow, it smells amazing.

720
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,500
Noona, wear this.

721
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,010
No, I'm okay.

722
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,160
I was at the Cheongsong Unit in Cheolwon.

723
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,290
I don't get cold at all.

724
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,780
- No, I'm really okay. 
 - It's okay.

725
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,990
It's okay.

726
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,940
Well, thank you.

727
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,480
Ram Woo,

728
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,440
I like this dependable fellow.

729
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:16,120
He's so cute.

730
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:18,620
What are you doing?

731
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:21,690
- Pardon? 
 - No, not you.

732
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,040
Seung Ho, are you cold? Your lips are blue.

733
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,470
- No. 
 - Put it back on.

734
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,670
I'm really okay. I'm okay.

735
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,580
I'll go get a heat pack, then.

736
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
I'm sorry. Gosh...

737
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,300
Seung Ho, get us more chips on the way.

738
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,990
Get spicy ones, too.

739
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:42,440
Geez, I'm embarrassed for him.

740
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,150
Hee Wan has a boyfriend, doesn't she?

741
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:48,670
The one who used to come to school every day.

742
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,870
- Boyfriend? 
 - He's handsome.

743
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,600
- No... 
 - He's handsome, even?

744
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,870
- No, no. 
 - Did you break up?

745
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:57,690
He's not my boyfriend. He's just...

746
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,150
How did you know that, Sunbae?

747
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,780
I noticed...

748
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,580
he had a cute tattoo on his arm.

749
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,120
I asked him where he got it from.

750
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,600
He said Hee Wan designed it for him.

751
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,310
It was a unique animal tattoo.

752
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,960
Yes, what was it?

753
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:12,000
- A dolphin. 
 - No, no.

754
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,710
- A ray? 
 - No, no.

755
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,410
No, no, no...

756
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,330
- Seal. 
 - It's a seal. A seal.

757
00:40:19,330 --> 00:40:21,610
- Is it Hong Seok, by any chance? 
 - No, no, no.

758
00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:24,140
- No? 
 - No, no, no.

759
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:26,990
No, no, no.

760
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,280
- No, no, no. 
 - She says no.

761
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,560
She said he isn't.

762
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,480
- I think she's shy. 
 - I'm not.

763
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,350
- Hey, hold on. 
 - Hee Wan, look at me!

764
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:46,880
There are sparklers here, Ram Woo.

765
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,010
Well, hold on.

766
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:50,790
- Here you go. 
 - Yes, thanks.

767
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,500
Hey, it's not that. Hold on.

768
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,040
 - Come check it out. 
 - Thank you! 

769
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,810
Hey, Hong Seok is...

770
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:02,670
 We're giving away sparklers. Come. 

771
00:41:02,670 --> 00:41:04,820
 You can take 10. 

772
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,560
 Do you want two? 

773
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:09,080
 Let's light them there. 

774
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,930
Let's count down and light them together.

775
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:13,210
 Okay! 

776
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:15,450
- 10. 
  - 9. 

777
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,580
 8. 

778
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,770
 7. 6. 

779
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,950
 5. 

780
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,050
 4. 3. 

781
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:24,720
 2. 1! 

782
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,080
 Take it now! Take it now! Now! 

783
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,940
 - Gosh, it's hard. 
 - Right now. 

784
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,910
Sorry.

785
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:55,430
 Kim Ram Woo died because of Jeong Hee Wan. 

786
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,590
Because of the name?

787
00:41:57,590 --> 00:42:00,680
She suggested switching names first, too.

788
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,970
What do you guys know?

789
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,540
Do you know how Hee Wan feels?

790
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,440
Are you suffering as much as she is?

791
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,560
Don't gossip when you know nothing!

792
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,060
No, they're right.

793
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,440
Ram Woo died because of me.

794
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:39,380
I should've died.

795
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:43,740
Hey, what are you doing?

796
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:47,050
Why are you doing this?

797
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:51,350
Why do you care?

798
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,320
It's dangerous.

799
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,700
Wouldn't you worry if you were me?

800
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,090
Worry?

801
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,750
Does worrying change anything?

802
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,180
How did it feel?

803
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:08,020
You couldn't go to college because of me.

804
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:09,850
Did you enjoy experiencing it?

805
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,880
What's next?

806
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,890
Let me see. What is it?

807
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,370
What do you want me to do? What is it?

808
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:19,430
What's the next one? What do you want?

809
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,050
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

810
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:29,350
It's not all of a sudden.

811
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:33,740
I've been like this for the last four years.

812
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,140
Why...

813
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:44,400
I can't forgive myself since that night.

814
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,710
But since you're in front of me right now,

815
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,780
I keep thinking you're actually alive.

816
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,560
I feel so pathetic for thinking that.

817
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,730
Why are you nice to me and smiling

818
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:57,550
as if you didn't die because of me?

819
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:01,260
What do you want to do with me, exactly?

820
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:05,300
- Ram Woo. 
 - Please stop calling me that!

821
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:06,960
Please...

822
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:21,280
Just call me by my name.

823
00:44:23,150 --> 00:44:26,980
I'll die if you call my name, right?

824
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,860
 Mr. Im Soo Hyeon, you passed away. 

825
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:32,030
 Im Soo Hyeon. Im Soo Hyeon. Im Soo Hyeon. 

826
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:36,010
That's why you keep calling me by your name.

827
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,260
I can't do this with you.

828
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,270
I want to stop.

829
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:45,870
Stop torturing me and end it.

830
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:50,490
Unless you're here to torture me.

831
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,440
Is that what you really want?

832
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:01,060
Yes.

833
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:06,230
Jeong Hee Wan.

834
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:26,000


835
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,060
I like you, Hee Wan.

836
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:38,400
I liked you a lot.

837
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:41,290
I like you now, too.

838
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:44,420
I'm sorry...

839
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,770
for telling you too late.

840
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:56,140
How could I hate you?

841
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,210
I came because I missed you.

842
00:46:04,390 --> 00:46:06,670
I missed you a lot.

843
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:19,420
♫  A star begins to shine, maybe it's you...  ♫

844
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:24,530
♫  If only we could rewrite the ending  ♫

845
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:27,440
♫  If you  ♫

846
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,420
♫  Take my hand  ♫

847
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:36,850
♫  I'm here to stay  ♫

848
00:46:36,850 --> 00:46:42,210
♫  I'll circle your path  ♫

849
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:48,030
♫  Never letting you go  ♫

850
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:50,210
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

851
00:46:53,330 --> 00:46:55,570
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

852
00:46:58,710 --> 00:47:01,030
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

853
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,380
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫

854
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:11,840
♫  If you, ooh-ooh  ♫
