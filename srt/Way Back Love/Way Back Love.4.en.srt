00:00:00,859 --> 00:00:02,928
(Gong Myoung)

2
00:00:02,929 --> 00:00:04,858
(Kim Min Ha)

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,929
(Jung Gun Joo, Oh Woo Ri, Ko Chang Seok, Seo Young Hee)

4
00:00:09,869 --> 00:00:13,009
(Way Back Love)

5
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:22,978
(Danger)

6
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:24,379
(Stop)

7
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:29,689
(Stop)

8
00:00:33,889 --> 00:00:35,089
(Stop)

9
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:50,409
I...

10
00:00:51,883 --> 00:00:54,853
can't forgive myself since that night.

11
00:00:56,563 --> 00:00:59,262
But with you in front of my eyes,

12
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:01,362
I feel foolish every moment,

13
00:01:01,363 --> 00:01:03,463
expecting you to be alive.

14
00:01:09,227 --> 00:01:12,167
The past memories alone give me enough pain.

15
00:01:12,597 --> 00:01:15,697
I can't do this with you. I quit.

16
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:20,737
- Ram Woo. - Please don't call me by that name.

17
00:01:26,677 --> 00:01:29,017
- Jung Hee Wan! - Oh, no!

18
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:42,927
- Move it! - Make way, please!

19
00:01:45,527 --> 00:01:47,167
- Ram Woo! - Please make way!

20
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:48,636
- Ram Woo! - Ram Woo!

21
00:01:48,637 --> 00:01:50,337
- Ram Woo! - Move!

22
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:52,807
- Ram... - Excuse me.

23
00:01:53,207 --> 00:01:54,307
Ram Woo!

24
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:58,107
Excuse me! Kim Ram Woo!

25
00:02:13,457 --> 00:02:15,097
(Hee Wan Tang)

26
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:21,067
(The diet starts tomorrow.)

27
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:23,866
To draw posters when you've come after so long?

28
00:02:23,867 --> 00:02:26,036
Only when you change them seasonally...

29
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:28,476
will the customers think this place pays attention...

30
00:02:28,477 --> 00:02:29,507
to the props.

31
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,806
But why are you drawing...

32
00:02:31,807 --> 00:02:34,117
a Christmas poster when it's for the four seasons?

33
00:02:34,677 --> 00:02:36,747
No, well...

34
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:39,957
Since I'm already at it, drawing them all is convenient.

35
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,486
How's business these days? Good?

36
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:44,557
There are ups and downs.

37
00:02:45,387 --> 00:02:46,397
Right.

38
00:02:47,957 --> 00:02:49,256
How are you in Seoul?

39
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:50,397
I'm good.

40
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,896
Why ask when you call me every day?

41
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:55,697
As if you ever picked up my call on time.

42
00:02:55,897 --> 00:02:58,437
You pick up once every 20 calls or so.

43
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:00,477
Hee Wan.

44
00:03:01,877 --> 00:03:03,706
Why did you drink again?

45
00:03:03,707 --> 00:03:05,776
Is it hard to sleep? Or do you have nightmares?

46
00:03:05,777 --> 00:03:07,246
No.

47
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:09,846
I was hanging out and drinking with some school friends.

48
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:10,887
Is that so?

49
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,456
Which college friends?

50
00:03:13,457 --> 00:03:14,516
Do I know any of them?

51
00:03:14,517 --> 00:03:15,987
How would you know them?

52
00:03:16,557 --> 00:03:17,627
Really.

53
00:03:18,787 --> 00:03:20,897
- I got the green onions. - Welcome back.

54
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,796
I'm sorry you must go to your part-time job...

55
00:03:23,797 --> 00:03:24,926
hungry because of me.

56
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:26,836
Part-time job? What kind of part-time job?

57
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:27,867
It's just a job.

58
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,496
Hee Ju plans to save money...

59
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:31,137
to go free diving in Cebu with her friends.

60
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:36,207
Come on. I told you to keep it from Hee Wan.

61
00:03:37,307 --> 00:03:39,646
We already booked our flights.

62
00:03:39,647 --> 00:03:40,877
I'm off.

63
00:03:41,377 --> 00:03:42,377
Hee Ju.

64
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,287
- What? - It's dangerous.

65
00:03:47,157 --> 00:03:49,057
- Cancel it. - What am I to do?

66
00:03:49,157 --> 00:03:50,427
Do nothing?

67
00:03:50,487 --> 00:03:52,186
Should I not even meet friends...

68
00:03:52,187 --> 00:03:53,796
and live a gloomy life cooped up in my room,

69
00:03:53,797 --> 00:03:55,096
staring at the ceiling all day, just like you?

70
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:56,097
What?

71
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,466
Stop it, Hee Ju. Get going.

72
00:03:58,467 --> 00:03:59,867
I don't want to do that.

73
00:04:00,597 --> 00:04:03,806
You're right. An accident may happen on a trip.

74
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,466
And I might die.

75
00:04:05,467 --> 00:04:06,607
But there are other possibilities.

76
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,746
I could die from a car accident as I head out...

77
00:04:09,747 --> 00:04:12,346
or from something falling onto my head on the street.

78
00:04:12,347 --> 00:04:14,677
Humans could even die while simply drinking water.

79
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:16,276
Who knows when I'll die?

80
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:18,747
That's why I will live my life doing things I want.

81
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,186
You should too.

82
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:22,016
Stop it. Live your life.

83
00:04:22,017 --> 00:04:23,627
Hee Wan. Just forget you heard that.

84
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:32,727
Hee Wan?

85
00:04:40,707 --> 00:04:42,907
- Excuse me. - You scared me.

86
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:47,446
I've been watching you from over there.

87
00:04:47,447 --> 00:04:48,976
You look terribly pale.

88
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:50,817
It's something you often hear, yes?

89
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:57,626
Goodness. A bad energy...

90
00:04:57,627 --> 00:04:59,586
is suppressing you.

91
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:01,626
That's why your shoulders and lips droop,

92
00:05:01,627 --> 00:05:02,696
making you look ugly.

93
00:05:02,697 --> 00:05:05,197
Right? I know a really nice place.

94
00:05:05,227 --> 00:05:06,297
Come with me.

95
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:09,497
Excuse me.

96
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:13,276
Because of the past incident and how much I hate you,

97
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:15,107
I planned to ignore you.

98
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:18,346
Gosh. But you looked too pitiful for me to walk past by.

99
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:20,376
You look awful.

100
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:22,776
Your energy isn't all that great.

101
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:24,917
It's something you often hear, yes?

102
00:05:27,187 --> 00:05:30,386
I know very well what people like you need.

103
00:05:30,387 --> 00:05:32,627
I know an amazing place nearby.

104
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:34,957
Come with me.

105
00:05:34,997 --> 00:05:36,297
To where?

106
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:38,826
- Let's go. - Why would I?

107
00:05:38,827 --> 00:05:40,697
Come on. Trust me.

108
00:05:41,237 --> 00:05:42,436
Let's go.

109
00:05:42,437 --> 00:05:43,906
I know this place.

110
00:05:43,907 --> 00:05:46,266
It's an amazing one where you'll get...

111
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:48,237
all the good energy.

112
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:57,946
Will it not open?

113
00:05:57,947 --> 00:06:01,217
(Eunsung High School)

114
00:06:01,417 --> 00:06:03,457
- It's open over here. - For real?

115
00:06:12,727 --> 00:06:13,967
What is it? Hurry.

116
00:06:52,067 --> 00:06:53,107
What do you think?

117
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:55,877
(Jung Hee Wan, stupid)

118
00:07:00,177 --> 00:07:02,847
Only Tae Gyeong and I know this place.

119
00:07:03,317 --> 00:07:04,487
However,

120
00:07:05,387 --> 00:07:07,516
there must be a reason...

121
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:08,717
the school prohibits entering here.

122
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:10,956
There might be a ghost looming here,

123
00:07:10,957 --> 00:07:13,227
or a cancer-causing agent might have been detected.

124
00:07:17,697 --> 00:07:18,727
Well,

125
00:07:20,397 --> 00:07:21,997
I'm not good at these things.

126
00:07:22,197 --> 00:07:24,267
Just do it. You don't have to be good.

127
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:35,976
Do it, without thinking much.

128
00:07:35,977 --> 00:07:38,247
Brush it. Go.

129
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:40,817
Go ahead.

130
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:51,667
You know,

131
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,467
a guest visits my place sometimes.

132
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:57,967
A guest?

133
00:07:59,407 --> 00:08:01,637
Maybe a guest isn't a good way to address her.

134
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:06,107
Anyway, I don't feel glad when I see her.

135
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,217
She's the wife of someone I should call my dad.

136
00:08:09,887 --> 00:08:12,987
I'm not sure how I should address her.

137
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:16,887
Anyway, she...

138
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:22,957
sometimes comes to my place and leaves some money.

139
00:08:23,867 --> 00:08:24,997
I guess that money is given...

140
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:27,997
to make me not reveal who I am.

141
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:31,907
I was always curious, though.

142
00:08:34,907 --> 00:08:37,447
Why isn't my dad coming to see me?

143
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:40,717
Doesn't he want to know what I'm like?

144
00:08:42,277 --> 00:08:43,387
Do you want to see him?

145
00:08:50,187 --> 00:08:51,187
I'm not sure.

146
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:54,057
I'm not sure about my feelings.

147
00:08:56,097 --> 00:08:58,797
I've been thinking about this all along since I was little,

148
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:04,167
but I'm still not sure.

149
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:06,977
It's the same with me.

150
00:09:10,647 --> 00:09:12,877
My mom passed away when I was four.

151
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,287
On the day I entered elementary school,

152
00:09:18,047 --> 00:09:21,157
among many people all smiling, only my dad was crying.

153
00:09:21,387 --> 00:09:23,117
I asked him why he was crying,

154
00:09:23,827 --> 00:09:26,657
and he said, "Your mom really wanted to be here."

155
00:09:27,227 --> 00:09:30,027
He said he cried because he missed my mom so much.

156
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:34,897
I...

157
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:37,006
was too little...

158
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:39,207
to have memories about my mom,

159
00:09:39,437 --> 00:09:41,776
but I cried after my dad...

160
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,377
and said I missed my mom.

161
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:46,006
But honestly, I'm not sure.

162
00:09:46,007 --> 00:09:47,716
I'm not sure whether I really miss her...

163
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:49,917
or I have to miss her.

164
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:18,847
Sit here.

165
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:20,977
- I mean, - Like this.

166
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:23,516
you're splattering the paint. Stop it.

167
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:24,747
- Here I go. - Watch out!

168
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:27,917
Are you out of your mind?

169
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,717
- Shall I make dots? - Yes.

170
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,426
Can you move over a bit?

171
00:10:32,427 --> 00:10:33,997
Please go.

172
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:37,827
All right.

173
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:42,867
Do what I do.

174
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:48,337
This looks like a night sky.

175
00:10:50,477 --> 00:10:51,477
I know.

176
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:04,527
Look.

177
00:11:05,157 --> 00:11:06,187
This is a shooting star.

178
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:09,657
This makes it a shooting star.

179
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,737
This makes it...

180
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:18,607
Saturn.

181
00:11:30,887 --> 00:11:31,917
What's going on?

182
00:11:34,557 --> 00:11:35,557
Hi.

183
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,387
Why is Hee Wan here?

184
00:11:37,957 --> 00:11:39,956
He was feeling lost,

185
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:41,697
so I helped him refresh himself.

186
00:11:42,997 --> 00:11:44,597
We promised that only two of us come here.

187
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:47,297
And you brought him without telling me.

188
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,906
- I forgot. - And,

189
00:11:50,907 --> 00:11:52,307
why didn't you answer my instant message?

190
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,137
- We need to make a reservation... - The weekend.

191
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:57,047
I forgot.

192
00:11:57,807 --> 00:12:00,176
I'm going to Seoul with my dad for house hunting on the weekend.

193
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,177
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,447
My dad suddenly told me that he's only available then.

195
00:12:07,217 --> 00:12:09,387
Is a promise with me nothing to you?

196
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,527
What are you saying?

197
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:12,757
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:16,497
These days, I'm busy with the college stuff.

199
00:12:17,497 --> 00:12:18,497
All right.

200
00:12:20,237 --> 00:12:22,997
You're busy, so you don't have to tell me everything from now on.

201
00:12:24,567 --> 00:12:27,007
You're only interested in hanging out with your new friend.

202
00:12:28,837 --> 00:12:30,076
Listening to your stories about passing the college...

203
00:12:30,077 --> 00:12:31,807
actually made me sick.

204
00:12:32,047 --> 00:12:33,677
- Tae Gyeong, it's not like that... - It made you sick?

205
00:12:34,977 --> 00:12:36,217
That's pretty harsh.

206
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:42,257
You look like you have chemistry.

207
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,557
Take care and have fun.

208
00:12:45,027 --> 00:12:46,027
Wait.

209
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:47,756
Why are you doing this?

210
00:12:47,757 --> 00:12:48,957
What's wrong with you?

211
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:51,797
Goodness.

212
00:13:03,177 --> 00:13:04,707
- This is unbelievable. - What is it?

213
00:13:06,877 --> 00:13:08,247
I didn't know it was still here.

214
00:13:12,287 --> 00:13:13,517
How is Tae Gyeong doing?

215
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:15,217
Tae Gyeong?

216
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:18,857
Well,

217
00:13:19,657 --> 00:13:20,927
I don't know.

218
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:24,227
What are you saying? Did you have an argument again?

219
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:28,667
I guess she isn't in Korea now.

220
00:13:30,837 --> 00:13:32,037
Then what about Hong Seok?

221
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,437
We don't keep in touch.

222
00:13:36,407 --> 00:13:38,606
The only friend left for you from the high school years...

223
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:40,647
is a grim reaper, me? That's a big problem.

224
00:13:43,687 --> 00:13:44,787
How can I open this?

225
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:49,517
You know what I think?

226
00:13:50,557 --> 00:13:51,957
I should go see Hong Seok.

227
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:53,187
Darn it.

228
00:13:58,997 --> 00:14:00,197
I miss him.

229
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,067
I want to see Hong Seok.

230
00:14:02,197 --> 00:14:04,567
- So I should go see him first. - Come on.

231
00:14:07,307 --> 00:14:08,337
What are you doing?

232
00:14:11,547 --> 00:14:12,577
All right.

233
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:15,617
Let me see. Let's take a look.

234
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:18,247
Where's Hong Seok's number?

235
00:14:21,157 --> 00:14:22,157
(Lee Hong Seok)

236
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,187
There it is.

237
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:25,627
When I see Hong Seok...

238
00:14:25,927 --> 00:14:27,097
(Lee Hong Seok)

239
00:14:28,897 --> 00:14:29,927
That little...

240
00:14:30,157 --> 00:14:32,497
We should play board games with him. That will be the first thing we do.

241
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:38,837
- Gosh. - Come on.

242
00:14:39,107 --> 00:14:40,807
You must have lost your mind. Seriously.

243
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:45,907
I'm sure he deleted my number.

244
00:14:51,147 --> 00:14:52,347
Wait. No, he didn't.

245
00:14:52,847 --> 00:14:53,857
Hey, you...

246
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,587
- Hello. - Hey.

247
00:14:59,157 --> 00:15:00,627
- Is this... - What's this about?

248
00:15:03,997 --> 00:15:06,267
I'm working right now. I'm hanging up.

249
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:14,337
Happy now?

250
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:18,407
All right. Meet my friend, Hong Seok.

251
00:15:18,547 --> 00:15:19,946
Hey, you can't do that.

252
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:21,747
This should be the least of your worries right now.

253
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:23,987
The real question is...

254
00:15:25,547 --> 00:15:26,947
how you're going to get out of here.

255
00:15:28,787 --> 00:15:29,987
Come on.

256
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,927
If you agree to meet with Hong Seok, I'll open it for you.

257
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:39,427
Do you plan on staying in there?

258
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,237
I got it. Just open it.

259
00:15:43,097 --> 00:15:45,067
(Restricted Area, Authorized Personnel Only)

260
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:51,047
(Meet my friend, Hong Seok.)

261
00:15:54,317 --> 00:15:56,517
(Meet my friend, Hong Seok.)

262
00:15:56,717 --> 00:15:57,717
Thank you.

263
00:16:00,757 --> 00:16:03,287
(Eunsung High School)

264
00:16:04,157 --> 00:16:06,456
Listen up, my friend. Here's an important piece of advice.

265
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:09,256
You cannot take anyone's side in this fight.

266
00:16:09,257 --> 00:16:12,627
Taking sides would be crossing the point of no return.

267
00:16:12,797 --> 00:16:13,896
What should I do?

268
00:16:13,897 --> 00:16:15,997
I'm partially responsible for this.

269
00:16:16,037 --> 00:16:17,367
Here's what I think.

270
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,837
Since this happened on school grounds,

271
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:21,736
we must get out of here.

272
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:22,737
I see.

273
00:16:24,247 --> 00:16:26,177
It sounds like you just want to go on a trip.

274
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,016
A graduation trip?

275
00:16:28,017 --> 00:16:29,647
Yes. Why don't we all go together?

276
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,617
- Including Hong Seok? - Yes.

277
00:16:33,987 --> 00:16:35,116
Tae Gyeong will join us too.

278
00:16:35,117 --> 00:16:37,056
My gosh, count me out. You guys can go by yourselves.

279
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,127
I'm sorry.

280
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:42,657
But I don't want to do anything with Kim Ram Woo.

281
00:16:43,157 --> 00:16:44,197
I know.

282
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,267
This could be the last trip we take together.

283
00:16:48,997 --> 00:16:49,997
"We?"

284
00:16:50,837 --> 00:16:52,407
What's the goal of this trip?

285
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:54,477
It's Mamidang.

286
00:16:56,407 --> 00:16:58,347
Mamidang? The bakery?

287
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:02,077
The bakery will close down next week for a year.

288
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:03,787
What? Why?

289
00:17:08,757 --> 00:17:10,157
The artisan baker...

290
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:12,657
is taking a sabbatical.

291
00:17:17,727 --> 00:17:19,867
We don't have much time. So think about that.

292
00:17:24,967 --> 00:17:25,967
Come on, let's go.

293
00:17:31,947 --> 00:17:33,247
I'll think about it.

294
00:17:33,307 --> 00:17:34,617
It's hurting my eyes.

295
00:17:35,177 --> 00:17:37,287
You're wearing a trash bag. Look at that.

296
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:38,747
- What are you doing? - Hey.

297
00:17:39,947 --> 00:17:41,686
What are you doing? What is that you're wearing?

298
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:43,416
- Hey, this looks expensive. - Hey.

299
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,186
- Don't touch it. - What's that?

300
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,257
- Hey. - What are you doing?

301
00:17:46,287 --> 00:17:48,497
- This looks expensive. - Let's go. Our bus must be here.

302
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,466
- Let's go, guys. - Let's go.

303
00:17:50,467 --> 00:17:52,426
My gosh. Hey, this jacket...

304
00:17:52,427 --> 00:17:54,637
- You'll sweat like a pig in this. - Right.

305
00:17:55,597 --> 00:17:56,967
You'll be sweaty especially here.

306
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,707
Hold on. My phone. Where's my phone?

307
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:06,707
- My phone. - Where did you put it?

308
00:18:07,517 --> 00:18:08,517
Come on.

309
00:18:22,857 --> 00:18:25,197
Hey, check it out. I see fish.

310
00:18:25,697 --> 00:18:26,866
- Where? - Hey.

311
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:28,066
- Over there! - That's dangerous.

312
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,237
I see them over there!

313
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:31,207
Yes. You're right.

314
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,677
- Hey. - Where are they?

315
00:18:36,637 --> 00:18:37,677
Where?

316
00:18:42,917 --> 00:18:45,817
Darn it. There's already a long line.

317
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:47,487
Who kept insisting the bakery was that way?

318
00:18:50,727 --> 00:18:52,386
Hey, we'll line up on the right side.

319
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:53,426
You take the left side.

320
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:54,527
Here's what you need to buy.

321
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,426
Pollack roe baguette, chocolate crumble,

322
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:57,466
and cream cheese croquettes.

323
00:18:57,467 --> 00:18:59,666
But it's highly likely that the croquettes are sold out.

324
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,297
So you must buy salt croissants no matter what. And...

325
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:03,537
- Shouldn't you write this down? - You're not writing this down?

326
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:07,006
- I know. This is a popular bakery. - I'm sorry.

327
00:19:07,007 --> 00:19:08,276
- You know that thing... - Could you repeat that?

328
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:09,477
- Are you kidding me? - Are you kidding me?

329
00:19:09,677 --> 00:19:10,746
Unbelievable.

330
00:19:10,747 --> 00:19:12,076
You guys are getting in the way. Just stay out of this.

331
00:19:12,077 --> 00:19:13,576
Good grief. You can just hold our bags.

332
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:14,946
- The salted pollack roe... - Hold our bags.

333
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:16,376
- They have salted pollack roe? - Just leave already.

334
00:19:16,377 --> 00:19:17,916
- It's pollack roe baguette. - Leave.

335
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:20,047
- Be quiet. Gosh, just go. Beat it. - Okay, just go.

336
00:19:20,347 --> 00:19:21,917
- The salted pollack roe... Sorry. - Excuse us.

337
00:19:23,617 --> 00:19:24,887
- Salted pollack roe? Seriously? - My gosh.

338
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:27,557
That's a great spot for pictures.

339
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,397
(2019 Winter Meteor Shower Festival)

340
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:37,737
I've never seen shooting stars in my life.

341
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:41,277
Watching...

342
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:44,607
the shooting stars together would be so romantic.

343
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:56,716
(Look at the shining stars up close!)

344
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:58,557
(The observatory meets the meteor festival!)

345
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,097
(2019 Winter Meteor Shower Festival)

346
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:03,096
Congratulations on opening your atelier.

347
00:20:03,097 --> 00:20:04,827
- Thank you. - This is a great place.

348
00:20:05,027 --> 00:20:06,596
It's decorated even more beautifully than I imagined.

349
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:08,197
- Right. - Yes.

350
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:10,366
- Hey. - Did a lot of people show up?

351
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,707
Yes, a lot of people came.

352
00:20:11,907 --> 00:20:13,706
You know what? I didn't know about this,

353
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:15,676
but apparently, we're quite close to this meteor shower festival.

354
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:17,107
- Really? - Yes.

355
00:20:18,347 --> 00:20:21,976
So it's about your opening party for your atelier.

356
00:20:21,977 --> 00:20:24,516
So you're ditching me to hang out with Hee Wan?

357
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,417
- Is that it? - My gosh, that's not it.

358
00:20:26,447 --> 00:20:28,517
My goodness. You got it all wrong.

359
00:20:29,117 --> 00:20:30,516
I mean, it's just my curiosity.

360
00:20:30,517 --> 00:20:31,986
It said there would be 200 shooting stars every hour.

361
00:20:31,987 --> 00:20:34,326
Gosh, tell the kids to have a blast and come back when they're done.

362
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,856
Ram Woo, I secured you a piece of cake.

363
00:20:36,857 --> 00:20:38,397
- Come on. Hurry. - Okay.

364
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:41,597
Okay. Yes. The two of us can have another party to celebrate.

365
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:43,497
- Have fun, okay? - Okay.

366
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,607
Hey, look.

367
00:20:49,377 --> 00:20:50,576
Look at the alien.

368
00:20:50,577 --> 00:20:51,876
- Let's take a look. - Hello.

369
00:20:51,877 --> 00:20:53,277
This is awesome.

370
00:20:53,977 --> 00:20:54,977
I love it.

371
00:20:55,977 --> 00:20:57,917
- Do the E.T. thing. - My gosh.

372
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,757
You have a fiery fist.

373
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:09,897
What?

374
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:11,167
It'll be fine.

375
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,227
Thanks.

376
00:21:14,267 --> 00:21:16,196
(The observatory meets the meteor festival!)

377
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:17,606
(Win tickets to enter the mini observatory!)

378
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:18,766
(Put your raffle tickets in the box.)

379
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,337
Are you done? Is it fixed?

380
00:21:20,507 --> 00:21:21,477
- Is it? - What?

381
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:33,017
Hey.

382
00:21:38,287 --> 00:21:39,287
Not that.

383
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:41,027
- This. - Okay.

384
00:21:52,407 --> 00:21:53,467
I'm sorry.

385
00:21:58,347 --> 00:22:00,606
I guess I took it for granted...

386
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:02,317
that we'd always be close.

387
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:05,887
But realizing I wouldn't go to university...

388
00:22:06,647 --> 00:22:08,317
and get left behind on my own...

389
00:22:09,357 --> 00:22:10,557
I felt lost.

390
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:13,257
I was serious too.

391
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:16,627
That...

392
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:20,197
whatever we did, wherever we were,

393
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:22,997
we'd be together.

394
00:22:23,397 --> 00:22:24,937
That we were a unit.

395
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:30,847
For real?

396
00:22:33,077 --> 00:22:34,117
I see.

397
00:22:36,077 --> 00:22:37,176
(2019 Winter Meteor Shower Festival)

398
00:22:37,177 --> 00:22:38,286
(Write a postcard to future me.)

399
00:22:38,287 --> 00:22:39,986
If you write a letter,

400
00:22:39,987 --> 00:22:41,516
we'll send it to your address...

401
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:44,086
- at the next meteor shower. - We don't need to do that.

402
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:45,457
You can write a postcard too.

403
00:22:45,757 --> 00:22:47,187
Thanks anyway.

404
00:22:48,897 --> 00:22:49,897
Darn it.

405
00:22:50,497 --> 00:22:51,997
- Who is it? - My mom.

406
00:22:52,897 --> 00:22:54,137
Why won't you pick up?

407
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:56,537
She wants me to retake the CSAT.

408
00:22:58,537 --> 00:23:00,367
Coming this far was the best I could do.

409
00:23:00,977 --> 00:23:02,276
I'm happy enough.

410
00:23:02,277 --> 00:23:03,907
Even without a fancy degree,

411
00:23:04,307 --> 00:23:06,507
I can have an awesome, satisfactory life.

412
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:08,577
But no one believes me.

413
00:23:10,247 --> 00:23:11,487
What's your address?

414
00:23:11,917 --> 00:23:12,946
I'll write one.

415
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:14,086
- Thank you. - What?

416
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:15,587
You'll write to me? What for?

417
00:23:16,057 --> 00:23:17,087
Because I want to.

418
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,657
You're giving me butterflies.

419
00:23:20,457 --> 00:23:21,697
Say your address.

420
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:28,097
What you really want to tell me is something else.

421
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:30,697
What?

422
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,206
I see stars.

423
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:37,077
- Over there. - Stars?

424
00:23:42,947 --> 00:23:45,147
Yes. Kim Ram Woo...

425
00:23:48,317 --> 00:23:49,717
Jung Hee Wan. I have a crush on her.

426
00:23:51,927 --> 00:23:53,887
When were you going to tell me?

427
00:23:54,027 --> 00:23:55,727
When did you figure it out?

428
00:23:55,927 --> 00:23:56,927
Me?

429
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:01,167
When I asked her out and got rejected.

430
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:04,767
I noticed today...

431
00:24:04,937 --> 00:24:08,077
that Hee Wan was always looking at you,

432
00:24:08,877 --> 00:24:10,307
and you were looking at her.

433
00:24:11,447 --> 00:24:13,847
I guess I knew all along...

434
00:24:14,107 --> 00:24:15,647
and wanted to deny it.

435
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:19,686
Anyway, what I want to say is, don't mind me...

436
00:24:19,687 --> 00:24:21,187
and do what your heart says.

437
00:24:21,417 --> 00:24:23,487
But don't expect my support.

438
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:26,887
And don't let your guard down.

439
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:39,207
I really have nothing to say to him.

440
00:24:40,767 --> 00:24:43,806
Well, I have a lot to say to him,

441
00:24:43,807 --> 00:24:45,407
so you can talk to him for me.

442
00:24:53,417 --> 00:24:54,417
He saw you.

443
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:56,187
Hello.

444
00:25:06,697 --> 00:25:07,897
It's so awkward.

445
00:25:08,337 --> 00:25:09,637
Why is it like this?

446
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:11,936
- Why... - Be quiet.

447
00:25:11,937 --> 00:25:13,007
What for?

448
00:25:17,007 --> 00:25:18,407
What are you doing?

449
00:25:19,547 --> 00:25:21,047
He's not doing anything at all.

450
00:25:21,177 --> 00:25:22,747
He's pretending to be busy.

451
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,347
Can I ask why you're here?

452
00:25:26,787 --> 00:25:27,917
I don't have too long.

453
00:25:29,117 --> 00:25:30,857
- Well... - He's acting all serious.

454
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:33,587
I'm here because...

455
00:25:34,927 --> 00:25:37,057
I have something to say.

456
00:25:38,367 --> 00:25:40,697
What I wanted to say was...

457
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,197
I need to tell you something.

458
00:25:43,397 --> 00:25:45,007
It's about...

459
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:48,376
You look better on the left, so when...

460
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:50,306
talking to women, stand on their right...

461
00:25:50,307 --> 00:25:51,307
What?

462
00:25:52,347 --> 00:25:53,677
(Beware of wild animals)

463
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,777
No, I mean...

464
00:25:56,417 --> 00:25:58,186
If you still work out,

465
00:25:58,187 --> 00:25:59,917
your feet smell addictive...

466
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:04,117
- Stop it. - I don't want to.

467
00:26:06,057 --> 00:26:07,856
I don't mean the smell of your feet.

468
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,697
I have a lot on my mind and I need to think...

469
00:26:10,997 --> 00:26:12,067
Stop it.

470
00:26:13,567 --> 00:26:14,567
Fine.

471
00:26:14,568 --> 00:26:17,197
Talk about your relationship, then.

472
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:25,647
Have you been well?

473
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,417
What was your stint in the army like?

474
00:26:28,847 --> 00:26:29,847
It went fine.

475
00:26:30,217 --> 00:26:32,147
Do you work here full-time?

476
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:34,756
Hey.

477
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:36,557
(Kahuna)

478
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:40,656
What book is that? Are you studying?

479
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:42,797
I'm studying to take an exam.

480
00:26:44,697 --> 00:26:46,266
Lee Hong Seok's studying?

481
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:47,297
An exam?

482
00:26:47,997 --> 00:26:49,937
- What exam? - Sorry.

483
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:53,007
I don't know what you're up to.

484
00:26:54,407 --> 00:26:56,307
I'm a bit flustered and bewildered.

485
00:26:57,007 --> 00:26:59,146
I find it uncomfortable being alone with you.

486
00:26:59,147 --> 00:27:00,307
Are we done talking?

487
00:27:02,477 --> 00:27:04,177
- Why... - Can you just go,

488
00:27:04,987 --> 00:27:05,987
Hee Wan?

489
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:09,887
(Youngil Indoor Gymnasium)

490
00:27:13,027 --> 00:27:14,157
Kim Ram Woo.

491
00:27:14,997 --> 00:27:15,997
Kim Ram Woo.

492
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:19,826
What's up with him?

493
00:27:19,827 --> 00:27:21,597
Sorry, but can you do this alone?

494
00:27:21,737 --> 00:27:23,897
You can. He's your friend, not mine.

495
00:27:25,637 --> 00:27:27,067
Wait up.

496
00:27:28,737 --> 00:27:30,137
Forget me. What about you?

497
00:27:31,177 --> 00:27:32,306
Are you okay with this?

498
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:33,506
Don't you have anything to say to him?

499
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:35,376
If you can't talk with me around, I'll go away.

500
00:27:35,377 --> 00:27:36,977
What's the point now anyway?

501
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,787
This is the time to talk to him.

502
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:41,986
Can you just end it like this?

503
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:43,657
- Is that okay with you? - Jung Hee Wan.

504
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:50,697
Did you touch the board game?

505
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:52,667
What?

506
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:54,997
That's...

507
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,467
- I actually... - Be honest with me.

508
00:27:57,907 --> 00:27:59,207
Why are you really here?

509
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:01,277
What do you mean?

510
00:28:04,377 --> 00:28:06,807
Is it because of Ram Woo? Kim Ram Woo again?

511
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:33,567
- Hee Wan! - Kim Ram Woo!

512
00:28:34,507 --> 00:28:35,876
Are you okay?

513
00:28:35,877 --> 00:28:37,636
Sit here and relax.

514
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:39,406
What can I do for you? Anything?

515
00:28:39,407 --> 00:28:42,077
Take a deep breath. It's okay. Okay.

516
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:44,616
- Please give me that plastic bag. - Yes?

517
00:28:44,617 --> 00:28:46,587
- Here you are. - It's nothing. Nothing happened.

518
00:28:48,387 --> 00:28:49,387
Here you are.

519
00:28:50,217 --> 00:28:51,257
Are you okay?

520
00:28:51,357 --> 00:28:52,727
Take a deep breath.

521
00:28:52,887 --> 00:28:55,257
Here is the plastic bag. Breathe out.

522
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:57,597
Breathe slowly.

523
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,497
This is nothing. It's okay.

524
00:28:59,897 --> 00:29:00,967
Are you okay?

525
00:29:01,097 --> 00:29:02,937
Take slow, deep breaths.

526
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:07,537
It's okay.

527
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:12,407
Two. One, two.

528
00:29:13,807 --> 00:29:16,747
She's fine now. Thank you.

529
00:29:28,797 --> 00:29:29,797
It won't come again.

530
00:29:30,397 --> 00:29:31,397
What?

531
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:33,067
The ambulance won't come again.

532
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,997
I see.

533
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:39,907
Be careful.

534
00:29:46,207 --> 00:29:47,307
It's so embarrassing.

535
00:29:47,747 --> 00:29:50,117
I showed up out of the blue and did something like this.

536
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,317
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

537
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:55,356
I was putting you in a corner earlier.

538
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:56,357
I'm sorry.

539
00:29:57,457 --> 00:29:59,127
Would you like to take a walk?

540
00:30:07,197 --> 00:30:08,467
It's just...

541
00:30:09,867 --> 00:30:11,467
It's just not that easy for me...

542
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:13,837
to pretend nothing ever happened.

543
00:30:16,207 --> 00:30:18,907
I'm not like you. You know about what I've done.

544
00:30:21,517 --> 00:30:23,877
I guess I didn't get how you did it...

545
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:27,447
and how you got over that so fast.

546
00:30:29,387 --> 00:30:32,127
I was actually envious of you.

547
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:40,197
You were envious of me.

548
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:44,967
You know what.

549
00:30:46,707 --> 00:30:48,807
I didn't want to say this.

550
00:30:50,907 --> 00:30:52,877
Why do you think you’re the only one having a hard time?

551
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:55,316
- What? - When you called me,

552
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:56,977
I really didn't want to answer it.

553
00:30:57,077 --> 00:30:59,317
I was afraid that something might've happened.

554
00:30:59,547 --> 00:31:00,687
You know what it's like.

555
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:05,326
When you see accidents on the news, you imagine the worst.

556
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:06,557
You're worried it's someone you know.

557
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:08,427
You know that.

558
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:11,057
But why do you think...

559
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,427
you’re the only one who's afraid?

560
00:31:14,737 --> 00:31:16,566
When you're having a hard time because of Ram Woo,

561
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:19,167
I talk about random things, pretending I'm okay.

562
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:21,137
Do you think it is easy for me?

563
00:31:22,707 --> 00:31:24,037
Do you think I was really okay?

564
00:31:29,917 --> 00:31:32,647
I want you to stop talking about Kim Ram Woo.

565
00:31:33,187 --> 00:31:34,447
When I tell you that,

566
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:39,587
have you thought about how I felt?

567
00:31:39,857 --> 00:31:40,957
Even once?

568
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:46,867
I was there, too. Hee Wan.

569
00:31:53,937 --> 00:31:55,437
Look at that.

570
00:31:56,077 --> 00:31:58,077
I can't believe we're here to see a shooting star together.

571
00:32:05,647 --> 00:32:06,746
You must be hungry.

572
00:32:06,747 --> 00:32:08,156
- Oh, yeah! - Yes!

573
00:32:08,157 --> 00:32:09,416
- I got some popcorn. - Yes!

574
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,586
This is great.

575
00:32:10,587 --> 00:32:11,956
- Yes!. - It's popcorn.

576
00:32:11,957 --> 00:32:14,256
I heard the countdown would start at 8pm.

577
00:32:14,257 --> 00:32:15,257
- Really? - Okay.

578
00:32:15,597 --> 00:32:17,096
- Look! I think that is it. - Where?

579
00:32:17,097 --> 00:32:18,166
- Where? - Over there.

580
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:19,496
- Where? - Look at that there.

581
00:32:19,497 --> 00:32:20,997
Where? Where is it?

582
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:23,837
It's gone.

583
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:26,066
- Just eat it. - Just have some rice puff.

584
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:27,637
Hey, this is pretty good. What's the brand?

585
00:32:28,037 --> 00:32:29,107
- Where did you buy this? - Hey.

586
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:30,806
Hey, this is good.

587
00:32:30,807 --> 00:32:32,346
- You... - Hey, grab that.

588
00:32:32,347 --> 00:32:33,477
Hello.

589
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:36,216
Yes, this is Jung Hee Wan.

590
00:32:36,217 --> 00:32:37,746
I guess we have to keep our eyes on the sky.

591
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,587
- You know, just in case. - Really?

592
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:42,956
Try again.

593
00:32:42,957 --> 00:32:44,926
(Try Your Luck!)

594
00:32:44,927 --> 00:32:46,727
(Observatory Raffle Ticket, Kim...)

595
00:32:51,727 --> 00:32:56,537
(Observatory Raffle Ticket, Jung Hee Wan)

596
00:33:01,777 --> 00:33:02,837
What is it?

597
00:33:03,407 --> 00:33:04,636
Where are we going?

598
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:06,407
The meteor shower is about to start.

599
00:33:10,817 --> 00:33:12,517
- Congratulations, Hee Wan. - What?

600
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:15,316
I won a ticket to the observatory event.

601
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:16,456
I just got the call.

602
00:33:16,457 --> 00:33:17,757
My gosh, you...

603
00:33:19,357 --> 00:33:21,126
Wait. But why are you congratulating me?

604
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:23,227
You said you had never seen a shooting star.

605
00:33:23,957 --> 00:33:25,167
It will be my present to you.

606
00:33:25,527 --> 00:33:28,897
It's your last chance to be called Jung Hee Wan.

607
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:32,407
Listen.

608
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:35,776
I got into my dream college.

609
00:33:35,777 --> 00:33:37,537
I made up with Tae Gyeong too.

610
00:33:37,877 --> 00:33:40,507
I'm on a trip with my favorite friends.

611
00:33:41,277 --> 00:33:43,246
I got to do everything I could ever want.

612
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:45,547
So I'm elated right now.

613
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:48,317
And...

614
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:51,457
I...

615
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:55,897
I want you to be happy tonight...

616
00:33:56,427 --> 00:34:00,267
because you're Kim Ram Woo who also goes by Jung Hee Wan.

617
00:34:08,037 --> 00:34:09,037
Do you want to come with me?

618
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:13,077
Come with me. I have something to tell you.

619
00:34:14,707 --> 00:34:16,477
- You do? - Yes.

620
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:18,487
I really want to say it tonight.

621
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:25,427
No. Just enjoy the event by yourself tonight.

622
00:34:26,187 --> 00:34:28,856
Here. Read it on your way there. Okay?

623
00:34:28,857 --> 00:34:30,827
But read it when you're alone. So...

624
00:34:32,297 --> 00:34:34,666
You're going to see the stars at the observatory later, right?

625
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:36,196
That's when you can read it. Okay?

626
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:38,837
You'll be in a great mood. So read it then.

627
00:34:41,507 --> 00:34:42,537
See you.

628
00:34:50,247 --> 00:34:51,317
Kim Ram Woo!

629
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,387
Honestly, switching names with you...

630
00:34:57,317 --> 00:34:59,027
definitely made my school life harder.

631
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:02,357
But that was the most fun thing I ever did in high school.

632
00:35:08,297 --> 00:35:09,367
Do you want to sit together...

633
00:35:14,367 --> 00:35:15,807
on our way home later?

634
00:35:20,777 --> 00:35:21,817
Sure.

635
00:35:24,987 --> 00:35:25,987
Okay.

636
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:50,937
(Winter Meteor Shower Festival)

637
00:35:51,137 --> 00:35:52,207
- Hello. - I'm so excited.

638
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:53,707
- What's your name? - My gosh.

639
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:54,917
- It's Jung Hee Wan. - I can't wait.

640
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:56,677
Yes, you're on the list.

641
00:35:57,017 --> 00:35:58,076
Hello. What's your name?

642
00:35:58,077 --> 00:36:00,087
(The observatory meets the meteor festival!)

643
00:36:05,187 --> 00:36:06,227
Oh, my.

644
00:36:09,397 --> 00:36:10,397
Why are you coming back alone?

645
00:36:10,398 --> 00:36:11,696
- Hey, you look so awkward now. - What's going on?

646
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:12,866
- No. - What is it?

647
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:13,967
It's nothing.

648
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:15,367
Look at her.

649
00:36:15,837 --> 00:36:16,837
Nothing.

650
00:36:21,807 --> 00:36:23,607
(To Kim Ram Woo, also known as Jung Hee Wan)

651
00:36:28,417 --> 00:36:30,177
Hey, it's starting.

652
00:36:33,047 --> 00:36:36,187
- Nine, eight, seven, - Nine, eight, seven,

653
00:36:36,917 --> 00:36:38,987
- six, five, - six, five,

654
00:36:39,087 --> 00:36:41,027
- four, three, - four three,

655
00:36:41,487 --> 00:36:43,327
- two, one. - two, one.

656
00:36:54,207 --> 00:36:55,307
There's one.

657
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,077
My gosh.

658
00:36:58,977 --> 00:37:00,007
- Oh, my. Look. - Please...

659
00:37:01,577 --> 00:37:03,416
(I don't know what else to say.)

660
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:05,287
(Kim Ram Woo, I really like you.)

661
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,126
- My gosh, did you see that? - Really?

662
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:17,597
- There it comes. - Oh, my.

663
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,967
- It's so beautiful. - Hey, look.

664
00:37:21,897 --> 00:37:23,066
Oh, my. It's so pretty.

665
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,667
Gosh, it's way too bright for my eyes.

666
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:26,837
There goes another one.

667
00:37:31,577 --> 00:37:32,677
I took a picture of that earlier.

668
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,016
Breaking news.

669
00:37:40,017 --> 00:37:41,446
A gas explosion has occurred at the observatory...

670
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:42,886
of Byeolmaru Campsite...

671
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:44,986
- in Jinsung-gun, Gangwon Province. - Gosh, wouldn't that be nice?

672
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:46,556
Here's a live report from the scene.

673
00:37:46,557 --> 00:37:48,596
Breaking news. I'm at the scene...

674
00:37:48,597 --> 00:37:51,056
of a gas explosion at Byeolmaru Campsite's observatory.

675
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:54,096
About 40 minutes ago, 2 explosions have gone off...

676
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,966
and resulted in the collapse of the building.

677
00:37:55,967 --> 00:37:57,267
It's utter chaos here.

678
00:37:58,437 --> 00:38:00,107
Check over there.

679
00:38:00,607 --> 00:38:02,377
- Hurry! - Hey, follow me!

680
00:38:02,777 --> 00:38:05,207
- Grab this. - Hey, come here.

681
00:38:05,777 --> 00:38:08,276
- I'm running low on it. - We need more people out here.

682
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:10,047
- We have to find him. - Oh, no!

683
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:12,717
- You can't go inside. - No!

684
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:15,057
- Step back. - It's dangerous here.

685
00:38:15,117 --> 00:38:16,356
- No! - Step back!

686
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:17,887
- Let me pass through. - Hey!

687
00:38:18,187 --> 00:38:19,226
- Please step back. - Step back.

688
00:38:19,227 --> 00:38:20,826
- No, my friend is in there. - Hold on.

689
00:38:20,827 --> 00:38:22,757
- Wait. - Come on. Move fast.

690
00:38:23,127 --> 00:38:24,827
Are you all right?

691
00:38:25,797 --> 00:38:28,396
- Jung Hee Wan! - You can't move, sir.

692
00:38:28,397 --> 00:38:30,397
- Please step back. - Stop it.

693
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:32,806
- Kim Ram Woo! - Please hurry up!

694
00:38:32,807 --> 00:38:35,006
- Ram Woo! - Ram Woo!

695
00:38:35,007 --> 00:38:37,106
- Ram Woo! - You can't pass through.

696
00:38:37,107 --> 00:38:38,237
Jung Hee Wan!

697
00:38:39,107 --> 00:38:41,476
- Ram Woo! - Ram Woo!

698
00:38:41,477 --> 00:38:42,946
- Please let us go in. - No!

699
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,147
- Ram Woo! - No, you can't.

700
00:38:45,287 --> 00:38:46,947
- Sir, my friend is in there. - Ram Woo.

701
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:49,056
- Ram Woo! - Kim Ram Woo!

702
00:38:49,057 --> 00:38:50,386
Jung Hee Wan!

703
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:51,927
Kim Ram Woo! Jung Hee Wan!

704
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:53,987
- Jung Hee Wan! - Step back.

705
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,927
- Ram Woo! - Please!

706
00:38:56,997 --> 00:38:58,227
Jung Hee Wan!

707
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:04,837
I know that you dated me...

708
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:07,567
not because you had feelings for me, but because you missed...

709
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:10,077
Ram Woo.

710
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,907
- Hong Seok. - But I was serious about us.

711
00:39:13,647 --> 00:39:15,517
So I guess I wanted us to be okay together.

712
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:22,587
I thought that you would be okay...

713
00:39:22,917 --> 00:39:24,987
when we pretended to be okay.

714
00:39:27,087 --> 00:39:28,557
That's what I wanted to believe.

715
00:39:31,357 --> 00:39:33,827
Maybe, that's why I kept goofing around and didn't talk about him.

716
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:37,667
I still struggle...

717
00:39:38,197 --> 00:39:40,367
with the sound of sirens too.

718
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:43,837
So...

719
00:39:46,207 --> 00:39:48,677
I'm going to get a job that won't require me to be okay with sirens.

720
00:39:51,177 --> 00:39:52,586
So you know the exam I'm preparing for?

721
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:53,987
I'm studying to be a firefighter.

722
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:55,757
A firefighter?

723
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:00,887
Be it the siren or whatnot. If I keep getting startled by it,

724
00:40:01,027 --> 00:40:02,257
so be it then.

725
00:40:02,997 --> 00:40:05,367
And that's fine for firefighters as they shouldn't be numb to it.

726
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,567
To be honest, I guess I didn't want to admit it.

727
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:17,377
The truth was, I was also hurting.

728
00:40:21,177 --> 00:40:22,247
And...

729
00:40:26,587 --> 00:40:28,487
the fact that I left him behind...

730
00:40:30,117 --> 00:40:31,357
was torturing me.

731
00:40:32,687 --> 00:40:36,057
But I hoped that you would ask me at least once...

732
00:40:37,197 --> 00:40:38,357
if I was okay.

733
00:40:42,597 --> 00:40:43,837
If I was having a hard time.

734
00:40:57,847 --> 00:41:00,847
I thought you wanted to forget about Ram Woo.

735
00:41:04,117 --> 00:41:06,057
How could I forget him?

736
00:41:09,157 --> 00:41:10,857
He was my best friend.

737
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:25,177
(Our deepest condolences)

738
00:41:39,427 --> 00:41:40,427
Hong Seok.

739
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,297
I'll forget everything and live happily.

740
00:41:49,037 --> 00:41:50,566
I plan to live so well and happily...

741
00:41:50,567 --> 00:41:52,667
that I'll have no time to call you.

742
00:41:55,707 --> 00:41:58,237
Don't get upset that I never call and be happy yourself.

743
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:01,607
And...

744
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:03,577
I'm sorry.

745
00:42:05,987 --> 00:42:07,617
For being mean and selfish.

746
00:42:07,717 --> 00:42:09,317
I'm sorry about that.

747
00:42:20,497 --> 00:42:22,037
Be sure to eat on time.

748
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:25,666
Don't be in the news.

749
00:42:25,667 --> 00:42:28,437
Okay. I won't be in the news.

750
00:42:29,107 --> 00:42:30,177
See you.

751
00:42:31,577 --> 00:42:33,847
- It's like... - You know what it's like.

752
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,447
It's like they get a second lease in life.

753

(Youngil Indoor Gymnasium)

754
00:43:22,497 --> 00:43:23,956
Did I expect too much...

755
00:43:23,957 --> 00:43:25,727
because I heard you were handsome?

756
00:43:27,227 --> 00:43:28,466
You look the same,

757
00:43:28,467 --> 00:43:29,967
just like in school.

758
00:43:30,237 --> 00:43:31,797
This is where we stopped playing.

759
00:43:32,037 --> 00:43:33,436
We promised to play on after the trip.

760
00:43:33,437 --> 00:43:35,337
I still get angry that we never did.

761
00:43:37,477 --> 00:43:38,907
I was just about to win.

762
00:43:39,007 --> 00:43:40,077
Do you admit defeat?

763
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:44,216
(Pull up your pant zipper.)

764
00:43:44,217 --> 00:43:45,217
(It was down since you practiced punching.)

765
00:43:48,187 --> 00:43:49,487
Wherever you are, whatever you do,

766
00:43:51,817 --> 00:43:53,457
have an awesomely great life.

767
00:43:55,897 --> 00:43:57,697
(P.S. I believe in you.)

768
00:44:15,347 --> 00:44:17,717
Let's walk together. I have something to say.

769
00:44:23,157 --> 00:44:24,217
Okay.

770
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:32,166
- I think I just saw one. - Where?

771
00:44:32,167 --> 00:44:33,766
- Over there. - For real? Where?

772
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:34,897
- Where? - Over there.

773
00:44:36,067 --> 00:44:37,767
Over there. It's gone now.

774
00:44:38,737 --> 00:44:41,066
- What are you talking about? - It was over there.

775
00:44:41,067 --> 00:44:42,977

Hello.

778
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:55,316
- You made it. - Take a seat.

779
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,357
Sit down.

780
00:44:56,717 --> 00:44:57,987
What's the topic?

781
00:45:04,157 --> 00:45:05,257

792
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:01,977
We must go somewhere.

793
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:07,047
There's someone I must see before I die.

794
00:47:07,687 --> 00:47:08,717
Who's that?

795
00:47:10,017 --> 00:47:12,357
Ms. Kim. Your mom.

796
