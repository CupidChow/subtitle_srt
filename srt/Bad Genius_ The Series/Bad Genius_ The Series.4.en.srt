1
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,170
Excuse me, what's that?

2
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:16,741
Where did you get this?

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,284
Espejo, answer me!

4
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,520
It's impossible for him
to figure out our signals.

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:21,871
It wasn't me, bro.

6
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,248
I'm not the one you're looking for.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,315
I'm not the one who leaked.

8
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,650
Don't put the blame on me!

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,776
But no one’s admitting anything!

10
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:28,236
What do you want me to do?

11
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,212
Speak nice to them?

12
00:00:29,237 --> 00:00:30,422
We also lied.

13
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,840
We also cheated, right?

14
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:32,865
Sorry, Lin.

15
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,301
You might not like what
you're about to hear, but

16
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:38,329
I have a feeling Grace
is the one who let Kyle copy.

17
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,373
I think you gave Kyle the answers.

18
00:00:41,037 --> 00:00:42,580
You made the cheat sheet.

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,919
You gave it to Claire,

20
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,379
she gave it to Baz,

21
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:48,151
and Baz gave it to Kyle.

22
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,301
Am I right?

23
00:00:50,592 --> 00:00:51,651
Guys,

24
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,011
the cheat sheet came from me.

25
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:54,511
I'm the one who leaked it.

26
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,685
Tony, please!

27
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,563
Please, I'll make sure
that they won't tell any of our

28
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:05,356
parents or teachers.

29
00:01:05,443 --> 00:01:07,025
The worst that could happen is

30
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:08,818
that they will just get mad at you.

31
00:01:09,318 --> 00:01:10,986
But once this is all done,

32
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:12,947
they’ll forget about it.

33
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,909
And Pat and Lin, they won't
do anything to you either

34
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,869
because that would implicate them too.

35
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,790
Tony, please.

36
00:01:24,779 --> 00:01:25,779
Please.

37
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:32,216
Before,

38
00:01:33,772 --> 00:01:35,315
you were just avoiding me.

39
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,933
No matter what I did to get close to you,

40
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:42,018
you didn’t want me.

41
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:46,064
But I still hoped that one day,

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,776
you would realize
how much I care for you.

43
00:01:52,487 --> 00:01:53,780
And you would choose me.

44
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:06,232
If I do this for you,

45
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,087
will you choose me?

46
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,851
But,

47
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,854
I love Pat.

48
00:02:30,553 --> 00:02:31,835
Then ask him for help.

49
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,237
What do you think I am?

50
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,047
Wait.

51
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,156
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

52
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:38,283
Tony, please.

53
00:02:38,308 --> 00:02:40,060
Please, I'll do anything that you want.

54
00:02:40,085 --> 00:02:41,962
Please, I just, I need you to help me.

55
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,720
I’m begging you.

56
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,596
Please.

57
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,621
Please.

58
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:45,723
Please.

59
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:46,882
Please help me.

60
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:49,102
Please.

61
00:02:54,595 --> 00:02:55,595
Anything?

62
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,683
Yes, I promise.

63
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,693
There’s only one thing I want.

64
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:15,171
Good thing Ms. Briones
still believes in me.

65
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,884
Maybe they’re starting to
realize I have no link to Kyle.

66
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,699
And they don’t really
have any proof against me.

67
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,597
And from the very beginning,

68
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,599
you knew I never had
any friends in drama club.

69
00:04:27,412 --> 00:04:30,248
Don’t think about it too much
so you don’t get stressed.

70
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,863
What’s important is you’re cleared now.

71
00:04:33,652 --> 00:04:34,652
You’re right.

72
00:04:35,397 --> 00:04:36,815
But you know what, I heard

73
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,903
they’re going to make
the next exam stricter

74
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,279
to stop the cheating.

75
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,907
Really?

76
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,827
Honestly,

77
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,538
I still can’t fully understand it.

78
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:51,287
How could they even stand to cheat?

79
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:01,603
Maybe they have their personal reasons.

80
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,434
I agree—we shouldn’t
tolerate cheating at all.

81
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:10,893
It’s definitely wrong.

82
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
But

83
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,524
maybe we shouldn’t
judge the person either.

84
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,918
Maybe they're just trying to survive.

85
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,077
You know, I get your point.

86
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,123
But I don't think survival is
an excuse to do something wrong.

87
00:05:32,957 --> 00:05:34,459
Because no matter your reason,

88
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:35,646
if you're wrong,

89
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:36,918
you're wrong.

90
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,046
Right?

91
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,384
Looks like it’s not over yet.

92
00:05:43,626 --> 00:05:44,552
Hi, Lin.

93
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:45,445
Hi, Bank.

94
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:45,987
Have a seat.

95
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,263
That’ll be done soon.

96
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:48,805
Okay.

97
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:53,978
I came here today because
the school is considering you two

98
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,646
for a scholarship abroad.

99
00:05:55,951 --> 00:05:57,290
It’s a full scholarship.

100
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,204
And if either of you get chosen,

101
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,943
The scholarship already covers

102
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,737
transportation and accommodation.

103
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,531
But of course, for a scholarship abroad,

104
00:06:05,627 --> 00:06:07,235
there are more requirements.

105
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,912
First, you need to take
the STIC examination.

106
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:14,290
You should also maintain
high academic standing

107
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,209
and most importantly,

108
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,835
no behavioral issues.

109
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,797
That's why we thought
of you two right away.

110
00:06:21,607 --> 00:06:24,109
Because I know you meet the criteria.

111
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,594
And I know, you both can wing it.

112
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:30,519
Thank you, Ms. Gonzales.

113
00:06:30,544 --> 00:06:32,671
- Of course, I trust you guys.
- Thank you.

114
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:37,404
Thank you.

115
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:41,608
You know,

116
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,026
I get it now.

117
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:48,628
Why Dad wanted to send me here to Possenti.

118
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,493
It's because of this opportunity.

119
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,204
And he knows that I want to study abroad.

120
00:06:53,542 --> 00:06:55,169
So you really want to study abroad?

121
00:06:55,463 --> 00:06:56,589
I do.

122
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:58,041
How about you?

123
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,071
I'm still unsure about it.

124
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:02,939
Why?

125
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:04,931
I realized what career I want to pursue.

126
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,299
I want to be a doctor.

127
00:07:07,022 --> 00:07:08,022
Really?

128
00:07:08,281 --> 00:07:10,313
You know what, you can definitely do that.

129
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:11,338
Thanks.

130
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:14,279
So, why do you want to become a doctor?

131
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,770
Maybe it’s because Mom’s sick now.

132
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,080
Also,

133
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,858
I’ve seen what it’s
like in public hospitals.

134
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,193
It’s tough when you don’t have money.

135
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,501
And I don’t want to go through
again what happened to Dad.

136
00:07:28,377 --> 00:07:30,735
If you don’t mind me asking,

137
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,202
what happened to your dad?

138
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,331
When we were still living in
Mindoro, he got sick.

139
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:38,875
Colon cancer.

140
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:42,003
Of course, he didn’t want treatment
because he didn’t want to spend.

141
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,796
So he hid it from Mom and me.

142
00:07:44,495 --> 00:07:45,481
You know,

143
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,674
he’s just like Mom in that way.

144
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,800
It’s frustrating.

145
00:07:48,191 --> 00:07:49,567
They really are couples.

146
00:07:50,327 --> 00:07:52,121
But eventually, he
still went to the hospital.

147
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,140
And in the end, he passed away

148
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,350
because the doctors
handling him weren’t good.

149
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,729
But you know,

150
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,856
what really stuck with me
was the feeling of being

151
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,192
helpless to do anything for them.

152
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,028
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,531
What are you saying? It’s okay.

154
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,033
At least now, right?

155
00:08:13,497 --> 00:08:15,124
If I become a doctor here,

156
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,322
Mom will have her own in-house doctor.

157
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,583
She won’t have to wait in long
lines at the hospital anymore, right?

158
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,918
Yeah.

159
00:08:23,674 --> 00:08:24,674
How about you?

160
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,048
Why do you want to study abroad?

161
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,094
I want to widen my knowledge
and my world.

162
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,262
It’s like—

163
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,805
I enjoy the feeling

164
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:38,809
of discovering new ideas or
experiences I know nothing about.

165
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,645
Then, I study them.

166
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:42,313
Master them.

167
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,524
So basically, you’re

168
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,109
afraid of being a know-it-all, huh?

169
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,778
You know, sometimes?

170
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:49,946
Yeah.

171
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,531
Sometimes, I just want to be

172
00:08:52,844 --> 00:08:54,596
oblivious to a lot of things.

173
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,620
So I don’t overthink
everything all the time.

174
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,665
Sometimes, I even wonder—

175
00:09:01,261 --> 00:09:02,261
What if,

176
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,917
What if,

177
00:09:04,772 --> 00:09:06,065
I'm not a top student?

178
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:09,186
Would people still expect the same from me?

179
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:11,362
Or maybe eventually,

180
00:09:11,387 --> 00:09:13,765
we’d just become a
burden to our parents too.

181
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,136
Why?

182
00:09:15,486 --> 00:09:16,486
Aren’t we already?

183
00:09:23,382 --> 00:09:24,425
But look at this.

184
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:28,876
Someday, you’ll be studying in the States.

185
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,652
Wow, look at you!

186
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:31,379
Hey, I haven’t even passed yet.

187
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,129
Come on.

188
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:35,112
I’m sure you’ll pass
the scholarship application.

189
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,616
You of all people.

190
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
But the thing is,

191
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,539
if you go abroad,
we won’t see each other.

192
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,332
Hey, that’s too much.

193
00:09:43,582 --> 00:09:45,584
The Philippines and the U.S.A. are close!

194
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,460
Close?

195
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,005
How does that work?

196
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,417
There, look!

197
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,633
Approximately, five inches.

198
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:55,761
Right,

199
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,138
super— super close,

200
00:09:57,259 --> 00:09:58,260
Five inches.

201
00:10:00,372 --> 00:10:01,372
Right?

202
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,893
You know,

203
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:05,688
no matter what happens,

204
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:10,026
I'll always come back to
where I can be more helpful.

205
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,647
I’m short by 160K.

206
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,651
I need more clients.

207
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:54,528
Wow, Teacher Lin.

208
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,739
Are you going to make
this a career or what?

209
00:10:57,505 --> 00:10:58,965
I need 16 or more clients.

210
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,077
Think you can find them?

211
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:02,285
What?

212
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,329
Chill out.

213
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,956
Not all our classmates
are willing to pay anyway.

214
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,043
Did I say it has to be our class?

215
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,481
Grade 11 has 3 other sections but

216
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,966
we need to start finding clients now.

217
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:17,968
Can you handle that, Pat?

218
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:20,679
Say less.

219
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:21,739
I got you.

220
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,764
Of course I can.

221
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,518
Good.

222
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,771
Because

223
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,985
I’ve been thinking that
after our final exams,

224
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,530
I want to stop this.

225
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,364
What?

226
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,659
What about next semester?

227
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:44,345
I don’t know.

228
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,015
Maybe you’ll have to find someone else.

229
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,750
One of the scholarship requirements

230
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,169
is a clean record and no behavioral issues.

231
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:56,890
And I can’t risk people getting
caught because of what we’re doing.

232
00:11:58,801 --> 00:11:59,801
Chill,

233
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,470
you won’t get caught.

234
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:03,061
I promise you.

235
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,602
Sorry.

236
00:12:12,213 --> 00:12:14,548
You should take that—
it might be important.

237
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:16,919
No, no. It’s okay.

238
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,944
Go ahead.

239
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,322
Look,

240
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,574
I should stop,

241
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,868
and I think we all should stop,

242
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,120
especially after what happened with Kyle.

243
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,039
But it’s hard because

244
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,333
I need money to pay for next sem's tuition.

245
00:12:32,522 --> 00:12:35,274
Okay, so after you get
your money this semester,

246
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,922
what about next semester?

247
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,508
What about me and your sis during midterms

248
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,218
and finals next semester?

249
00:12:41,776 --> 00:12:43,110
Don’t guilt trip me.

250
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,265
I already feel guilty about all this, okay?

251
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,033
Look, I just—

252
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:49,935
I just really need the money right now and

253
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,729
I never really wanted to do this.

254
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,813
But I just have to...

255
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,397
Hon!

256
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,041
Who’s calling you?

257
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,318
That’s been ringing for a while now.

258
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:58,318
Uhh.

259
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,863
No, it’s nothing.

260
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,328
It’s just drama club,
they're just delegating tasks.

261
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,996
I'll just take this really quick.

262
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:20,274
You know what’s weird?

263
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,967
I’m really good at reading people
but when it comes to

264
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:24,011
my own girlfriend, I can’t tell.

265
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,054
She’s been distant.

266
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,264
I don’t know, man.

267
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:34,980
Maybe,

268
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,107
there’s another guy.

269
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,217
Hey, I’m just joking.

270
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,576
You’re so serious.

271
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:48,576
Joke?

272
00:13:49,117 --> 00:13:50,117
Are we even close?

273
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,623
It's not funny.

274
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,838
So you do get jealous.

275
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,424
I thought you were cool and all.

276
00:14:03,207 --> 00:14:04,121
Me?

277
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,361
Jealous?

278
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:06,386
Never.

279
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,639
You know, there’s nothing
wrong with being jealous,

280
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,849
It just means that you
really do care for Grace.

281
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:14,770
The other day when you comforted
her when she cried at the auditorium,

282
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,565
I wanted to give you a standing ovation.

283
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:20,859
I used to think you were just an asshole.

284
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,696
Turns out you’ve actually got a heart.

285
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,677
Wow.

286
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:28,450
Thanks for not thinking of me as an asshole

287
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,288
'I’ve got a heart', huh.

288
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,789
As if that’s surprising.

289
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:36,981
Okay, sorry,

290
00:14:37,464 --> 00:14:38,465
I was wrong.

291
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,380
But Pat,

292
00:14:43,309 --> 00:14:45,562
if I ever find out you hurt Grace,

293
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,762
you’re dead to me.

294
00:15:33,841 --> 00:15:34,841
Oh!

295
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,909
Hon!

296
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:37,978
Hon, there you are.

297
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,455
Where are you going?

298
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,356
I was calling you.

299
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,774
Was your phone off?

300
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:45,739
I think— I think my phone died.

301
00:15:46,017 --> 00:15:47,017
Sorry.

302
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,048
It's fine.

303
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,741
Looks like a lot of people
have been calling you.

304
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,368
Don’t tell me you have another audition.

305
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:54,928
No.

306
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:55,953
None.

307
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,431
Okay,

308
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,249
because I’m taking you somewhere later.

309
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,086
Huh?

310
00:16:03,962 --> 00:16:04,962
Where?

311
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,548
You’ll see.

312
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:13,681
You’ll see.

313
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,645
There you go.

314
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,773
What is this?

315
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,401
Where are we going?

316
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,694
Are you kidnapping me?

317
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:27,528
You’ll see.

318
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,612
We’re almost there.

319
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,614
Keep going straight.

320
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,660
Turn to the right.

321
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,621
There you go.

322
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,331
Okay.

323
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,879
Can I take my blindfold off now?

324
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,548
I don’t like this feeling.

325
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,091
Yes, you can.

326
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,940
It’s so beautiful.

327
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,028
Happy anniversary, hon.

328
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,112
Oh.

329
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,198
Oh, I’m sorry.

330
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:17,619
I haven't even prepared
anything as big as this.

331
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,664
Don't worry about it.

332
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:22,583
What matters is,

333
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,169
we’re together, okay?

334
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:31,175
Here, we can be ourselves.

335
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,761
No pressure from our parents,

336
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,554
school stress,

337
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,096
judgment,

338
00:17:38,077 --> 00:17:39,077
problems.

339
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,436
Just the two of us.

340
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,569
Just the two of us.

341
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:19,889
Hon,

342
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,142
is there something wrong?

343
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,482
Nothing, nothing.

344
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,611
I just, I appreciate everything.

345
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,489
Are you overwhelmed?

346
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,451
Overwhelmed in a good way.

347
00:18:42,861 --> 00:18:44,487
I feel loved, hon.

348
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,176
You know,

349
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,058
if this is just a dream,

350
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,157
I really hope that I never have
to wake up from it.

351
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:15,049
I can't help but wish that we could
just stay in this moment forever.

352
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,907
It feels so perfect.

353
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:52,343
I love you.

354
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,865
I love you, too.

355
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,288
Hon,

356
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,499
I’m ready.

357
00:20:13,746 --> 00:20:14,914
Hon, are you sure?

358
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,216
Let’s do it. I’m ready.

359
00:20:19,217 --> 00:20:19,885
Are you really sure?

360
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,387
You might just be feeling
pressured by all this.

361
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,515
I’m sure.

362
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,226
Hon.

363
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,937
Are you okay?

364
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,117
I’m sorry.

365
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,705
I’m sorry, hon.

366
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,092
It's okay, hon.

367
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:53,270
Yo fam! Our exams are finally coming up,

368
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:56,481
So stay focused and good luck to all of us!

369
00:21:56,648 --> 00:22:00,360
Also, apologies for the speaker disturbance
but we're already working on it.

370
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,113
Thank you and stay tuned

371
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,322
here with

372
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,200
DJ Ping!

373
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,328
Guys, can we just please focus?

374
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,039
Lin?

375
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,624
Hey, Bank.

376
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,624
How are you?

377
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:16,876
I’m okay.

378
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,544
Where are you headed?

379
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:19,879
To you.

380
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,885
Oh, wait— No.

381
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:25,777
I mean,

382
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,029
not really 'to you'.

383
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,764
I’m on my way somewhere, then...

384
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:31,141
I saw you, so I walked over,

385
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,141
and...

386
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:34,532
I wanted to ask you something.

387
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,895
What is it?

388
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,359
Aren’t you with Pat or Grace?

389
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,905
I don’t know, maybe they’re on a date.

390
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:44,963
You know,

391
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,115
I don’t want to be the
national third wheel.

392
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,200
Ah.

393
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,251
That’s all you wanted to ask?

394
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,752
Actually, no.

395
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,463
I have another question.

396
00:23:03,998 --> 00:23:04,998
Are you heading home?

397
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:09,096
Actually, I was going to print
my application form,

398
00:23:09,141 --> 00:23:11,515
But our printer at home is broken.

399
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,949
Then,

400
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,601
the computer rooms are closed too.

401
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,828
I’ll just go somewhere else.

402
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:17,896
Where do you think there’s one?

403
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,664
Oh, no.

404
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,483
The computer shops around here are far.

405
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,443
You still need to take a tricycle.

406
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,102
You'll hail a ride then find a jeep.

407
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:26,595
Yeah, right.

408
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:27,948
Back in my old school,

409
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:29,908
there were printing shops everywhere.

410
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:31,938
This place is just too

411
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,286
exclusive.

412
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,009
You want me

413
00:23:36,243 --> 00:23:37,332
to print it for you instead?

414
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,917
There’s a shop right across from us.

415
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,079
I’m already a regular there.

416
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,646
So you won’t have to stay out late.

417
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:43,713
I’ll give it to you on Monday.

418
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:45,214
Really?

419
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,609
Of course.

420
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,634
For you, anything.

421
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,428
Wow.

422
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,848
You don’t always have to do that.

423
00:23:55,398 --> 00:23:57,561
Well, we’re friends now, right?

424
00:23:58,126 --> 00:23:59,126
That’s what friends do.

425
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,564
Okay.

426
00:24:06,773 --> 00:24:07,773
Hey,

427
00:24:08,152 --> 00:24:10,196
I see your hand has already healed.

428
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:14,702
Yeah.

429
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:16,537
My doctor’s really good.

430
00:24:17,372 --> 00:24:18,372
Who?

431
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,335
You.

432
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,129
Doctor already?

433
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,382
I only put a band-aid on you.

434
00:24:28,047 --> 00:24:30,216
You should be taking care of yourself.

435
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:34,807
I’ve got this now.

436
00:24:35,575 --> 00:24:36,575
Thank you.

437
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,059
Thanks, Bank.

438
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,772
Now I don’t have to go

439
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,357
to some printing shop outside, right?

440
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:51,323
Your call has been forwarded

441
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:53,450
to an automatic voice message system.

442
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:54,593
At the tone,

443
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:56,119
please record your message.

444
00:24:56,888 --> 00:24:57,888
Hi, hon.

445
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,706
I know your busy with your
audition and all.

446
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,417
And I know you told me not to pick you up

447
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:03,979
but I just miss you so much.

448
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,252
I'll be coming over.

449
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,803
No signal!

450
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,018
Sir, can I help you?

451
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:21,269
Ah, sir.

452
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,812
I’m here to pick up my girlfriend.

453
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:26,249
I dropped her off earlier,
but she’s not answering.

454
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,737
The one for the audition?

455
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,860
Sir, what audition?

456
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:33,156
The one for the softdrinks commercial?

457
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,576
There’s no audition here, sir.

458
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,911
Huh?

459
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,932
But my girlfriend’s here, kuya.

460
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,333
I dropped her off earlier.

461
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,461
Sir, the office is closed right now.

462
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,260
Uh, sorry.

463
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:55,053
Hon, who's calling you?

464
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,658
That’s been ringing for a while now.

465
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:58,013
Oh!

466
00:25:58,056 --> 00:25:58,915
Hon!

467
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:01,067
Hon, there you are.

468
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,355
She’s been distant.

469
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,316
Maybe there’s another guy.

470
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,169
Where have you been?

471
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,509
The auditions are at the other studio.

472
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,681
You're a bit early, Hon.

473
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,185
Hon?

474
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,395
Let’s go.

475
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,279
Hey, Banky.

476
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,304
Hi, Patty.

477
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,265
Patty your face.

478
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,977
Lin.

479
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,104
Hey, Bank.

480
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,482
Oh, here are your copies.

481
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,691
I made three of each, just in case.

482
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:34,110
So if they ask for extras,
you’ll have spares.

483
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:35,444
Wow!

484
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,238
Very efficient.

485
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,740
Thanks so much, really.

486
00:27:38,765 --> 00:27:39,507
Of course.

487
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,575
And here’s your flash drive.

488
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,482
You might forget it.

489
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:42,507
Thank you.

490
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:44,346
I’ll make it up to you.

491
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,371
Promise.

492
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,919
What if we go eat at my
favorite tapsilugan after exams?

493
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,336
My treat.

494
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,545
Really?

495
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,591
But what about—

496
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,218
Pat and Grace,

497
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,552
they’re your friends, right?

498
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:01,054
Oh no, no.

499
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:01,596
It’ll be just us.

500
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,515
They’ve got somewhere else to be.

501
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:09,729
Also, I know things between
you and Pat are not okay.

502
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:12,898
Alright.

503
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,776
Let’s just meet at the library first.

504
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,044
Sure, game.

505
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,029
Perfect, I actually have
something to tell you.

506
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,530
What is it?

507
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:21,573
I was going to say—

508
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,825
Nothing, okay?

509
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,743
Nothing.

510
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:27,872
You said you had something
to tell me after exams.

511
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540
What is it?

512
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,793
Why not now?

513
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,295
Okay, fine.

514
00:28:35,469 --> 00:28:37,539
Let’s just do it after exams.

515
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,509
You’re really going for the suspense, huh?

516
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,760
Just tell me now.

517
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,762
I said later.

518
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,948
What!

519
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,600
Now I’m going to be thinking
about it through the whole exams?

520
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:52,272
If my score drops, it’s on you.

521
00:28:52,688 --> 00:28:53,731
Yo fam!

522
00:28:53,731 --> 00:28:56,943
This is the day! Final exams are waving.

523
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,319
God bless us all.

524
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:03,908
Our speakers are still under repair,

525
00:29:04,112 --> 00:29:08,283
so expect to hear some unnecessary sounds.

526
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:09,664
You got this!

527
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,312
So?

528
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,338
See you later?

529
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,715
Let’s meet at the library.

530
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:21,783
- Bye, Lin.
- Bye.

531
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,613
Get one and pass.

532
00:29:42,804 --> 00:29:44,764
You're about to begin your first exam.

533
00:29:45,382 --> 00:29:46,800
After the cheating issue,

534
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:48,643
we will be stricter.

535
00:29:49,135 --> 00:29:52,639
Anyone caught talking with one another
will automatically fail.

536
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,127
When you're finished, leave
your papers on my desk.

537
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,838
Your first exam will end strictly

538
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,131
at 11:15.

539
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:06,054
You guys will be allowed a 15-minute
break before the next exam in philosophy,

540
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,806
which begins at exactly 11:30.

541
00:30:12,835 --> 00:30:13,835
You may now start.

542
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,065
You may now start.

543
00:32:53,048 --> 00:32:55,009
I need more clients.

544
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,808
Based on my calculations,

545
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,811
I need a total of three
hundred thousand pesos.

546
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:01,854
My earnings during midterms weren’t enough.

547
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,148
And since this sem is the last time

548
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,150
I’ll be giving you answers.

549
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,819
I still need 160,000.

550
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,111
Lin,

551
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,864
I see you as more than a friend.

552
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,575
I like you.

553
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,285
That’s tough.

554
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:21,833
It’s hard to find clients willing
to pay 20,000 for finals.

555
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:25,253
That’s why my fee
for finals is just 10,000.

556
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,797
So I need at least 16 or
more clients to reach my goal.

557
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:28,924
Can you do that?

558
00:33:28,949 --> 00:33:31,576
But I only see you as a friend, Bank.

559
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,599
Two weeks, different sections.

560
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:42,520
I think I can do it.

561
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,688
10,000 is a fair rate.

562
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:47,734
How should I do this?

563
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,918
How should I do this?

564
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:49,919
Good.

565
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,362
Well, if I'm going to
give you more clients,

566
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,864
how are you going to give
them the answers?

567
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,575
We’ll be taking the exams at
the same time in different classrooms.

568
00:33:56,033 --> 00:33:58,161
I'll give them the answers
by taking advantage

569
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,871
of our defective speakers.

570
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,374
Alright, I can handle this.

571
00:34:06,085 --> 00:34:07,312
Okay, here’s how.

572
00:34:07,532 --> 00:34:09,304
I’ll play four different sounds.

573
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:13,681
They’ll represent A, B, C, and D.

574
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,280
What are you playing?

575
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:16,305
Piano?

576
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,182
No, it has to be less obvious.

577
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,350
That’s why the sounds I’ll use
will seem like they’re just

578
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,468
coming from our broken speakers.

579
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,366
This will be the start signal.

580
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,414
This is A.

581
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:00,598
This is B.

582
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,114
This is C.

583
00:35:33,682 --> 00:35:35,309
And this one’s D.

584
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:56,678
It’s fine.

585
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,698
There’s still a second part of the exam.

586
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,034
I’ll gather my courage.

587
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:05,830
Did she send the code?

588
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,124
Can you not be so loud?

589
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,293
Yeah, she sent it.

590
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,477
Huh?

591
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,854
Why didn’t I hear it?

592
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,334
I had to guess the answer!

593
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,065
You should’ve listened carefully.

594
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,675
Of course, it’s not obvious.

595
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,326
Just remember,

596
00:36:19,592 --> 00:36:20,845
the bounce sound—

597
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:22,889
that’s the start signal.

598
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:24,682
The ones after that—

599
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,475
those are the answers.

600
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,456
Get one and pass.

601
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,959
We're about to begin your next exam.

602
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:34,919
When you're done answering,

603
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,879
you may leave and take your lunch break.

604
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,257
You have 45 minutes.

605
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,805
Time starts now.

606
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,576
You should’ve listened carefully.

607
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,201
If it’s the bounce sound,

608
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,152
that’s the starting signal.

609
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,612
The ones after that,

610
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,826
those are the answers.

611
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,072
Code?

612
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,473
Ah, Ms. Briones, I think

613
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,392
there’s something wrong with the speakers.

614
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,281
Why, what’s the problem?

615
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,951
What I noticed was that it seems like

616
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:56,078
there are four sounds coming
from the speakers.

617
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,455
And I think each one of those four

618
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,416
corresponds to a letter in the answers.

619
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,711
It’s not obvious at first.

620
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,088
But if you really listen carefully.

621
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,094
If you’re done with your exam,

622
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,469
you may leave.

623
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:16,764
Ms. Briones,

624
00:41:17,464 --> 00:41:19,068
please, just listen one more time.

625
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:22,104
I even noted that each letter
has a different sound.

626
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:25,805
A sounds like a beep.

627
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,236
Then B sounds like feedback.

628
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,948
C is more like a buzzer.

629
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,700
And D has a cracking sound.

630
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,911
What nonsense is that?

631
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,622
Please, Ms. Briones.

632
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:44,001
If you don’t stop,
I’ll mark your exam as invalid.

633
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:48,922
I’m sorry, ma’am.

634
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,443
Wait, AV Room.

635
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,495
There's someone in the speaker room
during the exams?

636
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:52,313
Mr. Bangkat.

637
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,364
Someone's using the speakers
to give out the answers.

638
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,674
I’ll go look for the key.

639
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:33,647
What a waste of money.

640
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,492
This is serious.

641
00:47:08,629 --> 00:47:09,760
Bank already knows.

642
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,162
and he even went to the
storage room with a teacher.

643
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,767
Do you have any idea

644
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:18,268
who might be behind this?

645
00:47:18,293 --> 00:47:19,795
Bank, talk to me please.

646
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:21,070
- Bank.
- What now?

647
00:47:21,153 --> 00:47:23,250
They’re taking advantage of us.

648
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:25,188
Do you notice her new phone?

649
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:26,635
I gave that to her.

650
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,304
It has a tracking device.

651
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,932
You really believe her when
she says she’s going home?

652
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,892
Okay, let’s be rational.

653
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,353
Maybe it’s from a
relative or family friend.

654
00:47:36,496 --> 00:47:38,266
I’m so sorry, I’m so sorry.

655
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,522
Grace!

656
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,125
Stop making a fool out of me.

657
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,294
Let me repeat the question.

658
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,615
Who among you is the mastermind
behind the cheating?
