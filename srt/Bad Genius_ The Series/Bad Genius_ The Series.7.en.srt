1
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:44,331
When has the
world ever been fair?

2
00:00:44,356 --> 00:00:45,656
Choose your battles, Lin.

3
00:00:45,918 --> 00:00:47,643
The world is already
too complicated.

4
00:00:47,668 --> 00:00:49,545
Don’t make things
harder for yourself.

5
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:54,846
I want you, Grace, to go with
Pat to study at Boston University.

6
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:56,570
Why did you accept Boston?

7
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:57,554
Are you that selfish?

8
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,485
You’ll do everything
just to get what you want?

9
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,762
If you want to
end this right now,

10
00:01:00,787 --> 00:01:02,455
then admit to your
dad that we're over.

11
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,340
I have a client who
needs a stand-in for the

12
00:01:11,365 --> 00:01:14,421
Standard Test for
International Colleges Exam.

13
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:16,323
So tell me, what should I do?

14
00:01:16,348 --> 00:01:17,357
Full name?

15
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,032
Grace Anne L. Dizon

16
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:20,949
And date of birth?

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,530
February 21, 2007.

18
00:01:23,555 --> 00:01:24,765
In what we’re going to do,

19
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:28,298
the whole Philippines can benefit
from the answers to STIC.

20
00:01:28,465 --> 00:01:30,027
I can’t do this alone.

21
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,555
Someone has to help me.

22
00:01:31,726 --> 00:01:32,726
Mom,

23
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:35,302
my decision is final.

24
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:37,562
Please don’t stop me.

25
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:39,756
Aren’t you earning money
from leaking the exam answers?

26
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:40,679
Teach me.

27
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:43,684
Thief! Help!

28
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,709
Help!

29
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,013
Hey!

30
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,522
Let’s go, hurry!

31
00:01:48,547 --> 00:01:49,547
Let’s go, hurry!

32
00:01:53,208 --> 00:01:54,379
Mom!

33
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:57,005
- Ouch!
- Mom!

34
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:58,747
- Mom!
- Ouch, Tristan!

35
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:00,586
My God, I think I’m dying.

36
00:02:00,951 --> 00:02:02,536
Help me, son!

37
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:03,554
Mom!

38
00:02:04,141 --> 00:02:05,322
It hurts!

39
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:07,332
It really hurts!

40
00:02:52,024 --> 00:02:55,027
Thoracic Laminectomy
is a major operation.

41
00:02:55,204 --> 00:02:57,832
That’s why there are a lot of
requirements for the patient.

42
00:03:00,459 --> 00:03:01,669
Imaging studies.

43
00:03:02,127 --> 00:03:03,504
Bone density scan.

44
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:05,422
Coagulation panels.

45
00:03:05,631 --> 00:03:06,715
And anesthesia.

46
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:08,008
Consultation.

47
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:11,595
Since you don’t have insurance,

48
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:13,430
all of this will cost—

49
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,765
Four hundred fifty thousand.

50
00:03:19,395 --> 00:03:20,604
I’m sorry, son.

51
00:03:20,813 --> 00:03:21,792
Stay strong, okay?

52
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:23,732
I’ll go ahead.

53
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:25,109
I still have other patients.

54
00:04:04,356 --> 00:04:05,356
Bank?

55
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,444
What are you doing here?

56
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:14,783
Aren’t you earning money
from leaking the exam answers?

57
00:04:17,202 --> 00:04:18,412
Teach me.

58
00:04:25,794 --> 00:04:26,794
I need money.

59
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:31,133
I need money to get
my mom operated on.

60
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:40,976
Lin.

61
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:45,188
Bank.

62
00:04:58,494 --> 00:04:59,494
Come in.

63
00:05:08,921 --> 00:05:09,921
What’s this place?

64
00:05:10,339 --> 00:05:12,675
This was my family’s
printing press but

65
00:05:12,925 --> 00:05:15,177
we moved, so now
it’s just a warehouse.

66
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,471
So...

67
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:20,240
What’s the plan?
Why are we here?

68
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:21,266
So many questions!

69
00:05:21,475 --> 00:05:22,493
Pat.

70
00:05:22,518 --> 00:05:23,441
What?

71
00:05:23,477 --> 00:05:24,812
Lin, do you still
trust this guy?

72
00:05:25,145 --> 00:05:26,689
He's a fucking snitch.

73
00:05:26,814 --> 00:05:28,899
He’ll just cry and break,
he can’t handle this.

74
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:29,931
Hon.

75
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,310
What?

76
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,505
Might as well
bring Tony back in.

77
00:05:33,696 --> 00:05:35,322
Isn’t there anyone
else to help us?

78
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:36,823
What?

79
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,533
You gonna fight me?

80
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:39,593
Go for it, dude.

81
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:40,619
Pat, that’s enough.

82
00:05:41,495 --> 00:05:42,913
If Bank isn’t part of our plan,

83
00:05:42,913 --> 00:05:45,624
then our plan won’t push
through. You know that.

84
00:05:53,138 --> 00:05:54,138
Pat.

85
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:57,886
Let’s forget what happened
between us at school.

86
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:00,681
That’s a different story now.

87
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:05,425
You don’t have to be my friend.

88
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,285
But you can trust me.

89
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,941
Lin,

90
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:13,235
I’ll help you guys.

91
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:15,112
You can count on
me, whatever it takes.

92
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,957
We’re going to Australia,

93
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:30,586
and we’ll take the STIC exam.

94
00:06:32,296 --> 00:06:34,840
So, how much are
we going to earn?

95
00:06:35,883 --> 00:06:37,009
One million.

96
00:06:39,528 --> 00:06:42,364
One million divided
by four so 250k each?

97
00:06:42,389 --> 00:06:43,389
Right?

98
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:45,099
No, Bank.

99
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,351
Oh.

100
00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:47,394
Sorry, sorry.

101
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:49,105
Is there anyone else in our group?

102
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:52,483
You know, honestly, any
amount is fine with me.

103
00:06:52,483 --> 00:06:54,208
50k, that’s already
a big help for me.

104
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:55,401
That’s just for you.

105
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:57,488
We each get one million.

106
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:10,958
Game.

107
00:07:12,878 --> 00:07:13,878
Okay.

108
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:17,723
The time difference between
Sydney and Manila is three hours.

109
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:20,344
One, two, three.

110
00:07:23,305 --> 00:07:25,307
After uploading the photo
and filling out the form

111
00:07:25,307 --> 00:07:26,517
for the application,

112
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,556
we’ll take the exam there.

113
00:07:28,894 --> 00:07:30,952
Then we’ll send
the answers here.

114
00:07:31,396 --> 00:07:32,815
So we’re going to Sydney?

115
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:34,817
We need to go there.

116
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,890
One, two, three.

117
00:07:49,873 --> 00:07:52,251
Only limited items are
allowed in the exam room.

118
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:56,004
Pencil, eraser, passport,
and registration form.

119
00:07:57,422 --> 00:07:59,883
So how do we give the answers?

120
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:02,027
Memory.

121
00:08:02,052 --> 00:08:03,679
The STIC has four sections.

122
00:08:04,012 --> 00:08:06,098
You mean we have
to memorize all of that?

123
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:10,102
Three, two, one, go.

124
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:12,854
Split it up.

125
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:16,483
So Bank, you memorize
the second half.

126
00:08:19,528 --> 00:08:22,447
And then Lin
gets the first half.

127
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,950
Section one,

128
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:28,954
answer half of the
questions in just 30 minutes.

129
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:41,675
And time!

130
00:08:41,884 --> 00:08:43,510
But how do we send
out the answers?

131
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,554
We’ll bring spare phones.

132
00:08:46,305 --> 00:08:49,391
We’ll hide the spare phones
in the CR inside the toilet tank.

133
00:08:52,186 --> 00:08:54,396
There’s a 10-minute
break every exam section.

134
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,440
In between those breaks,

135
00:08:56,732 --> 00:08:58,859
we’ll send the answers
using the phone.

136
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,196
A.

137
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:05,344
A.

138
00:09:05,407 --> 00:09:06,074
C.

139
00:09:06,074 --> 00:09:06,925
B.

140
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,950
C.

141
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,783
For the examinees
or just for us?

142
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,806
Nope.

143
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:13,874
Uh, just through me.

144
00:09:13,874 --> 00:09:17,044
I am in charge of getting
all the answers to the clients.

145
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:21,338
B.

146
00:09:38,565 --> 00:09:39,691
Look at the barcode.

147
00:09:40,317 --> 00:09:42,527
So every bar
represents an answer.

148
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:46,114
From A being the thickest
to D being the thinnest.

149
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:50,160
All clients will get three
pencils and each pencil

150
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,788
represents every
section of the STIC exam.

151
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:55,331
Okay.

152
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:57,434
Then what about
the essay portion?

153
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:00,128
The only thing we can do
is to provide the essay topic.

154
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:02,256
They’ll handle the research.

155
00:10:03,623 --> 00:10:05,198
And the clients
are fine with that?

156
00:10:06,343 --> 00:10:07,636
Small thing, Banky.

157
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:10,639
They won’t complain.

158
00:10:11,181 --> 00:10:12,474
I’ll take care of them.

159
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,980
Nice to meet you.

160
00:10:18,314 --> 00:10:19,523
I’m Pat Tioseco.

161
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:24,611
We have contract signing here
and all meetings are recorded.

162
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:27,781
No one will snitch because
you’re already accomplices.

163
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:30,205
Cheating?

164
00:10:30,784 --> 00:10:31,784
Nah.

165
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:33,161
I like the word,

166
00:10:33,745 --> 00:10:34,745
investment.

167
00:10:35,414 --> 00:10:37,361
Investment for your future.

168
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,544
One test result is all it
takes to change your life.

169
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:42,086
I’m risking.

170
00:10:42,713 --> 00:10:43,714
As they say,

171
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:46,008
education is a right.

172
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:48,760
So let’s work smart

173
00:10:49,344 --> 00:10:50,554
and let’s work together.

174
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:52,806
But hey,

175
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:55,517
this stays between us, okay?

176
00:10:58,937 --> 00:10:59,855
Cash only, bro.

177
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:01,440
Of course we don’t
want a paper trail.

178
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,153
Alright, just make sure to send the
full payment within the week, okay?

179
00:11:06,153 --> 00:11:07,492
No refunds.

180
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:09,071
Aight.

181
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,536
Business is booming, guys.

182
00:11:14,536 --> 00:11:15,554
Let’s go.

183
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:17,122
We’re close to the finish line.

184
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,291
Good job, team.

185
00:11:23,211 --> 00:11:25,363
Well, me and Grace
are about to head out.

186
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,107
Are you ready, hon?

187
00:11:27,132 --> 00:11:27,899
Yeah.

188
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:29,384
Are you guys
gonna hitch or what?

189
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:31,761
Uhm.

190
00:11:32,429 --> 00:11:34,973
I just have one request.

191
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:37,154
What is it, Bank?

192
00:11:38,644 --> 00:11:41,063
Maybe I can get my

193
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,523
first 500,000.

194
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:44,774
What?

195
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:46,695
Are you serious?

196
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:49,446
I’m sorry.

197
00:11:49,446 --> 00:11:51,073
It’s just that I really need

198
00:11:51,782 --> 00:11:54,368
money for my mom’s
surgery and private room.

199
00:11:55,994 --> 00:11:57,472
Well, we had an agreement.

200
00:11:57,913 --> 00:12:00,791
I won’t pay you until
the STIC is finished.

201
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:03,293
But what if you ghost us?

202
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:05,253
I wouldn’t do that to you guys.

203
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:10,967
Eh, even Lin hasn’t
received her share yet.

204
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:12,694
- How much more to you?
- Pat.

205
00:12:12,886 --> 00:12:14,262
That’s so unfair for her.

206
00:12:14,638 --> 00:12:15,638
Pat,

207
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,891
it’s okay with me to wait.

208
00:12:19,197 --> 00:12:20,197
But Bank,

209
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:22,771
he needs money for his mom.

210
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,235
Okay?

211
00:12:27,401 --> 00:12:28,693
Can we trust you?

212
00:12:35,992 --> 00:12:36,992
Fine.

213
00:12:39,663 --> 00:12:41,248
But if you run away,

214
00:12:41,957 --> 00:12:43,125
you're fucking dead.

215
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,856
And Lin,

216
00:12:49,881 --> 00:12:52,050
that’s your responsibility
if he doesn’t come back.

217
00:12:53,218 --> 00:12:56,388
You need to memorize
and send all the answers.

218
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,191
Can you do that?

219
00:12:58,223 --> 00:12:59,724
I trust Bank.

220
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:17,032
Oh,

221
00:13:17,742 --> 00:13:18,660
why are you home just now?

222
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,701
Have you eaten?

223
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:21,871
Dad?

224
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,332
Something happened to you again.

225
00:13:26,543 --> 00:13:28,253
I spoke to Mom.

226
00:13:31,548 --> 00:13:34,634
She said she wants to see me.

227
00:13:35,712 --> 00:13:37,338
I’m going to Sydney.

228
00:13:38,638 --> 00:13:40,140
She already bought a ticket.

229
00:13:40,724 --> 00:13:41,766
She bought you a ticket?

230
00:13:41,766 --> 00:13:42,865
Since when?

231
00:13:43,351 --> 00:13:44,853
I contacted her last week.

232
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,397
I’m leaving in three days.

233
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:53,320
Three days?

234
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,114
Good thing you even thought
of telling your dad, huh?

235
00:13:56,687 --> 00:13:57,632
I’m sorry, dad.

236
00:13:57,657 --> 00:13:58,800
I’ve been meaning to tell you.

237
00:13:58,825 --> 00:13:59,825
It’s just,

238
00:13:59,993 --> 00:14:01,195
I couldn’t find the right timing.

239
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,304
But you contacted her.

240
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,415
You decided without telling me.

241
00:14:05,999 --> 00:14:07,136
Come on, son.

242
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:10,446
There’s no problem if I talk
to Mom whenever I want.

243
00:14:10,471 --> 00:14:12,348
No problem, talk to your mom.

244
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:16,301
But if you’re leaving the
country alone, do you think

245
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:18,345
I wouldn’t worry something
might happen to you?

246
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:23,642
I can take care of myself,
Dad, and I’ll be with Mom.

247
00:14:23,892 --> 00:14:25,727
I trust you, but not your mom.

248
00:14:26,144 --> 00:14:27,370
But Dad...

249
00:14:27,395 --> 00:14:28,563
I’ll come back.

250
00:14:30,232 --> 00:14:32,984
I won’t be like mom who left you here.

251
00:14:37,781 --> 00:14:38,781
Dad.

252
00:14:40,617 --> 00:14:42,369
I just miss Mom.

253
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:46,790
I hope you won’t be angry
if I want to see her too.

254
00:14:50,335 --> 00:14:51,127
Why would I be angry?

255
00:14:51,127 --> 00:14:52,193
She’s your mom.

256
00:14:54,381 --> 00:14:55,840
It’s your right to see her.

257
00:14:57,175 --> 00:14:58,301
But next time,

258
00:14:58,627 --> 00:14:59,928
before making a decision,

259
00:15:01,179 --> 00:15:02,180
tell me first.

260
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,048
Bank,

261
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:33,670
have you been there a while?

262
00:15:35,621 --> 00:15:36,621
Yes, Ma.

263
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,009
But you were
sleeping so soundly.

264
00:15:40,176 --> 00:15:41,574
So, it’s really nice here, huh?

265
00:15:42,012 --> 00:15:43,805
So this is what private is like.

266
00:15:44,806 --> 00:15:46,016
It’s so quiet.

267
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,310
And so cold.

268
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:50,958
Can you turn off the aircon first?

269
00:15:54,566 --> 00:15:55,625
There, Ma.

270
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,650
All good now.

271
00:16:05,535 --> 00:16:07,078
Where did you get the money?

272
00:16:10,415 --> 00:16:11,875
Don’t worry about that, Ma.

273
00:16:17,047 --> 00:16:17,881
I don’t want to
stay here anymore.

274
00:16:17,881 --> 00:16:19,003
I want to go home.

275
00:16:19,884 --> 00:16:20,884
Ma!

276
00:16:21,343 --> 00:16:22,343
Oh dear,

277
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:23,637
I don’t want to spend more.

278
00:16:23,637 --> 00:16:25,106
Life is so hard now.

279
00:16:25,347 --> 00:16:26,348
My child.

280
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:28,724
Ma.

281
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,977
Please don’t think about the money.

282
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:34,064
I’ll take care of you.

283
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,526
Do you remember my friend Pat?

284
00:16:39,235 --> 00:16:40,239
He’s rich.

285
00:16:40,695 --> 00:16:41,821
He lends me money.

286
00:16:49,871 --> 00:16:51,331
So you two are close, huh?

287
00:16:53,714 --> 00:16:54,714
And also,

288
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:57,879
I have a part-time job.

289
00:16:58,463 --> 00:17:00,715
I tutor kids every MWF.

290
00:17:10,266 --> 00:17:12,060
I’m really so lucky to have you.

291
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:17,357
Maybe if your
dad didn’t leave us,

292
00:17:18,191 --> 00:17:21,027
Life wouldn’t be this
hard now, my child.

293
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:24,381
Come on, Ma.

294
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:25,907
We’ve come a long way.

295
00:17:26,866 --> 00:17:28,660
And Dad never really
abandoned us either.

296
00:17:35,709 --> 00:17:37,085
Just remember, son, if,

297
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:45,135
if your problems become
too heavy, ask for help, okay?

298
00:18:03,027 --> 00:18:04,027
Oh,

299
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:07,615
we need to wrap up.

300
00:18:08,158 --> 00:18:09,743
I have to go home early.

301
00:18:11,536 --> 00:18:12,536
Curfew?

302
00:18:14,873 --> 00:18:17,042
I need to get on dad's good side.

303
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:22,422
He was upset when I told
him I was leaving for Australia.

304
00:18:24,758 --> 00:18:25,758
How about you?

305
00:18:28,261 --> 00:18:30,138
I can’t tell mom
that I’m leaving.

306
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:31,931
It’ll just make her worry.

307
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,893
Anyway, it’s only a few days.

308
00:18:37,562 --> 00:18:38,566
Just think,

309
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:42,317
in just a few days
our lives will change.

310
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,784
Then you’ll finally fulfill your
dream of studying abroad.

311
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,698
You’ll be able to go
to med school too.

312
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:53,912
More importantly, we won’t need to
compete for the scholarship anymore.

313
00:18:55,663 --> 00:18:56,873
So now,

314
00:18:57,957 --> 00:19:00,752
maybe we can
finally be real friends?

315
00:19:05,792 --> 00:19:06,792
Lin?

316
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:08,409
Bank?

317
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:09,551
Wow,

318
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:11,356
you two look so happy there!

319
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:13,056
Right, hon?

320
00:19:13,056 --> 00:19:14,974
I wonder what we missed.

321
00:19:16,101 --> 00:19:16,743
Oh.

322
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:18,645
Here are your application forms.

323
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,471
And here are your boarding passes.

324
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:24,250
Direct flight Manila to
Sydney, that’s 8 hours.

325
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:27,362
So you leave at night, then when
you wake up, it’ll be morning in Sydney.

326
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:30,782
Wait, hon.

327
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:32,597
Um...

328
00:19:33,451 --> 00:19:35,120
We forgot about their rooms.

329
00:19:37,288 --> 00:19:38,414
Oh, right.

330
00:19:38,414 --> 00:19:40,250
What’s our favorite
hotel again, hon?

331
00:19:40,747 --> 00:19:42,665
But I think it’s fully booked.

332
00:19:44,003 --> 00:19:44,546
No, hon.

333
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:46,339
But the resort is too far.

334
00:19:46,339 --> 00:19:49,425
They should stay at a
place near the site instead.

335
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:51,553
Okay, just book the hotel, hon.

336
00:19:51,553 --> 00:19:52,445
But,

337
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,097
let’s keep it budget-friendly.

338
00:19:55,098 --> 00:19:57,016
You two can share a room,

339
00:19:57,934 --> 00:19:59,102
so you’ll be closer.

340
00:19:59,644 --> 00:20:00,658
Hon?

341
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,229
What?

342
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,940
It’s twin beds.

343
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,942
And you won’t even be side by side.

344
00:20:06,352 --> 00:20:07,352
Wait,

345
00:20:08,444 --> 00:20:10,530
we shouldn’t be in the same hotel.

346
00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:12,282
That would look suspicious.

347
00:20:13,663 --> 00:20:16,241
Even in flights, why
are we seated together?

348
00:20:17,579 --> 00:20:18,555
Right, right.

349
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,873
Ah yeah, it’s true.

350
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:22,333
You’re right, as always.

351
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:25,879
We’ll figure something out.

352
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:28,781
Who’s that, Grace?

353
00:20:31,134 --> 00:20:32,134
I don’t know.

354
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:35,013
There shouldn’t be anyone here.

355
00:20:35,013 --> 00:20:36,021
Yo, chill.

356
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:37,807
I just sent someone.

357
00:20:38,775 --> 00:20:39,852
Bank, I hope

358
00:20:40,059 --> 00:20:41,644
your mom doesn’t have allergies.

359
00:20:41,978 --> 00:20:42,979
I got her flowers.

360
00:20:43,438 --> 00:20:44,463
I’ll be back.

361
00:20:44,814 --> 00:20:45,899
Pat, do you need help?

362
00:20:57,744 --> 00:20:58,744
You took so long.

363
00:20:59,245 --> 00:20:59,996
Sorry, boss.

364
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:01,289
We almost got into trouble.

365
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:09,272
Thief!

366
00:21:09,297 --> 00:21:10,297
Help!

367
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:12,507
Hey!

368
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,672
Alright.

369
00:21:17,931 --> 00:21:19,574
I’ll just send the
payment to the number.

370
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,909
Thank you, boss Pat.

371
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:22,894
By the way, what about the
money from the laundry shop

372
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:24,145
that you told us to steal?

373
00:21:25,146 --> 00:21:25,997
That’s yours now.

374
00:21:26,022 --> 00:21:27,523
Go on, leave.

375
00:21:59,238 --> 00:22:00,853
Bank, are you okay?

376
00:22:00,878 --> 00:22:01,968
Bank,

377
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:03,601
here’s the bouquet for your mom.

378
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:07,038
- Bank!
- Guys!

379
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:11,025
Guys, stop it!

380
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,236
Why did you do this to us, Pat?

381
00:22:13,236 --> 00:22:14,529
Why did you do this to us?

382
00:22:14,904 --> 00:22:16,197
What are you talking about!

383
00:22:16,239 --> 00:22:18,574
Stop lying to us, boss Pat!

384
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:20,576
I caught you.

385
00:22:20,576 --> 00:22:21,953
I heard everything outside.

386
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:24,180
The guys who
gave you the flowers.

387
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:26,846
They’re the same guys
you ordered to rob our shop.

388
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,126
I saw the plate number.

389
00:22:28,126 --> 00:22:29,394
I saw the helmet.

390
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:31,629
And I heard that the
money we worked hard for…

391
00:22:31,629 --> 00:22:32,733
You just gave it away!

392
00:22:34,966 --> 00:22:35,842
No, come on guys!

393
00:22:35,842 --> 00:22:37,318
You’ll believe him?

394
00:22:37,343 --> 00:22:38,602
He’s just stressed out!

395
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:39,512
Bank, stop it!

396
00:22:39,512 --> 00:22:40,613
He’s just imagining things!

397
00:22:40,638 --> 00:22:41,723
Fuck you, Pat!

398
00:22:42,181 --> 00:22:44,475
Because of you, my
mom’s in the hospital!

399
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:48,229
Bank, why are you doing this?

400
00:22:49,272 --> 00:22:51,149
Pat, tell the truth, please!

401
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:53,650
Come on!

402
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:58,057
Okay, fine.

403
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:00,783
Okay, Bank. Listen to me.

404
00:23:01,993 --> 00:23:03,036
I didn’t mean it.

405
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:04,871
Yes, I paid them to
mess up your shop.

406
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:07,015
But I didn’t tell them
to hurt your mom.

407
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,499
I just want you to help us!

408
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:09,667
Well, it already
happened, right?

409
00:23:09,692 --> 00:23:10,697
But she’s fine!

410
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:13,171
You already got your 500k!

411
00:23:13,963 --> 00:23:15,690
If you want, I’ll give
you half of my share.

412
00:23:15,715 --> 00:23:16,733
Stupid!

413
00:23:16,758 --> 00:23:18,818
Not everything can be
solved with money, okay?

414
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:20,153
Bank, we’re desperate!

415
00:23:20,178 --> 00:23:22,696
If all this didn’t happen,
you wouldn’t have said yes.

416
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,244
You, Lin.

417
00:23:25,475 --> 00:23:26,771
You’re involved
in this too, right?

418
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:27,839
Bank, I don’t know
anything about that,

419
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,163
and if I knew that
was Pat’s plan,

420
00:23:30,188 --> 00:23:32,065
I would never have
allowed him to do it.

421
00:23:35,276 --> 00:23:36,351
It’s just me, Bank.

422
00:23:36,944 --> 00:23:38,446
Grace has nothing to do with this.

423
00:23:39,505 --> 00:23:40,464
Just remember this, Pat.

424
00:23:40,489 --> 00:23:41,612
I’m telling you,

425
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:43,409
I’ll return all of this to you.

426
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:48,615
Fine.

427
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:49,832
I deserve it.

428
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:53,120
But,

429
00:23:53,294 --> 00:23:54,295
it’s so cool though, right?

430
00:23:54,295 --> 00:23:55,146
The…

431
00:23:55,171 --> 00:23:57,090
plan we had with STIC?

432
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,509
Damn it, are you serious, Pat?

433
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:03,346
Bank, this is not
about you and me.

434
00:24:03,346 --> 00:24:05,196
We need to finish the plan.

435
00:24:05,431 --> 00:24:07,825
There are so many clients
waiting, Bank, please.

436
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,143
That’s no longer my problem.

437
00:24:09,602 --> 00:24:11,479
Go find someone else
to help you instead,

438
00:24:11,479 --> 00:24:12,852
because I'm done here.

439
00:24:13,439 --> 00:24:14,439
Bank!

440
00:24:14,941 --> 00:24:16,029
Stop it, Lin!

441
00:24:16,567 --> 00:24:18,111
You're all liars!

442
00:24:19,237 --> 00:24:21,697
Bank, can we
please talk properly?

443
00:24:23,149 --> 00:24:24,859
Hon, I'm sorry this happened.

444
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:29,158
How...

445
00:24:30,706 --> 00:24:32,542
how could you do that?

446
00:24:32,959 --> 00:24:34,544
Hon, I did that for us!

447
00:24:34,836 --> 00:24:37,046
Isn't that what you wanted
for us to be together?

448
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:38,065
Yes!

449
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,634
Yes, but not like this!

450
00:24:45,054 --> 00:24:46,848
Not like this, Pat.

451
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:55,508
Grace...

452
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:19,130
At last, you're awake, Mom.

453
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,383
I thought maybe later
you won’t be able to sleep.

454
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:25,094
The medicine makes me sleepy.

455
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:31,959
Oh, Mom,

456
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,059
here.

457
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,140
You still need to
take this medicine,

458
00:25:37,172 --> 00:25:38,173
please get up first.

459
00:25:57,251 --> 00:25:58,836
Thank you, Doc.

460
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:02,298
It feels so good to hear, right?

461
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,628
Doctor...

462
00:26:06,135 --> 00:26:07,135
Bangkat.

463
00:26:08,846 --> 00:26:09,889
Someday.

464
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
Wait.

465
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:14,101
I'm not pressuring you, okay.

466
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:17,396
If ever you change your mind

467
00:26:17,396 --> 00:26:21,108
and you don’t want Medicine
anymore, that’s okay with me.

468
00:26:23,986 --> 00:26:25,321
I'm still your doctor, Ma.

469
00:26:26,447 --> 00:26:27,782
For you and Papa.

470
00:26:28,783 --> 00:26:30,159
I promised that already.

471
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:31,706
Even before, right?

472
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:37,500
So how are your clients?

473
00:26:38,584 --> 00:26:39,752
Huh? Clients?

474
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:42,088
Didn’t you say

475
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,257
you’re tutoring?

476
00:26:44,382 --> 00:26:45,591
Tell me about it.

477
00:26:45,758 --> 00:26:47,647
Do the kids listen to you?

478
00:26:49,428 --> 00:26:50,428
Ah.

479
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:53,514
Yes, of course.

480
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:54,607
And also,

481
00:26:55,518 --> 00:26:59,814
it’s lucky too because when
there’s overtime, there’s a bonus,

482
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:01,482
and there are also
many incentives.

483
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:09,198
Tristan,

484
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:15,454
I know

485
00:27:16,372 --> 00:27:19,875
that there’s a lot you don’t tell me.

486
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:25,667
You’re grown up now.

487
00:27:26,632 --> 00:27:27,925
You’re smart.

488
00:27:30,428 --> 00:27:33,306
You know what’s right and wrong.

489
00:27:35,474 --> 00:27:40,646
As long as if it gets hard and you need

490
00:27:41,772 --> 00:27:43,399
help with problems

491
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:47,695
or even just someone to talk
to, I’m right here, son, okay?

492
00:27:51,324 --> 00:27:52,658
I’m fine, Ma.

493
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:08,934
Come in.

494
00:28:18,684 --> 00:28:19,684
Oh.

495
00:28:20,853 --> 00:28:22,197
Good evening, tita.

496
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,766
Uh, I brought
some fruits for you.

497
00:28:24,791 --> 00:28:26,251
Oh, thank you.

498
00:28:26,889 --> 00:28:28,805
You visited and even
brought something.

499
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:30,838
How are you feeling now?

500
00:28:30,863 --> 00:28:31,863
I’m okay.

501
00:28:32,323 --> 00:28:33,741
Just fighting off

502
00:28:34,492 --> 00:28:35,701
the body pain.

503
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:37,745
But I can handle this.

504
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:38,871
I’ll endure it.

505
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:40,456
I’m used to this.

506
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:42,416
That’s just how life is, right?

507
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:44,168
Good thing Bank is here.

508
00:28:49,353 --> 00:28:50,056
Alright.

509
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:51,317
Chat with Ma for now.

510
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:52,985
I’ll just go to the
pharmacy before it closes.

511
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:55,221
Oh no, take Lin with you.

512
00:28:56,764 --> 00:28:57,740
It’s okay.

513
00:28:57,765 --> 00:28:58,617
I’ll go with you.

514
00:28:58,642 --> 00:28:59,492
No, no.

515
00:28:59,517 --> 00:29:00,525
It’s fine.

516
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,074
Go with him.

517
00:29:02,228 --> 00:29:04,864
Later the nurses will be
making their rounds anyway.

518
00:29:05,314 --> 00:29:06,607
I’ll have company.

519
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:08,218
Go ahead, you two.

520
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:11,319
Get well soon.

521
00:29:43,394 --> 00:29:46,772
I just want to apologize
for what happened earlier.

522
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:50,264
You did nothing wrong, Lin.

523
00:29:51,652 --> 00:29:53,295
I should be the one to apologize

524
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,864
because I left you hanging.

525
00:29:56,282 --> 00:29:57,741
What Pat did was really wrong.

526
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,953
And there’s no excuse
that can justify it.

527
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:05,832
Bank,

528
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:08,461
just focus on your mom.

529
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,088
I’ll handle STIC.

530
00:30:12,089 --> 00:30:13,577
You’ll still get your share.

531
00:30:15,468 --> 00:30:16,510
Thanks, Lin.

532
00:30:17,178 --> 00:30:20,639
But you and I both know you can’t
memorize the entire STIC exam.

533
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:24,702
I already got my 500,000.

534
00:30:24,727 --> 00:30:25,780
I still have some left.

535
00:30:26,061 --> 00:30:28,452
I can return that to you so you
can find someone to replace me.

536
00:30:28,624 --> 00:30:29,624
No need.

537
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:32,109
We already split the money,

538
00:30:32,109 --> 00:30:33,151
fair and square.

539
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:35,946
I don’t need assistance, Lin.

540
00:30:36,238 --> 00:30:37,173
Wait.

541
00:30:37,198 --> 00:30:38,657
I’m not belittling you.

542
00:30:38,991 --> 00:30:40,387
But it’s still the same, right?

543
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:43,537
Even if you don’t admit
it, you see me differently

544
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,327
because our lives are different.

545
00:30:46,582 --> 00:30:49,376
You pity us because no
matter how fair we try to fight,

546
00:30:49,376 --> 00:30:50,586
we never win.

547
00:30:50,586 --> 00:30:51,687
Right?

548
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:53,842
Don’t separate yourself from me.

549
00:30:55,216 --> 00:30:56,842
We’re both just finding ways

550
00:30:56,842 --> 00:30:58,672
to change our situations, right?

551
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,642
Life is just really hard in the
Philippines if you’re not born rich.

552
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,187
But are we just
going to give up?

553
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,180
Of course, we’ll just
do our best, right?

554
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,854
That’s the only fight we have.

555
00:31:19,417 --> 00:31:20,912
But for people like Pat,

556
00:31:22,117 --> 00:31:23,677
they don’t fight fair

557
00:31:23,702 --> 00:31:25,538
even if they already have
the advantage of wealth.

558
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:30,083
If you,

559
00:31:30,543 --> 00:31:31,543
stand up to him,

560
00:31:32,836 --> 00:31:34,004
we’ll understand you.

561
00:31:41,428 --> 00:31:42,428
No, Lin.

562
00:31:43,326 --> 00:31:44,355
I’ve changed my mind.

563
00:31:45,808 --> 00:31:48,269
We’ll go to Sydney
and take the STIC.

564
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:50,688
I won’t leave you in the fight.

565
00:31:52,106 --> 00:31:53,106
You’re right.

566
00:31:54,233 --> 00:31:55,484
We’re not competitors,

567
00:31:56,443 --> 00:31:57,528
we’re friends,

568
00:31:58,571 --> 00:31:59,780
and friends

569
00:32:01,073 --> 00:32:02,073
don’t abandon each other.

570
00:32:08,824 --> 00:32:09,824
Thank you.

571
00:32:22,177 --> 00:32:24,054
Lin, let me take you home.

572
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:25,531
I’ll just change
then I’ll book a ride.

573
00:32:25,556 --> 00:32:26,348
It’s fine, Dad.

574
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:27,808
You might be late for class.

575
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:29,142
Are you sure?

576
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:31,645
This is the first time
this is happening.

577
00:32:31,645 --> 00:32:33,647
This is the first time my
baby Linlin will be far from me.

578
00:32:34,023 --> 00:32:35,239
Dad, come on!

579
00:32:35,264 --> 00:32:36,960
I’ll only be gone
for a few days.

580
00:32:39,403 --> 00:32:40,738
I’m sorry.

581
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,365
I thought that

582
00:32:44,271 --> 00:32:46,898
as long as I did
everything I could,

583
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,944
even alone...

584
00:32:48,704 --> 00:32:49,770
that was enough.

585
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:53,000
Sorry if I fell short.

586
00:32:53,113 --> 00:32:55,194
No, you’re not lacking, Dad.

587
00:32:55,419 --> 00:32:57,212
You’ve given more
than enough and

588
00:32:57,671 --> 00:32:59,089
I’m lucky to have you.

589
00:33:00,591 --> 00:33:01,591
Thank you.

590
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:04,595
But I also understand that
you need to see your mom.

591
00:33:04,903 --> 00:33:06,322
It’s good that you two can talk

592
00:33:06,347 --> 00:33:07,642
at least even for a while.

593
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:10,059
That’s it, I get it.

594
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:12,478
I want you to know
that I love you.

595
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:13,896
So whatever it is you need,

596
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:16,689
I’ll accept it.
It just hurts my pride.

597
00:33:17,316 --> 00:33:18,692
But I do get it.

598
00:33:18,942 --> 00:33:19,942
And also,

599
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:21,417
I hope...

600
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,113
I hope nothing changes.

601
00:33:24,031 --> 00:33:25,574
This is just for a
short while, Dad.

602
00:33:26,409 --> 00:33:28,203
It'll be back to
normal when I return.

603
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:29,370
That's what's important.

604
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,162
That you'll come back.

605
00:33:31,163 --> 00:33:32,640
- Promise.
- Promise.

606
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:33,986
- Promise.
- Oh, here.

607
00:33:35,292 --> 00:33:36,018
What is this?

608
00:33:36,043 --> 00:33:36,894
Oh, don’t open it.

609
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:37,919
It’s nothing.

610
00:33:38,087 --> 00:33:38,796
Music box.

611
00:33:38,796 --> 00:33:41,590
It plays your favorite piece.

612
00:33:41,965 --> 00:33:43,300
So you can remember me.

613
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,387
I know no matter how beautiful
your mom’s house is in Australia.

614
00:33:46,387 --> 00:33:47,446
It doesn’t have a piano.

615
00:33:48,347 --> 00:33:49,556
Thank you, Dad.

616
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,308
Thank you so much!

617
00:33:51,517 --> 00:33:52,534
You're welcome.

618
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,632
Wow!

619
00:33:53,727 --> 00:33:54,745
I'll take this.

620
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:55,820
I'll take you there.

621
00:33:56,188 --> 00:33:56,855
Really?

622
00:33:58,065 --> 00:33:59,110
Thank you, Dad.

623
00:34:04,279 --> 00:34:05,485
What is this?

624
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,510
It’s too heavy.

625
00:34:16,834 --> 00:34:18,001
Oh, are you ready?

626
00:34:18,368 --> 00:34:19,169
Let’s go.

627
00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:20,154
Okay, wait a minute.

628
00:34:22,089 --> 00:34:23,465
Grace, Pat.

629
00:34:23,902 --> 00:34:24,902
This is it.

630
00:34:25,134 --> 00:34:26,427
We’re already in Australia.

631
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:27,937
Thanks, sis.

632
00:34:28,303 --> 00:34:29,071
Okay.

633
00:34:29,096 --> 00:34:29,982
Good luck, guys.

634
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:31,807
Later, sis.

635
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:32,908
Roaming is expensive.

636
00:34:32,933 --> 00:34:33,988
Take care there.

637
00:34:34,143 --> 00:34:34,702
Okay.

638
00:34:34,727 --> 00:34:35,821
Bye, sis.

639
00:34:35,853 --> 00:34:36,853
You guys take care.

640
00:34:37,312 --> 00:34:38,312
Okay.

641
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:41,774
There.

642
00:34:42,693 --> 00:34:43,693
This is it.

643
00:34:45,362 --> 00:34:47,297
Wow. We've come a long way, huh?

644
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:47,823
I'm Lin.

645
00:34:47,823 --> 00:34:49,219
Also Grade 11, Section A.

646
00:34:49,383 --> 00:34:50,801
- Lin Estrella?
- Yeah.

647
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:52,170
- Why?
- I'm Bank!

648
00:34:53,162 --> 00:34:55,222
I’m the one you stole
the scholarship from.

649
00:34:55,247 --> 00:35:00,878
Possenti has been chosen
to host the Teen Genius Quiz.

650
00:35:02,337 --> 00:35:04,715
And I want the
two of you to join.

651
00:35:05,883 --> 00:35:07,634
What is the value of Pi,

652
00:35:08,264 --> 00:35:10,600
to twelve decimal places?

653
00:35:12,417 --> 00:35:13,417
Relax.

654
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:15,159
We can win this.

655
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:16,272
For what?

656
00:35:16,468 --> 00:35:17,728
So you can be the first to answer?

657
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:19,687
No, thanks.

658
00:35:21,857 --> 00:35:24,193
Tristan wasn’t able to
take the exam earlier,

659
00:35:24,193 --> 00:35:27,410
so he’ll be taking
it with your section.

660
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:28,876
What the heck?

661
00:35:28,906 --> 00:35:30,657
I can’t concentrate
with what you’re doing.

662
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:35,204
Can we talk?

663
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:44,851
Oh, here.

664
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:46,161
So that wound of yours can heal.

665
00:35:52,596 --> 00:35:56,058
Hey, is the wound on
your hand better now?

666
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:57,266
Yeah.

667
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:59,376
My doctor’s really good.

668
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:17,286
You know what?

669
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:19,289
I’d forgotten the feeling.

670
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:22,570
It’s really awful
when you lie, right?

671
00:36:35,055 --> 00:36:36,223
I never thought that

672
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,891
the reason for my
first trip abroad is

673
00:36:39,101 --> 00:36:41,353
because I’m an accomplice in
an international cheating scheme.

674
00:36:41,603 --> 00:36:42,603
Hey!

675
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:48,318
What did you tell your mom?

676
00:36:49,611 --> 00:36:52,364
I said I’m going to coach
junior high school students

677
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:53,866
who will compete in
the Math Olympiad.

678
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:55,825
You?

679
00:36:59,252 --> 00:37:00,795
My mom lives here now.

680
00:37:02,166 --> 00:37:03,484
She has a new family.

681
00:37:05,127 --> 00:37:07,337
We haven’t talked for years.

682
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:11,466
But what my dad knows
is that I’ll just visit them.

683
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,730
Is that true?

684
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:17,809
Shall we go?

685
00:37:23,604 --> 00:37:24,578
What?

686
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,477
Our test taker backed out?

687
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:27,565
Of course not!

688
00:37:27,874 --> 00:37:29,052
Where did that come from?

689
00:37:29,443 --> 00:37:30,861
We’re not amateurs.

690
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:32,571
Trust us, okay?

691
00:37:33,565 --> 00:37:34,565
Come on.

692
00:37:39,202 --> 00:37:41,455
I hope Lin and Bank are okay.

693
00:37:43,332 --> 00:37:44,333
They’ll be fine, hon.

694
00:37:45,584 --> 00:37:47,044
They know what’s at stake.

695
00:37:47,997 --> 00:37:48,997
Okay?

696
00:37:49,963 --> 00:37:53,592
I just hope that all of our
sacrifices pay off, you know?

697
00:37:53,759 --> 00:37:57,220
We worked too hard for
this and the risk is too high.

698
00:37:57,638 --> 00:37:58,655
Of course.

699
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,283
Don't be too negative, hon.

700
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:01,808
Professionals siya tayo.

701
00:38:03,226 --> 00:38:05,558
Hey, don't say that.

702
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:09,162
I mean,

703
00:38:09,816 --> 00:38:11,693
we won't be doing
this forever, right?

704
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,040
It's just this one time.

705
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:14,296
Of course.

706
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,321
Just one time.

707
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,075
But us,

708
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:19,951
forever.

709
00:38:21,161 --> 00:38:22,161
Okay?

710
00:38:23,997 --> 00:38:24,997
Wait.

711
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:26,308
You

712
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,502
ask me this again
with a ring, okay?

713
00:38:29,406 --> 00:38:30,270
And

714
00:38:30,295 --> 00:38:32,047
maybe after college?

715
00:38:33,173 --> 00:38:34,358
Of course.

716
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:35,389
But,

717
00:38:35,926 --> 00:38:37,928
as if for a second I thought
I was gonna lose you.

718
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:44,059
Especially when Bank
found out about what I did.

719
00:38:46,603 --> 00:38:47,854
I almost did.

720
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:50,941
That was really foul.

721
00:38:54,194 --> 00:38:55,194
But,

722
00:38:55,779 --> 00:38:58,991
we all make mistakes
and wrong decisions

723
00:39:00,075 --> 00:39:03,120
and you're sorry for it
naman and I'm good with that.

724
00:39:05,372 --> 00:39:07,291
I believe that you're
a good person, Pat.

725
00:39:08,052 --> 00:39:08,767
Okay?

726
00:39:08,792 --> 00:39:10,377
And I won't give up on you.

727
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:12,795
On us.

728
00:39:18,552 --> 00:39:20,053
And I promise you

729
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:21,921
that I won't
disappoint you, hon.

730
00:39:42,242 --> 00:39:44,077
Good morning everyone.

731
00:39:44,703 --> 00:39:47,289
Welcome to the STIC exam.

732
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,418
You may begin the
registration process.

733
00:39:54,504 --> 00:39:59,551
Please leave all your belongings
before entering the exam hall.

734
00:40:00,552 --> 00:40:03,889
And yes, that includes
your mobile phone.

735
00:40:06,391 --> 00:40:08,268
If you sneak them inside,

736
00:40:08,643 --> 00:40:09,728
we will know.

737
00:40:25,077 --> 00:40:28,747
Please observe the rules
and don't try to outsmart us.

738
00:40:28,872 --> 00:40:29,938
Excuse me.

739
00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:31,278
Do you still have
your cellphone?

740
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:33,210
Please, surrender
it with your bag.

741
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:34,851
Thank you.

742
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:40,217
Every incident of
cheating in the STIC,

743
00:40:40,717 --> 00:40:43,178
has been dealt with accordingly.

744
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,939
So how are the
answers going to get out?

745
00:41:18,964 --> 00:41:20,716
We'll bring spare phones.

746
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:24,157
We'll hide the spare phones
inside the CR, in the toilet tank.

747
00:41:36,815 --> 00:41:37,816
Nona,

748
00:41:38,191 --> 00:41:39,734
can I speak with Lin?

749
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:41,950
What are you talking about?

750
00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:43,839
How would Lin even get here?

751
00:41:44,355 --> 00:41:48,234
Vin, there's exactly an exam
right now at Sydney Center.

752
00:41:48,985 --> 00:41:51,696
You have 45
minutes allotted for it.

753
00:41:52,873 --> 00:41:55,375
And your time, now.

754
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,961
Today is a good day.

755
00:41:57,961 --> 00:41:58,545
Come in.

756
00:41:58,545 --> 00:42:01,339
So, anytime soon we're
gonna get the answers, okay?

757
00:42:01,715 --> 00:42:04,169
At this point, they should
be done with the exam.

758
00:42:11,183 --> 00:42:11,725
D.

759
00:42:11,725 --> 00:42:12,492
B.

760
00:42:12,517 --> 00:42:13,118
A.

761
00:42:13,143 --> 00:42:13,886
A.

762
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,473
There was a slight delay.

763
00:42:18,148 --> 00:42:19,816
It's almost done.

764
00:42:19,816 --> 00:42:20,834
Always a delay!

765
00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:21,793
Promise!

766
00:42:21,818 --> 00:42:24,905
You're definitely getting into
some serious trouble here.
