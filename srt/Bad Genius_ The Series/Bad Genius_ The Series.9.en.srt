1
00:00:42,754 --> 00:00:44,881
May I have your attention, please?

2
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:47,534
You have 45 minutes allotted for it.

3
00:00:48,535 --> 00:00:49,619
And your time...

4
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,699
Now!

5
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,326
Good morning!

6
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,394
Today is a good day.

7
00:00:57,419 --> 00:00:58,145
Come in!

8
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,838
As of now, I just got the update.

9
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,933
They just finished their first section.

10
00:01:02,174 --> 00:01:04,777
So, anytime soon, we're
gonna get the answers, okay?

11
00:01:06,686 --> 00:01:07,812
Lin already messaged.

12
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:08,823
A.

13
00:01:08,848 --> 00:01:09,848
A.

14
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:10,682
B.

15
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:11,158
B.

16
00:01:11,183 --> 00:01:11,783
A.

17
00:01:11,808 --> 00:01:12,200
A.

18
00:01:12,225 --> 00:01:12,726
C.

19
00:01:12,726 --> 00:01:13,618
[Additional 500k if you want
me to send the answers.]

20
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:15,090
What am I? Stupid?!

21
00:01:15,115 --> 00:01:17,080
I should've just had him beaten
up when he was at the shop!

22
00:01:17,105 --> 00:01:18,190
That son of a bitch!

23
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:19,191
He's a greedy bastard!

24
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:20,216
Fuck him!

25
00:01:20,653 --> 00:01:22,029
Pat, just stop!

26
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,256
What now?

27
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:27,716
We're gonna be late!

28
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:28,742
Sorry, excuse us.

29
00:01:28,742 --> 00:01:29,576
Is there a problem?

30
00:01:29,576 --> 00:01:32,746
I'm sorry to disrupt your break time.

31
00:01:33,138 --> 00:01:37,893
However, it has come to my
attention that there was some

32
00:01:37,918 --> 00:01:41,755
troublesome misconduct
that you should all be aware of.

33
00:01:50,514 --> 00:01:51,515
So,

34
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:53,809
here we are.

35
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:57,521
Just you and me, Mr. Bangkat.

36
00:01:59,122 --> 00:02:01,875
Perhaps now, you could explain how come

37
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,486
there are two cellphones on the table.

38
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:06,987
No?

39
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:08,418
Let me help you a little.

40
00:02:10,122 --> 00:02:12,082
The cellphone on the right

41
00:02:12,402 --> 00:02:15,279
is the one that you
gave us during entrance.

42
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:17,778
The cellphone on the left

43
00:02:17,803 --> 00:02:21,264
is the one that we found
in the men's restroom.

44
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:23,921
Which

45
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:26,466
you confessed to all.

46
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:30,595
So, if you would now
kindly explain the situation,

47
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:32,681
it would save us all a lot of time.

48
00:02:35,915 --> 00:02:38,084
Do you have any idea

49
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:41,773
of the risks involved
in what you're doing?

50
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,565
Mister, you're not answering
my questions once again.

51
00:02:48,363 --> 00:02:49,573
Just tell me one thing.

52
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:53,615
What were you intending
to do with this cellphone?

53
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Just that.

54
00:02:58,458 --> 00:02:59,458
Perhaps,

55
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:01,631
I should call your
mother in the Philippines

56
00:03:02,546 --> 00:03:08,176
and tell her that her son is
involved in a cheating scheme.

57
00:03:09,224 --> 00:03:11,101
I'll tell your mother

58
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,514
that her son is a cheat.

59
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,059
How would you like that, Mr. Bangkat?

60
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:20,562
Don't test my patience,

61
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:21,979
boy!

62
00:03:24,024 --> 00:03:26,860
I could call now the Philippine government

63
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,833
How about that?

64
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,088
And tell them all about this.

65
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:34,583
That would have nasty
consequences for you.

66
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:35,969
Or,

67
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,538
we could be a little more benevolent.

68
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:42,167
If you just gave me the
names of your accomplices

69
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:43,200
in this scheme,

70
00:03:43,793 --> 00:03:47,005
how about that, Mr. Bangkat?

71
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,310
Ms. Linette Estrella, is it?

72
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,334
Did I get that right?

73
00:05:27,188 --> 00:05:27,981
Never mind.

74
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:28,981
Yeah?

75
00:05:29,149 --> 00:05:32,027
Now, it's you and me here, alone.

76
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,839
Perhaps,

77
00:05:34,785 --> 00:05:36,370
you could speak freely now.

78
00:05:37,594 --> 00:05:38,720
Will you cooperate?

79
00:05:43,163 --> 00:05:44,289
Yes, I'll try.

80
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:45,477
You'll try?

81
00:05:45,748 --> 00:05:48,042
Well, that's all we can ask, right?

82
00:05:49,002 --> 00:05:51,755
You did not come here alone, did you?

83
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:56,301
There's that other
participant, Tristan Bangkat,

84
00:05:57,015 --> 00:05:58,308
from the Philippines.

85
00:05:58,739 --> 00:05:59,836
You know him, right?

86
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:03,515
I don't.

87
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,076
I don't know that.

88
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,436
I don't know what you're talking about.

89
00:06:07,457 --> 00:06:08,547
I don't know him.

90
00:06:08,855 --> 00:06:09,977
You don't know him.

91
00:06:10,844 --> 00:06:12,242
Now, that's funny.

92
00:06:13,068 --> 00:06:16,738
Because your papers indicate
you're both from the same school,

93
00:06:17,353 --> 00:06:19,305
Colegio St. Gabriel,

94
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:20,631
Possenti?

95
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:24,120
What if I called the principal over there?

96
00:06:24,435 --> 00:06:27,188
What would they say about
what's happening here?

97
00:06:32,504 --> 00:06:35,507
Yes, we go to the same
school, but he's not my friend.

98
00:06:36,224 --> 00:06:37,224
Hmm.

99
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:38,581
There you go.

100
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:42,503
There’s an STIC
center in the Philippines.

101
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:44,699
You could have taken the exam there.

102
00:06:44,724 --> 00:06:46,476
You still chose to take it over here.

103
00:06:47,393 --> 00:06:48,393
How come?

104
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,313
My mom lives here.

105
00:06:51,523 --> 00:06:52,290
Your mom?

106
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:52,999
Ye—

107
00:06:53,024 --> 00:06:54,442
Yes, I came to visit her.

108
00:06:54,749 --> 00:06:56,251
Your mom lives here.

109
00:06:57,112 --> 00:06:58,133
Right.

110
00:07:00,532 --> 00:07:01,532
Prove it.

111
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:07,579
Call her.

112
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:55,545
Ms. Wynona Robinson.

113
00:07:55,962 --> 00:07:57,297
From Bathurst, is it?

114
00:07:58,006 --> 00:08:01,217
Well, we do have a center
to take exams near Bathurst.

115
00:08:02,348 --> 00:08:05,518
Why do you think your daughter
chose this center to take it?

116
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,204
It's my daughter's first time in Sydney.

117
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:10,976
She wanted to stay in the city center.

118
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:14,938
I see.

119
00:08:16,149 --> 00:08:18,026
Still, we have an issue here.

120
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:20,951
I do believe that your
daughter was cheating.

121
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:22,864
That's impossible.

122
00:08:23,114 --> 00:08:25,742
Lin is the top student in her class.

123
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:27,830
She won't have any reason to cheat.

124
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:31,427
Well, smart kids
follow rules, don't they?

125
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:33,460
Smart kids

126
00:08:33,882 --> 00:08:36,718
don't run and hide when they're caught.

127
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,420
Yet,

128
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:44,831
Lin ran and locked
herself up in the bathroom.

129
00:08:46,179 --> 00:08:47,472
My apologies.

130
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,433
She's always been a nervous child.

131
00:08:52,268 --> 00:08:53,268
But,

132
00:08:53,443 --> 00:08:55,062
was that her only offense?

133
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:56,626
I'm afraid so.

134
00:08:57,891 --> 00:08:59,559
Then why are you still detaining her?

135
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:01,842
Fair enough.

136
00:09:02,935 --> 00:09:05,429
No need to escalate the matter nor

137
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:07,622
alert the authorities.

138
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:09,763
Still,

139
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:11,511
she did break the rules.

140
00:09:12,914 --> 00:09:14,541
She left the exam room

141
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,108
before it was time and without permission.

142
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,133
Therefore,

143
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,393
we need to disqualify her.

144
00:09:26,094 --> 00:09:27,220
We understand.

145
00:09:28,888 --> 00:09:29,889
Very well, then.

146
00:09:52,117 --> 00:09:53,744
I have no excuse, Mom.

147
00:09:55,456 --> 00:09:57,417
I lied to you and Dad.

148
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:00,342
I'm so sorry, Mom.

149
00:10:01,548 --> 00:10:05,135
And I'm ready to accept whatever
consequences that seem fit.

150
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,136
I'll accept it.

151
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:09,919
I don't wanna punish you, Lin.

152
00:10:10,953 --> 00:10:13,080
I just wanna know why you did this.

153
00:10:14,684 --> 00:10:17,395
And why didn’t you tell
me you were coming here?

154
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,177
Lin, what's happening to you?

155
00:10:22,275 --> 00:10:23,276
You can talk to me.

156
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:30,116
Who am I kidding?

157
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,536
You don't even talk to
your dad, let alone me.

158
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,335
But I'm still your mom.

159
00:10:41,836 --> 00:10:44,130
I can't help but be bothered
by what’s happening to you.

160
00:10:45,757 --> 00:10:47,717
And no matter what you’ve done,

161
00:10:48,325 --> 00:10:50,160
I'm always on your side, Lin.

162
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,328
Always on my side?

163
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,021
How are you on my side
when you're so far away, Mom?

164
00:11:06,027 --> 00:11:07,028
I'm sorry.

165
00:11:08,863 --> 00:11:09,864
I'm sorry.

166
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:17,622
Don't be sorry.

167
00:11:18,956 --> 00:11:20,333
I guess I deserve it.

168
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,421
I'm also to blame for why
things turned out this way.

169
00:11:27,256 --> 00:11:29,133
I'm the only one at fault here, Mom.

170
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,760
You don't have to take my side.

171
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:32,678
You have no involvement in this.

172
00:11:33,429 --> 00:11:34,429
It's all me.

173
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:38,261
And I'm sorry that I disappointed you.

174
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:41,938
It shouldn’t have gotten this far.

175
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,860
Lin,

176
00:11:49,704 --> 00:11:50,704
please.

177
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,122
Don't treat me like a stranger.

178
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:59,372
I waited so long for us
to see each other again.

179
00:12:06,337 --> 00:12:07,839
It’s so hard because,

180
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,510
all this time, you thought...

181
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:16,639
it was easy for me to
leave you all behind.

182
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:20,643
It’s not that easy to
leave the ones you love.

183
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:24,272
But sometimes,
I really have no choice...

184
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,124
you want to help them but...

185
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,960
they also need to help themselves.

186
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:42,081
You won't understand that
because you're still young.

187
00:12:45,376 --> 00:12:47,336
I understand that feeling.

188
00:12:48,226 --> 00:12:49,233
That...

189
00:12:49,672 --> 00:12:52,675
helpless feeling when you can’t help
the people who are important to you.

190
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:57,180
But we always have a choice.

191
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:01,746
You're right.

192
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:04,896
And your dad had a choice.

193
00:13:06,722 --> 00:13:09,600
He could've followed me here,

194
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,152
and then,

195
00:13:12,695 --> 00:13:14,113
we could’ve lived here.

196
00:13:14,614 --> 00:13:16,157
Lin, I was earning more.

197
00:13:16,157 --> 00:13:17,575
I had a good job here.

198
00:13:17,825 --> 00:13:19,118
But he refused.

199
00:13:19,827 --> 00:13:21,871
He didn't even give it a chance.

200
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,123
All I know is,

201
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,709
Dad was waiting for you.

202
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:30,087
But you married someone else.

203
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,216
He was hurt, Mom.

204
00:13:36,802 --> 00:13:38,346
That’s where I went wrong.

205
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,599
I let myself fall in love.

206
00:13:42,892 --> 00:13:44,852
I cheated on your Dad.

207
00:13:48,356 --> 00:13:49,607
You know,

208
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:53,861
Vin and I were together
when we were young.

209
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:57,490
Even if I loved him so much,

210
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,494
I didn’t really know myself back then.

211
00:14:03,037 --> 00:14:05,206
We weren’t meant for each other.

212
00:14:08,626 --> 00:14:09,752
But with Greg,

213
00:14:11,212 --> 00:14:12,463
It was different.

214
00:14:13,798 --> 00:14:15,591
He’s easy to love.

215
00:14:16,008 --> 00:14:18,010
We understand each other.

216
00:14:20,471 --> 00:14:22,223
But I never regretted being with Vin.

217
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:27,645
Because— We had you.

218
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,066
Lin, whatever happened
between me and your Dad,

219
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,611
it has nothing to do
with my love for you.

220
00:14:41,617 --> 00:14:42,617
I know it's

221
00:14:43,744 --> 00:14:46,747
a little too late for us to be close.

222
00:14:49,901 --> 00:14:51,945
I just hope you can forgive me.

223
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:55,423
I forgave you, Mom.

224
00:14:57,408 --> 00:14:58,408
A long time ago.

225
00:15:01,092 --> 00:15:03,220
It’s over, I’ve moved on.

226
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,745
We’re okay now.

227
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:09,854
But maybe,

228
00:15:11,063 --> 00:15:12,064
sometimes,

229
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:15,985
I miss you too.

230
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:20,118
Actually, no, Mom.

231
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,171
I miss you always.

232
00:15:23,784 --> 00:15:27,997
I miss the feeling of having
a mom with me at home.

233
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:31,050
Someone I can just joke around with.

234
00:15:32,154 --> 00:15:33,823
Someone I can talk to.

235
00:15:33,848 --> 00:15:36,058
Someone I can hug.

236
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,681
I missed that, Mom.

237
00:15:43,012 --> 00:15:44,764
I’m sorry for everything, Lin.

238
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:45,988
Sorry.

239
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,174
I love you so much.

240
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,062
I love you too, Mom.

241
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:53,397
I’m so sorry, Mom.

242
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,958
I’m so sorry, Mom.

243
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,675
Is this them?

244
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,376
Your new family?

245
00:16:46,585 --> 00:16:47,585
See that?

246
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:49,916
That’s you.

247
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,263
You’re part of the family.

248
00:16:55,929 --> 00:16:57,973
You know, Carson...

249
00:16:57,998 --> 00:16:59,500
when we talk...

250
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,021
he always thinks you’re just a baby

251
00:17:03,046 --> 00:17:05,402
because that’s what
you look like in the picture.

252
00:17:05,427 --> 00:17:07,846
That’s why he calls you baby sister.

253
00:17:10,931 --> 00:17:13,621
I'm glad he already knows me.

254
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,195
Even if it’s just through
your stories or your photo.

255
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,025
But Mom.

256
00:17:29,493 --> 00:17:31,746
Thanks for saving me earlier.

257
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,164
Sorry.

258
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:42,018
Greg and I already talked
actually, last week

259
00:17:42,043 --> 00:17:43,670
after we spoke on the phone.

260
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:47,425
You can live with us if you’ll study here.

261
00:17:50,055 --> 00:17:52,725
And you won’t need that STIC anymore

262
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:54,143
because you’ll already be a resident,

263
00:17:54,143 --> 00:17:55,144
if you’ll live here.

264
00:17:56,661 --> 00:17:57,661
Or

265
00:17:59,356 --> 00:18:01,066
you don’t even have to

266
00:18:01,091 --> 00:18:03,718
wait for your suspension to be lifted.

267
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:05,390
Or,

268
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:07,453
you can wait ‘til you’re 18

269
00:18:07,507 --> 00:18:09,910
so you’re no longer
under your father’s custody.

270
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:11,410
You won’t be a minor,

271
00:18:12,098 --> 00:18:13,599
and you can decide on your own.

272
00:18:18,688 --> 00:18:19,688
Thank you, Mom.

273
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:22,218
That means a lot.

274
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:25,256
But,

275
00:18:26,915 --> 00:18:28,375
Lin, I’m not rushing you.

276
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,653
Think everything through first.

277
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,728
Okay?

278
00:18:31,753 --> 00:18:33,046
But talk to your Dad.

279
00:18:34,688 --> 00:18:37,065
Whatever it is you decide.

280
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,091
I’ll support you.

281
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:42,024
Just know you have
the option to study here,

282
00:18:42,295 --> 00:18:43,605
even without a scholarship.

283
00:18:44,407 --> 00:18:45,407
Alright?

284
00:18:48,372 --> 00:18:49,748
Thank you for being here.

285
00:18:50,066 --> 00:18:51,066
Sorry.

286
00:18:56,205 --> 00:18:59,605
You see, it's all about
hard work and honesty.

287
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:03,761
If you put in the hours,
you will reap the rewards.

288
00:19:03,786 --> 00:19:06,247
And that's why we're
giving back to the community

289
00:19:06,506 --> 00:19:09,318
full scholarships for
underprivileged youth.

290
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:12,488
Now, that is a legacy I
would love to leave behind.

291
00:19:12,513 --> 00:19:14,307
Oh, speaking of legacy, sir,

292
00:19:15,189 --> 00:19:16,441
Your only son, Patrick,

293
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,815
is he ready to be a part
of the Tioseco Empire?

294
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,853
He's got big shoes to fill.

295
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:24,037
Well, Patrick will learn.

296
00:19:24,062 --> 00:19:25,814
And he's learning everything fast.

297
00:19:25,885 --> 00:19:28,555
In fact, he's already made
plans of his own, right, son?

298
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:30,446
Uh, yeah.

299
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:32,488
I'm going to study business in Boston.

300
00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:35,119
My dad's a BU graduate, so

301
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,564
I guess I'm following his footsteps.

302
00:19:38,622 --> 00:19:42,418
Your father tells me that you
almost got a perfect score at the STIC.

303
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:46,052
So do you have any advice
to inspire other students?

304
00:19:46,425 --> 00:19:48,105
I guess you just gotta put in the work

305
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,665
and do whatever it
takes to make it to the top.

306
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:54,263
You must be very proud of Pat...

307
00:19:54,263 --> 00:19:55,447
Oh, yeah.

308
00:19:55,472 --> 00:19:56,891
I'm very, very proud of him.

309
00:20:22,697 --> 00:20:24,207
Yo, what happened in Sydney?

310
00:20:24,752 --> 00:20:26,253
I heard shit went down, bro.

311
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:29,715
I got caught but I didn’t get jailed.

312
00:20:32,009 --> 00:20:33,009
Damn.

313
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:36,055
Well, tell me more.

314
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:39,777
We have nothing left to talk about.

315
00:20:42,645 --> 00:20:43,645
Bet.

316
00:20:44,469 --> 00:20:45,554
That's 500k.

317
00:20:48,502 --> 00:20:49,502
We’re even now.

318
00:20:54,073 --> 00:20:55,073
We’re even now.

319
00:21:08,712 --> 00:21:10,589
The STIC results are in.

320
00:21:11,632 --> 00:21:13,801
Yup, she's in the top percentile.

321
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:15,945
Ah, of course.

322
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,221
This is our Grace.

323
00:21:18,555 --> 00:21:19,310
Thank you.

324
00:21:19,335 --> 00:21:20,169
Thank you so much.

325
00:21:20,194 --> 00:21:21,946
Hey, see you all December, alright?

326
00:21:23,519 --> 00:21:24,687
Okay, bye-bye, auntie.

327
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:26,172
Thank you again.

328
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:27,197
Bye.

329
00:21:29,322 --> 00:21:30,740
Ah, Grace.

330
00:21:31,672 --> 00:21:33,341
We're very proud of you.

331
00:21:33,366 --> 00:21:34,367
All of us.

332
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,255
Good job, dear.

333
00:21:36,573 --> 00:21:37,616
Okay, keep it up.

334
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:39,270
Thanks, Dad.

335
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:41,578
It was nothing.

336
00:21:42,021 --> 00:21:43,021
Really.

337
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:52,881
Um, Dad?

338
00:21:52,918 --> 00:21:53,918
Yup?

339
00:21:55,876 --> 00:21:57,294
Pat and I have been thinking.

340
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:01,848
Okay.

341
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,620
So,

342
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,239
he's studying in Boston University, and

343
00:22:06,485 --> 00:22:08,779
I was wondering if

344
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:11,734
I could study there too?

345
00:22:12,174 --> 00:22:14,843
I heard that they have a
really good drama program.

346
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:16,179
Wait a minute.

347
00:22:17,153 --> 00:22:18,238
Whose idea is this?

348
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:22,943
Grace, that's a very major commitment.

349
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:25,931
You're still a baby.

350
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:27,583
Even Pat's a baby.

351
00:22:27,942 --> 00:22:28,942
Alright?

352
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:32,092
You're both too young.

353
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:34,911
Are you really ready for this?

354
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,264
Dad,

355
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,757
Pat and I want to do this together.

356
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:40,428
And

357
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:41,847
it's in the U.S., and I grew up there.

358
00:22:41,847 --> 00:22:43,583
So, this feels like a homecoming for me.

359
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:44,825
You know? And,

360
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,310
even though Mom's gone,

361
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:49,313
I won't be alone because Pat's there.

362
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:50,980
Grace,

363
00:22:51,771 --> 00:22:52,771
you know,

364
00:22:54,115 --> 00:22:55,130
your mom and I,

365
00:22:56,132 --> 00:22:57,550
we were like just you guys.

366
00:22:58,864 --> 00:23:03,147
We thought anything the world
can throw at us, we could handle.

367
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:06,734
But when we went there,

368
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:11,110
life wasn’t that easy.

369
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:15,391
We're two different persons.

370
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:17,222
And eventually,

371
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:20,378
we separated.

372
00:23:27,661 --> 00:23:28,380
Okay?

373
00:23:28,405 --> 00:23:29,302
Yeah.

374
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:31,562
I understand.

375
00:23:32,145 --> 00:23:33,145
Thanks.

376
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,555
I'm just saying,

377
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:39,310
don't rush it.

378
00:23:41,021 --> 00:23:42,107
Don't rush

379
00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:44,746
until you’re both ready.

380
00:23:58,794 --> 00:23:59,359
Lin.

381
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:00,384
Ah, Dad!

382
00:24:00,712 --> 00:24:01,739
You're still awake?

383
00:24:02,106 --> 00:24:03,816
I just brought up your laundry.

384
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:06,549
Thank you, Dad.

385
00:24:07,683 --> 00:24:10,185
Ah, also a gift.

386
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:12,938
From Mom.

387
00:24:19,069 --> 00:24:20,863
Hey, thanks.

388
00:24:21,989 --> 00:24:24,324
I spoke with Nona, she said

389
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,702
you already have plans.

390
00:24:28,579 --> 00:24:31,373
You're going to Australia,
and you'll study there.

391
00:24:34,793 --> 00:24:35,919
That’s fine.

392
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:40,465
You need to think of your future.

393
00:24:43,468 --> 00:24:45,429
It’s just that, for me, I wish...

394
00:24:46,763 --> 00:24:47,973
I wish you had told me.

395
00:24:47,973 --> 00:24:51,393
I just don't like the feeling that
something’s being kept from me.

396
00:24:54,646 --> 00:24:57,816
I don’t want to make decisions
without talking to you, Dad.

397
00:24:59,313 --> 00:25:00,313
But,

398
00:25:00,652 --> 00:25:02,321
I've thought this through.

399
00:25:04,114 --> 00:25:06,200
I might not get another scholarship.

400
00:25:07,201 --> 00:25:09,620
This might be my only
chance to study abroad.

401
00:25:09,828 --> 00:25:10,829
I know that.

402
00:25:11,622 --> 00:25:13,081
I understand.

403
00:25:14,708 --> 00:25:15,876
We can’t avoid this.

404
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:21,017
You’ll do it, and you need it, and,

405
00:25:21,423 --> 00:25:23,425
I just need this for myself.

406
00:25:25,469 --> 00:25:28,388
So don’t mind my drama.

407
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,752
This isn’t real.

408
00:25:31,391 --> 00:25:33,185
I’m not leaving yet.

409
00:25:33,563 --> 00:25:35,273
Even if it’s my dream to study abroad,

410
00:25:36,855 --> 00:25:39,191
it’s so hard for me to leave you here.

411
00:25:41,443 --> 00:25:42,486
Don’t make me cry.

412
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:44,321
Of course I’m hard to leave.

413
00:25:44,321 --> 00:25:45,260
This handsome face?

414
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:46,635
You’ll miss this.

415
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:48,158
Okay.

416
00:25:48,158 --> 00:25:49,201
Oh, you win!

417
00:25:49,201 --> 00:25:51,036
Yeah, but let’s not talk about it anymore.

418
00:25:51,036 --> 00:25:52,554
Go rest now, that’s enough.

419
00:25:52,579 --> 00:25:53,597
Go on.

420
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:54,765
Go on.

421
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,458
Good night, Dad. I love you.

422
00:25:56,458 --> 00:25:57,334
Love you, Lin-Lin.

423
00:25:57,334 --> 00:25:58,213
Good night.

424
00:25:58,238 --> 00:25:59,948
Hope you share the gift too!

425
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:01,063
I’m heading out.

426
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,105
The handsome guy’s leaving.

427
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:02,923
Bye-bye.

428
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:04,091
Bye, Dad. Good night.

429
00:26:11,807 --> 00:26:15,102
[Come get your share, sis. We miss you!]

430
00:26:20,355 --> 00:26:23,996
[I can’t take the money
anymore. Sorry, I’m out.]

431
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:31,865
Students, attention please.

432
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:34,329
As you know,

433
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,582
the National College Entrance Test

434
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,210
is upon us.

435
00:26:41,677 --> 00:26:43,944
Every Filipino student

436
00:26:44,921 --> 00:26:47,924
on their senior year is expected

437
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:50,218
to take the NCET.

438
00:26:50,684 --> 00:26:53,437
The NCET test results will determine

439
00:26:53,462 --> 00:26:55,714
which university you get into.

440
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:57,949
The higher the score,

441
00:26:58,415 --> 00:27:01,335
the more likely the acceptance letter.

442
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:03,582
So, I highly suggest

443
00:27:04,031 --> 00:27:05,265
that you study

444
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:09,465
like your life depends on it.

445
00:27:16,121 --> 00:27:16,872
Good afternoon.

446
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:17,664
Oh, no need.

447
00:27:17,664 --> 00:27:19,666
Please remain seated, Mrs. Bangkat.

448
00:27:19,691 --> 00:27:21,401
- Oh, thank you.
- I hope I did not keep you waiting.

449
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,585
Tristan.

450
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:24,647
It’s no problem.

451
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:26,965
We were just looking over the NCET.

452
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:28,437
I came across this.

453
00:27:28,784 --> 00:27:29,994
They returned it.

454
00:27:30,323 --> 00:27:31,028
Oh my.

455
00:27:31,053 --> 00:27:31,636
Tristan,

456
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:34,264
you need to prepare for this exam.

457
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:38,372
Mrs. Bangkat, didn’t Tristan tell you

458
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:40,607
why I asked you to come here?

459
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:42,913
Tristan,

460
00:27:43,023 --> 00:27:44,296
did you not tell your mom?

461
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:51,846
Mrs. Bangkat, I don't
know how else to say this.

462
00:27:52,824 --> 00:27:54,468
So, I'll go straight to the point.

463
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:56,249
I'm very disappointed, Tristan,

464
00:27:56,356 --> 00:27:57,691
for your mother to find out

465
00:27:57,716 --> 00:27:59,426
this way and that
you've been lying to her.

466
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:03,518
Bank, why?

467
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:04,711
What did you do?

468
00:28:04,711 --> 00:28:05,718
What happened?

469
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,806
Our school was contacted by the STIC,

470
00:28:16,556 --> 00:28:18,600
Testing Center in Sydney, Australia.

471
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,352
Tristan went there.

472
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:24,189
Basically, he was caught cheating.

473
00:28:24,648 --> 00:28:25,816
He took the exam

474
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:28,110
but he snuck in a cellphone

475
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,404
into the restroom to use the calculator

476
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,614
to answer the said exam.

477
00:28:33,824 --> 00:28:35,367
Your son admitted this.

478
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,786
Australia?

479
00:28:38,829 --> 00:28:40,288
How could that happen?

480
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:43,097
We already spent all our
money on hospital bills.

481
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:47,629
I couldn’t afford to send my son abroad.

482
00:28:47,654 --> 00:28:50,324
This came straight from the STIC office.

483
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,550
I'm sorry to disappoint you, ma'am, but

484
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:56,525
this is the proof.

485
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,717
Just a moment, ma'am.

486
00:29:04,875 --> 00:29:06,502
I know my son.

487
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,331
Even with the hardest
math problems you give him,

488
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:13,534
he can calculate them in his head.

489
00:29:14,072 --> 00:29:16,366
Why would he use a calculator?

490
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:17,371
I know, ma'am,

491
00:29:17,862 --> 00:29:21,616
I'm also wondering why
he would need a calculator,

492
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:28,144
why he would sneak in a
cellphone into the bathroom.

493
00:29:36,315 --> 00:29:39,610
Ah, we arrived with the STIC officials

494
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,688
with a mutual decision.

495
00:29:42,154 --> 00:29:43,989
to take this matter privately.

496
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:48,802
But, Colegio de San Gabriel
Possenti does not condone cheating

497
00:29:49,858 --> 00:29:51,026
in any form.

498
00:29:51,641 --> 00:29:55,561
Ma'am, we aren’t even
sure yet that this is cheating.

499
00:29:56,406 --> 00:29:57,908
I know my son.

500
00:29:58,158 --> 00:29:59,784
He’s not a cheater.

501
00:30:00,744 --> 00:30:01,629
- Mom.
- Please.

502
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,777
No, wait.

503
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:03,863
Don’t.

504
00:30:04,206 --> 00:30:05,499
Let me handle this.

505
00:30:06,194 --> 00:30:07,058
You know,

506
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:10,086
this has never happened
in the history of our school

507
00:30:10,504 --> 00:30:11,546
of Possenti.

508
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,880
Tristan.

509
00:30:13,548 --> 00:30:15,133
Never in the history

510
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:17,792
of our school has this ever happened.

511
00:30:19,429 --> 00:30:20,639
Will I be suspended, ma'am?

512
00:30:20,639 --> 00:30:21,781
Suspended?

513
00:30:21,806 --> 00:30:22,699
No.

514
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:24,559
Ma'am, just a moment.

515
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,566
I’m begging you.

516
00:30:27,669 --> 00:30:29,410
If my son has done something wrong,

517
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:31,162
I’ll talk to him.

518
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,277
But can we please discuss this first

519
00:30:34,277 --> 00:30:36,655
before you make a decision?

520
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,807
Ma'am, my hands are
really tied up. Sorry.

521
00:30:39,545 --> 00:30:42,256
If I donated a new computer

522
00:30:42,634 --> 00:30:45,178
or sponsored a new building,

523
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:48,669
would you still talk to us this way?

524
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:50,738
If I had millions,

525
00:30:51,002 --> 00:30:53,527
would you treat my son like this?

526
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,715
- I beg your pardon?
- Ma'am.

527
00:30:56,005 --> 00:30:57,673
We’re not wealthy.

528
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:02,714
The only thing I can pass down to my son

529
00:31:02,847 --> 00:31:05,267
is a good education.

530
00:31:08,864 --> 00:31:10,616
Please give us

531
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:13,848
a fair chance.

532
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:20,198
Whatever it is that my son did, I’m sure

533
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:23,041
he had a good reason.

534
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,062
My son is a good student.

535
00:31:32,166 --> 00:31:34,752
He’s not a cheater.

536
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,371
Mom, that’s enough.

537
00:31:36,537 --> 00:31:37,537
Bank!

538
00:31:38,153 --> 00:31:40,405
Son, fight for yourself.

539
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:42,266
Explain.

540
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:44,347
Speak up.

541
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,917
Nice glow up.

542
00:32:14,502 --> 00:32:15,527
Thanks, Lin.

543
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,610
But there’s still a lot that needs fixing.

544
00:32:18,212 --> 00:32:20,574
That’s still going to be added
with two more washing machines.

545
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:22,844
At least, we’re slowly recovering.

546
00:32:23,692 --> 00:32:24,692
You,

547
00:32:25,347 --> 00:32:26,347
how are you?

548
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:27,616
Well,

549
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:29,476
I have a new part-time job.

550
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:30,863
Music lessons.

551
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:32,257
Just home-based.

552
00:32:32,282 --> 00:32:33,325
Just saving a bit.

553
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,207
Saving?

554
00:32:36,232 --> 00:32:36,983
What happened to the—

555
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:38,360
I didn’t take the money.

556
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,630
I felt

557
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:47,369
guilty about it.

558
00:32:48,737 --> 00:32:50,864
Especially after everything
you went through.

559
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:55,085
Mr. Clark said your
scores were disqualified.

560
00:32:57,229 --> 00:32:58,229
And

561
00:32:58,254 --> 00:33:00,423
we didn’t talk anymore after that.

562
00:33:02,556 --> 00:33:04,349
I don’t want to talk about it anymore.

563
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,000
People have moved on.

564
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:08,321
And I’m fine now.

565
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:11,059
The million was worth it anyway.

566
00:33:12,394 --> 00:33:14,229
And I could never be as good as you.

567
00:33:15,438 --> 00:33:18,316
Conscience can't buy this renovation.

568
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:20,902
Bank, come on.

569
00:33:22,237 --> 00:33:25,031
I didn’t come here to fight with you.

570
00:33:25,532 --> 00:33:27,367
We’re in different situations.

571
00:33:28,618 --> 00:33:29,869
Just kidding, Lin.

572
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,913
You’re too serious.

573
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:33,858
Alright, fine.

574
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:36,253
But serious mode for real.

575
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,838
Actually, I’m here to say goodbye.

576
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:41,436
Goodbye?

577
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:43,537
Why? Where are you going?

578
00:33:44,342 --> 00:33:45,342
Australia.

579
00:33:46,569 --> 00:33:48,863
I’m going to study there with Mom.

580
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:55,561
Wow.

581
00:33:57,159 --> 00:33:58,398
That’s great, Lin.

582
00:33:59,649 --> 00:34:00,649
Congrats.

583
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,545
I’m happy for you.

584
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,739
You’ve been manifesting
that for a while, right?

585
00:34:07,574 --> 00:34:08,605
You deserve it.

586
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:09,950
You’re really lucky.

587
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:11,418
Thanks, Bank.

588
00:34:12,234 --> 00:34:13,277
I’ll miss you.

589
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:24,254
But congratulations, okay?

590
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:26,592
Thanks.

591
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,388
Nice glow up.

592
00:34:33,057 --> 00:34:34,184
Really beautiful.

593
00:34:43,812 --> 00:34:44,669
Patrick,

594
00:34:44,694 --> 00:34:47,363
it's rude to be on your
phone while we’re eating.

595
00:34:47,363 --> 00:34:48,782
Just finish your food.

596
00:34:50,754 --> 00:34:51,754
Sorry, Dad.

597
00:34:52,425 --> 00:34:53,995
Breaking news.

598
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:56,950
Massive cheating in the Standardized Test

599
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:59,686
for Intellectual Capacity
is under investigation.

600
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:01,967
Wait.

601
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,403
Put that back on.

602
00:35:03,428 --> 00:35:04,503
I wanna hear the rest of that.

603
00:35:05,215 --> 00:35:06,215
Come on.

604
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:16,770
This bombshell came from a
mysterious dummy account.

605
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:21,110
They said the answers were hidden
in barcodes attached to the pencils.

606
00:35:24,901 --> 00:35:26,111
What a bunch of idiots.

607
00:35:27,893 --> 00:35:30,354
How hard is it to just study?

608
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,845
All money, no brains.

609
00:35:38,615 --> 00:35:39,615
Yeah, Dad.

610
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:41,750
It’s a hassle.

611
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:44,157
Well, you have no choice.

612
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:47,762
You need to reapply for the
next round of examinations.

613
00:35:48,842 --> 00:35:51,302
The deadline for Boston
University is still far away.

614
00:35:51,302 --> 00:35:52,971
You can still make it.

615
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:57,892
Yes, Uncle.

616
00:36:03,243 --> 00:36:06,413
The STIC officials were left cluless

617
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:08,565
that cheating happened in the exam room.

618
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:11,406
The universities declared

619
00:36:11,656 --> 00:36:16,870
that all STIC results from this
round are automatically invalid.

620
00:36:17,296 --> 00:36:20,828
The Education Commission
continues to investigate the

621
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:23,703
cheating scandal and those involved.

622
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:39,632
Hey, Pat.

623
00:36:46,049 --> 00:36:47,843
Whoa, look at that.

624
00:36:53,198 --> 00:36:54,991
So, have you sent in the application?

625
00:36:58,202 --> 00:36:59,202
I'm about to, Dad.

626
00:37:00,365 --> 00:37:01,365
What are you waiting for?

627
00:37:01,406 --> 00:37:02,344
You're good to go.

628
00:37:02,369 --> 00:37:03,369
Just do it.

629
00:37:08,338 --> 00:37:09,338
Dad,

630
00:37:09,964 --> 00:37:11,758
I need to talk to you about something.

631
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:17,221
It's about the STIC.

632
00:37:17,758 --> 00:37:18,885
What's there to talk about?

633
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:20,183
You'll just have to submit it.

634
00:37:20,183 --> 00:37:21,768
Something so simple.

635
00:37:30,372 --> 00:37:31,372
Dad, I cheated.

636
00:37:37,489 --> 00:37:38,489
What did you say?

637
00:37:40,348 --> 00:37:41,808
Did you say, cheated?

638
00:37:42,711 --> 00:37:44,087
I've always been cheating.

639
00:37:44,624 --> 00:37:46,209
The STIC results,

640
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:47,524
my good grades,

641
00:37:48,826 --> 00:37:50,077
none of that was me.

642
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:53,075
I've been paying someone
to give me the answers.

643
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,181
What you saw on the news,

644
00:37:56,803 --> 00:37:58,012
I was part of that.

645
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:01,954
This is some kind of joke, right?

646
00:38:02,892 --> 00:38:04,894
What nonsense is this, Patrick?

647
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:07,522
Dad, I'm sorry.

648
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:11,198
But haven’t you ever wondered?

649
00:38:11,899 --> 00:38:14,902
You've never even seen me study
and suddenly my grades shot up.

650
00:38:19,283 --> 00:38:20,660
I can't believe this.

651
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,246
You're an embarrassment.

652
00:38:23,246 --> 00:38:25,039
You were so arrogant in that interview.

653
00:38:25,284 --> 00:38:26,297
My god,

654
00:38:27,078 --> 00:38:29,455
I gave you everything you needed,

655
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:34,068
I gave in to all your luxuries
and this is what I get in return?

656
00:38:39,325 --> 00:38:40,625
Dad, I'm trying my best.

657
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,156
But honestly, I don't want to go to BU.

658
00:38:47,442 --> 00:38:49,736
I'm struggling with your expectations.

659
00:38:51,169 --> 00:38:52,169
I could—

660
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,900
I could never be like you.

661
00:38:57,218 --> 00:38:58,218
No,

662
00:38:59,052 --> 00:39:01,012
but you are a Tioseco.

663
00:39:01,437 --> 00:39:04,899
And you will graduate
from Boston University.

664
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,345
You will retake the STIC and get,

665
00:39:08,814 --> 00:39:13,046
by studying, the high
marks that you got before.

666
00:39:13,463 --> 00:39:14,297
Or else...

667
00:39:14,297 --> 00:39:15,923
Or else you'll do what, Dad?

668
00:39:16,611 --> 00:39:19,447
Whatever I do, I am never enough for you.

669
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,446
Do you think

670
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:24,149
my world revolves around you?

671
00:39:24,954 --> 00:39:26,392
I am my own person.

672
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,234
You silly,

673
00:39:30,771 --> 00:39:32,356
stupid boy.

674
00:39:32,388 --> 00:39:34,556
You are nothing without me.

675
00:39:34,581 --> 00:39:37,189
Everything you have came from me,

676
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:39,243
don't you ever forget that.

677
00:39:40,214 --> 00:39:41,892
Well, I'm done living off with you.

678
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:43,899
I can do this on my own.

679
00:39:44,856 --> 00:39:46,315
Cut me off, throw me off.

680
00:39:49,082 --> 00:39:50,124
I don't care anymore.

681
00:39:51,542 --> 00:39:52,710
Well, neither do I.

682
00:39:53,207 --> 00:39:55,167
See if you can survive without me.

683
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:56,204
Go ahead.

684
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,091
Go ahead and fail!

685
00:40:09,852 --> 00:40:10,852
Hon.

686
00:40:12,847 --> 00:40:13,855
What?

687
00:40:16,730 --> 00:40:19,901
Oh my god, look at this mess.

688
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:22,782
Pat, you just moved in here

689
00:40:22,782 --> 00:40:24,784
and this place already looks trashed.

690
00:40:25,243 --> 00:40:26,277
Hon, seriously,

691
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:27,995
are you going to yell at me too?

692
00:40:29,413 --> 00:40:31,582
You need to be more responsible.

693
00:40:31,874 --> 00:40:34,043
You don't have a nanny,
you have no credit cards,

694
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:34,811
nothing.

695
00:40:34,836 --> 00:40:35,878
I know, but

696
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:39,006
I still have savings and
earnings from our STIC.

697
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,134
We're good, hon, relax.

698
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:44,220
And all evidence connecting
us to STIC is already deleted.

699
00:40:45,113 --> 00:40:46,135
We're clean.

700
00:40:49,794 --> 00:40:51,755
Okay, maybe.

701
00:40:52,353 --> 00:40:54,147
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

702
00:40:54,397 --> 00:40:56,357
You know,
maybe I should just go home.

703
00:40:58,257 --> 00:41:01,302
We should just apologize
to your dad so this is over.

704
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:08,786
I'd rather go broke than go back to my dad.

705
00:41:16,669 --> 00:41:19,338
My dad found out about the STIC tests too.

706
00:41:20,481 --> 00:41:22,609
You know, good thing the
news didn't even mention our

707
00:41:22,633 --> 00:41:23,985
printing press company.

708
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,345
You know, I'm pretty much
a prisoner back at home.

709
00:41:27,346 --> 00:41:28,848
I sneaked out.

710
00:41:32,894 --> 00:41:33,894
Hon,

711
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:35,145
we're together anyway.

712
00:41:37,106 --> 00:41:38,106
We can do this.

713
00:41:41,694 --> 00:41:44,071
By the way, did Bank message you earlier?

714
00:41:45,364 --> 00:41:46,364
Message me?

715
00:41:46,782 --> 00:41:47,782
About what?

716
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:49,117
Check your phone.

717
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,456
The gang is back.

718
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,379
Bank, what’s this?

719
00:42:11,057 --> 00:42:12,057
What’s going on?

720
00:42:13,937 --> 00:42:17,274
Are we still here to talk about
what's happening in STIC?

721
00:42:17,715 --> 00:42:19,023
I also saw the news.

722
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,315
You have no information about that.

723
00:42:24,423 --> 00:42:25,449
Anyway,

724
00:42:25,561 --> 00:42:26,645
we're good, Lin.

725
00:42:26,862 --> 00:42:28,270
No one’s coming after us anymore.

726
00:42:28,658 --> 00:42:30,535
No reruns, no retakes.

727
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,286
That’s the clients’ problem now.

728
00:42:33,614 --> 00:42:34,388
And

729
00:42:34,413 --> 00:42:38,960
our dads found out about the STIC
tests but they're not calling the cops.

730
00:42:41,409 --> 00:42:42,426
That's how it should be.

731
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:46,571
Because if they’re good
parents, they’ll protect you.

732
00:42:48,552 --> 00:42:49,434
But Lin,

733
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:52,470
we’re not here to talk about STIC.

734
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:54,321
We need your help.

735
00:42:55,557 --> 00:42:56,766
We have a new plan.

736
00:43:05,298 --> 00:43:06,489
Let me just remind you.

737
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:09,700
This isn’t like before
where I’d just give answers.

738
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:11,380
What we're doing is a crime.

739
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,278
Here are the five main processes.

740
00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:14,685
One, sampling.

741
00:43:15,243 --> 00:43:16,372
Actual printing.

742
00:43:16,843 --> 00:43:17,886
Quality assurance.

743
00:43:17,911 --> 00:43:19,016
Packaging.

744
00:43:19,041 --> 00:43:20,184
And dispatch.

745
00:43:20,209 --> 00:43:22,586
But security is really tight.

746
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,689
They're super strict, right?

747
00:43:24,714 --> 00:43:27,925
But we just need an
inside man to work for us.

748
00:43:28,254 --> 00:43:29,235
Seems like

749
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,106
what you're asking me to do is hard because

750
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:32,793
first of all, it's dangerous.

751
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:34,403
Second, if my boss catches me,

752
00:43:34,595 --> 00:43:35,846
I’ll be done for.

753
00:43:35,871 --> 00:43:38,040
Even if we pay you 100,000.

754
00:43:39,226 --> 00:43:40,231
It's about time.

755
00:43:44,025 --> 00:43:45,661
We already put the phone in the food pack.

756
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:47,762
We’re sending in the utility now.

757
00:43:49,739 --> 00:43:51,632
Where’s the food I set aside?

758
00:43:51,657 --> 00:43:55,036
I don’t know, maybe it all
got thrown away with the trash.

759
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,793
Yes, the power is off.
