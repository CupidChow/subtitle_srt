1
00:00:44,289 --> 00:00:46,041
I’ve said this before.

2
00:00:46,414 --> 00:00:47,523
I’m done.

3
00:00:49,106 --> 00:00:50,733
If you need money,

4
00:00:50,838 --> 00:00:52,923
why don’t you just use my share in STIC.

5
00:00:52,923 --> 00:00:53,841
Come on, Lin.

6
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,385
In compliance with our school regulations,

7
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,804
I’m sorry to disappoint you, ma’am but

8
00:00:59,513 --> 00:01:00,597
Tristan Bangkat,

9
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:03,399
you are expelled effective today.

10
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:04,884
That’s why I need the NCET.

11
00:01:05,477 --> 00:01:07,688
If I can’t be a doctor anymore,
then I need the money

12
00:01:07,688 --> 00:01:09,523
for my future and for mama.

13
00:01:10,107 --> 00:01:11,400
That’s my only way, Lin.

14
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,942
Alright.

15
00:01:11,942 --> 00:01:12,860
Let’s do this.

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,361
One last time.

17
00:01:15,654 --> 00:01:18,490
Well, desperate times call
for desperate measures.

18
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:21,133
He needs the money for his family.

19
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:24,370
We need a blackout so the CCTVs won’t work.

20
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:25,729
So here’s what’s going to happen.

21
00:01:25,754 --> 00:01:29,341
At 10:00 PM, Kuya Fidel starts his shift.

22
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:30,836
Sir, just checking, sir.

23
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:31,687
Alright.

24
00:01:31,712 --> 00:01:32,855
How’s it going?

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,826
All good.

26
00:01:33,851 --> 00:01:36,120
We placed the phone in the food pack.

27
00:01:36,145 --> 00:01:38,063
Utility’s bringing it in now.

28
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:41,513
Papi, where’s the food I set aside?

29
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:42,888
I don’t know.

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,267
Maybe it got thrown away.

31
00:01:45,851 --> 00:01:46,911
What now, Bank?

32
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:49,037
Looks like it’s gone.

33
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:50,286
It’s almost 1:00 AM.

34
00:02:05,342 --> 00:02:05,846
Alright.

35
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:06,901
Take care.

36
00:02:08,123 --> 00:02:09,284
Sir, we’ll just check.

37
00:02:10,042 --> 00:02:10,501
Oh, boy!

38
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:11,823
You’re sweating so much!

39
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,964
Yes, boss.

40
00:02:15,964 --> 00:02:18,050
Our vehicle’s aircon is broken, sir.

41
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,058
Is that so?

42
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,970
Also, boss, I’m naturally sweaty.

43
00:02:21,995 --> 00:02:22,696
Oh, alright.

44
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,198
Just leave your phones here.

45
00:02:24,223 --> 00:02:25,378
Okay, sir.

46
00:02:28,036 --> 00:02:29,788
Please hurry with the work.

47
00:02:30,229 --> 00:02:31,814
We’re chasing a deadline.

48
00:02:32,731 --> 00:02:33,917
Yes, sir.

49
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:38,195
Uh, boss, can I use your
restroom? I really need to pee.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,972
Hey, Fidel, why are you still here?

51
00:02:40,364 --> 00:02:42,324
Boss, I’ll just accompany him.

52
00:02:42,991 --> 00:02:43,784
I also need to pee.

53
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:44,201
Go on.

54
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:45,677
Take him to the CR.

55
00:02:45,702 --> 00:02:46,678
Then,

56
00:02:46,703 --> 00:02:47,871
head outside after.

57
00:02:47,871 --> 00:02:48,806
Thank you Boss.

58
00:02:48,831 --> 00:02:49,831
Quick.

59
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:50,925
Thank you, boss.

60
00:02:54,253 --> 00:02:55,395
Come with me.

61
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,448
Okay, boss.

62
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:58,816
Let’s go.

63
00:02:58,841 --> 00:02:59,909
Here.

64
00:03:02,886 --> 00:03:04,471
It smells bad here.

65
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:09,142
Why’d you bring me here, bro?

66
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:10,244
What happened?

67
00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:11,284
Because,

68
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:13,003
the cellphone

69
00:03:14,356 --> 00:03:15,082
is missing.

70
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,190
Huh?

71
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:17,818
How did you lose it?

72
00:03:18,151 --> 00:03:19,361
Here’s what happened.

73
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,529
I was holding it.

74
00:03:20,529 --> 00:03:21,488
It was in my hand.

75
00:03:22,072 --> 00:03:24,157
Then, Boss Choi suddenly came.

76
00:03:24,157 --> 00:03:25,242
Told me to do something.

77
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:27,019
I left it in the Cafeteria.

78
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:28,495
When I came back,

79
00:03:29,162 --> 00:03:30,237
it was gone.

80
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:31,431
Kuys.

81
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,749
That’s really important.

82
00:03:32,749 --> 00:03:33,792
What now?

83
00:03:35,586 --> 00:03:37,671
Can you not blame me for now?

84
00:03:37,671 --> 00:03:38,940
Just help me look for it.

85
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:40,675
Please.

86
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:41,884
Come on.

87
00:03:41,884 --> 00:03:42,568
There.

88
00:03:42,593 --> 00:03:43,260
You look over there

89
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,331
I'll look here.

90
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:46,315
Over there.

91
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:04,284
Bank,

92
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:05,652
can we still do this?

93
00:04:06,992 --> 00:04:09,202
It’s almost 2:00 AM and Pat
still hasn’t sent anything.

94
00:04:09,202 --> 00:04:10,637
Yeah, Bank.

95
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:12,789
You know what? We
are totally blind out here.

96
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:14,917
And I’m so worried for Pat.

97
00:05:08,637 --> 00:05:09,652
Bank,

98
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:14,351
I told Pat if things get too dangerous,

99
00:05:14,935 --> 00:05:16,520
he should back out and leave the place

100
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,021
to save himself.

101
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:19,793
What?

102
00:05:20,857 --> 00:05:22,317
Why’d you tell him that?

103
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,611
He might not do the plan.
You know him, he’s an idiot.

104
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:26,488
He’ll just take the easiest way out.

105
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:30,033
Do you even hear yourself, Bank?

106
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:32,869
Pat’s safety is at stake here.

107
00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:34,496
What do you want him to do inside?

108
00:05:34,496 --> 00:05:35,555
What, improvise?

109
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,416
Let me remind you, Bank,

110
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:40,252
this isn’t his job,
we’re just students.

111
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:58,988
Lin,

112
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,483
I’m really worried for Pat and I
don’t think he’s doing well in there.

113
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,848
Bank, look,

114
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,281
I know Pat didn’t treat you well.

115
00:06:09,281 --> 00:06:11,742
But at least show some
consideration, please.

116
00:06:35,307 --> 00:06:36,348
Here it is!

117
00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:39,978
I’m sure this is it.

118
00:06:41,897 --> 00:06:42,957
This is it.

119
00:06:43,482 --> 00:06:44,527
Thank God!

120
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:47,902
- Give it to me.
- There it is.

121
00:06:48,904 --> 00:06:49,949
Yes!

122
00:06:56,453 --> 00:06:57,481
Bu—

123
00:06:57,871 --> 00:06:59,122
Why is there no signal?

124
00:06:59,748 --> 00:07:03,001
If Pat isn’t texting, then
there’s a problem inside.

125
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:04,723
You’re right,

126
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,171
maybe he can’t handle it alone.

127
00:07:06,797 --> 00:07:08,298
It was wrong to leave it all to him.

128
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,843
Is there no signal in
your building?

129
00:07:12,469 --> 00:07:13,543
I don’t know,

130
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:15,514
since phones are banned here.

131
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:17,557
If you want,

132
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:19,277
let’s go back to the office.

133
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,603
Maybe there’s signal there.

134
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,270
Let’s go!

135
00:07:28,443 --> 00:07:29,457
Hey!

136
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:30,793
What now?

137
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,009
Okay, let’s go.

138
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:37,035
Let’s go.

139
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:43,183
Wait,

140
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,584
what are you doing, Bank?

141
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:48,004
I’ll fix all my mistakes.

142
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,192
- Bank!
- Bank!

143
00:07:52,217 --> 00:07:53,468
We’re out of time.

144
00:07:54,136 --> 00:07:56,179
If they can’t take pictures of the exams,

145
00:07:56,179 --> 00:07:58,515
I’ll do it myself and find a way.

146
00:07:58,682 --> 00:08:00,892
But Bank, that’s not part of the plan.

147
00:08:00,892 --> 00:08:01,949
Bank!

148
00:08:08,066 --> 00:08:09,042
2:00 AM.

149
00:08:09,067 --> 00:08:13,071
By 2:00 AM, we should already
have the pictures of the test paper.

150
00:08:13,071 --> 00:08:14,072
Still no signal?!

151
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:15,173
At this time,

152
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:17,534
Lin and I should already
be answering the exam.

153
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:20,579
While Lin and I are answering,

154
00:08:20,808 --> 00:08:22,768
Pat should go to the Men’s CR

155
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,000
to hide the phone in the drain cover.

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,211
Maybe Sir Choi did not receive your texts

157
00:08:28,211 --> 00:08:30,547
while our printing is ongoing.

158
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:33,425
We actually have a signal jammer here

159
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:34,926
for your security.

160
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:39,306
Why didn’t you say
there’s a signal jammer?

161
00:08:39,931 --> 00:08:41,074
How would I know?

162
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:43,101
Cellphones are banned inside, right?

163
00:08:43,476 --> 00:08:45,020
So that’s why we can’t send.

164
00:08:46,146 --> 00:08:47,160
I didn’t know.

165
00:08:53,111 --> 00:08:56,281
I thought you guys were smart,
why didn’t you think of this?

166
00:09:09,044 --> 00:09:10,462
I’m fixing the power.

167
00:09:10,712 --> 00:09:14,758
There’s just a 30-minute delay
but we’ll still meet the deadline.

168
00:09:15,675 --> 00:09:16,684
Thank you.

169
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:22,004
What are you still doing here?

170
00:09:22,849 --> 00:09:24,893
You’ll be dead if Boss Choi sees you.

171
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:26,978
Alright then.

172
00:09:27,395 --> 00:09:28,410
Fix it up.

173
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:34,753
Kuya Jerry,

174
00:09:34,778 --> 00:09:36,238
wrap it up, switch it on.

175
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,490
We need to back out so turn the power on

176
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,078
so we can get out of here.

177
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:41,551
Huh?

178
00:09:41,576 --> 00:09:42,786
I’m not done yet.

179
00:09:43,745 --> 00:09:45,080
Not done with what?

180
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:48,750
- Huh?
- Oh.

181
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,419
With the power.

182
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:52,712
I’m still fixing it.

183
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,799
Looks like something was forgotten.

184
00:09:56,258 --> 00:09:58,009
Your people are still outside.

185
00:09:58,927 --> 00:10:01,137
Apparently they forgot the circuit breaker.

186
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,539
Is that so?

187
00:10:10,313 --> 00:10:11,898
Anytime, anytime...

188
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:18,822
Out of all things,
you forget the breaker?

189
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:23,422
Yeah.

190
00:10:23,702 --> 00:10:24,711
Thanks.

191
00:10:28,415 --> 00:10:29,430
I just noticed something.

192
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,003
You’re still young.

193
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:35,422
You’re newbies, aren’t you?

194
00:10:38,633 --> 00:10:39,649
Tom,

195
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,053
why didn’t you call Jimboy instead?

196
00:10:42,053 --> 00:10:42,977
Boss,

197
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,004
I actually called Jimboy.

198
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,594
He said they’re on their way.

199
00:10:56,151 --> 00:10:57,527
Why’s there an electrician here?

200
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:58,555
Huh?

201
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:01,614
I don’t know, Lin.

202
00:11:03,783 --> 00:11:07,537
I have a feeling that Fidel failed to make
the fake call to the electrician.

203
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:09,992
Maybe Tito Choi called them.

204
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,258
Uhh.

205
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,463
We’re trainees of Boss Jimboy.

206
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,965
He’s busy so he sent us.

207
00:11:19,132 --> 00:11:20,884
Oh my god, then what do we do?

208
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:22,177
Pat and Bank could get caught.

209
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:24,000
Think.

210
00:11:24,054 --> 00:11:25,030
Think.

211
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,070
Think.

212
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:30,685
So that’s why you’re fumbling around.

213
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:33,271
Come on,

214
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:34,814
hurry up.

215
00:11:36,524 --> 00:11:38,652
This isn’t training time.

216
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:40,403
We’ve got a deadline.

217
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:43,781
Fidel,

218
00:11:44,699 --> 00:11:46,092
why are you still here?

219
00:11:46,117 --> 00:11:47,703
You and Tom get out of here.

220
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:48,930
Yes, boss.

221
00:12:09,557 --> 00:12:10,100
Lin,

222
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,725
Lin?

223
00:12:10,725 --> 00:12:11,559
Wait.

224
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:12,570
Lin.

225
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:20,485
What’s happening?

226
00:12:20,485 --> 00:12:21,945
There’s a signal jammer here.

227
00:12:25,615 --> 00:12:26,674
Okay,

228
00:12:26,699 --> 00:12:28,039
we'll take pictures instead.

229
00:12:28,201 --> 00:12:29,661
But we need to find another way

230
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,413
to get the phone out
without getting caught.

231
00:12:31,413 --> 00:12:32,492
Where is it? Give it to me.

232
00:12:33,915 --> 00:12:34,930
Give it to me!

233
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,508
This was fully charged.

234
00:12:44,843 --> 00:12:45,934
Fuck.

235
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:47,011
Maybe it got wet.

236
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:48,721
It was in the trash earlier.

237
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:52,058
It’s gone.

238
00:12:52,058 --> 00:12:53,476
The phone’s probably useless, Bank.

239
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:54,536
Let’s go.

240
00:12:54,561 --> 00:12:56,146
We need to leave.

241
00:12:56,146 --> 00:12:56,813
We still have time.

242
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:57,814
- There’s still time.
- Huh?

243
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,941
Just a few minutes left,
it’s almost 3:00 AM!

244
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:01,651
We need to be printing.

245
00:13:01,651 --> 00:13:03,194
Don’t force it, Bank.

246
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,529
We need to get out!

247
00:13:04,529 --> 00:13:06,322
You have to stall another 20 minutes.

248
00:13:06,322 --> 00:13:09,325
I’ll find the questionnaires
and that’s what we’ll pull out.

249
00:13:09,534 --> 00:13:10,567
Take this.

250
00:13:10,869 --> 00:13:12,203
Pat, take it.

251
00:13:13,913 --> 00:13:15,165
Bank, stop!

252
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:17,542
Bank!

253
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:18,710
Stay here, Pat.

254
00:13:19,377 --> 00:13:20,458
Stay here.

255
00:13:28,303 --> 00:13:29,471
Oh, you’re done?

256
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:31,833
Where are you going?

257
00:13:32,599 --> 00:13:34,851
Ah, just using the restroom.

258
00:13:36,728 --> 00:13:38,396
But they’re fixing it.

259
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:40,732
Okay, I’ll come too. I need to go.

260
00:13:42,942 --> 00:13:44,611
When I come back this better be done.

261
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,991
Do you have kidney stones or
something? You keep going to the CR.

262
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,123
Sorry, sir, hold it.

263
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:59,184
- Sorry, uhm.
- Miss, why?

264
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,169
Sorry.

265
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:04,547
But Boss Choi asked me to
say you’re not needed now.

266
00:14:04,672 --> 00:14:05,648
Huh?

267
00:14:05,673 --> 00:14:06,684
Why?

268
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:09,511
Two calls were made.

269
00:14:10,345 --> 00:14:13,014
I'm the one who called the
electrician who's already inside.

270
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:15,600
But Boss Choi called too.

271
00:14:16,601 --> 00:14:17,895
Ah, I see.

272
00:14:17,977 --> 00:14:21,105
Choi usually calls us for this stuff.

273
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:42,710
I’m still an intern, so I
called someone else.

274
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:43,603
Sorry.

275
00:14:43,628 --> 00:14:44,921
Wait, I’ll call Choi.

276
00:14:45,129 --> 00:14:46,881
Please don’t, he’s busy inside.

277
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:50,260
Maybe they need me more because
I know their power system well.

278
00:14:50,969 --> 00:14:53,555
Sorry, but I might get
scolded by Boss Choi.

279
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:55,515
Ah, sorry Miss. It’s not my fault.

280
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:57,183
I’m just doing my job.

281
00:15:35,805 --> 00:15:36,889
Boss.

282
00:15:38,266 --> 00:15:39,450
There’s...

283
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:40,852
a client calling.

284
00:15:43,146 --> 00:15:45,398
These clients are persistent.

285
00:15:45,898 --> 00:15:47,191
And you actually came here?

286
00:15:48,568 --> 00:15:49,544
Oh,

287
00:15:49,569 --> 00:15:51,279
I also need to pee, Boss.

288
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,948
Finish your work, okay?

289
00:15:54,782 --> 00:15:55,825
That should be done by now.

290
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:04,726
Okay, Bank.

291
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:09,589
If you'll get the test papers, make
sure you don't get us caught, okay?

292
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:12,258
You’ll see me in the window.

293
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:14,353
Once I secure the test papers,

294
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:16,262
I’ll give the go signal.

295
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:18,181
That’s when you
switch the power, okay?

296
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:12,652
No one’s answering.

297
00:17:14,362 --> 00:17:16,322
He’s busy inside.

298
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:17,849
Hello?

299
00:17:19,992 --> 00:17:21,029
Hello?

300
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,631
Hello!

301
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:27,375
No one’s answering, I think
these idiots are pranking me.

302
00:17:30,545 --> 00:17:32,338
When will the power be back?

303
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:34,090
I'll update the clients.

304
00:17:34,757 --> 00:17:35,904
Ah...

305
00:17:36,551 --> 00:17:37,927
About 30 minutes.

306
00:17:38,678 --> 00:17:39,387
30 minutes?

307
00:17:39,387 --> 00:17:41,180
That’s too long, hurry up!

308
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:43,099
I have a deadline.

309
00:17:44,225 --> 00:17:45,268
Hurry up.

310
00:17:47,812 --> 00:17:48,826
I’ll call again.

311
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:54,711
Hello?

312
00:17:54,736 --> 00:17:56,320
Dizon Printing.

313
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,197
I will just update you.

314
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:02,045
Yes.

315
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:03,870
Maximum 30 minutes.

316
00:18:06,664 --> 00:18:07,748
Busy tone already.

317
00:18:11,102 --> 00:18:13,312
He's really busy sir,
I'm sorry.

318
00:18:13,337 --> 00:18:14,797
It's your lucky day, huh?

319
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:16,549
Choi won’t scold you.

320
00:18:17,258 --> 00:18:18,760
Be grateful, we’re full right now.

321
00:18:19,552 --> 00:18:20,611
Next time, okay?

322
00:18:20,636 --> 00:18:21,904
Don’t show off.

323
00:18:21,929 --> 00:18:23,531
You’re wasting our time.

324
00:18:23,556 --> 00:18:24,307
Sorry.

325
00:18:24,307 --> 00:18:25,451
It won’t happen again.

326
00:18:47,872 --> 00:18:49,098
Yes.

327
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:50,183
We’re working on it.

328
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,243
Yeah.

329
00:18:51,709 --> 00:18:52,821
Okay.

330
00:18:58,174 --> 00:19:00,092
What the hell, what are you doing?

331
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,266
Yes.

332
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:09,290
Yes.

333
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,782
Thank you.

334
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,474
What?

335
00:19:48,474 --> 00:19:49,600
Is it not done yet?

336
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:51,290
Ah...

337
00:19:52,395 --> 00:19:52,979
Ah...

338
00:19:52,979 --> 00:19:54,188
Boss, ah...

339
00:19:54,897 --> 00:19:56,274
If you need me,

340
00:19:56,732 --> 00:19:58,067
I’ll be outside.

341
00:19:58,442 --> 00:19:59,861
It’s hot in here.

342
00:20:00,778 --> 00:20:01,587
Huh?

343
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:02,727
Okay.

344
00:20:15,001 --> 00:20:16,110
Damn.

345
00:21:21,859 --> 00:21:23,085
What now, Pat?

346
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,295
I’m done.

347
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,030
Just give me the go signal.

348
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:27,782
One sec, Kuya Jerry.

349
00:21:27,782 --> 00:21:28,835
Bank’s not back yet.

350
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,068
We have to wait.

351
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,157
Section 3.

352
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:56,911
Part 4.

353
00:21:56,936 --> 00:21:58,079
Section 4.

354
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:19,709
Now guys, please take note

355
00:22:20,167 --> 00:22:24,046
that they take note of the barcode numbers
of the copies they shred for tracing.

356
00:22:28,551 --> 00:22:30,386
I can’t get this out.

357
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:34,056
What?

358
00:22:34,056 --> 00:22:35,266
Is it still not done?

359
00:22:37,727 --> 00:22:38,686
Oh...

360
00:22:38,686 --> 00:22:40,521
Almost done, Sir.

361
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,241
How many minutes?

362
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:38,008
Oh...

363
00:23:38,746 --> 00:23:39,872
Boss, uh...

364
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:41,874
Hey!

365
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,434
What?!

366
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:45,127
About five minutes, boss.

367
00:23:46,003 --> 00:23:47,088
Fuck.

368
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:50,091
The other guy...

369
00:23:50,674 --> 00:23:52,343
Where is he?

370
00:24:05,274 --> 00:24:06,274
Hey!

371
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,361
Uhh...

372
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:12,404
He might still be in the CR.

373
00:24:12,404 --> 00:24:14,031
He said his stomach hurts.

374
00:24:15,574 --> 00:24:17,201
Shit.

375
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:33,050
If you want,

376
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,593
I'll look for him, sir?

377
00:24:34,593 --> 00:24:35,611
Just a sec.

378
00:24:35,636 --> 00:24:36,860
No.

379
00:24:36,971 --> 00:24:38,180
No one's going out.

380
00:24:38,556 --> 00:24:39,640
Stay there.

381
00:24:40,266 --> 00:24:43,227
Work on that power already.

382
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,479
It’s been ages!

383
00:24:45,504 --> 00:24:46,648
Go.

384
00:25:13,507 --> 00:25:15,134
Five minutes!

385
00:25:16,177 --> 00:25:17,595
Turn it on.

386
00:25:21,932 --> 00:25:23,008
Hey.

387
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:24,579
Uhh...

388
00:25:25,269 --> 00:25:27,438
Sir, we just need to—

389
00:25:31,358 --> 00:25:32,568
Turn it on!

390
00:25:35,404 --> 00:25:36,524
Huh?

391
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:38,032
Power’s back on.

392
00:25:38,699 --> 00:25:39,930
Power’s back on.

393
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:43,370
But they still aren’t out.

394
00:25:44,663 --> 00:25:46,290
They should be out by now.

395
00:25:46,874 --> 00:25:48,184
Okay, what do we do?

396
00:25:48,209 --> 00:25:49,344
Um, hold on.

397
00:25:50,169 --> 00:25:51,469
I don’t know either.

398
00:25:51,629 --> 00:25:52,438
Now,

399
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:54,715
- let's see this through.
- They haven't sent the answers yet.

400
00:25:55,799 --> 00:25:57,635
If they haven't sent the
answers yet, so what?

401
00:25:57,718 --> 00:25:58,552
What does that mean?

402
00:25:58,552 --> 00:25:59,720
- What, they stole the exam?
- No—

403
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:03,015
I don’t know, but hopefully they
get out without getting caught.

404
00:26:03,015 --> 00:26:04,850
Forget the NCET, it's okay.

405
00:26:05,358 --> 00:26:06,400
- Okay?
- Yeah.

406
00:26:07,436 --> 00:26:08,547
Just breathe.

407
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,608
Okay, all will be well.

408
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:16,184
Where are you now, Bank?

409
00:26:28,374 --> 00:26:30,125
Finally, power's on.

410
00:26:33,337 --> 00:26:34,588
You can leave now.

411
00:26:36,465 --> 00:26:37,758
Wait, your companion,

412
00:26:38,801 --> 00:26:39,954
where is he?

413
00:26:40,813 --> 00:26:41,971
He's gone for too long.

414
00:26:45,349 --> 00:26:46,350
Something's fishy.

415
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:49,922
Roger.

416
00:26:50,562 --> 00:26:52,231
Roger, don't let anyone in yet.

417
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:12,001
Tom, come in here.

418
00:27:14,545 --> 00:27:16,964
Check the CCTV monitor.

419
00:27:16,964 --> 00:27:18,132
We just need to find someone.

420
00:27:20,592 --> 00:27:21,777
This way.

421
00:27:21,802 --> 00:27:24,513
There's a connecting door
going to the dispatch room.

422
00:27:31,312 --> 00:27:32,730
This area,

423
00:27:33,439 --> 00:27:35,649
if I remember correctly, has

424
00:27:36,008 --> 00:27:39,077
one to four CCTVs.

425
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,736
In compliance with our school regulations,

426
00:28:22,071 --> 00:28:24,073
I'm sorry to disappoint you, ma'am, but

427
00:28:24,823 --> 00:28:25,824
Tristan Bangkat,

428
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:28,919
you are expelled effective today.

429
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:45,636
Since, you have no insurance,

430
00:28:45,969 --> 00:28:47,471
all of this will cost—

431
00:28:47,471 --> 00:28:48,847
450,000.00

432
00:28:53,477 --> 00:28:54,561
I'm sorry, son.

433
00:28:55,396 --> 00:28:56,412
Hold on tight, okay?

434
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:00,776
- Ouch, ouch.
- Wait, wait.

435
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:01,794
It hurts.

436
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:02,974
It really hurts.

437
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,196
Oh my God.

438
00:29:04,196 --> 00:29:05,172
Wait.

439
00:29:05,197 --> 00:29:06,396
Just wait a moment.

440
00:29:07,491 --> 00:29:08,534
- Mom.
- It hurts.

441
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,244
Oh my God, oh my God.

442
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:13,584
It hurts.

443
00:29:17,626 --> 00:29:18,752
Thief!

444
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:19,603
Help!

445
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:20,421
Help!

446
00:29:29,054 --> 00:29:29,905
Let's go, hurry.

447
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:30,514
Let's go, quick!

448
00:29:30,514 --> 00:29:31,682
Tristan!

449
00:29:31,682 --> 00:29:32,015
Mom.

450
00:29:32,015 --> 00:29:32,975
Tristan!

451
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:35,327
Mom!

452
00:29:35,352 --> 00:29:36,245
- Tristan!
- Mom!

453
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,294
Tristan!

454
00:30:04,631 --> 00:30:05,507
A.

455
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:06,513
B.

456
00:30:48,592 --> 00:30:49,693
Let's go, bro.

457
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:50,880
What about your the other guy?

458
00:30:54,097 --> 00:30:55,349
We don't really have a choice.

459
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:59,478
We have to do this so we won't
go back to our miserable lives.

460
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:02,544
Me?

461
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:05,150
I don't want to go back to my old life

462
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,319
buried in debt and with a
broken washing machine.

463
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,699
My life was ruined
ever since I got expelled.

464
00:31:13,951 --> 00:31:15,035
I have no future, Pat.

465
00:31:18,413 --> 00:31:20,123
This is the only way
I can redeem myself.

466
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:22,976
As for me,

467
00:31:23,001 --> 00:31:25,921
all I want is to stop being
controlled by my father.

468
00:31:59,496 --> 00:32:00,669
Hey!

469
00:32:02,791 --> 00:32:04,126
Turn on the lights!

470
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:15,612
Hey!

471
00:32:15,637 --> 00:32:16,841
What happened?

472
00:32:17,973 --> 00:32:19,224
Uhh,

473
00:32:19,766 --> 00:32:20,642
Oh, we just have to...

474
00:32:20,642 --> 00:32:21,865
We...

475
00:32:21,977 --> 00:32:24,396
we just have to test something

476
00:32:25,022 --> 00:32:26,315
Turn it on again!

477
00:32:26,315 --> 00:32:27,899
Boss Choi will get mad.

478
00:32:28,609 --> 00:32:29,610
Boss, the thing is—

479
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,111
Just turn it on!

480
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:32,872
Boss!

481
00:32:42,831 --> 00:32:43,849
Hey!

482
00:32:46,376 --> 00:32:47,711
Come out of there!

483
00:32:47,711 --> 00:32:48,962
I can hear you!

484
00:32:52,257 --> 00:32:54,301
No, what is happening?

485
00:32:55,052 --> 00:32:56,428
What is happening?

486
00:32:56,428 --> 00:32:58,722
They haven't even come out yet!

487
00:32:59,306 --> 00:33:02,476
There are people outside but
the operations haven't resumed.

488
00:33:04,436 --> 00:33:08,231
They haven't come out yet, but how do
we know what's going on inside?

489
00:33:08,774 --> 00:33:11,985
I'm really worried for Pat.
What do we do?

490
00:33:13,236 --> 00:33:15,697
- I don't want to…
- I need you to relax, Grace.

491
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:17,758
Calm down.

492
00:33:17,783 --> 00:33:18,759
Almost there.

493
00:33:18,784 --> 00:33:21,370
- How do you know?
- We're so close…

494
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,294
No, what if…

495
00:33:22,829 --> 00:33:23,764
How do we know?

496
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:25,916
How do we know what is going on inside?

497
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,668
How do we know that they are okay?

498
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:29,920
- What if something happens to them?!
- Grace!

499
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:30,990
Grace!

500
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:32,709
Listen!

501
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:35,175
Relax.

502
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:36,843
We're almost there.

503
00:33:37,469 --> 00:33:40,639
I need you to give me everything
you've got right now.

504
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:41,657
Okay?

505
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:43,850
I don't want something to happen to Pat.

506
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:44,912
Calm down.

507
00:33:45,811 --> 00:33:47,062
We don't need this right now.

508
00:33:47,604 --> 00:33:48,855
We're almost there.

509
00:33:50,357 --> 00:33:51,435
Calm down now!

510
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,162
Grace!

511
00:33:55,404 --> 00:33:57,072
Okay, okay!

512
00:33:57,739 --> 00:33:59,116
Do it for Pat.

513
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:01,732
Sir Choi.

514
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:02,998
Sir Choi.

515
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:04,287
Sir Choi.

516
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:07,144
What now?

517
00:34:08,291 --> 00:34:09,626
What happened this time?

518
00:34:09,626 --> 00:34:11,044
Why did the lights go out?

519
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,047
I just tested it, but I'm sorry.

520
00:34:14,047 --> 00:34:16,533
I just needed your signature for the…

521
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:18,184
for the approval of…

522
00:34:19,845 --> 00:34:20,951
the power.

523
00:34:23,306 --> 00:34:24,412
Why do you look like that?

524
00:34:29,771 --> 00:34:31,106
I won't sign that.

525
00:34:31,815 --> 00:34:33,817
Not until I see your colleague.

526
00:34:37,154 --> 00:34:39,156
Feels like you're making a fool out of me.

527
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:45,388
You know—

528
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:49,207
I've been looking for you.
Come here.

529
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,232
Where did you come from?

530
00:34:52,294 --> 00:34:53,545
Uhh, sir.

531
00:34:53,962 --> 00:34:55,130
It took me long time in
the comfort room.

532
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,263
I'm really sorry.

533
00:34:58,383 --> 00:34:59,192
What's going on?

534
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:00,318
Why are you…

535
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:02,512
It's because, sir.

536
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,347
It's my first day as a trainee.

537
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:05,724
So I felt pressured.

538
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:07,142
I got anxious.

539
00:35:07,601 --> 00:35:08,518
I was shaking.

540
00:35:08,518 --> 00:35:09,607
I couldn’t move. Then…

541
00:35:10,103 --> 00:35:11,209
That's enough, that's enough!

542
00:35:11,688 --> 00:35:12,789
I've had enough of you.

543
00:35:12,814 --> 00:35:14,349
You're starting to annoy me.

544
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,069
We still have work to do.

545
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:19,748
Get out of here.

546
00:35:21,615 --> 00:35:22,324
We're sorry, sir.

547
00:35:22,324 --> 00:35:22,966
Get out of here.

548
00:35:22,991 --> 00:35:24,092
Roger.

549
00:35:24,117 --> 00:35:25,744
Let the people in already.

550
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,209
Shit.

551
00:35:36,338 --> 00:35:37,349
Oh.

552
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,326
You may let them in.

553
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,818
Alright.

554
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:42,719
You can come in now.

555
00:35:43,428 --> 00:35:44,279
Yes!

556
00:35:44,304 --> 00:35:45,748
Alright, double time!

557
00:35:47,682 --> 00:35:48,802
Hurry up.

558
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:08,646
Hands up.

559
00:36:17,504 --> 00:36:18,513
Clear.

560
00:36:18,964 --> 00:36:19,982
Next.

561
00:36:20,632 --> 00:36:21,709
Hands up.

562
00:36:32,686 --> 00:36:33,810
Clear.

563
00:36:34,896 --> 00:36:35,959
Next.

564
00:36:42,237 --> 00:36:43,279
Hands up.

565
00:37:00,505 --> 00:37:01,815
Take this now.

566
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,216
Pat, take it!

567
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:10,015
- Bank!
- Stay here, Pat.

568
00:37:19,816 --> 00:37:20,826
Clear.

569
00:37:25,322 --> 00:37:26,172
Boy.

570
00:37:26,197 --> 00:37:27,302
Hold on.

571
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:35,582
Less than five hours left
before the testing sites open.

572
00:37:37,709 --> 00:37:38,919
Come on, guys.

573
00:37:39,294 --> 00:37:40,712
Please, please, please.

574
00:37:56,115 --> 00:37:56,991
Your shoelace,

575
00:37:58,021 --> 00:37:59,022
fix it.

576
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:10,075
Whatever, I can't just wait!

577
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:11,159
Wait, Grace!

578
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:12,385
Grace, wait!

579
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:13,474
Please, wait!

580
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:18,849
Boy,

581
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:22,253
your cellphone.

582
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:34,683
Thank you, sir.

583
00:38:34,683 --> 00:38:35,725
Okay, take care.

584
00:38:44,609 --> 00:38:46,111
Grace, Grace, wait!

585
00:38:46,111 --> 00:38:47,112
Pat! Finally!

586
00:38:47,112 --> 00:38:48,446
Oh my god, thank god!

587
00:38:49,405 --> 00:38:50,443
Okay.

588
00:38:51,575 --> 00:38:52,716
Come on!

589
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,164
Hurry, please!

590
00:39:00,709 --> 00:39:02,043
What happened to you?

591
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:03,521
We got blocked by the guard.

592
00:39:04,496 --> 00:39:05,513
What?

593
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,466
Yeah, the phone was
fucking on me the whole time

594
00:39:08,466 --> 00:39:11,903
it was in my pocket but I
thought, I thought he saw it!

595
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:12,595
But wait.

596
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:14,068
How did you get away?

597
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,473
I don't fucking know, man!

598
00:39:15,473 --> 00:39:17,904
Wait, wait, enough
with the story! Let's go!

599
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:19,828
Wait, what about the exam?

600
00:39:19,853 --> 00:39:20,395
Bank.

601
00:39:20,395 --> 00:39:22,205
I memorized it, I memorized it!

602
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:22,647
All of it?

603
00:39:22,647 --> 00:39:23,606
Did you memorize all of it?

604
00:39:23,606 --> 00:39:24,274
Yes!

605
00:39:24,274 --> 00:39:26,151
Don't bother me, let's go!

606
00:39:26,985 --> 00:39:28,169
Go, Pat.

607
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:29,237
- Go, go, go!
- Come on.

608
00:39:29,262 --> 00:39:30,437
Let's go!

609
00:39:46,421 --> 00:39:47,439
Okay, got it.

610
00:39:47,464 --> 00:39:48,498
Okay.

611
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:50,467
Bro, I still don't get it.

612
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:52,510
The guard felt the phone in my pocket

613
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,928
but he still let me go.

614
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:55,302
How did that happen?

615
00:39:56,264 --> 00:39:56,740
Bank,

616
00:39:56,765 --> 00:39:58,975
did you do something
that wasn't part of our plan?

617
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,357
Nothing.

618
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,038
Bank,

619
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,780
I saw you and the guard exchange looks.

620
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:09,474
Is that true?

621
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,213
Do you know the guard, Bank?

622
00:40:12,238 --> 00:40:13,474
Yes already!

623
00:40:13,565 --> 00:40:15,724
I paid the guard so he would let me in

624
00:40:15,749 --> 00:40:18,460
and I paid him big so
he would let us out too.

625
00:40:18,485 --> 00:40:19,570
That was plan B.

626
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,779
Guys, there's something
wrong with the answers.

627
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,019
Don't look at me like that.

628
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:28,044
Because if I didn’t do that,
we would’ve been caught.

629
00:40:28,838 --> 00:40:29,839
Lin, listen.

630
00:40:31,007 --> 00:40:32,060
Guys.

631
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:33,401
Guys!

632
00:40:33,426 --> 00:40:35,470
There is something wrong with the answers.

633
00:40:36,638 --> 00:40:37,263
Okay, look.

634
00:40:37,263 --> 00:40:39,849
We are missing one, two, three,

635
00:40:40,934 --> 00:40:42,310
six more items.

636
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:47,482
Right, this should be thirty items.

637
00:40:51,444 --> 00:40:51,820
Bank.

638
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,571
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

639
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:56,435
I remembered it.

640
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:58,093
B.

641
00:40:58,118 --> 00:40:58,827
Okay, B.

642
00:40:58,827 --> 00:40:59,327
D.

643
00:40:59,327 --> 00:40:59,844
D.

644
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:01,037
C.

645
00:41:01,663 --> 00:41:02,831
A.

646
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:04,124
A.

647
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:06,292
B.

648
00:41:06,292 --> 00:41:07,341
C.

649
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:12,318
Bank?

650
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:15,093
That's seven letters!

651
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:17,762
We’re missing six!

652
00:41:19,889 --> 00:41:21,891
Then just remove one if it’s extra!

653
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:23,685
What do you mean remove one?!

654
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:26,779
Bank, you think you're smart, huh?

655
00:41:31,526 --> 00:41:32,748
Okay then.

656
00:41:32,773 --> 00:41:34,358
You memorized the whole thing, right?

657
00:41:35,363 --> 00:41:37,198
Enumerate everything again!

658
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:40,034
We’ll just double-check!

659
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,203
Don’t you trust me?

660
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:46,499
This isn’t about trust!

661
00:41:47,959 --> 00:41:50,712
You’ve done things
we didn’t know about!

662
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:52,439
Didn’t you think?

663
00:41:52,464 --> 00:41:56,050
How would we know if you’re still
hiding something from us, Bank?!

664
00:41:58,386 --> 00:41:59,654
How?!

665
00:41:59,694 --> 00:42:01,905
So come on, please!

666
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,224
Come on!

667
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:06,728
Let’s just double-check the
answers you remembered!

668
00:42:09,397 --> 00:42:11,858
You’re the only one who
saw the questionnaire, Bank.

669
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:13,787
Only you!

670
00:42:21,201 --> 00:42:22,302
D.

671
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,693
B.

672
00:42:25,413 --> 00:42:26,568
B.

673
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:27,779
C.

674
00:42:28,874 --> 00:42:29,896
A.

675
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:31,685
A.

676
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:33,498
B.

677
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:34,748
C.

678
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:41,988
Oh, Bank!

679
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:43,698
Did you really memorize it?!

680
00:42:43,723 --> 00:42:44,449
Huh?!

681
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:45,642
Did you memorize it?!

682
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:48,561
The first answer is already wrong!

683
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:50,855
Bro, think harder!

684
00:42:51,314 --> 00:42:52,899
Concentrate, Bank!

685
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:54,359
Forget it!

686
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,528
We’re just fooling ourselves!

687
00:43:01,241 --> 00:43:03,368
Bank has photographic memory.

688
00:43:04,577 --> 00:43:06,496
If he can’t recite the answers,

689
00:43:08,373 --> 00:43:10,208
maybe he didn’t really answer at all.

690
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:18,732
Bank?!

691
00:43:21,594 --> 00:43:24,264
This isn’t about trust!

692
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:27,976
How would we know if you’re still
hiding something from us, Bank?!

693
00:43:28,518 --> 00:43:29,894
I’ll tell you everything.

694
00:43:30,317 --> 00:43:31,388
What is it?

695
00:43:37,068 --> 00:43:38,319
I’m sorry.

696
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,863
It’s better if you just go home, Grace.

697
00:43:40,863 --> 00:43:42,465
The driver will take you.

698
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:44,367
No, Grace stays here.

699
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:45,827
I've made all the arrangements.

700
00:43:45,852 --> 00:43:47,637
You’re going to the U.S.

701
00:43:47,662 --> 00:43:48,913
That’s where you’ll study now.

702
00:43:48,913 --> 00:43:49,956
I’m sorry.

703
00:43:51,123 --> 00:43:52,796
I don’t want to leave you.

704
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:55,593
I don’t think you need to leave Possenti.

705
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,251
But I need your help.

706
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,929
Bank, letter for you.
