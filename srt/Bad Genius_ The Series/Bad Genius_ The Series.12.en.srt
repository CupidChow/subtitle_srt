1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,264
Here it is!

2
00:00:15,717 --> 00:00:16,717
- Give it to me.
- There it is.

3
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:21,354
Why is there no signal?

4
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:22,768
We’re out of time.

5
00:00:22,867 --> 00:00:24,911
If they can’t take pictures of the exams,

6
00:00:24,911 --> 00:00:27,246
I’ll do it myself and find a way.

7
00:00:27,538 --> 00:00:29,248
Looks like something was forgotten.

8
00:00:29,248 --> 00:00:31,668
Out of all things,
you forget the breaker?

9
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,628
You have to stall another 20 minutes.

10
00:00:33,628 --> 00:00:36,631
I’ll find the questionnaires
and that’s what we’ll pull out.

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,090
What now, Pat?

12
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:39,384
I’m done.

13
00:00:39,525 --> 00:00:41,152
Just give me the go signal.

14
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:42,261
One sec, Kuya Jerry.

15
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,279
Bank’s not back yet.

16
00:00:43,304 --> 00:00:44,764
We have to wait.

17
00:00:45,223 --> 00:00:46,432
Turn it on!

18
00:00:50,895 --> 00:00:51,871
Power’s back on.

19
00:00:51,896 --> 00:00:53,168
But they aren't out yet.

20
00:00:54,524 --> 00:00:55,900
It's my first day as a trainee.

21
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,276
So I felt pressured.

22
00:00:57,276 --> 00:00:58,861
I got anxious.

23
00:00:59,987 --> 00:01:01,364
What happened to you?

24
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:02,657
We got blocked by the guard.

25
00:01:02,657 --> 00:01:04,617
The phone was fucking
on me the whole time!

26
00:01:04,617 --> 00:01:07,995
it was in my pocket but I
thought, I thought he saw it!

27
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:08,663
Yes!

28
00:01:08,663 --> 00:01:10,039
Don't bother me, let's go!

29
00:01:16,254 --> 00:01:17,271
Okay, got it.

30
00:01:17,296 --> 00:01:18,340
Okay.

31
00:01:18,923 --> 00:01:20,299
Bro, I still don't get it.

32
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:22,343
The guard felt the phone in my pocket

33
00:01:22,343 --> 00:01:23,761
but he still let me go.

34
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,137
How did that happen?

35
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:26,572
Bank,

36
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:28,808
did you do something
that wasn't part of our plan?

37
00:01:30,143 --> 00:01:31,160
Nothing.

38
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:32,870
Bank,

39
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:34,605
I saw you and the guard exchange looks.

40
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:39,379
Is that true?

41
00:01:40,324 --> 00:01:42,035
Do you know the guard, Bank?

42
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,071
Yes already!

43
00:01:43,406 --> 00:01:45,408
I paid the guard so he would let me in

44
00:01:45,658 --> 00:01:48,369
and I paid him big so
he would let us out too.

45
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,454
That was plan B.

46
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:51,456
Guys, there's something
wrong with the answers.

47
00:01:54,208 --> 00:01:55,501
Don't look at me like that.

48
00:01:55,877 --> 00:01:58,113
Because if I didn’t do that,
we would’ve been caught.

49
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,672
Lin, listen.

50
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,840
Guys.

51
00:02:02,234 --> 00:02:03,234
Guys!

52
00:02:03,305 --> 00:02:05,349
There is something wrong with the answers.

53
00:02:06,471 --> 00:02:07,096
Okay, look.

54
00:02:07,096 --> 00:02:09,682
We are missing one, two, three,

55
00:02:10,767 --> 00:02:12,143
six more items.

56
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:17,315
Right, this should be thirty items.

57
00:02:21,277 --> 00:02:21,652
Bank.

58
00:02:21,652 --> 00:02:23,404
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

59
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:26,299
I remembered it.

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:27,925
B.

61
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,659
Okay, B.

62
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:29,160
D.

63
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,677
D.

64
00:02:29,702 --> 00:02:30,870
C.

65
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:32,663
A.

66
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:33,956
A.

67
00:02:35,083 --> 00:02:36,125
B.

68
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:37,084
C.

69
00:02:41,005 --> 00:02:42,005
Bank?

70
00:02:43,466 --> 00:02:44,926
That's seven letters!

71
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:47,595
We’re missing six!

72
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:51,724
Then just remove one if it’s extra!

73
00:02:52,016 --> 00:02:53,518
What do you mean remove one?!

74
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:56,437
Bank, you think you're smart, huh?

75
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,463
Okay then.

76
00:03:02,652 --> 00:03:04,237
You memorized the whole thing, right?

77
00:03:05,196 --> 00:03:07,031
Enumerate everything again!

78
00:03:08,282 --> 00:03:09,867
We’ll just double-check!

79
00:03:10,493 --> 00:03:12,036
Don’t you trust me?

80
00:03:13,788 --> 00:03:16,332
This isn’t about trust!

81
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:20,545
You’ve done things
we didn’t know about!

82
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:22,237
Didn’t you think?

83
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:25,849
How would we know if you’re still
hiding something from us, Bank?!

84
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,237
How?!

85
00:03:29,512 --> 00:03:31,722
So come on, please!

86
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:33,057
Come on!

87
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,698
Let’s just double-check the
answers you remembered!

88
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,691
You’re the only one who
saw the questionnaire, Bank.

89
00:03:42,567 --> 00:03:43,635
Only you!

90
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:52,033
D.

91
00:03:53,452 --> 00:03:54,452
B.

92
00:03:55,246 --> 00:03:56,246
B.

93
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:57,831
C.

94
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,833
A.

95
00:04:00,501 --> 00:04:01,501
A.

96
00:04:02,169 --> 00:04:03,169
B.

97
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,671
C.

98
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:11,636
Oh, Bank!

99
00:04:11,846 --> 00:04:13,222
Did you really memorize it?!

100
00:04:13,556 --> 00:04:14,282
Huh?!

101
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:15,474
Did you memorize it?!

102
00:04:16,142 --> 00:04:18,394
The first answer is already wrong!

103
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,688
Bro, think harder!

104
00:04:21,147 --> 00:04:22,732
Concentrate, Bank!

105
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,191
Forget it!

106
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:27,361
We’re just fooling ourselves!

107
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:33,200
Bank has photographic memory.

108
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,329
If he can’t recite the answers,

109
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:40,041
maybe he didn’t really answer at all.

110
00:05:30,758 --> 00:05:32,635
- Bank?
- Okay!

111
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:38,057
There's too many!

112
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:23,436
I ran out of time to
answer the exam.

113
00:06:24,311 --> 00:06:26,105
So I just made
up all the answers.

114
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:29,233
- Are you fucking serious, Bank?
- Bank?

115
00:06:31,027 --> 00:06:32,528
No, no, no, no, no.

116
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,279
Holy shit!

117
00:06:38,038 --> 00:06:40,457
Why did you lie to us, Bank?!

118
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,288
Why?

119
00:06:42,288 --> 00:06:43,349
Huh?

120
00:06:44,415 --> 00:06:45,415
Look.

121
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:46,934
Okay.

122
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,836
Let’s call Miss Maya
while it’s still early

123
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:51,881
tell her we didn’t get the
questionnaire and all will be well.

124
00:06:51,881 --> 00:06:53,215
- We'll return the money and...
- Return what?!

125
00:06:53,215 --> 00:06:54,467
Don’t do that!

126
00:06:55,426 --> 00:06:56,402
Lin!

127
00:06:56,427 --> 00:06:58,387
All our hard work
will go to waste.

128
00:06:58,596 --> 00:06:59,739
Think of this.

129
00:06:59,764 --> 00:07:01,390
We’re in a win-win
situation here.

130
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,867
- We’ll give them the answers.
- What the?!

131
00:07:02,892 --> 00:07:04,143
We’ll get our money.

132
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:05,143
Done!

133
00:07:06,312 --> 00:07:08,522
You’ll give out random answers?!

134
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:09,889
Huh?

135
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:14,737
We already cheated on the exam!

136
00:07:15,988 --> 00:07:18,074
Now, we're gonna
scam our clients too?!

137
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:18,574
Lin!

138
00:07:18,574 --> 00:07:19,450
What’s that?

139
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:20,618
Listen to me.

140
00:07:21,952 --> 00:07:23,454
They’re already rich.

141
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:25,349
Fifty thousand Pesos is just
a loose change to them.

142
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:27,792
Think of how we’ll
get our money back?

143
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:32,354
Okay.

144
00:07:32,379 --> 00:07:33,606
Alright, Bank.

145
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,303
But maybe you didn’t think
about the future of the 800 students

146
00:07:39,637 --> 00:07:41,305
who are relying on us!

147
00:07:41,305 --> 00:07:42,306
How?

148
00:07:43,057 --> 00:07:44,091
Huh?

149
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:47,269
They’ll fail!

150
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:49,188
Then let them fail, Lin!

151
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:51,774
They wanted to cheat, right?

152
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:54,819
They should accept the fact
that they'll be cheated too.

153
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,827
What happened to you?

154
00:08:03,786 --> 00:08:04,826
Huh?

155
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:06,413
Since when have
you been like this?

156
00:08:06,413 --> 00:08:07,515
Been what?

157
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,958
Become a bad person?

158
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:12,628
Unlike you, Lin,
you won’t lose anything.

159
00:08:12,628 --> 00:08:15,047
Whatever the result is,
you can still study abroad,

160
00:08:15,047 --> 00:08:15,981
both of you!

161
00:08:16,006 --> 00:08:17,758
You can also study abroad!

162
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:21,261
Right?

163
00:08:22,972 --> 00:08:24,073
Bank!

164
00:08:24,098 --> 00:08:26,100
That has nothing
to do with this!

165
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,268
What do you mean nothing, Lin?!

166
00:08:28,644 --> 00:08:29,687
Think about it!

167
00:08:30,813 --> 00:08:34,150
If you have no money, if
you can’t study anymore,

168
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,860
if you have no future,

169
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,447
if all of this, you’re just holding
onto a knife’s edge, think about it.

170
00:08:39,947 --> 00:08:40,990
Let’s think about
this, let’s think—

171
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,575
Will you think of other people?

172
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,618
Or will I just think of myself?

173
00:08:44,618 --> 00:08:45,786
Holy shit, wait.

174
00:08:47,329 --> 00:08:48,789
Let's not all act clean here.

175
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,125
We all need money.

176
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,043
Maybe I need it more
than you guys.

177
00:08:53,836 --> 00:08:55,671
But my plan already failed.

178
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,925
My plan failed and I don't want everything
I built for three months to go to waste.

179
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,161
Everything I worked hard
for us to be here.

180
00:09:03,262 --> 00:09:04,889
I don’t want it to be ruined.

181
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:08,641
Wait.

182
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
You said,

183
00:09:11,187 --> 00:09:13,522
you worked hard
to bring us together?

184
00:09:17,443 --> 00:09:20,446
You know after graduation,
Grace and I are going to Boston?

185
00:09:21,655 --> 00:09:22,656
You’re taking so long.

186
00:09:23,193 --> 00:09:23,866
Sorry, boss.

187
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:25,284
We almost got into an accident.

188
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,267
I didn’t mean it.

189
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:35,211
Yes, I paid them to
mess up your shop.

190
00:09:35,211 --> 00:09:37,188
But I didn’t tell them
to hurt your mom.

191
00:09:37,213 --> 00:09:38,672
I just want you to help us.

192
00:09:38,672 --> 00:09:39,840
Well, it already
happened, right?

193
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,841
But she’s fine!

194
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:43,427
You already got your 500k.

195
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:45,905
If you want, I'll give
you half of my share.

196
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,947
Idiot!

197
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:48,824
Not everything can
be solved with money!

198
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:50,476
- Bank.
- Bank, we’re desperate.

199
00:09:50,476 --> 00:09:52,519
If all this didn’t happen,
you wouldn’t have said yes.

200
00:09:53,229 --> 00:09:55,314
Just remember,
Pat. I’m telling you.

201
00:09:55,689 --> 00:09:57,233
I'll give all this back to you.

202
00:09:58,484 --> 00:10:01,362
Were you the one who
leaked the STIC?

203
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:02,655
Huh?

204
00:10:32,309 --> 00:10:33,309
Come on, Tristan.

205
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,104
It’s over.

206
00:10:35,104 --> 00:10:36,563
There’s nothing
we can do anymore.

207
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:45,363
Sorry, Mom.

208
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:48,701
I just wanted you
to proceed with the surgery.

209
00:10:51,787 --> 00:10:52,787
Tristan.

210
00:10:58,369 --> 00:11:01,038
Maybe not this way.

211
00:11:02,187 --> 00:11:05,065
All your hard work was wasted.

212
00:11:06,343 --> 00:11:07,344
Such a waste.

213
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:17,895
No, Mom.

214
00:11:19,356 --> 00:11:20,524
I’ll make it up.

215
00:11:24,695 --> 00:11:26,655
I’ll still give you a good life.

216
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:28,240
No matter what happens.

217
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:40,209
Let's go.

218
00:11:50,137 --> 00:11:54,016
Your father tells me that you
almost got a perfect score at the STIC.

219
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:57,603
So do you have any advice,
to inspire other students?

220
00:11:57,968 --> 00:11:59,427
I guess you just
gotta put in the work

221
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,316
and do whatever it
takes to make it to the top.

222
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:05,694
You must be very proud of Pat.

223
00:12:05,694 --> 00:12:06,945
Oh, yeah.

224
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,280
Very, very proud.

225
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:16,455
The STIC results are in.

226
00:12:16,455 --> 00:12:17,039
Yup.

227
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:18,732
She’s in the top percentile.

228
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,126
Ah, Grace.

229
00:12:21,877 --> 00:12:23,504
We’re very proud of you.

230
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:24,505
All of us. Hmm.

231
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:26,357
Good job, Grace.

232
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:27,257
Okay?

233
00:12:27,257 --> 00:12:28,400
Keep it up.

234
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:29,510
Thanks, Dad.

235
00:12:30,512 --> 00:12:31,722
It was nothing.

236
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:33,179
Really.

237
00:12:36,016 --> 00:12:37,029
This can’t be.

238
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,687
They all got what
they want except me.

239
00:12:44,311 --> 00:12:46,354
It was declared
by the universities

240
00:12:46,527 --> 00:12:51,573
that all STIC results coming from
this round are automatically invalid.

241
00:12:51,782 --> 00:12:55,369
The Education Commission
continues to investigate

242
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:58,163
the cheating scandal
and those involved in it.

243
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:17,808
Huh, Bank?!

244
00:13:17,808 --> 00:13:19,977
- Were you the one who snitched?
- Yes! Yes!

245
00:13:19,977 --> 00:13:20,978
Yes, Pat!

246
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,815
I’m the one responsible
for all of that.

247
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:27,943
But what's the difference between
what I did and what you did to me?

248
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,002
Huh?

249
00:13:29,027 --> 00:13:30,821
- You bastard, Bank! Huh!
- Stop! Enough!

250
00:13:30,821 --> 00:13:31,864
- Huh?!
- Let go of me!

251
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:34,116
- Enough!
- What?!

252
00:13:34,783 --> 00:13:36,910
Do you understand now, Pat?

253
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:41,623
Now you know the feeling of
having no other option but to cheat.

254
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,166
Huh?

255
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,170
You know what, Pat?

256
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,880
You’re already free from your father.

257
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:50,223
And me,

258
00:13:51,216 --> 00:13:54,511
money is the replacement for
everything that was taken from me.

259
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:58,223
You needed me at
the STIC back then.

260
00:13:58,682 --> 00:14:00,809
And I need you here
at the NCET, Pat.

261
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:06,148
That’s why you have no
other choice but to go with me

262
00:14:06,148 --> 00:14:09,026
until the end just like how
I went with you back then, right?

263
00:14:14,156 --> 00:14:15,156
What?

264
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,910
Who else wants to continue this?

265
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,958
Let’s vote!

266
00:14:19,786 --> 00:14:20,934
Bank!

267
00:14:21,121 --> 00:14:22,302
Bank!

268
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:23,583
No!

269
00:14:25,292 --> 00:14:26,294
No!

270
00:14:28,086 --> 00:14:29,130
Grace!

271
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:30,192
What?

272
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:37,013
So, Pat?

273
00:14:41,183 --> 00:14:42,809
Whatever Pat says.

274
00:14:49,066 --> 00:14:50,108
You’re embarrassing!

275
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:51,860
You were even
arrogant in the interview!

276
00:14:52,194 --> 00:14:53,237
My god!

277
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:57,449
I gave you everything you
needed, all your luxuries

278
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:00,953
I indulged you and this
is what I get in return?

279
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,709
Dad, I'm trying my best.

280
00:15:09,461 --> 00:15:12,297
But honestly, I don’t
want to go to BU.

281
00:15:14,508 --> 00:15:16,718
I’m already struggling
with your expectations.

282
00:15:18,387 --> 00:15:19,387
I could...

283
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:22,015
I could never be like you.

284
00:15:24,226 --> 00:15:25,226
No.

285
00:15:26,103 --> 00:15:27,938
But you are a Tioseco.

286
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,858
And you will graduate
from Boston University.

287
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:35,559
You will retake the
STIC and get,

288
00:15:35,592 --> 00:15:40,033
by studying, the high
marks that you got before.

289
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,368
Or else...

290
00:15:41,368 --> 00:15:42,786
Or else you’ll do what, Dad?

291
00:15:43,662 --> 00:15:46,582
No matter what I do, I
am never enough for you.

292
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:51,587
You silly, stupid boy.

293
00:15:51,587 --> 00:15:53,589
You are nothing without me.

294
00:15:53,714 --> 00:15:56,383
Everything you
have came from me,

295
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:58,427
don’t you ever forget that.

296
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:01,013
Well, I’m done
living off with you.

297
00:16:02,014 --> 00:16:03,140
I can do it on my own.

298
00:16:04,016 --> 00:16:05,475
Cut me off, throw me off.

299
00:16:08,145 --> 00:16:09,293
I don’t care anymore.

300
00:16:10,647 --> 00:16:11,898
Well, neither do I.

301
00:16:12,316 --> 00:16:14,359
See if you can
survive without me.

302
00:16:14,359 --> 00:16:15,669
Go ahead.

303
00:16:15,694 --> 00:16:17,070
Go ahead and fail!

304
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:25,412
Grace, print the answers.

305
00:16:25,964 --> 00:16:26,673
Pat!

306
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,752
Lin, I don’t want to
go back to my dad.

307
00:16:33,503 --> 00:16:35,047
So we’re going to continue this.

308
00:16:35,881 --> 00:16:36,815
Hon.

309
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,342
Print it now, quick!

310
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:39,109
Sis,

311
00:16:39,134 --> 00:16:40,134
Sis!

312
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:52,189
I'm sorry, Lin.

313
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,730
Yup.

314
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,444
I have to stand by Pat.

315
00:17:00,238 --> 00:17:01,323
- Okay, Grace.
- Okay.

316
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:05,369
If that's your final decision,

317
00:17:05,911 --> 00:17:08,080
I have nothing to do with this.

318
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:11,166
I get it.

319
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,126
I get it.

320
00:17:14,544 --> 00:17:15,045
Okay, Grace.

321
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:16,672
Just remove one
letter then print it.

322
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:17,697
Go ahead.

323
00:17:21,051 --> 00:17:22,051
Lin.

324
00:17:25,472 --> 00:17:26,556
Just play along.

325
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,142
You won’t lose anything.

326
00:17:30,185 --> 00:17:31,645
Just turn a
blind eye to this, Lin.

327
00:17:54,501 --> 00:17:55,627
Let's go, Grace.

328
00:17:56,795 --> 00:17:57,921
Okay, I'll go.

329
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,881
- I'll print now.
- Come on, let's print it.

330
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:22,337
Lin!

331
00:18:22,362 --> 00:18:23,488
Where have you been?

332
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:24,823
Why are you only coming home now?

333
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:30,036
I'm so sorry, Dad.

334
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:37,919
I'm so sorry.

335
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:45,302
I'll tell you everything.

336
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,764
But I hope...

337
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:51,099
I hope to ask
something from you.

338
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:53,851
What is it?

339
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,318
I hope you’ll come with me to
the Educational Commission.

340
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:04,321
They need to know
something important.

341
00:19:11,745 --> 00:19:12,745
Okay.

342
00:19:15,499 --> 00:19:16,750
I'm sorry, Dad.

343
00:19:18,168 --> 00:19:19,795
I hope you won’t be mad.

344
00:19:24,007 --> 00:19:24,716
I'm sorry, Dad.

345
00:19:24,716 --> 00:19:26,218
It's okay.

346
00:19:26,218 --> 00:19:27,844
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

347
00:19:33,475 --> 00:19:35,811
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to.

348
00:19:36,102 --> 00:19:37,102
It's okay.

349
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:38,646
Lin.

350
00:19:39,731 --> 00:19:40,731
It's okay.

351
00:19:44,653 --> 00:19:45,987
I'm sorry, Dad.

352
00:20:07,133 --> 00:20:09,886
Chaos ensued at several
testing sites this morning

353
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:11,304
when a sudden halt

354
00:20:11,304 --> 00:20:13,348
to the National College Entrance
Test was ordered,

355
00:20:13,348 --> 00:20:16,601
due to the revelation of a
leakage in the test questions.

356
00:20:47,632 --> 00:20:49,467
According to the
Education Commission,

357
00:20:49,467 --> 00:20:51,970
a 17-year-old student

358
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,223
let’s hide under the name
Angel, voluntarily reported

359
00:20:55,223 --> 00:20:57,851
that she and
three of her friends

360
00:20:57,851 --> 00:21:00,520
attempted to steal the
NCET questionnaire

361
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,025
and sell it to some
clients for 50,000 pesos.

362
00:21:05,025 --> 00:21:06,025
What?

363
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,236
This can't be happening.

364
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:09,821
What do we do, Grace?

365
00:21:11,364 --> 00:21:13,033
We should've
just listened to Lin.

366
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:15,785
We should've just stopped
and returned the money.

367
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:22,767
Cops.

368
00:21:22,792 --> 00:21:23,792
Wait.

369
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,085
We don't know yet.

370
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:29,257
We'll just deny everything.

371
00:21:29,257 --> 00:21:30,258
I'll do the talking, okay?

372
00:21:33,011 --> 00:21:33,862
Dad?

373
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:34,971
How did you find me?

374
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,781
That's really not important.

375
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:38,975
I need to have a
word with my son.

376
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:41,519
You’d better just
go home, Grace.

377
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,854
The driver will take you.

378
00:21:43,063 --> 00:21:43,830
No.

379
00:21:43,855 --> 00:21:44,940
Grace stays here.

380
00:21:45,607 --> 00:21:47,192
Tell me what you want
to say in front of her.

381
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,217
Alright.

382
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,487
I've made all the arrangements.

383
00:21:50,487 --> 00:21:52,030
You're going to the US.

384
00:21:52,238 --> 00:21:53,615
You'll study there.

385
00:21:54,115 --> 00:21:55,533
And we have to leave now.

386
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:57,661
Your flight's in four hours.

387
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,079
And as for this scandal,

388
00:21:59,579 --> 00:22:00,413
I'll take care of it

389
00:22:00,413 --> 00:22:04,334
like I always do whenever
you mess around.

390
00:22:05,001 --> 00:22:05,418
What?

391
00:22:05,418 --> 00:22:09,506
And we have no time to
dwell on your stupid mistakes.

392
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:10,273
No.

393
00:22:10,298 --> 00:22:11,299
What about Grace?

394
00:22:11,424 --> 00:22:13,885
It’s better if you break up.

395
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:21,618
What?

396
00:22:21,643 --> 00:22:23,603
Grace and I can’t break up, Dad.

397
00:22:24,479 --> 00:22:25,479
And what?

398
00:22:26,106 --> 00:22:27,440
You're going to
stay here with her

399
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,944
and when you’re jailed, you
think you’ll be together in one cell?

400
00:22:31,361 --> 00:22:32,361
Jesus.

401
00:22:33,363 --> 00:22:34,363
Dad, please.

402
00:22:34,614 --> 00:22:35,407
I'm begging you.

403
00:22:35,407 --> 00:22:36,783
Please help Grace too.

404
00:22:37,158 --> 00:22:38,410
We'll be together.

405
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:39,285
I'll do anything.

406
00:22:39,285 --> 00:22:40,912
I won’t rebel anymore.

407
00:22:40,912 --> 00:22:41,871
Please, Dad.

408
00:22:42,038 --> 00:22:43,289
A federal lawyer.

409
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:44,516
A good one.

410
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:46,876
But you can’t be
together anymore.

411
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:49,295
Aside from her
father not allowing it,

412
00:22:49,295 --> 00:22:52,215
all you do is bring
trouble and problems.

413
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:56,845
You never learned
from what you did.

414
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,970
You wanna help her?

415
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,306
Just obey.

416
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:03,977
I'll wait for you in the car.

417
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:11,191
Hon.

418
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:13,277
I'm sorry.

419
00:23:14,988 --> 00:23:16,573
I don't wanna leave you.

420
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,708
I'm gonna miss you.

421
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:42,015
It's okay, Hon.

422
00:23:44,392 --> 00:23:46,269
You know, maybe
your dad is right.

423
00:23:49,566 --> 00:23:53,026
We'll just call and
I'll video chat you.

424
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:57,197
And maybe if my dad lets
me, I'll just visit you there.

425
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:07,832
I love you so much.

426
00:24:10,478 --> 00:24:11,478
I love you.

427
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:19,302
Good bye.

428
00:24:30,688 --> 00:24:31,688
That's him.

429
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:33,631
- That's him, alright.
- There.

430
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:36,891
Tristan Bangkat.

431
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:40,573
We have a warrant
of arrest for you.

432
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,952
Uh, what is this?

433
00:24:43,952 --> 00:24:44,552
Why?

434
00:24:44,577 --> 00:24:45,870
Your son has a case.

435
00:24:46,822 --> 00:24:47,822
Case?

436
00:24:49,499 --> 00:24:50,499
Huh?

437
00:24:51,793 --> 00:24:54,729
Tristan, you have the
right to remain silent.

438
00:24:54,754 --> 00:24:58,508
Anything you say can and will
be used for or against you in court.

439
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:00,885
You also have the right
to get your own lawyer.

440
00:25:00,885 --> 00:25:02,403
- And if you can’t afford one,
- Wait a moment.

441
00:25:02,428 --> 00:25:04,305
- the government will provide one.
- Please wait.

442
00:25:04,639 --> 00:25:06,015
- Do you understand your rights?
- Please wait.

443
00:25:06,766 --> 00:25:07,976
Please wait.

444
00:25:09,018 --> 00:25:10,145
Hold on a second.

445
00:25:11,396 --> 00:25:13,189
- What did you do?
- Sorry, Mom.

446
00:25:13,648 --> 00:25:14,983
Sorry, Mom.

447
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,317
Don't worry, Tristan.

448
00:25:16,442 --> 00:25:19,529
Tristan, I’ll get a good lawyer.

449
00:25:19,529 --> 00:25:20,864
I won’t abandon you.

450
00:25:20,864 --> 00:25:21,823
Remember that.

451
00:25:21,823 --> 00:25:23,199
I’m right here.

452
00:25:23,224 --> 00:25:24,868
Come on now, come with us.

453
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:27,704
- Please wait.
- Mom, don’t leave me.

454
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:29,305
Come now, come with us.

455
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:29,956
Come now, come on!

456
00:25:29,956 --> 00:25:31,499
- Mom!
- Wait! Wait!

457
00:25:31,499 --> 00:25:32,809
Mom!

458
00:25:32,834 --> 00:25:34,586
Mom, no! Come with me!

459
00:25:35,086 --> 00:25:36,105
Mom!

460
00:25:36,588 --> 00:25:37,547
- Mom!
- Come now!

461
00:25:37,547 --> 00:25:39,966
All test scores will be voided

462
00:25:39,966 --> 00:25:43,970
and a new round of the NCET
will be conducted next month.

463
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:47,056
Two more have been arrested

464
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:49,851
for cheating in the NCET exams.

465
00:25:50,226 --> 00:25:53,855
A former professor,
identified as Maya Salinas

466
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:57,108
was the clients' contact in
the cheating scandal.

467
00:25:57,317 --> 00:26:02,155
Her license will be revoked and
her tutorial center will be shut down.

468
00:26:04,908 --> 00:26:06,701
An investigation
was also conducted

469
00:26:06,701 --> 00:26:09,996
among the employees
working at DL Printing

470
00:26:09,996 --> 00:26:12,373
because of the
NCET exam scandal.

471
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:25,553
It was also decided in the
fiscal’s preliminary investigation

472
00:26:25,553 --> 00:26:28,056
that alias "Angel" and alias "Baby"

473
00:26:28,056 --> 00:26:32,769
will both be acquitted due
to lack of intent in their cases

474
00:26:32,977 --> 00:26:36,439
and also because of their
clean criminal records.

475
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:47,742
I'm sorry this happened to you.

476
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:57,835
I should've apologized too.

477
00:26:59,128 --> 00:27:00,168
You know,

478
00:27:00,363 --> 00:27:02,340
I should've just
listened to you.

479
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,217
I shouldn't have
printed those answers

480
00:27:04,217 --> 00:27:06,302
and I should've just
stopped it right there.

481
00:27:09,514 --> 00:27:12,574
It's okay.

482
00:27:19,983 --> 00:27:20,988
You know,

483
00:27:22,527 --> 00:27:23,903
when the cops came,

484
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:26,739
I thought I was
going to be scared.

485
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:32,954
But honestly, for some reason,

486
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:36,541
I felt like a weight had
been lifted off of my chest.

487
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,919
I don't have to lie anymore.

488
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,088
I don't have to pretend anymore.

489
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,590
Thank you, Attorney.

490
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:52,389
Grace.

491
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:02,942
Didn’t I tell you

492
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:05,945
to stay away from her?

493
00:28:19,042 --> 00:28:20,042
Sis.

494
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:38,518
Let’s go.

495
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:43,815
Attorney.

496
00:28:55,578 --> 00:28:57,538
I’ll always visit you.

497
00:29:02,293 --> 00:29:05,004
The alleged mastermind
of the cheating scandal

498
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:07,090
hidden under the alias "Charles"

499
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:11,552
will be detained in a
Youth Detention Center for a year

500
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,515
due to his previous case
of cheating in the last STIC.

501
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:18,496
Dad.

502
00:30:20,246 --> 00:30:22,665
I brought you modules

503
00:30:23,583 --> 00:30:26,752
so you'll stay updated with the lessons
even if you’re not in school.

504
00:30:30,047 --> 00:30:31,047
Thank you, Dad.

505
00:30:35,678 --> 00:30:37,263
Do you have any problems?

506
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:39,682
You look sad.

507
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,642
Nothing, Dad.

508
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:45,897
I just feel guilty because
you're still kind to me

509
00:30:46,522 --> 00:30:48,262
even though I'm
a bad daughter to you.

510
00:30:49,734 --> 00:30:51,736
I keep on disappointing you.

511
00:30:56,483 --> 00:30:57,483
Is that so?

512
00:30:58,951 --> 00:31:01,162
I think, maybe...

513
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:04,665
maybe I should be

514
00:31:05,708 --> 00:31:07,668
more disappointed to myself.

515
00:31:09,378 --> 00:31:10,463
You know, Lin,

516
00:31:11,005 --> 00:31:12,965
I knew nothing
about being a father

517
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:14,592
before you came.

518
00:31:16,719 --> 00:31:18,012
So maybe

519
00:31:19,138 --> 00:31:20,890
I was the one lacking,

520
00:31:21,516 --> 00:31:23,309
maybe I didn’t even know

521
00:31:23,893 --> 00:31:26,437
how to truly
raise you properly.

522
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
But

523
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,734
don’t you ever say,

524
00:31:32,568 --> 00:31:34,820
that you’re a disappointment
to me. Because you’re not.

525
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:36,489
I even admire you.

526
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:39,450
You’re not just smart.

527
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,663
You make mistakes, yes.

528
00:31:43,663 --> 00:31:44,288
But,

529
00:31:45,915 --> 00:31:49,210
you know in your heart
what's right to fix yourself.

530
00:31:50,169 --> 00:31:52,171
You still choose
to do what’s right.

531
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,298
And because of that,

532
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:58,135
you’re a blessing to me.

533
00:31:58,594 --> 00:31:59,971
I’m proud of you.

534
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,430
No, Dad.

535
00:32:05,017 --> 00:32:07,478
Have you ever had
a student like that?

536
00:32:09,939 --> 00:32:11,023
Which one,

537
00:32:11,566 --> 00:32:13,693
the proper, decent, smart one?

538
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:17,530
I don’t know, maybe.

539
00:32:18,531 --> 00:32:20,908
The only thing I can
do as a teacher...

540
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,579
is my best,

541
00:32:25,371 --> 00:32:30,293
hoping that someday, one of those
kids will learn something from me.

542
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:32,587
Even if

543
00:32:33,588 --> 00:32:35,339
I don't personally see their growth,

544
00:32:36,215 --> 00:32:37,383
it doesn't matter to me anymore.

545
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:41,846
The best student of my
life is right here by my side.

546
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:46,088
That’s you.

547
00:32:47,018 --> 00:32:48,060
Thank you, Dad.

548
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:52,732
Love you, Dad.

549
00:32:52,732 --> 00:32:53,733
I love you, Linlin.

550
00:32:53,733 --> 00:32:55,151
Don’t be sad anymore, okay?

551
00:32:56,444 --> 00:32:57,486
Thanks again.

552
00:32:58,237 --> 00:32:59,237
Don’t mention it.

553
00:33:22,419 --> 00:33:23,419
Hi.

554
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:26,932
I hope that the auditorium

555
00:33:27,308 --> 00:33:30,770
gets done in time for
your batch's graduation

556
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:32,854
You know,

557
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:36,067
I genuinely thought

558
00:33:36,484 --> 00:33:39,779
either you or Tristan would
be valedictorian of your class.

559
00:33:41,482 --> 00:33:42,567
As it turns out,

560
00:33:44,867 --> 00:33:47,662
in the history of
Possenti, the top

561
00:33:47,953 --> 00:33:48,958
students

562
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:53,459
were also the ones who did the
most shameful act they could possibly do.

563
00:33:54,669 --> 00:33:56,337
Maybe in the next tournament,

564
00:33:56,629 --> 00:33:58,839
Possenti might also
make it to the championship

565
00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:00,800
if Lin plays.

566
00:34:08,891 --> 00:34:11,227
That is if you'll give her a chance

567
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:13,437
to be a scholar of Possenti.

568
00:34:14,522 --> 00:34:16,691
Well, that's asking
for too much, Vin.

569
00:34:18,526 --> 00:34:19,502
I know.

570
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:23,197
That’s why I’m thankful you
came so you could witness Lin.

571
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,241
that she could be
the student to win

572
00:34:25,241 --> 00:34:27,076
all of your academic
competitions

573
00:34:27,076 --> 00:34:29,161
if you give her a chance.

574
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:32,101
You're right.

575
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,084
I mean, she's
highly intelligent.

576
00:34:37,211 --> 00:34:39,463
I would like to ask
for your forgiveness.

577
00:34:40,464 --> 00:34:42,341
I'm truly sorry for
everything that happened.

578
00:34:43,467 --> 00:34:45,678
You could expel me, but...

579
00:34:46,137 --> 00:34:47,154
you didn't.

580
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:48,179
Right.

581
00:34:49,807 --> 00:34:52,768
You should also be punished
like what happened to Tristan.

582
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:54,562
But,

583
00:34:55,271 --> 00:34:56,789
you have shown remorse.

584
00:34:56,814 --> 00:34:58,441
You surrendered
to the authorities.

585
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,901
Which brings me to my point.

586
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:05,406
I think, you don’t
need to leave Possenti.

587
00:35:06,699 --> 00:35:08,117
But I need your help.

588
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,660
What is that?

589
00:35:12,747 --> 00:35:13,747
This year,

590
00:35:14,707 --> 00:35:17,251
applications opened

591
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:20,296
for Alami-Khatib Scholarship.

592
00:35:21,172 --> 00:35:22,965
This only happens
every two years

593
00:35:23,591 --> 00:35:24,592
for applicants.

594
00:35:25,468 --> 00:35:29,138
In my opinion, this is the
most difficult scholarship

595
00:35:29,305 --> 00:35:30,389
compared to all.

596
00:35:31,265 --> 00:35:36,854
You will be competing against
students from all over Southeast Asia.

597
00:35:39,523 --> 00:35:40,526
And,

598
00:35:42,526 --> 00:35:45,154
Lin, I think you’re the
only one who can win this

599
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:46,655
in the whole school.

600
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:56,665
I thought I made
the right choice.

601
00:35:57,458 --> 00:35:59,710
But was my choice
right for everyone?

602
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:03,881
Maybe we can ask
Grace's family for donations.

603
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:06,133
Don't they own a chain
of printing presses?

604
00:36:06,759 --> 00:36:07,791
Right.

605
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:10,262
Ask her Dad if he
can sponsor us.

606
00:36:12,098 --> 00:36:13,098
Hi, man.

607
00:36:14,362 --> 00:36:15,851
If you need help
with your report,

608
00:36:16,143 --> 00:36:18,896
you can just pay a
guy, to write it for you.

609
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:20,924
I know someone.

610
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:22,792
You want his number?

611
00:36:22,817 --> 00:36:24,401
I know what you're thinking.

612
00:36:25,402 --> 00:36:26,153
Lin, you know what?

613
00:36:26,153 --> 00:36:27,571
This is just how the system is.

614
00:36:27,571 --> 00:36:29,073
This is how the world works.

615
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:32,159
If you win this scholarship,
you get to go to school here.

616
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:35,246
And next year, your dreams
of going to school abroad,

617
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:36,413
will come true.

618
00:36:36,705 --> 00:36:38,707
I've made my final
decision just now.

619
00:36:38,999 --> 00:36:41,085
One of us should be
able to get in there.

620
00:36:41,377 --> 00:36:42,837
Maybe it takes

621
00:36:43,129 --> 00:36:47,633
a good cheater to redesign a
system without poverty and corruption.

622
00:36:47,758 --> 00:36:49,093
The decision is yours, Bank.
