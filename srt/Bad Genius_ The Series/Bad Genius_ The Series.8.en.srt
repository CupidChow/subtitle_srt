1
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:45,421
Aren’t you earning from
leaking exam answers?

2
00:00:47,687 --> 00:00:48,579
Teach me.

3
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:50,690
I need money for
mom's operation.

4
00:00:50,715 --> 00:00:52,775
He’ll just cry and throw
up, he can’t handle this.

5
00:00:52,775 --> 00:00:54,819
Let’s forget what
happened to us at school.

6
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:56,320
This is a different
situation now.

7
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,757
We’ll go to Australia
and take the STIC exam.

8
00:00:59,782 --> 00:01:00,966
Thank you, Boss Pat.

9
00:01:00,991 --> 00:01:04,203
What about the money from
the laundry shop you ordered us to steal?

10
00:01:05,047 --> 00:01:06,013
It's all yours.

11
00:01:06,038 --> 00:01:06,889
Go on.

12
00:01:06,914 --> 00:01:08,057
Leave now.

13
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:09,016
I caught you!

14
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,140
I heard everything outside!

15
00:01:10,165 --> 00:01:12,530
That the men who
gave you flowers

16
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,272
were the same men you
ordered to rob our shop!

17
00:01:18,884 --> 00:01:20,413
Grace, Pat.

18
00:01:20,438 --> 00:01:21,821
This is it!

19
00:01:21,846 --> 00:01:23,624
We’re already in Australia.

20
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,530
How will we give out the answers?

21
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,838
We’ll bring spare phones.

22
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:42,074
We’ll hide the spare phones in
the CR, inside the toilet tank.

23
00:02:15,783 --> 00:02:18,243
[In the ceiling.]

24
00:04:29,575 --> 00:04:30,575
Hello?

25
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:32,511
Vin.

26
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:33,231
Nona.

27
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:35,871
Can I speak to Lin?

28
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:37,356
I can’t reach her.

29
00:04:37,381 --> 00:04:38,879
Is she there?

30
00:04:39,168 --> 00:04:39,768
Huh?

31
00:04:39,793 --> 00:04:41,003
What are you talking about?

32
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:42,838
How would Lin even come here?

33
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,131
Stop joking around.

34
00:04:44,131 --> 00:04:45,299
It’s like you don’t
know anything.

35
00:04:45,299 --> 00:04:46,926
Weren’t you the
one who invited her?

36
00:04:46,926 --> 00:04:48,719
And sent her a ticket.

37
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:49,970
You bought her a
ticket, didn’t you?

38
00:04:50,346 --> 00:04:51,597
I bought her a ticket?

39
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,032
Hold on.

40
00:04:53,057 --> 00:04:55,784
You know, I do talk
to your daughter,

41
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:57,394
but our conversations
are always cut short.

42
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:59,438
And yes, I offered
for her to study here,

43
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:02,473
but she said she’s studying
there in the Philippines,

44
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:03,859
so there’s nothing—

45
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:06,904
we never talked
about it further.

46
00:05:07,237 --> 00:05:08,547
Are you joking?

47
00:05:08,572 --> 00:05:11,075
She messaged me earlier.
She’s already in Sydney.

48
00:05:11,634 --> 00:05:12,301
She even sent—

49
00:05:12,326 --> 00:05:14,495
Wait, I’ll send you
the screenshot.

50
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:15,645
Hold on.

51
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,153
Hello?

52
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:28,467
Vin, I don’t know
anything about this.

53
00:05:28,968 --> 00:05:30,098
And also,

54
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,889
I’m not buying
her a plane ticket.

55
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:33,555
You mean to say,

56
00:05:33,555 --> 00:05:35,182
my daughter is in Sydney.

57
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,643
All by herself?

58
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,187
What should I do?

59
00:05:40,187 --> 00:05:42,481
Should I buy a
ticket to follow her?

60
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:43,482
Should I call the police?

61
00:05:43,482 --> 00:05:44,208
What do I do?

62
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,567
Wait, calm down.

63
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:48,570
We can’t be reckless
with what we’re saying

64
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:49,488
and what we’re doing.

65
00:05:49,488 --> 00:05:52,241
What’s important
is we first find out

66
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,702
where Lin is, or

67
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,328
if she’s safe, or whatever.

68
00:05:56,578 --> 00:05:59,415
You know, during my last call
with her, which was weeks ago,

69
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:03,127
at that time, she was
at the STIC center.

70
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:05,254
She said she had an exam.

71
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,340
Okay, but our
conversation didn’t go on.

72
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,848
It's still cut short.

73
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:15,746
Wait, there’s—

74
00:06:18,475 --> 00:06:20,394
There’s an STIC reviewer here.

75
00:06:30,696 --> 00:06:31,735
Vin.

76
00:06:32,531 --> 00:06:35,659
There’s an exam happening at
the Sydney Center right now.

77
00:06:36,118 --> 00:06:38,954
I can visit her in Sydney.

78
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:39,638
She can—

79
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:41,331
She can just stay here with me.

80
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:45,252
Why would she take
the STIC exam there?

81
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:48,213
That’s exactly what I’m
wondering, that’s why I’m confused.

82
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:49,922
Because, first of all,

83
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,052
where would she get
the money to buy a ticket,

84
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:54,470
if not from you or me?

85
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,514
And how would she pay
for her accommodations?

86
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:00,075
Wait,

87
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,144
Vin, did you get a
large sum of money?

88
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:03,937
Let’s not talk about money.

89
00:07:04,897 --> 00:07:08,692
The question is, why did she take
the STIC exam in the first place?

90
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:10,044
Because didn’t she say,

91
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:11,361
she said

92
00:07:11,528 --> 00:07:13,405
she really wants
to study, right?

93
00:07:13,405 --> 00:07:14,782
She wants to go
to college abroad.

94
00:07:14,782 --> 00:07:18,285
And specifically, she
said she wants the USA.

95
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:19,563
Yes.

96
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:20,162
She wants that.

97
00:07:20,162 --> 00:07:21,538
But she can’t take the STIC.

98
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:22,790
She’s not allowed.

99
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:24,969
Why?

100
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:29,213
She didn’t tell you.

101
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,467
Lin got suspended from school

102
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:35,844
because she got involved
in a cheating scheme.

103
00:07:37,346 --> 00:07:38,722
Lin cheated?

104
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:41,308
That's impossible, Vin.

105
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:43,393
It’s absolutely impossible
she didn’t cheat.

106
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:45,204
She was the one giving answers,

107
00:07:45,229 --> 00:07:46,656
in exchange for money.

108
00:07:47,356 --> 00:07:48,656
I don’t know, maybe…

109
00:07:49,942 --> 00:07:51,735
Maybe it’s my fault, because…

110
00:07:54,204 --> 00:07:56,456
I couldn’t provide extra.

111
00:07:57,282 --> 00:07:59,201
I don’t even know what
our daughter is doing.

112
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:01,161
Go ahead, say
what you want to say.

113
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:03,372
Vin, come on.

114
00:08:03,372 --> 00:08:03,997
Wait, right?

115
00:08:03,997 --> 00:08:05,749
This isn’t the time for drama.

116
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:06,917
What’s important

117
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:09,336
is to find out where Lin
is, where our daughter is,

118
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:11,421
if she’s safe, what’s
happening to her.

119
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:15,425
Okay, here’s the plan.

120
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,927
I’ll go see her in Sydney.

121
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:18,679
I’ll go there, I’ll drive there.

122
00:08:18,804 --> 00:08:20,556
Then I’ll just update you.

123
00:08:21,223 --> 00:08:23,892
I’ll let you know
what’s going on.

124
00:08:24,143 --> 00:08:25,477
Please, Nona, please.

125
00:08:25,686 --> 00:08:28,397
Whatever’s happening or what
our daughter’s going through,

126
00:08:28,397 --> 00:08:30,315
just make sure
she’s okay, please.

127
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,067
Okay, okay.

128
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,152
Alright, alright. Bye.

129
00:08:49,626 --> 00:08:51,670
May I have your
attention, please?

130
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:53,422
Good morning, participants.

131
00:08:54,173 --> 00:08:55,549
Good morning.

132
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,509
My name is Oliver Clark.

133
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,336
Joining me is Ms. Thompson.

134
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,556
We're your proctors
for today's exam.

135
00:09:03,223 --> 00:09:04,224
And before we begin,

136
00:09:04,933 --> 00:09:07,269
I'll state a few basic rules.

137
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,940
Fill out every blank in
your information sheet

138
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,194
as well as every blank
in your answer sheet.

139
00:09:15,527 --> 00:09:17,863
Don't skip any part of the test.

140
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:21,533
Leaving the room is
absolutely forbidden

141
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:23,994
during the duration
of this session.

142
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,596
Additionally,

143
00:09:25,621 --> 00:09:27,956
speaking while in this room

144
00:09:28,457 --> 00:09:30,167
is not allowed as well.

145
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:32,544
Violation of these simple rules,

146
00:09:32,961 --> 00:09:36,340
would lead to immediate
cancellation of your scores.

147
00:09:37,674 --> 00:09:38,859
Am I understood?

148
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,219
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, Mr. Clark.

149
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:43,222
That said, Section 1
is the reading test.

150
00:09:43,222 --> 00:09:46,141
You have 45
minutes allotted for it.

151
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,393
And your time

152
00:09:48,393 --> 00:09:49,686
starts...

153
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:56,985
So, how do we send
over the answers?

154
00:09:57,069 --> 00:09:58,110
Memory.

155
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:02,008
Now.

156
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:14,544
There are four sections in STIC.

157
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,880
So that means we’ll
memorize all of it?

158
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:18,090
Split it.

159
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,281
So, Bank.

160
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:21,360
You memorize the second half.

161
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,763
And then Lin
gets the first half.

162
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,985
B.

163
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:21,987
A, C.

164
00:11:32,247 --> 00:11:33,290
D. C.

165
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:34,875
A, C.

166
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:38,347
Time's up.

167
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:39,623
Pencils down.

168
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,091
Please leave your
test papers on the table.

169
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,813
You will have a
break of 10 minutes

170
00:11:46,219 --> 00:11:48,055
until we hear the bell ring

171
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:52,267
which signifies we have to come
back for the second part of our test.

172
00:11:52,292 --> 00:11:53,711
You may leave now.

173
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:09,659
Did they text yet, Hon?

174
00:12:10,911 --> 00:12:13,330
At this point, they should
be done with the exam.

175
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:16,541
We should receive the
answers at any moment.

176
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:19,436
Okay.

177
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,129
I gotta deal with
the clients first.

178
00:12:21,129 --> 00:12:22,235
Sure, Hon.

179
00:12:32,516 --> 00:12:34,101
Just chill out.

180
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,313
Hey, guys.

181
00:12:37,104 --> 00:12:38,188
Good morning!

182
00:12:39,231 --> 00:12:40,232
Today is a good day.

183
00:12:40,232 --> 00:12:41,124

[Additional 500k if you want
me to send the answers.]

231
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:29,960

of your fee, what's the extra 500k for?]

236
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:59,639

150.

379
00:23:09,694 --> 00:23:10,695
Now for Lin.

380
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:12,030
360.

381
00:23:24,792 --> 00:23:26,169
Okay, answers from Lin.

382
00:23:26,502 --> 00:23:27,437
360.

383
00:23:27,462 --> 00:23:28,850
Okay, 360.

384
00:23:28,952 --> 00:23:29,647
6/7.

385
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:30,866
6/7.

386
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:31,674
0.2.

387
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:32,942
0.2.

388
00:23:32,967 --> 00:23:33,943
1160.

389
00:23:33,968 --> 00:23:34,927
1160.

390
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,195
4.55.

391
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:37,780
4.55.

392
00:23:37,805 --> 00:23:38,656
32.

393
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:39,282
32.

394
00:23:39,307 --> 00:23:40,283
0.7.

395
00:23:40,308 --> 00:23:41,381
0.7.

396
00:23:41,934 --> 00:23:42,452
5.

397
00:23:42,477 --> 00:23:43,678
5.

398
00:23:44,687 --> 00:23:46,170
How long do we have to wait?

399
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:47,565
I’m wasting my time here.

400
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:48,566
Why is it taking so long?

401
00:23:49,859 --> 00:23:50,967
Go.

402
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:17,095
Success is sweeter when
it's earned through hard work,

403
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:17,779
right, son?

404
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:18,946
Yes, dad.

405
00:24:18,971 --> 00:24:20,865
We won't be doing
this forever, right?

406
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,200
It's just this one time.

407
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:23,592
Just this once.

408
00:24:24,477 --> 00:24:25,803
But us,

409
00:24:26,174 --> 00:24:27,366
forever.

410
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,399
Is it going to take long?

411
00:24:55,424 --> 00:24:56,801
We're going to be late.

412
00:24:56,801 --> 00:24:58,428

still pushing through?

413
00:24:59,262 --> 00:25:00,342

414
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:50,396
Guys, please wait for a while.

415
00:25:50,396 --> 00:25:51,205
Pat.

416

417
00:25:52,481 --> 00:25:53,958
We’re about to take the exam!

418
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:55,067

travel, you know.

419

421
00:25:56,986 --> 00:25:57,820
Is it going to happen today?

422
00:25:57,866 --> 00:25:59,864
We’ve been waiting
here for ages.

423
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:00,948
What’s going on?

424
00:26:00,948 --> 00:26:01,532
What time is it already?

425
00:26:01,557 --> 00:26:04,977
Guys, the second
section just finished, okay?

426
00:26:05,203 --> 00:26:06,579
We’re also printing the answers.

427
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:08,331
I just need more patience
from you guys, okay?

428
00:26:08,331 --> 00:26:09,749
What time will we get them?

429
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:13,241
I'll update you guys
right away, okay?

430
00:26:13,377 --> 00:26:15,313
Don't worry,
they’re almost done.

431
00:26:15,338 --> 00:26:17,089
You’ve been
saying that for ages.

432
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:18,491
Seriously?

433
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:20,760
We’re going to be late.

434
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,904
- Promise, it’s almost done, okay?
- It’s so hot here!

435
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:23,971
- I’ll be back.
- Look at the time!

436
00:26:23,971 --> 00:26:25,678
Wait, let me update you.

437
00:26:40,029 --> 00:26:41,155
Wait.

438
00:27:12,986 --> 00:27:15,989
You may start
answering section 3 now.

439
00:27:40,589 --> 00:27:43,050
Excuse me, participants.

440
00:27:43,718 --> 00:27:48,556
I have to step out briefly
for an important matter.

441
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:49,874
Ms. Thompson here

442
00:27:50,308 --> 00:27:52,018
will be supervising

443
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:54,145
until I come back.

444
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:11,537
What’s going on?

445
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:12,955
I’m getting really worried.

446
00:28:12,955 --> 00:28:14,707
What if something
happened to Lin and Bank?

447
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:17,006
Don’t say that.

448
00:28:23,466 --> 00:28:24,400
I'll be back, okay?

449
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:25,897
Yeah, yeah go.

450
00:28:26,647 --> 00:28:27,762
Hurry, okay?

451
00:28:27,762 --> 00:28:28,763
Fast!

452
00:28:29,597 --> 00:28:30,973
Guys, sorry.

453
00:28:30,973 --> 00:28:32,158
- Just a bit more…
- Hey, what now?

454
00:28:32,183 --> 00:28:33,534
We’re going to be late!

455
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,394
- Sorry, our apologies.
- Is there a problem?

456
00:28:35,394 --> 00:28:36,787
We paid good money for this!

457
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:38,456
Guys, calm down.

458
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:39,373
Okay?

459
00:28:39,398 --> 00:28:40,941
We’re on the last section now.

460
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:42,610
That’s all we’re waiting for.

461
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,420
We’re almost done, promise.

462
00:28:44,445 --> 00:28:45,821
Boss, what about us?

463
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,698
We’ve been waiting
here for hours!

464
00:28:47,698 --> 00:28:48,924
Here’s what we’ll do.

465
00:28:48,949 --> 00:28:50,509
We’ll only charge you

466
00:28:50,534 --> 00:28:52,244
for the hours spent here.

467
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,662
- Yeah!
- Right!

468
00:28:53,662 --> 00:28:54,872
Sure, sure, that works!

469
00:28:55,331 --> 00:28:57,166
Alright, I’ll add some.

470
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:57,792
No problem.

471
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:58,417
You better!

472
00:28:58,417 --> 00:28:59,293
Sorry for the hassle!

473
00:28:59,877 --> 00:29:01,504
Everyone!

474
00:29:04,006 --> 00:29:05,966
- Thank you!
- Sorry, sorry for the hassle.

475
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:08,427
Just a little longer, sorry.

476
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:16,744
Time’s up.

477
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:17,853
Pencils down.

478
00:29:18,854 --> 00:29:20,314
But this time,

479
00:29:21,774 --> 00:29:23,526
nobody leaves the room

480
00:29:23,984 --> 00:29:27,071
because there’s an
important announcement.

481
00:29:27,446 --> 00:29:29,240
I’m sorry to disrupt

482
00:29:29,573 --> 00:29:30,699
your break time.

483
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,295
However,

484
00:29:33,751 --> 00:29:35,503
it has come to my attention

485
00:29:37,415 --> 00:29:38,457
that there was

486
00:29:38,874 --> 00:29:40,751
some troublesome misconduct

487
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:44,255
that you should all be aware of.

488
00:29:46,966 --> 00:29:47,967
A phone

489
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:49,844
was found

490
00:29:50,594 --> 00:29:53,514
in the men’s restroom
during break time.

491
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,477
Sorry to announce that the
exam process will be put on hold

492
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:00,855
until we apprehend

493
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:02,690
the individual

494
00:30:02,857 --> 00:30:04,984
who dared engage

495
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,570
in this suspicious activity.

496
00:30:55,743 --> 00:30:56,952

497
00:30:57,912 --> 00:30:58,913
to your pants,

498
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,414
Mr. Bangkat?

499
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,751
Why are they wet?

500
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,295
What?

501
00:31:09,632 --> 00:31:11,300
Not answering my questions?

502
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:13,761
Perhaps you’re hiding something.

503
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,308
Do you recognize this?

504
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,645
Is that your phone?

505
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:29,585
I’m going to ask

506
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,975
one last time,

507
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,258
Mr. Bangkat.

508
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:34,198
Is that your phone?

509
00:31:35,574 --> 00:31:36,780
Answer me!

510
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:46,436
Answer me!

511
00:31:48,712 --> 00:31:50,131
Yes, it’s mine.

512
00:31:50,923 --> 00:31:52,147
There you go.

513
00:31:54,635 --> 00:31:57,471
Stand up and follow
me to the office.

514
00:31:58,847 --> 00:32:00,225
For the rest,

515
00:32:00,516 --> 00:32:01,976
we will continue the exam

516
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:04,311
under the supervision
of Ms. Thompson

517
00:32:05,271 --> 00:32:07,523
who will make sure all rules

518
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:09,817
are followed in my absence.

519
00:32:23,998 --> 00:32:26,959
They should be on section 4 by
now but we haven't even received

520
00:32:26,959 --> 00:32:28,669
the answers for section 3.

521
00:32:33,387 --> 00:32:34,475
Alright.

522
00:32:34,883 --> 00:32:37,469
Since you have already
used up all your breaks,

523
00:32:38,193 --> 00:32:40,988
you may now proceed with
the last portion of the test.

524

525
00:32:53,736 --> 00:32:55,029

There’s just one
thing I didn’t expect.

531
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,267
So there is a problem?

532
00:33:08,307 --> 00:33:10,225
No, no, I didn’t say that.

533
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:11,604
What I mean is

534
00:33:11,629 --> 00:33:13,631
there was just a slight delay.

535
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:15,966

Promise. Trust me.

537
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:20,846
Man, we won’t even
make it to the exam!

538
00:33:20,846 --> 00:33:21,972
Just a little more time, please.

leaking the answers to exams?

00:37:02,442 --> 00:37:03,652
Let’s just focus on this first

564
00:37:03,652 --> 00:37:05,779
because Lin is about to send
the answers to Bank's part.

565
00:37:06,405 --> 00:37:07,452
Okay?

566
00:37:09,867 --> 00:37:11,155
Miss?

567
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:13,136
Okay, I got it.

568
00:37:13,161 --> 00:37:13,720
Okay.

569
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:14,388
C.

570
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:14,872
C.

571
00:37:14,872 --> 00:37:15,681
D.

572
00:37:15,706 --> 00:37:16,123
D.

573
00:37:16,123 --> 00:37:16,765
A.

574
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,266
A.

575
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:17,708
B.

576
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:18,208
B.

577
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:18,767
A.

578
00:37:18,792 --> 00:37:19,268
A.

579
00:37:19,293 --> 00:37:20,060
C.

580
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:21,202
C.

581
00:37:29,761 --> 00:37:30,904
Okay, I got it.

582
00:37:30,929 --> 00:37:31,947
Okay.

583
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:32,489
D.

584
00:37:32,514 --> 00:37:32,948
D.

585
00:37:32,973 --> 00:37:33,615
A.

586
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,199
A.

587
00:37:34,224 --> 00:37:34,641
B.

588
00:37:34,641 --> 00:37:35,100
B.

589
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:35,642
A.

590
00:37:35,726 --> 00:37:36,184
A.

591
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:36,643
B.

592
00:37:36,643 --> 00:37:36,977
B.

593
00:37:36,977 --> 00:37:37,536
C.

594
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:38,624
C.

595
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:43,692
Please hurry up.

596
00:37:46,487 --> 00:37:47,577
Miss?

597
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,366
You're definitely getting into
some serious trouble here.

598
00:37:55,621 --> 00:37:56,747
Come on, let me do it.

599
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:03,729
C.

600
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:04,229
C.

601
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:04,730
D.

602
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:05,230
D.

603
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:05,631
D.

604
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:06,106
D.

605
00:38:06,131 --> 00:38:06,690
C.

606
00:38:06,715 --> 00:38:07,149
C.

607
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:07,691
B.

608
00:38:07,716 --> 00:38:08,150
B.

609
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:08,650
A.

610
00:38:08,675 --> 00:38:09,276
A.

611
00:38:09,301 --> 00:38:09,735
D.

612
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,527
D.

613
00:38:10,552 --> 00:38:10,986
B.

614
00:38:11,011 --> 00:38:11,403
B.

615
00:38:11,451 --> 00:38:12,202
D.

616
00:38:12,227 --> 00:38:13,312
C.

617
00:38:14,598 --> 00:38:16,155
We're gonna count to three.

618
00:38:16,516 --> 00:38:18,518
If this door doesn't
open by then,

619
00:38:18,518 --> 00:38:20,437
we're entering anyway.

620
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,359
A.

621
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,327
A.

622
00:38:26,568 --> 00:38:27,194
B.

623
00:38:27,194 --> 00:38:27,628
B.

624
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:28,086
C.

625
00:38:28,111 --> 00:38:28,545
C.

626
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,171
A.

627
00:38:29,196 --> 00:38:29,755
A.

628
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,547
And B.

629
00:38:30,572 --> 00:38:31,460
B.

630
00:38:32,115 --> 00:38:33,108
Lin!

631
00:38:33,367 --> 00:38:33,897
Wait.

632
00:38:33,951 --> 00:38:35,350
Just three more, please!

633
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:36,499
One.

634
00:38:38,538 --> 00:38:39,686
Please, send it!

635
00:38:44,878 --> 00:38:45,921
Okay, got it.

636
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:47,648
B.

637
00:38:47,673 --> 00:38:48,273
B.

638
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:49,210
Two.

639
00:38:50,273 --> 00:38:50,776
C.

640
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:51,401
C.

641
00:38:51,426 --> 00:38:52,428
Three.

642
00:38:55,347 --> 00:38:55,739
D.

643
00:38:55,764 --> 00:38:56,865
D.

644
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,366
That's it.

645
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:58,514
That's it? Okay.

646
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,194
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay, okay, let's go.

647
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:50,444
Are you in there, miss?

648
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:54,698
Open this door.

649
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,147
Open!

650
00:40:10,047 --> 00:40:11,965
Let's deal with that
later. Let's finish this first.

651
00:40:13,216 --> 00:40:13,859
Wait.

652
00:40:13,884 --> 00:40:15,327
This is important.

653
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:35,922
I'm sorry.

654
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:36,948
I did warn you.

655
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:38,325
You did not reply, so...

656
00:40:40,343 --> 00:40:41,261
I'm sorry, Mr. Clark.

657
00:40:41,286 --> 00:40:42,496
I'm really not feeling well.

658
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:44,936
Well,

659
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,058
tidy up

660
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:47,667
and follow me to the office.

661
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,119
Come on.

662
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:06,953
Get the pencils.

663
00:41:06,978 --> 00:41:07,746
Okay.

664
00:41:07,771 --> 00:41:08,827
- Let's go.
- Okay.

665
00:41:10,774 --> 00:41:12,692
It's past the time, I
wonder what time—

666
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:14,361
Guys, here are the answers.

667
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:15,717
- Sorry.
- Here they are.

668
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:17,013
- Apologies.
- Here you go.

669
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:20,163
Good luck, guys.

670
00:41:20,188 --> 00:41:21,259
Sorry again.

671
00:41:21,284 --> 00:41:22,077
Thank you.

672
00:41:22,077 --> 00:41:23,295
Take care!

673
00:41:23,745 --> 00:41:24,991
Sorry.

674
00:41:40,428 --> 00:41:41,054
We did it!

675
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,772
We did it, hon!

676
00:41:47,394 --> 00:41:48,195
Hon,

677
00:41:48,227 --> 00:41:50,827
sorry for slapping
you earlier, okay?

678
00:41:50,939 --> 00:41:51,957
It’s nothing, hon.

679
00:41:51,982 --> 00:41:53,186
That’s over now.

680
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:55,335
Okay.

681
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,663
I love you.

682
00:41:58,029 --> 00:41:58,505
Okay.

683
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,156
You should go now.

684
00:41:59,156 --> 00:42:00,549
You're going to be
late for your exam.

685
00:42:00,574 --> 00:42:01,772
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

686
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,900
Perhaps,

687
00:42:59,925 --> 00:43:01,927
I should call your
mother in the Philippines

688
00:43:02,698 --> 00:43:03,991
and tell her

689
00:43:04,471 --> 00:43:06,256
that her son is involved

690
00:43:06,681 --> 00:43:08,183
in a cheating scheme.

691
00:43:08,183 --> 00:43:09,601
I don't know what
you're talking about.

692
00:43:10,685 --> 00:43:11,828
I don't know him.

693
00:43:11,853 --> 00:43:13,022
That's funny

694
00:43:13,313 --> 00:43:16,775
because your papers indicate
you're both from the same school,

695
00:43:17,651 --> 00:43:20,737
Colegio de San Gabriel Possenti.

696
00:43:21,029 --> 00:43:23,365
What if I call the
principal over there?

697
00:43:23,573 --> 00:43:25,367
Greg and I already
talked, actually,

698
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:28,203
last week, right after
we spoke on the phone.

699
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:30,705
You can live with us if
you’re going to study, Lin.

700
00:43:30,872 --> 00:43:32,540
I'm going to study
business in Boston.

701
00:43:33,416 --> 00:43:35,210
My dad's a BU graduate so,

702
00:43:36,044 --> 00:43:37,545
I guess I'm following
his footsteps.

703
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:40,590
I was wondering if,

704
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,593
I could study there too?

705
00:43:43,677 --> 00:43:45,061
As you know,

706
00:43:45,637 --> 00:43:48,098
the National College
Entrance Test

707
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:50,600
is upon us.

708
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:52,727
Every Filipino student

709
00:43:53,853 --> 00:43:56,731
on their senior year is expected

710
00:43:57,232 --> 00:43:58,900
to take the NCET.

711
00:43:59,317 --> 00:44:00,919
Did Bank message you?

712
00:44:00,944 --> 00:44:02,337
Message me?

713
00:44:02,362 --> 00:44:03,188
About what?

714
00:44:03,213 --> 00:44:04,547
Check your phone.

715
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:05,850
The gang is back.
